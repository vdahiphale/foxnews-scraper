The move has set off a political firestorm across Washington and beyond, with Democrats in overdrive trying to gym up as much anger and outrage as they can, apparently forgetting their long running disdain for the ousted FBI chief. Today, President Trump gave his first on camera remarks about his decision.",

So let's bring in new guys and let's have a little discussion about that. A lot of partisan divide going on all day in the media today with the left saying this is scandalous.

You mentioned at the top, and that really is the headline of the day, that the narrative is to how all of this came to pass really has changed quite dramatically in the last 24 hours. We were led to believe yesterday, and even as recently as this morning when the vice president was up on Capitol Hill and appear before the cameras that this really was a bottom up recommendation and operation. That this had come from the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who had looked into James Comey and come to the conclusion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI director and that he needed to be replaced. But now we're learning, as you mentioned at the top here, that President Trump has been thinking about this for an awful long time. In fact, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, principal deputy press secretary, who was filling in for Sean Spicer today, said that the president has been thinking about this going all the way at least until just after the election. Listen to what she told us just a short time ago in the daily briefing.",

The deputy attorney general who is Jim Comey's boss gave a long -- it was a two and a half page long letter to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, saying that he think that he had tried to usurp then attorney general Loretta Lynch's authority when he held that press conference back on July 5th of last year. The attorney general then sent that recommendation up to the president who then wrote that now famous letter of termination. But, Eric, what we're learning today was that this had a lot to do with the president as well. And if the president was thinking about firing Jim Comey on the ninth or the tenth of November, that means he must have been thinking about it a long time before that, potentially including when he's sang Jim Comey's praises after the October 28th decision to reopen the Hillary Clinton email investigation. So not sure if this goes all the way back to July 5 for the president or not, but it certainly seems to go back a lot further than we were initially led to believe. And while the president has been thinking about this for months, we are told by Sarah Huckabee Sanders that the big catalyst, the big part of the reason why Comey is gone happen when he was giving that testimony before the judiciary committee in the senate a week ago when he all but acknowledged, according to Sarah Huckabee, that he had thrown a stick of dynamite into the works at the FBI when it decided that he was going out there without permission back in July, and give that press conference. We talked at length about Clinton's emails, what she had done wrong, what she should have done, and the fact that he didn't see any reason for the department of justice to press charges, Eric.",

They said it was like throwing a bomb into the justice department which is right across the street from where I'm standing right now. And then, what amplified that is Comey's testimony last week before the senate where he said he stood by that decision, and he did not accept that it was in fact a fatal error in this case. We've also learned that one of the other factors was his misstatement to congress about the Clinton email probe where he said thousands of emails were found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, in a separate criminal case. Weiner's connection to all of this is that he's the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aid, Huma Abedin. The FBI had to correct the record in a written statement saying that the number was far less, but all of that came together to create a lack of confidence in the director. Back to you.",

We are \"The Fox News Specialists.\" The firing of FBI director James Comey may be the most decisive act of the Trump young presidency so far. The move has set off a political firestorm across Washington and beyond, with Democrats in overdrive trying to gym up as much anger and outrage as they can, apparently forgetting their long running disdain for the ousted FBI chief. Today, President Trump gave his first on camera remarks about his decision."

So let's bring in new guys and let's have a little discussion about that. A lot of partisan divide going on all day in the media today with the left saying this is scandalous. This is Watergate-type scandal. And the right saying, wait a minute, Trump has been talking about this for a long time."

That's how astonish I was in that moment. I thought it was a joke. I thought it was a practical joke. And apparently, I wasn't the only one.

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Eric, good afternoon. You mentioned at the top, and that really is the headline of the day, that the narrative is to how all of this came to pass really has changed quite dramatically in the last 24 hours. We were led to believe yesterday, and even as recently as this morning when the vice president was up on Capitol Hill and appear before the cameras that this really was a bottom up recommendation and operation. That this had come from the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who had looked into James Comey and come to the conclusion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI director and that he needed to be replaced. But now we're learning, as you mentioned at the top here, that President Trump has been thinking about this for an awful long time. In fact, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, principal deputy press secretary, who was filling in for Sean Spicer today, said that the president has been thinking about this going all the way at least until just after the election. Listen to what she told us just a short time ago in the daily briefing."

    {
      "speaker": "SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "The president had lost -- again, like I said, he's lost confidence in Director Comey, and frankly, he's been considering letting Director Comey goes since the day he was elected. But he did have a conversation with the deputy attorney general on Monday, where they had come to him to express their concern. The president asked that they put their concerns and their recommendation in writing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "So clearly, they went through the appropriate procedure here. The deputy attorney general who is Jim Comey's boss gave a long -- it was a two and a half page long letter to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, saying that he think that he had tried to usurp then attorney general Loretta Lynch's authority when he held that press conference back on July 5th of last year. The attorney general then sent that recommendation up to the president who then wrote that now famous letter of termination. But, Eric, what we're learning today was that this had a lot to do with the president as well. And if the president was thinking about firing Jim Comey on the ninth or the tenth of November, that means he must have been thinking about it a long time before that, potentially including when he's sang Jim Comey's praises after the October 28th decision to reopen the Hillary Clinton email investigation. So not sure if this goes all the way back to July 5 for the president or not, but it certainly seems to go back a lot further than we were initially led to believe. And while the president has been thinking about this for months, we are told by Sarah Huckabee Sanders that the big catalyst, the big part of the reason why Comey is gone happen when he was giving that testimony before the judiciary committee in the senate a week ago when he all but acknowledged, according to Sarah Huckabee, that he had thrown a stick of dynamite into the works at the FBI when it decided that he was going out there without permission back in July, and give that press conference. We talked at length about Clinton's emails, what she had done wrong, what she should have done, and the fact that he didn't see any reason for the department of justice to press charges, Eric."

There's a cloud hanging over Trump's administration, White House unjustified, and I think he was telling, in effect, telling Comey, look, get this done. Get it over with. Exonerate me or indict somebody come. And I think Comey didn't do a thing and that's why he got rid of him."

Was it back in July, when Comey politicized, I think, the FBI in that, you know, ridiculous and unnecessary statement, perhaps in an effort to save Loretta Lynch, whatever. Was it in October, when he put the letter out? Reopening the Hillary Clinton investigation? Or was it when president -- then, candidate Trump said what Comey did took guts and he was praising him.

So, on October 28th, he's defending it. And now, he's listing it as a reason that Comey has got to be fired. So where was the switch and why?

The White House said that when last year, he went around the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, and he made that very public statement in July against -- recommending against criminal charges for the apparent mishandling of classified information by Clinton and her team. They said it was like throwing a bomb into the justice department which is right across the street from where I'm standing right now. And then, what amplified that is Comey's testimony last week before the senate where he said he stood by that decision, and he did not accept that it was in fact a fatal error in this case. We've also learned that one of the other factors was his misstatement to congress about the Clinton email probe where he said thousands of emails were found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, in a separate criminal case. Weiner's connection to all of this is that he's the estranged husband of longtime Clinton aid, Huma Abedin.

What Comey did, I just respectfully disagree with my opponent. What he did was appalling. And prosecutors from one end of America to another know it. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF, NOV. 2, 2016: I think he made a mistake on this. And he clearly has a double standard when it comes to Donald Trump. And these jobs, if you're not in it for a while, you can't take the heat, and I think he just couldn't take the heat from the Republicans. SEN.

I don't think anyone is particularly sad to see him go on merit alone. But I do want to point this out. I don't think it's just -- I think that's not fair or accurate to say that it's just the left that has these questions or concerns. Republican senator, Jeff Flake, from Arizona said, specifically, I've got a lot -- I took the last several hours trying to figure out an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing and I just can't do it.

For example, a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton is quoted by saying to Politico, quote, \"This has every appearance of a cover-up, a possible act of obstruction of justice, just as much as Nixon firing Archibald Cox. That's the only comparable historical precedent I can think of.\" Well, we are so fortunate here today. We have one of our specialists, Pat Buchanan, who actually worked for the Nixon White House during Watergate. And you say these comparisons are just way off base."

And they were talking about moving nuclear weapons through the Bosporus. And this occurred in the middle of it, and Nixon had to fire him, as I say. And I recommended Arch -- I mean, Elliot Richardson, because he refused an order to fire Cox when he had told us that he would do it. And that's why we went ahead. So he had no other choice. As I say, I was sitting in the Oval Office with him, and he was very calm about it and serious about it.

Look, I think that the whole thing just reeks of conspiracy. And I think there is absolutely a comparison to be made between Archibald Cox's firing and James Comey.

First of all, I'd like to say how thrilled I am that Pat Buchanan is here, because he was in the White House, the Nixon White House when this was going on. But Mark -- and Pat, weight in if you want. Archibald Cox was onto something. He knew -- he found a tie to Nixon. He found it; he knew it. He was asking them to be produced, and therefore, he was fired as he was on to something.

But I think he's getting a lot of pushback, and a lot of people do consider him quite partisan. But my \"Circle Back\" is to Mr. Buchanan.

He came to his views on economic nationalism at the same time I did, way back when. He did a tremendous job. And look, whatever you say about the guy, he stood up to some of the worst -- worse beatings than Nixon ever had. I've never seen someone take a beating like that in the campaign, day in and day out, and smile and come through it. Really, I mean, you've got to credit the guy for that."
