Governor Jerry Brown says it's, well, meant to really protect illegal immigrants living in the shadows of society and making sure authorities don't try to yank them out of there.  But acting ICE Director Thomas Homan says it's putting politics above public safety. He joins us now with his first interview since the Golden State became this sanctuary state.  Very good to have you, acting director. I mean, I couldn't believe this when I heard it, because it's one thing when a city or a community kind of unofficially espouses these views. Quite another for a governor to put the stamp and his blessing behind it on statewide level. What do you make of it?",

What they have done is force my officers to arrest dangerous criminals on their turf, in their homes, and their places of business, rather than arresting them in the safety and security of a county jail.  It's ridiculous to knowingly and intentionally put law enforcement at risk. It's just -- and the American communities, the communities themselves put at risk. When you release a public safety threat back into the public, it's just a foolish decision they made.",

There's no sanctuary from federal law enforcement. As a matter of fact, we're in the process now, I'm going to significantly increase our enforcement presence in California. We're already doing it.   We're going to detail additional enforcement assets to California. California better hold on tight. They're about to see a lot more special agents, a lot more deportation officers in the state of California. If the politicians in California don't want to protect their communities, then ICE will.",

We want to take public safety threats out of the communities. And so this comes to -- this is a political decision. This is not a law enforcement decision. No one thought about the safety of law enforcement when this decision was made. No one thought about cases like Kate Steinle and others. I can give example of example. In Sonoma County a few weeks ago, an illegal alien was arrested. We put a detainer on him. He was arrested for domestic violence.  Sonoma County didn't honor the detainer. What happened? Two weeks later, he killed that girl. Now she has two young daughters without a mother. So, I can give you example after example of the effect this law is going to have on the community safety in the state of California. The state of California better hang on tight, because the smuggling organizations are using the sanctuary cities law, the sanctuary state law as a selling point. More illegal aliens will be coming to California. More criminal aliens will be coming to California.  So, California just bit off a lot more than they can chew.",
