Jesse, Jr. could have planned a better exit strategy. In fact, Greg, he peered over his crib on Sunday and said, dad, why wouldn't President Biden leave in some air support in order to buy time for the evac? I said, it's a great question. I don't know. We're sitting on Sunday watching these images of people clinging from airplanes. The Taliban parading around with our weaponry and ISIS jail breaking, Americans surrounded. Joe Biden says, you know, we planned for this. Really? I'd like to see what winging it would look like, Joe. He said it's not my fault. Don't look at me. Really? He is the one that set the 9-11 pullout deadline with no conditions. Taliban heard that, they started advancing everywhere. He was getting intel briefings in June. He was getting them in July. He was getting them in August that showed the Taliban advancement. What did Joe do? Nothing. He actually went out on television after getting those briefings and said this wasn't going to happen. So Joe was slow, Joe lied, and then he remained on vacation. You can only hide incompetence for so long. Joe has done a good job of it. He hid when he was in the Senate. He hid as V.P. He hid during the campaign. COVID let him hide. But now it's the Joe show. It's only him in charge. And right as that happens, it all blows up. He killed the Afghan exit, killed the border, killed vaccine confidence with the J&J pause. We should have seen it coming. The guy botched the Iraq exit. The guy stranded Americans in Benghazi. This was the man that was supposed to be an experienced Washington hand. He knew how to pull the levers of power. Listen to his intelligence advisers. Make sure we have strong alliances. And in one weekend, that's just shattered. I don't trust him anymore. Who's going to trust this guy? Oh, Joe's going to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in America. Just arm the Taliban. Oh, Joe, you're going to ask for billions for the Green New Deal. Really? How did the billions work out training the Afghan army? That's how it's going to go now and I'm sorry, this is going to haunt Joe Biden for the rest of his short presidency.",

And it's such a rookie mistake and when you think about Afghanistan where I've spent a lot of time between 2001 and 2012, 11 assignments there. To think that you have Bagram Airbase, a wonderful impenetrable, formidable fortress of an airbase that can land any aircraft of any size, and instead of Bagram, which you give back to the enemy, you keep the Kabul airport, which is in a big depression. It's a bowl. It's a horrible place. Not defensible at all. It just shows how absolutely incompetent they were and the United States embassy. The United States embassy, I was in the United States embassy when there was a mortar attack on the embassy. I was with Ryan Crocker. Nobody got hurt. The buildings are this thick. Again, it is a place where you could have an orderly withdrawal. Instead, you have kids like these, these preppy, you know, self-important, just Ivy asses that just were unconnected to the reality. And just the -- I hasten to add the one thing we can never forget is the service and sacrifice of our G.I.'s in that awful place for 20 years.

So, F him. He overestimated the white rube and underestimated the terrorists. He underestimated the Taliban. We forget, as Jesse points out, that he is wrong on everything. He didn't even want to go after Bin Laden. So this is a consequence of his manufacturing of fear to somehow get back at a segment of the population under the lie of being a unifier. Again, par for the course, to your point, every choice that he has made is to undermine order. The southern border, no process. Law and order, defund and say you didn't -- ignoring crime. Afghanistan, ripped the band-aid off because that's the only way you can do it. Every decision results in absolute disorder. How can they come back to this?

Jesse, Jr. could have planned a better exit strategy. In fact, Greg, he peered over his crib on Sunday and said, dad, why wouldn't President Biden leave in some air support in order to buy time for the evac? I said, it's a great question. I don't know. We're sitting on Sunday watching these images of people clinging from airplanes. The Taliban parading around with our weaponry and ISIS jail breaking, Americans surrounded. Joe Biden says, you know, we planned for this. Really? I'd like to see what winging it would look like, Joe. He said it's not my fault. Don't look at me. Really? He is the one that set the 9-11 pullout deadline with no conditions. Taliban heard that, they started advancing everywhere. He was getting intel briefings in June. He was getting them in July. He was getting them in August that showed the Taliban advancement. What did Joe do? Nothing. He actually went out on television after getting those briefings and said this wasn't going to happen. So Joe was slow, Joe lied, and then he remained on vacation. You can only hide incompetence for so long. Joe has done a good job of it. He hid when he was in the Senate. He hid as V.P. He hid during the campaign. COVID let him hide. But now it's the Joe show. It's only him in charge. And right as that happens, it all blows up. He killed the Afghan exit, killed the border, killed vaccine confidence with the J&J pause. We should have seen it coming. The guy botched the Iraq exit. The guy stranded Americans in Benghazi. This was the man that was supposed to be an experienced Washington hand. He knew how to pull the levers of power. Listen to his intelligence advisers. Make sure we have strong alliances. And in one weekend, that's just shattered. I don't trust him anymore. Who's going to trust this guy? Oh, Joe's going to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in America. Just arm the Taliban. Oh, Joe, you're going to ask for billions for the Green New Deal. Really? How did the billions work out training the Afghan army? That's how it's going to go now and I'm sorry, this is going to haunt Joe Biden for the rest of his short presidency."

And it's such a rookie mistake and when you think about Afghanistan where I've spent a lot of time between 2001 and 2012, 11 assignments there. To think that you have Bagram Airbase, a wonderful impenetrable, formidable fortress of an airbase that can land any aircraft of any size, and instead of Bagram, which you give back to the enemy, you keep the Kabul airport, which is in a big depression. It's a bowl. It's a horrible place. Not defensible at all. It just shows how absolutely incompetent they were and the United States embassy. The United States embassy, I was in the United States embassy when there was a mortar attack on the embassy. I was with Ryan Crocker. Nobody got hurt. The buildings are this thick. Again, it is a place where you could have an orderly withdrawal. Instead, you have kids like these, these preppy, you know, self-important, just Ivy asses that just were unconnected to the reality. And just the -- I hasten to add the one thing we can never forget is the service and sacrifice of our G.I.'s in that awful place for 20 years.

Wherever you go in life, wherever you work, you're going to have mediocrities, incompetence. This is proof. And this is the only thing you can defend Joe Biden on, and I'm not going to do it. But that it if -- 20 years, they had 20 years to plan this. So, it's just not entirely on him, right? I mean, a few extra months of planning wouldn't do a lick of difference if you had 20 years.

I'm talking about the 20 years of incompetence and corruption, that there is a whole bunch of people involved in there, but he is holding the bag here. And the reason why, and this is the biggest reason why. Who was the leader who said the number one threat to America was not the Taliban, not ISIS, not AL Qaeda, but white supremacy, Trump voters. So, F him. He overestimated the white rube and underestimated the terrorists. He underestimated the Taliban. We forget, as Jesse points out, that he is wrong on everything. He didn't even want to go after Bin Laden. So this is a consequence of his manufacturing of fear to somehow get back at a segment of the population under the lie of being a unifier. Again, par for the course, to your point, every choice that he has made is to undermine order. The southern border, no process. Law and order, defund and say you didn't -- ignoring crime. Afghanistan, ripped the band-aid off because that's the only way you can do it. Every decision results in absolute disorder. How can they come back to this? The y should be -- there should be resignations. And by the way, this is why they're keeping Kamala out of this because they know he's done. He's toast."

He moved up the terror threat. It is now more dangerous than a white Republican, but still not as lethal as a Trump voter. You got to remember, the war on terror was supposed to shift to white supremacy. So this has got to chafe on Lemon's butt, because they're not -- CNN's not going to be able to pull this anymore because now you got to deal with the Taliban.
