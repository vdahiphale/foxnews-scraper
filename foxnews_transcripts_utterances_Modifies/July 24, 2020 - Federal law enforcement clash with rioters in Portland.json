Breaking tonight, the fight over getting back to school as schools come to the crucial decision about what will happen in just a few weeks.  The president's press secretary said today children should go back to school this fall even if future studies find they are transmitting the coronavirus with of course proper mitigation efforts by the schools.  The U.S. is now approaching 150,000 deaths and yesterday eclipse the four million cases mark. The World Health Organization reports global deaths rose by almost 9,800 in 24 hours, the largest single day increase since late April. And the number of cases rose by a record of almost 300,000 in one day.  A new poll meantime finds nearly half of Americans who family -- whose families have experienced a layoff during this pandemic now believe those jobs are lost for good. All of this occurs as the president signs an executive order to get drug prices down. Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight live on the North Lawn of the White House. Good evening, Kevin.",

The Washington Post has settled the defamation lawsuit launched by a Kentucky high school student over its coverage of a confrontation with the Native Americans in the nation's capital last year. Nicholas Sandmann has already reached a settlement with CNN and is still pursuing action against several other outlets.

What we see from the president this week is better, it's good that he has changed his position on masks, it's good that he's pushing people to take this more seriously than he has. But I think looking at the polls today, it certainly seems that people have come to the conclusion that the way that he handled it to this point was not positive. He didn't do a good job on it. And if you look at the specifics that we now know help curb the virus, help control the virus, as Dr. Fauci said, things like wearing masks, et cetera, the president was on the wrong side of those things. He was mocking reporters in the briefing room for wearing masks, saying it was politically incorrect of them to wear masks. He said we were going to be open by Easter, which was, I think, certainly premature and not what was consistent with his own White House guidelines. So I think it's a good thing that he's not going to be trying to hold the convention in Jacksonville or Charlotte. I think it's a good thing that he's wearing masks.

The difference is Democrats can't get wait to get out to vote against Donald Trump, regardless of whether it's for Joe Biden or not, and that's why I still think this is going to be a 50/50 election. Biden does have a lot of weaknesses, and I still think there's a real opportunity for the president to do better than most Republicans ever do with African- Americans. I still think he's on track for about 15 percent of the African- American vote.

Pientka's typewritten notes showed Trump asked, Joe, are the Russians bad because they have more numbers? Are they worse than the Chinese? Pientka responds, both countries are bad. During a discussion on Russia and China cheating on a Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, Trump asked, who's worse? Someone then responds, they are both bad but Russia is worse. Trump and Christie turned towards each other and Christie comments with apparent sarcasm, I'm shocked. Later, Agent Pientka turns the case file over to the FBI's head of counter espionage Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Kevin Kleinsmith who has admitted falsifying a FISA application to spy on the Trump campaign. It remains unclear whether Agent Pientka was told before briefing Trump whether to seek damaging information on him.

And if you look at the U.S. daily cases and deaths, deaths is the blue line there, cases being the yellow line. And you can see where we are here at the end of July. Hospitalizations track in Florida, that number as well, which is why the RNC is not going to be in Jacksonville. We'll see what it looks like coming forward. Let's bring in our panel, former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Ari, how do you think this is going to work from now until November 3rd, what this election is going to look like?"

That is probably the reality of no rallies, no public events, the debates are going to take on an even bigger importance because there will be so few other events to measure especially Joe Biden by. But corona remains, Bret, the biggest issue. And I'm convinced until the president successfully deals with corona, it will be very hard for him to make the economy, or to make law and order, as he puts it, the main issues in this campaign. And that's why I thought it is a welcome change this week how realistic the president was about corona, how frank he was, his actions in canceling the convention. These are the steps he needs to take to help reset this race and just face corona head on."

Most viruses we live with or we develop vaccines for things in our lives. You've heard of polio and other things that we couldn't survive at one time and do survive now. Here's the problem, though, Bret. We've lost a lot of time with messaging. We've lost a lot of time with making this political and it's not. It's very societal and medical. We as a nation have a responsibility to wear our masks, practice our social distancing. I agree with Ari, I think the president has finally come around. But it's five months too late. If we had been told as a nation social distance, put your mask on, or lock the place down for three weeks, this would be perhaps a different conversation. But definitely with the election in November, COVID-19 is on the ballot, and the president's handling of it will be the referendum on whether or not he has four more years or he goes into retirement as the president of the United States."

Obviously, the economy and coronavirus is tied together."

What we see from the president this week is better, it's good that he has changed his position on masks, it's good that he's pushing people to take this more seriously than he has. But I think looking at the polls today, it certainly seems that people have come to the conclusion that the way that he handled it to this point was not positive. He didn't do a good job on it. And if you look at the specifics that we now know help curb the virus, help control the virus, as Dr. Fauci said, things like wearing masks, et cetera, the president was on the wrong side of those things. He was mocking reporters in the briefing room for wearing masks, saying it was politically incorrect of them to wear masks. He said we were going to be open by Easter, which was, I think, certainly premature and not what was consistent with his own White House guidelines. So I think it's a good thing that he's not going to be trying to hold the convention in Jacksonville or Charlotte. I think it's a good thing that he's wearing masks. I think it's catastrophic that we didn't do a lot of the things earlier."

Joe Biden has an enthusiasm problem of his own, and in a traditional year, that would really be one of the things that takes Joe Biden down. The difference is Democrats can't get wait to get out to vote against Donald Trump, regardless of whether it's for Joe Biden or not, and that's why I still think this is going to be a 50/50 election. Biden does have a lot of weaknesses, and I still think there's a real opportunity for the president to do better than most Republicans ever do with African- Americans. I still think he's on track for about 15 percent of the African- American vote. And if the African-American vote doesn't come out in huge numbers the way they traditionally do for Democrats, they did for Barack Obama, it can also really hurt to Joe Biden in a lot of the industrial battleground states."
