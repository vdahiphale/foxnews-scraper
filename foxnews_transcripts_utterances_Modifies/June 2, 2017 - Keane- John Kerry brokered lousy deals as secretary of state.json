The president's Paris announcement was arguably the loudest expression of economic nationalism on display since inauguration day, as it's the man from the trail jumped from rally to rose garden. But the media has chosen another focus, despite little proof that the Paris deal could save us from climate catastrophe, reporters today lobbed just wonder major question again and again. Watch.",

I mean, it's very clear that the United States is a leader in innovative clean energy technology, as well as oil, and gas production. But we do not have to sign on onto the Paris climate agreements or stay on the Paris climate agreement just because--at the end, we have to look at what's best for the United States of America.

I mean, first of all, we're the leader in emissions control in the world, and we're not going to give that position up. What brought us here is our innovation and technology, and that is going to continue. Actually, President Trump is providing more motivation and inspiration for additional innovation and technology than any President I've seen in my adult life, to be frank about it. So, I think we're going to continue to be the world's leader in it. And you know, all this hysteria over this thing is really quite extraordinary. I mean, if they believe zealotry in the environment, and that we're on the edge of such a major crisis, then why didn't they put together a deal that made some sense? They walk away from the number one and number two world polluters--China and India. China's emissions control will actually grow 32 percent in terms of their emissions being out of control by 2040. They're going to continue to put in place coal burning plants all the way up for the next 13 years, and India is doing the same thing."

He's not on top of the issue and making certain that this deal is in the best interest of the United States. That's who he is operating as Secretary of State. He's working for the American people when he's a secretary of state. But the idea of the deal as an objective is what is driving him, and that's why he has brokered two lousy deals that are completely adverse to the American people. One, the Iranian nuclear deal, which is going to put our National Security in threat in years to come; and two, this one here. And I give the president and a lot of courage for standing up. He knew full well that the International Community would be opposed to him; it's only new there would be people in the United States opposed to him.

The president needs to get contrarian views--on National Security, something I pay a lot of attention to, there is constant disagreement over how to deal with the Iranians, how to deal with Afghanistan, what are we going to do in Syria? That's good government; that is healthy. And the president's the decision-maker, he's the commander-in-chief, he's the president of the United States, he gets the information, and then he decides.

And as you know, Sandra, I give the media absolutely no quarter, no protection whatsoever for their behavior in all of this. But you know, you're a Republican, you're Donald Trump, the media is not ever going to give you a fair shake on anything, and so those are the terms of the deal. And you know, he did a good job of maneuvering through the campaign and operating in a speaking directly to people. They've got to figure out how to do that out of the White House, and as you said, put to rest some of this Russia stuff because they do have some achievements that they can point to."

Well, that's different than no new facts, that's not what you just said. I think that we will see what facts come from these investigations and those need to play out. But going back to Charlie's point, when President Trump himself keeps making Russia the story by tweeting about it that--you know, I'm not defending the media here either, but that does force the media to continue coverage. He keeps putting it in the news too."

But you know, he has been fairly effective at getting his argument across in a very hostile atmosphere where he does not get much of an opportunity to get anything across through the media. And so, while, Marie is exactly right. You know, sometimes he does go overboard, I think, with some of the tweets in particular about Jim Comey because that is such a serious legal situation, he ought to lay off of it. But he has some, at times, been his own worst enemy. But more often than not, he is basically his best communicator in so many ways.

Meaning, a political group that is run outside of the White House, instead of at the Eisenhower Executive Office building right next door which was the original plan. That gives the administration literal and figurative breathing space to focus instead on the big issues like taxes, and health care, and President Trump's agenda, and be walled off from responding to reporters and investigators tied to Russia. That duty could instead fall to Trumps Advisors like David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. Sources tell me, they are now less likely to take jobs inside the White House in part because the president believes they'll be better deployed with what the Wall Street Journal is saying will be \"an army of lawyers, researchers, and communications experts\" pushing back on the attacks against the president from the outside. Though some people inside the White House like Kellyanne Conway will still play plenty of offense pointing out they believe the biggest uncovered a story about Russia is the alleged unmasking by Obama officials."

And I think by Trump picking some of his most tough-edged advisors and having them outside the White House handling this. In terms of just where you put your resources in personnel, moving--having those personalities in those roles so that inside the White House they can focus on the governing.

They act upon what they believe is a credible threat or something that might invoke a credible threat, and that the president doesn't get to say, hey, go investigate this person, it doesn't work like that. So if they did contact her, it was because they thought that her actions were so outrageous that it could invoke somebody to want to create some level of harm to the president or his family. This is just absurd for her to go out and pretend that somehow she has been stepped on. Even liberals ran away from her over this."

I've never seen women told they couldn't go to Sunday school or get an education. I've never seen a suicide bomber sitting on the front row. This is such an absurdity. But here's a problem with the show like \"The View.\" It has become an increasingly sad panel of people who come to a set unprepared to speak intelligently, and so they come and spout off the first thing that comes out of their mind. This used to be a pretty decent show worth watching when Barbara Walters was sort of the queen bee, but it is just disintegrated into something that is disgusting and, frankly, an embarrassment. But to compare Christians with the Taliban, I mean, that's beyond any kind of absurdity and they should be ashamed of themselves."

In her journals, you could read about her begging God to release her from this addiction, to where there would be tears in the ink. She wanted this so bad. She wanted to live."

All of those deaths represent a mom, a dad, a siblings, children, and it's a fight that we're running behind. If they can get them to admit it, and if they can get them to maybe support some recovery for these folks. I mean, I don't have all the answers. I'm a substance abuse counselor and I'm telling you that we are running behind. We can't catch up to this."

      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "It really is, and it's not just the media. It's almost everyone on politics. If you look at the reaction in Europe, it's as if Donald Trump has literally just declared war on Western Europe. It is so over- the-top. And remember, it's not even a disagreement over climate change. It's a disagreement about how you tackle climate change. It's a policy disagreement, and yet it's blown up into this complete attack that basically accuses the president of all these crimes when really it's just a technical question of how best you balance the need to protect the planet and to protect jobs. And if we can't have disagreements with each other over policies without accusing the other side of being bad people, then I just don't know where we come too, but that seems to be the way it's going with this president."

      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. Because what you've seen, Sandra, over the past season, we've talked about this many times on \"Outnumbered\" and elsewhere is that more and more power has been centralized by the elite. And they love that process, they've been in charge, they've been making these policies that benefit them while working people have suffered. And the populist movement arose in response to that. People are fed off with the situation that whoever they vote for it seems to be the same people that are in charge. And what we are doing on The Next Revolution is looking that populist movement, understanding what caused it, and then most importantly setting out a positive agenda for dealing with the economic insecurity for the things that have gone wrong in people's lives, a positive agenda for change, and that's why we're calling it positive populism, that's what it's going to be all about."
