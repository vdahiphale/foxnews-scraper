A bombshell court filing, it dropped late last night suggest just that. And Mollie Hemingway and Victor Davis Hanson are here with analysis and reaction.  Plus, this is a fascinating story. George Soros has been quietly working behind the scenes for decades, but now he has a new goal. He's financing the campaigns of Far-Left prosecutors. This is a story that could affect the safety and security of your community. You do not want to miss it.  And a haunted house that requires a medical waiver and a safe word, Hollywood's reboot obsession, ohm my God, it never ends.  And what happened to Joe Biden's Hispanic website. Raymond Arroyo has all the details in a spooky Friday Follies. But first, the announcement that U.S. Attorney John Durham's investigation is now a criminal probe has made a lot of folks nervous in this town. And they're all the same intel and media collaborators who spread the phony collusion narrative from the start.  Minutes after seeing the news, former Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper appeared on television and was it just me or did he seem to struggle to get out the right words.",

His text doesn't match the official transcript. The statue itself was changed shortly before he finally worked with the Democratic law. It didn't make sense. He doesn't want to come forward. And you ask yourself, why did they predicate this whole latest push for impeachment on such a thin read? And I think the answer is, they have to change the news cycle, because the news cycle, to use an old English expression, the worm has turned. And that's going to be McCabe and Ohr and Brennan and Clapper and Comey for the next six months. It's not going to be good.

His legal team is alleging that the agents tampered with the evidence to charge Flynn himself of lying. So, the 302 is the interview memo that's written after a subject is interviewed. And the question is, who edited this memo? How significantly was it edited? And Clapper effectively, I think told The Washington Post reporter, according to Sidney Powell, to, \"take the kill shot on Flynn\" after he obtained these leaked transcripts of Flynn's phone calls. Mollie, Clapper's people deny this, but it was very curious, was it not that David Ignatius received this information about these calls with Kislyak and then suddenly the article appears and then these agents proceed to interview Michael Flynn.",

And this is where the Federal Drug Administration has to take action. And Alex, you've been all over this, I think, of all the people out there who've discussed with specificity the threat of these substances and derivatives. And you've written a lot about the marijuana industry, the big money push for pot legalization. The truth is with being withheld from the people and often cases and listen to this, the CDC saying now 1604 confirmed and probable lung injuries, including 34 deaths after the vaping outbreak break this year. Both the FDA and the CDC have not yet identified a brand, substance or device, but most cases, the illnesses have been tied to THC vaping products. Alex, this is a huge, huge issue. ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR OF \"TELL YOUR CHILDREN\": It's a huge problem. There is a couple really interesting facets to this. One is that the industry, the cannabis industry tries to hide under CBD. So, they encourage people who may not be paying close attention to this, oh, CBD is good for X, Y and Z. That means cannabis is good for X, Y and Z. Well, beyond the fact that there is no evidence that CBD is good for X, Y or Z, CBD isn't really cannabis. Cannabis that, you know, the grandma is using CBD supposedly. You know, she thinks they'll help her arthritis, but her grandson's upstairs getting high on THC. And the industry is hoping people who don't use either product or who only use CBD won't know enough to know the difference.  That's one issue. As for vaping, I think it's fascinating. The industry has really gone out of its way to try to demonize illegal - \"illegal vapes\" and said, well, it doesn't look like the vapes that are sold through regulated stores in places like California are causing the problem. That's not true. People have gotten sick and died after using THC vapes that they've bought in regulated stores. And as you just said, neither the CDC nor the FDA has any idea whether it's an adulterate in the vape or whether it might even just be high potency near pure THC itself that is lung damaging. And that's why both the FDA and the CDC have said to people, don't vape THC. And that's the message, the message that should be being communicated by the public health authorities, by the states, by the media. But because everyone loves marijuana right now so much, it's getting a little bit lost.",

Now, Soros backs the Justice and Public Safety PAC which works hand-in-hand with the Justice Collaborative, a liberal group that advocates not prosecuting serious crimes. And this group also likens incarceration to slavery. According to a May, 2018 investigation by \"The L.A. Times,\" Soros pumped in at least $2.7 million into four California D.A. races back in 2018. The paper also reported that Soros spent more than $16 million in 17 county races across the country since 2014. And Soros local elections spending spree, it didn't stop there. This year he is targeting two Virginia counties not far from where we are broadcasting from tonight. Joining me now are two candidates he is trying to take out. Jonathan Fahey, candidate for the Office of Commonwealth's Attorney for Fairfax County, and Nicole Wittmann, Chief Deputy Commonwealth Attorney for Loudoun County.

His text doesn't match the official transcript. The statue itself was changed shortly before he finally worked with the Democratic law. It didn't make sense. He doesn't want to come forward. And you ask yourself, why did they predicate this whole latest push for impeachment on such a thin read? And I think the answer is, they have to change the news cycle, because the news cycle, to use an old English expression, the worm has turned. And that's going to be McCabe and Ohr and Brennan and Clapper and Comey for the next six months. It's not going to be good.

His legal team is alleging that the agents tampered with the evidence to charge Flynn himself of lying. So, the 302 is the interview memo that's written after a subject is interviewed. And the question is, who edited this memo? How significantly was it edited? And Clapper effectively, I think told The Washington Post reporter, according to Sidney Powell, to, \"take the kill shot on Flynn\" after he obtained these leaked transcripts of Flynn's phone calls. Mollie, Clapper's people deny this, but it was very curious, was it not that David Ignatius received this information about these calls with Kislyak and then suddenly the article appears and then these agents proceed to interview Michael Flynn."

Despite this being a very serious crime, now whether Clapper was the person who directly did that or whether other people were involved is unknown at this point. But what's really unfortunate is years went by without any actual investigation instead chasing, you know, going down rabbit holes of this Russia collusion theory that ended again with not a single American being found to have to have done this. We do know from Clapper's testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that he did like to talk to reporters, and he was talking to reporters around that time.

And it's even more bizarre because remember, these are the same two who post-facto decided that James Comey's presidential memos were not secret, but they were merely confidential and therefore not Polonia. So, Peter Strzok especially was everywhere. He was with Cheryl Mills, giving her exemptions. He was overseas. He was interviewing Michael Flynn."

      "utterance": "Well, these are false claims. There is no peer-reviewed study that shows any medical benefit from these products. And this is where the Federal Drug Administration has to take action. And Alex, you've been all over this, I think, of all the people out there who've discussed with specificity the threat of these substances and derivatives. And you've written a lot about the marijuana industry, the big money push for pot legalization. The truth is with being withheld from the people and often cases and listen to this, the CDC saying now 1604 confirmed and probable lung injuries, including 34 deaths after the vaping outbreak break this year. Both the FDA and the CDC have not yet identified a brand, substance or device, but most cases, the illnesses have been tied to THC vaping products. Alex, this is a huge, huge issue. ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR OF \"TELL YOUR CHILDREN\": It's a huge problem. There is a couple really interesting facets to this. One is that the industry, the cannabis industry tries to hide under CBD. So, they encourage people who may not be paying close attention to this, oh, CBD is good for X, Y and Z. That means cannabis is good for X, Y and Z. Well, beyond the fact that there is no evidence that CBD is good for X, Y or Z, CBD isn't really cannabis. Cannabis that, you know, the grandma is using CBD supposedly. You know, she thinks they'll help her arthritis, but her grandson's upstairs getting high on THC. And the industry is hoping people who don't use either product or who only use CBD won't know enough to know the difference. That's one issue. As for vaping, I think it's fascinating. The industry has really gone out of its way to try to demonize illegal - \"illegal vapes\" and said, well, it doesn't look like the vapes that are sold through regulated stores in places like California are causing the problem. That's not true. People have gotten sick and died after using THC vapes that they've bought in regulated stores. And as you just said, neither the CDC nor the FDA has any idea whether it's an adulterate in the vape or whether it might even just be high potency near pure THC itself that is lung damaging. And that's why both the FDA and the CDC have said to people, don't vape THC. And that's the message, the message that should be being communicated by the public health authorities, by the states, by the media. But because everyone loves marijuana right now so much, it's getting a little bit lost."

Whoopi Goldberg is going to London to star in a musical remounting of, you guessed it, \"Sister Act,\" playing the role she played in the movie 27 years ago. WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": The original Dolores is back, a little older, a little seasoned, but really still kind of out there."

      "utterance": "Yes, you couldn't get it right. You said \"Sister Act\" rather than \"Sister Act,\" and I told you it was one word. Anyway, what everyone needs to know is this is a revival, Laura. It's the same Alan Menken show that ran on Broadway in 2011, but they have raised the age of the lead character and probably lowered the songs for Whoopi. And now a Disney movie, \"Hocus Pocus,\" is also being revived. Tragically, the Sanderson sisters, Laura, are coming back to Disney Plus."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "George Soros has been quietly working behind the scenes for decades, but now he has a new goal, and it's a very dangerous one. The liberal billionaire has been spending the last few years financing the campaign of far-left prosecutors with the goal of transforming how laws are enforced, or rather not enforced. Now, Soros backs the Justice and Public Safety PAC which works hand-in-hand with the Justice Collaborative, a liberal group that advocates not prosecuting serious crimes. And this group also likens incarceration to slavery. According to a May, 2018 investigation by \"The L.A. Times,\" Soros pumped in at least $2.7 million into four California D.A. races back in 2018. The paper also reported that Soros spent more than $16 million in 17 county races across the country since 2014. And Soros local elections spending spree, it didn't stop there. This year he is targeting two Virginia counties not far from where we are broadcasting from tonight. Joining me now are two candidates he is trying to take out. Jonathan Fahey, candidate for the Office of Commonwealth's Attorney for Fairfax County, and Nicole Wittmann, Chief Deputy Commonwealth Attorney for Loudoun County. All right, Jonathan, what kind of candidates does Soros back in Virginia? We already lost a great Commonwealth attorney in Theo Stamos who is finishing up her year, but she was unseated for someone who has no experience. But what's going on here? What kind of candidates is he supporting?"

      "speaker": "JONATHAN FAHEY, I-CANDIDATE, FAIRFAX COUNTY COMMONWEALTH'S ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "In my race in Fairfax County, I'm running because the incumbent, Ray Morrogh, the Democrat, was defeated in the primary thanks to $500,000 by George Soros. But the types of candidates he is financing are candidates, my opponent has never tried a case in Virginia courts. He is tax lawyer, and he is running on, they call it criminal justice reform, but it is essentially, the underlying theme is to delegitimize our entire system. And he is running on ideas of not prosecuting certain crimes, that all of our -- our whole system is not legitimate, including the police."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So I want to put up the dossier. It's a resume of no talent. Sorry, resume of little experience. So this is your opponent Steve Descano, so he graduated law school in 2010. He never tried a case, as you said, in Virginia. He had a brief stint as a federal prosecutor, but in the criminal tax division, and on his website it says he'll develop metrics that flag areas of systemic discrimination and implement solutions to fix those inequalities. We know when they say criminal justice reform, that what they really mean, Nicole, is not prosecute entire categories of crime just as we've been enjoying a declining violent crime rate. So what does this mean for localities? A commonwealth attorney, people don't know what that means. That's the most important prosecutor in an entire large swath. Your county, Loudoun County, is one of the most important counties in the country, as is Fairfax County."

      "speaker": "NICOLE WITTMANN, R-CANDIDATE, LOUDOUN COUNTY COMMONWEALTH'S ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Right. What it means is you have prosecutors who are now not interested in community safety, they're not interested in victims' rights. They're not interested in protecting our communities. What they are interested in is weaponizing these local prosecutors' office to try to push their social agenda."

      "speaker": "WITTMANN",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. They are not going to -- they're going to do selective prosecution. They're not going to prosecute certain theft offenses. They're not going to prosecute violent crimes in schools. They're not going to prosecute drug offenses. And so what that causes is a dangerous atmosphere in the community and lack of community safety."

      "utterance": "Now tell us what the Krasner Effect is. People don't maybe know outside of Philly who Larry Krasner is, a candidate for Philadelphia D.A. supported by Soros. What's happened since he took office in, I guess, early 2018."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAHEY",
      "utterance": "That's a great question, and it's really helpful for the voters in Fairfax County and Loudoun County to know, because a George Soros candidate, Larry Krasner, was elected in Philadelphia as a district attorney. And since then, in 2018, the murder rate went up 10 percent, and that might not seem like a lot unless you are one of the 35 people that lost a mother, a father, a son, a brother. And it's amazing this has happened when crime has been going down other places. And Philadelphia is a total disaster."

      "utterance": "The cops and the prosecutors are at war with each other. And that's what my opponent wants to bring to Fairfax County, which is remarkable. We have the safest large county in America, and he wants to bring Philadelphia to Fairfax county. And it's like, we have a great attorney, we have a great police department. We should keep that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "People around the country, I want to really emphasize this. We talk a lot on this show about national politics. And it's important. There's an impeachment war going on, we have budget fights, we have about military deployments in faraway countries. This is all important and we cover it. But you must occasionally drill down to what's happening on the local and state level, because this is where all the mischief is made, not only with your tax dollars, but it affects the safety, and I think the overall sense of community where you live. And I'm telling you, Nicole, I look at Kim Foxx in Chicago, another Soros supported city attorney. Do we have to remember that she was given in 2016 $300,000 created to elect her? That's, Soros is responsible for Kim Foxx in Chicago."

He is buying puppets who he is putting into office to push his agenda, and that's exactly what he's trying to do. There's an election now in Fairfax, in Arlington, and in Loudoun County where it used to be $20,000, $30,000 used to be what a candidate would have to spend. Now you are looking at millions of dollars."

The people of Loudoun, people of Fairfax, I think they are going to make the right decisions, but you all have got to hit hard. There is no patty-cake with Soros. You have to call it what it is. It's an open door for criminals in these counties if you elect these Soros people. Fahey and Wittmann, remember those names. I expect great things from both of you. Jonathan and Nicole, thanks so much."
