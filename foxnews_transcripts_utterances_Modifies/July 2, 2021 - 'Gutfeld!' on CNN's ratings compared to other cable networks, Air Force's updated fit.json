What's a destination for news when T.V. was in black and white, is now a motley assortment of glum freaks touting what's left of their shredded reputation? They act like the former Soviet Union clinging to past glory and full economies. It's a clown car minus the car. So between the first and second quarter of this year, the network has lost more than half of its audience. Yes, in mere months, they went from six people trapped in an airport watching Don Lemon cry to three. And those three viewers were baggage handlers on break. Yes, they're racing to the bottom faster than Brian Stelter eating a can of concentrated tomato paste. It's not elegant, but it's tasty. Their primetime hours are in freefall, averaging under a million viewers. Meanwhile, in the daytime, it's roughly 650,000 viewers.  How I get that many viewers? When I do nude Pilates on my balcony. Reliable sources hosted by Captain Pop N' Fresh lost 53 percent of its viewers since January. You know, remember is tough question to Jen Paski was asking her how he could do his job better. Well, that's easy. Stop writing books about Fox News and report the news, you shaved, hamster. No wonder people take him as seriously as a Velcro wallet.  Since last year, CNN lost 49 percent of total viewers. They're changing their slogan from the worldwide leader in news to the most watched news network at Planet Fitness. MSNBC lost viewers too, but not nearly as much. So you can't attribute it to just generic disinterest. They got hit losing 37 percent in primetime. And Fox lost a little too, which is understandable given a country reopening, coming out of an election, summer arriving, slow news, Brian Kilmeade. But there's something else going on with CNN. They don't have a single show in the top 20. Who could have predicted this?",

      "sentences": "It's funny because it's true. And it's funny because it's Trump. All CNN had going for it were broken remote controls at Grandma's and a deep hatred for Trump and everything associated with them. From his once 89 million followers on Twitter to the guy who makes his taco salads. And once their target of hatred left the White House, their only narrative was orphaned.  Of course, they continued loading Trump supporters, but it just wasn't the same. To CNN, the White House without Trump was like One Direction without Zayn. Going to let that reference sit for a while? See, Trump was such a big interesting target that CNN could feed off him like a giant leech. He was an endless buffet spread of yummy stories. Remove that. And you see CNN for what it is.  First unappealing and angry hosts. CNN was Karen, before it Karen even existed. In fact, it's unfair to Karen's to keep using that name negatively. When it's really not Karen, it's dawn, Chris and Anderson who were there first. CNN is the one-stop shaming network. Their disapproving anchors, always wagging an overpaid finger. They pass judgment like a cattle farm passes gas. CNN went from respective news to a rumor mongering hate machine. You could say their fomenting of racial strife helped destroy cities. You could say they have more blood on their hands than Hannibal Lecter after lunch. You could say that, but I won't. Because I'm not that type of guy. But also CNN's obsession with Trump led to a butt loads of errors. From collusion to Kavanaugh, Lafayette Square, the Wuhan lab, Hands Up, Don't Shoot, Avenatti, Russia, Russia, Russia.   They walked back more tails than a tuxedo delivery service. Yes. That was bad, huh? But their strategy was always to pivot from one Trump tail to another. Now that he's gone, so goes that strategy. Meanwhile, the same time we saw CNN collapse, something else was going on. \"GUTFELD!\" was the number one cable news show in total viewers for the hour.",

This little spunky show at 11:00 p.m. is beating all their shows in primetime. That's not like David beating Goliath. It's David beating Goliath and then marrying his sister, so you have to see him every Thanksgiving. This show also toppled some long-running alleged comedy shows on the broadcast networks, including both Jimmy's.  Not a bad start for what the legacy media had branded a certain failure. They wanted us to fail so bad, because they're miserable people. The failed comedians, the unhappy blog writers, the blue-check gawkers on Twitter, they needed this show not to work because they weren't working either. But now the numbers are in and we crushed it. And weirdly, they've gotten quiet, but it's not over yet. I'm not ready to have the last laugh. I just enjoy the fact that we're all laughing. We're having a good time. We don't talk down to the viewers. Well, let's be honest, I can't talk down to anyone. But we aren't interested in dividing people. We don't tell family members to inform on liberals or try to deplatform CNN. We want you to go to bed feeling hope and not hopeless. And we don't think the other side is evil. We just think they're wrong and human. But they think we're evil. And that's the lesson. A network built on hate is failing. But a show built on love is thriving. I mean, look at the love that we show each other.",

You know what, I mean, or they're working at the Fukuyama nuclear plant? Did I --",

Great news for pochi pilots, the U.S. Air Force has announced changes to their physical fitness test to give service members more and possibly easier options. The new test will allow Airmen, excuse me air persons, to choose between their traditional 1.5-mile run sprints or walking for the aerobic portion. They can also choose between planks or sit-ups, push-ups, or raised hand push-ups. FYI last year, the testers removed the unpopular waist circumference measurement, replacing it with a pie eating contest. Said the Air Force Chief of Staff AKA, the guy in charge of making lower standards and positive: \"Testing options will put flexibility in the hands of our Airmen where it belongs. We know not all Airmen maintain their fitness the same way and may excel in different areas.\" Nice. Anyway, perhaps this adjustment reflects the fitness crisis among civilians. Americans are heavier, less active and more injury prone than ever, especially when those injuries are caused by reaching for the drive thru window. And frankly, we need our servicemen and women to be in better shape than us. It's what my gym teacher once told me many years ago, Greg, the showers are only for the people actually in the class, and I wasn't even bathing. So Loftus? Is this a sign I hear the wo-suffocation of our nation, or is this just an inevitability that we're changing as human beings and we're evolving?",

      "utterance": "All right. Shut up, Loftus. So we're all happy to be here with you. You know who's not happy? CNN. What's a destination for news when T.V. was in black and white, is now a motley assortment of glum freaks touting what's left of their shredded reputation? They act like the former Soviet Union clinging to past glory and full economies. It's a clown car minus the car. So between the first and second quarter of this year, the network has lost more than half of its audience. Yes, in mere months, they went from six people trapped in an airport watching Don Lemon cry to three. And those three viewers were baggage handlers on break. Yes, they're racing to the bottom faster than Brian Stelter eating a can of concentrated tomato paste. It's not elegant, but it's tasty. Their primetime hours are in freefall, averaging under a million viewers. Meanwhile, in the daytime, it's roughly 650,000 viewers. How I get that many viewers? When I do nude Pilates on my balcony. Reliable sources hosted by Captain Pop N' Fresh lost 53 percent of its viewers since January. You know, remember is tough question to Jen Paski was asking her how he could do his job better. Well, that's easy. Stop writing books about Fox News and report the news, you shaved, hamster. No wonder people take him as seriously as a Velcro wallet. Since last year, CNN lost 49 percent of total viewers. They're changing their slogan from the worldwide leader in news to the most watched news network at Planet Fitness. MSNBC lost viewers too, but not nearly as much. So you can't attribute it to just generic disinterest. They got hit losing 37 percent in primetime. And Fox lost a little too, which is understandable given a country reopening, coming out of an election, summer arriving, slow news, Brian Kilmeade. But there's something else going on with CNN. They don't have a single show in the top 20. Who could have predicted this?"

      "utterance": "Do you miss me? They missed me. They miss me. I know. They look at that bad ratings and they're saying we missed this guy. I said it was going to happen. I was waiting for them to endorse me actually. I know that was a big step, but they're going down the tubes and numbers are very bad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "It's funny because it's true. And it's funny because it's Trump. All CNN had going for it were broken remote controls at Grandma's and a deep hatred for Trump and everything associated with them. From his once 89 million followers on Twitter to the guy who makes his taco salads. And once their target of hatred left the White House, their only narrative was orphaned. Of course, they continued loading Trump supporters, but it just wasn't the same. To CNN, the White House without Trump was like One Direction without Zayn. Going to let that reference sit for a while? See, Trump was such a big interesting target that CNN could feed off him like a giant leech. He was an endless buffet spread of yummy stories. Remove that. And you see CNN for what it is. First unappealing and angry hosts. CNN was Karen, before it Karen even existed. In fact, it's unfair to Karen's to keep using that name negatively. When it's really not Karen, it's dawn, Chris and Anderson who were there first. CNN is the one-stop shaming network. Their disapproving anchors, always wagging an overpaid finger. They pass judgment like a cattle farm passes gas. CNN went from respective news to a rumor mongering hate machine. You could say their fomenting of racial strife helped destroy cities. You could say they have more blood on their hands than Hannibal Lecter after lunch. You could say that, but I won't. Because I'm not that type of guy. But also CNN's obsession with Trump led to a butt loads of errors. From collusion to Kavanaugh, Lafayette Square, the Wuhan lab, Hands Up, Don't Shoot, Avenatti, Russia, Russia, Russia. They walked back more tails than a tuxedo delivery service. Yes. That was bad, huh? But their strategy was always to pivot from one Trump tail to another. Now that he's gone, so goes that strategy. Meanwhile, the same time we saw CNN collapse, something else was going on. \"GUTFELD!\" was the number one cable news show in total viewers for the hour."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "But get this. Get this back. At 11:00 we surpass every CNN show in every hour, every hour in total viewers. Think about that. This little spunky show at 11:00 p.m. is beating all their shows in primetime. That's not like David beating Goliath. It's David beating Goliath and then marrying his sister, so you have to see him every Thanksgiving. This show also toppled some long-running alleged comedy shows on the broadcast networks, including both Jimmy's. Not a bad start for what the legacy media had branded a certain failure. They wanted us to fail so bad, because they're miserable people. The failed comedians, the unhappy blog writers, the blue-check gawkers on Twitter, they needed this show not to work because they weren't working either. But now the numbers are in and we crushed it. And weirdly, they've gotten quiet, but it's not over yet. I'm not ready to have the last laugh. I just enjoy the fact that we're all laughing. We're having a good time. We don't talk down to the viewers. Well, let's be honest, I can't talk down to anyone. But we aren't interested in dividing people. We don't tell family members to inform on liberals or try to deplatform CNN. We want you to go to bed feeling hope and not hopeless. And we don't think the other side is evil. We just think they're wrong and human. But they think we're evil. And that's the lesson. A network built on hate is failing. But a show built on love is thriving. I mean, look at the love that we show each other."

Anyway, they found that having the ability to effectively (BLEEP) other people is often a sign of intelligence. Researchers presented participants with various concepts, some real some fake and ask them to provide convincing explanations for those concepts, not based on facts. Turns out the best B.S.ers also did better on intelligence test too. Researchers added that not everyone who is smart will be a good B.S.er, similar to the way that not all smart people are also funny. Fact is, there doesn't seem to be any upside to being stupid, besides having your own show if you're related to a governor. But it's like Abe Lincoln once said, you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you won't believe how many squirrels I can fit under this hat.

She called the person who took this and put it on Twitter and a-hole and said it was only up for 30 seconds and some a-hole put it on Twitter, who she call it an a-hole?

I used to listen to this podcast when it was the two hosts but since it was just her, it's awful. It drives me crazy how she thinks she's so taboo, when really she's so boring. The last time I listened to it. She was like, I listen up people won't talk about this, but I will OK, daddy, God, daddy, daddy (BLEEP) my dad. But like there was a lot more daddy and swearing and hyping up like she was going to say something groundbreaking, then she goes, if you have sex, trying to initiate sex with your boyfriend, he'll like that. Like, who does not know that? Who older than the age of 14 does not know that? Which makes me think all of our listeners are maximum 14-years-old, which to me is a lot weirder than making out with a dog. Like, and if the fan see this, they'll probably come after me and they're like, you know, you know, but I already know she has way more money than I ever will. She has way more boobs than I ever will, they could probably say I'm jealous but all her listeners are probably jealous of me because I'm old enough to legally purchase white claw."
