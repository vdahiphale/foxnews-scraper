The week is over, and not a moment too soon, as you look at a White House and a nation's capital gripped with trying to deal with the coronavirus, news at the Corner of Wall and Broad that they were getting creamed and reamed, the Dow swooning today, better than 927 points.  It's at 19160, far lower than when Donald Trump took office and, if you are counting, the worst week for the markets since back around the time of the 1987 stock market crash. That was then. A lot of people want to know what the heck is going on now.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and you're watching \"Your World,\" a world gripped now by growing concerns that this virus thing is getting kind of out of hand.  We got word today out of Italy that the number of deaths in a single day, north of 620 individuals, was the highest recorded by any country on any single day, including China, in the better-than-four-month history of this virus. And it's not slowing down. It's escalating in Europe. It is escalating in other regions, and it is escalating here.  We just got word that the New Jersey governor now is putting sort of a ding on any sort of emergency activity. If you are not essential, you are not going to work. If you're a business whose items are not considered essential to have, you are not going to open your doors. If that sounds familiar, it should, because it's happening in California, it is happening in New York, it is happening in Pennsylvania. Fully 70 million Americans are under the grip of such restrictions, and it probably won't end there.  Let's get the read from John Roberts at the White House and how the president is handling all of this -- John.",

They, of course, are among the hardest hit because they rely on constant cash flow. They don't have a lot of reserves. And if they can't bring people in the doors or ship items out the front door, then they are going to have a difficult time keeping going. There was some track -- some talk, rather, earlier this week by Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, that, if it comes to it, that the United States government may have to cover revenues for a lot of those small businesses.   Another big piece of news today, the United States now all but closing down the border between the United States and Mexico to all but essential cross- border traffic, including trade. Same sort of thing with Canada has now been going on for a couple of days. And the Centers for Disease Control today announcing that all illegal immigrants who try to cross the border, whether it be the northern border or the southern border, will quickly be sent back from where they came. Here's what the president said about that earlier today:",

Before we get to the Capitol, I want to update you on these various states that are looking at shelter in place reactions to this ongoing virus threat.  Illinois the latest now to recommend that its residents shelter in place. That's not considered a lockdown. But, to many, it is the first step in that degree.  Remember, California's Governor Newsom had the same requirements out there; 40 million residents will be affected by very big limitations on their travels and go-abouts in the country's largest state. The situation is playing out much the same in New York state, in New Jersey. Right now, as I said, this affects, by my math, doing rough equivalent some of these states, 80 million Americans, so, again, about a quarter of the U.S. population. We will keep you posted on that, as that number is likely expected to grow. In Illinois, this staying in place starts tomorrow, in some of these other states, like California and New York, immediately.   All right, in the meantime here, let's get the read on how they're trying to get a handle on this in Washington by, well, spending a good deal of money and targeting it, and fast.

Here in the past couple of hours, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Treasury secretary have all spoken by telephone here.  Mitch McConnell wants to move this through the Senate, actually write the text tomorrow, and have a procedural vote perhaps sometime tomorrow night. Now, what that could tee up is a Monday passage of this bill, and maybe as early -- I'm going to let you in on a little secret here -- procedurally, depending on how they do it, when they say Monday, it could be Monday at 1:00 a.m.  And then the House of Representatives would have to move, maybe later in the day, maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. That's Congress moving at warp speed here, Neil. Here's something that's key. I was told yesterday -- and this is something that speaks to the markets here -- by a senior source working on this that this has to be done -- quote -- \"by Monday.\" The markets are not going to tolerate inaction. This needs to be done by Monday.   And I inquired further, and they kind of hearken back to what happened in 2008. The implication here is that Hank Paulson, the then Treasury secretary, called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the 18th of September 2008, and said, I need to meet with you tonight, or we're not going to have an economy by Monday.  I asked this source, I said, is that what we're really dealing with here? And they said, this is pretty grim. That's why they're trying to underscore, by Monday, get this done as soon as they can. But here we are late on Friday afternoon, they still don't have bill text. And, again, they have to get Democratic buy-in, because the House of Representatives is controlled by the Democrats. And, also, there is some Republican reluctance. You're going to need 60 votes to get this through the Senate to avoid a filibuster. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, he lost eight Republicans on his side of the aisle when they move the phase two bill on Wednesday.   So you have to have agreement with Democrats, Neil.",

But it's very, very clear, just if I were to look at market reaction, that any sort of stimulus that's being considered, whether it's the Federal Reserve driving interest rates down to near zero percent again, or buying trillions of dollars worth of corporate paper, Treasury paper, mortgage- backed security paper, none of that works.

Obviously, in the meantime, we need to do everything we can to stop its spread, which has been the focus of all the activities by the medical professionals. And everybody is, I think, stepping in, trying to contribute to that. But we need to make it as easy as possible and get rid of the hurdles, the regulatory obstacles to getting a vaccine out there as quickly as possible. And, usually, it takes -- there are tests and -- research period, test period, all that you have to go through. I think we ought to be looking at everything we can do to streamline that process in order to get to the vaccine. We need to be able to get this and beat this, because, if we don't, obviously, it could be with us for a really long time. And, as you can tell, that's having a profound adverse impact on the economy, which is what we're trying to address here on Capitol Hill. But, ultimately, it comes down to beating this disease.

And so there is a -- it's a full-court press, I believe. I think the president understands that. I think everybody understands that. All you have to do is look around the country and see what's happening. But I think he is rightly focused on trying to come up with solutions that will beat the disease. And combating the virus and its spread is the best we can do right now. But we need to be putting all our efforts behind coming up with a solution that ultimately will treat this. And I think that's where Dr. Fauci and all the members of the president's team have their eyes and their focus right now, but, in the meantime, we have got to assist the states, we have got to assist the hospitals, health care providers, people on the front lines, and try and do something to ensure that our small businesses don't go away.",

But just for those of you who tuned in here, it was an awful closing on an awful week. The Dow now is back to levels it wasn't only before the president was inaugurated, but not too far from when he was first elected, 19173. To put this in perspective for you, the Dow in little more than a few weeks has shed more than a third of its value, 35 percent from its highs, some issues 50, 60, 70 percent from their highs. It's not that the economy is bad. It's not that the underlying fundamentals are questionable. It's not that the fact that companies are doing very well is at issue. The question going forward is, can they continue to do that, when companies like AT&T and a host of others are saying, we're not so sure, when FedEx is saying, we're withdrawing guidance on the future because we don't know what the future looks like?

We're seeing an uptick in the number of aces, for sure, in the hospital emergency room, and as far as ambulance and 911 calls. So, putting people in homes and apartments is a good way to suppress the infection rate. Social distancing that we practice now will cut a hole in this epidemic. So, this is not so draconian as everybody thinks, everybody saying, oh, my gosh, the sky is falling. We got to slow the infectious process. And that's mitigation. That's the next step. But that doesn't stop the spread. So it should be the first line of defense -- it shouldn't be the first line of defense.  What should be the first line of defense is to suppress things.

Fortunately, we haven't had any terrible situations with children, but, in young people, I'm surprised at the number of people around the state who are intubated.

Let's get the read on whether that comes to pass, whether it should come to pass from David Neeleman, the JetBlue founder, Azul Airlines founder. He is a pioneer in the airline industry. A lot of people said JetBlue wasn't going to go anywhere, that Azul wasn't going anywhere. Well, he made mincemeat of them. So, David, let me ask you a little bit about this and the bailout that that's being kicked around. And I understand where the airlines are coming from. It's not their fault that this virus got out of control and people stopped traveling. But should they be restricted if they get it? In other words, should they be restricted on buybacks, stock buybacks, that sort of thing?   DAVID NEELEMAN, FORMER CEO, JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION: I think it depends on if it's a loan or if it's a grant. Obviously, if it's a grant, and they get money, then they should accept some of the terms. But part of the problem, Neil, that we're at -- I'm sitting here watching the stock report -- I have spent -- the last two weeks, I haven't slept three hours a night. I'm trying to figure out how to save jobs. I'm trying to figure it out. And I think the most discouraging thing for all of us is kind of the lack of uncertainty. If we could just tell us, this day, it will all end, then we will all be fine, but the lack of uncertainty. And just in the last, I don't know -- I -- I stay up all night reading stuff, because I just can't -- I just -- I'm just an innovator. And just in the last few days, I have just -- I have -- I have found hope. I have -- actually think that this thing's going to resolve itself really quickly. And how -- and I know that seems kind of crazy to all these people that are really upset right now. And -- but one of the things that, when you saw this thing, it started in December. It could have started sooner in China, and then it exploded throughout the world, and it went to 100 different countries, one thing that never really kind of made sense to a lot of people is, is, how are we only having 295,000 cases, if something exploded this much? And then I started reading some research. And a lot of people know that the denominator is wrong, but we don't know how many -- what factor it is wrong. And I started reading some things out of University of Padua out of Italy, and a study that was done in China that says, between one -- nine out of 10 people that have this thing didn't -- never had a symptom.

Neil, just as you were coming to us, we reset the machine here. This come from a Web site generated out of Baltimore. That was at 265,000. Now it's at 258,000. Now, I'm not trying to be overly optimistic about all this, but I just want to point this out, that this is all happening in real time. And these numbers literally change sometimes by the hour, certainly by the day here. So, the total recovered mark here is 87,000 globally. At 2:30 this afternoon, that was at 81,000. So you're getting a shift a little bit, as some of these countries and populations start to pull away from that, the time where they were worst affected by the virus, and now starting to move out of it. One place that is not the case is Italy, 47,000 cases, Neil. There are more than 4,000 deaths report in that country. They had a grim headline -- going to move across the room -- they had a grim headline today, Neil. They reported more than 670 people died today in one day alone out of Italy. And that's -- that follows a day after they reported another death toll of more than 400 in a single day. So, Italy is really getting racked on this. Neil, I want to show these to you. This is the Italian line in yellow, South Korea in blue, and the United States here in green. The Italian line is not where you want to be. We here in the U.S. were below the South Korean line yesterday. And, today, we have just ticked above that, OK? So I'm going to change something for you, Neil, and show you, perhaps in the U.S., to give us some more perspective about what's happening out there as we take in this information. This is as of late last night, so, Thursday, March 19. These are the cases in the U.S. in yellow, and the New York cases here in blue, new cases going back a couple days, 12,000 in the U.S., 6,600 in New York. Just hold on to that number and watch this graph here. Across the country, as of last night, We're at 14,250. But in New York, this is a -- this is a problem, Neil. In New York late last night, we spiked to 7,100. And that number could change rapidly. Just for a bit more perspective on New York specifically, if you're at 7,100 last night, with 35 deaths reported -- that was Thursday. But take you back to Monday to start the week, on March 16. Watch this here, 1,300 on Monday, popped to 2,300 on Tuesday, 4,100 on March 18, and then yesterday 7,100. Now, you could say that that's because we're testing more. And that's in all likelihood the case. You're getting more tests out there. People don't feel well, and they're going in for the examination. And they're coming back positive. But at the moment, for the United States specifically, New York City is the epicenter for this. And we're going to watch this throughout the weekend. New York right -- Neil, would ranked arguably eighth in the world a for, city for a single state, as opposed to all the other dozens and dozens of countries that are trying to add this up.",

I have now -- AHCA has an embedded staff at the facility around the clock. But if you are an operator of one of these facilities, you need to take responsibility to protect your residents. This is a virus that is in certain communities spreading in Florida. And Broward is one of them. And you need to take action to protect your people.

So I told everyone, be patient, we're going to try to get it right. But I'm happy to report, as of 4:00, the initial goal, I think, was to do about 250 samples collected. They have already collected 407 samples in this one test site on their first day. This is in C.B. Smith Park, 900 North Flamingo Road, Pembroke Pines, Florida. And really the only thing you can do is go into the main gate. Hours of operation, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00, Monday through Sunday, started today, Friday, March 20.

They fill out the registration and lab form. There's a collection. Then they get -- then they leave in their car, and Broward Memorial will run the lab and inform the individual of the results.

The difference, though, is the lack of urgency that we have seen out of the state of Florida until today. As you mentioned earlier, the beaches weren't closed. Spring breakers were out there. Key West was still open. Well, now the Keys, the hotels, all the resorts, they have finally closed. The governor is also issuing executive orders to close movie theaters, concert houses, auditoriums, playhouses, bowling alleys, arcades, gymnasiums, what have you. He is now issuing a number of executive orders, the way that our governor here in New York did. He also mentioned something interesting to note here, that they have now opened a remote test site. Remember, Florida's numbers are nowhere near New York's. Right now, they have 520 cases in the entire state of Florida. Of course, those numbers go up as tests come in and 10 deaths at this point. In Broward County alone, which is where he mentioned they are going to be setting up that remote test site, 124 cases there, in Miami-Dade, 113 cases. They say there's two steps.

The week is over, and not a moment too soon, as you look at a White House and a nation's capital gripped with trying to deal with the coronavirus, news at the Corner of Wall and Broad that they were getting creamed and reamed, the Dow swooning today, better than 927 points. It's at 19160, far lower than when Donald Trump took office and, if you are counting, the worst week for the markets since back around the time of the 1987 stock market crash. That was then. A lot of people want to know what the heck is going on now. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and you're watching \"Your World,\" a world gripped now by growing concerns that this virus thing is getting kind of out of hand. We got word today out of Italy that the number of deaths in a single day, north of 620 individuals, was the highest recorded by any country on any single day, including China, in the better-than-four-month history of this virus. And it's not slowing down. It's escalating in Europe. It is escalating in other regions, and it is escalating here. We just got word that the New Jersey governor now is putting sort of a ding on any sort of emergency activity. If you are not essential, you are not going to work. If you're a business whose items are not considered essential to have, you are not going to open your doors. If that sounds familiar, it should, because it's happening in California, it is happening in New York, it is happening in Pennsylvania. Fully 70 million Americans are under the grip of such restrictions, and it probably won't end there. Let's get the read from John Roberts at the White House and how the president is handling all of this -- John."

And if they can't bring people in the doors or ship items out the front door, then they are going to have a difficult time keeping going. There was some track -- some talk, rather, earlier this week by Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, that, if it comes to it, that the United States government may have to cover revenues for a lot of those small businesses. Another big piece of news today, the United States now all but closing down the border between the United States and Mexico to all but essential cross- border traffic, including trade. Same sort of thing with Canada has now been going on for a couple of days.

Before we get to the Capitol, I want to update you on these various states that are looking at shelter in place reactions to this ongoing virus threat. Illinois the latest now to recommend that its residents shelter in place. That's not considered a lockdown. But, to many, it is the first step in that degree. Remember, California's Governor Newsom had the same requirements out there; 40 million residents will be affected by very big limitations on their travels and go-abouts in the country's largest state. The situation is playing out much the same in New York state, in New Jersey. Right now, as I said, this affects, by my math, doing rough equivalent some of these states, 80 million Americans, so, again, about a quarter of the U.S. population. We will keep you posted on that, as that number is likely expected to grow. In Illinois, this staying in place starts tomorrow, in some of these other states, like California and New York, immediately. All right, in the meantime here, let's get the read on how they're trying to get a handle on this in Washington by, well, spending a good deal of money and targeting it, and fast. Chad Pergram on that -- Chad."

      "utterance": "Good afternoon, Neil. Well, the goal here is to get this agreement forged in the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, sometime tonight. Here in the past couple of hours, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Treasury secretary have all spoken by telephone here. Mitch McConnell wants to move this through the Senate, actually write the text tomorrow, and have a procedural vote perhaps sometime tomorrow night. Now, what that could tee up is a Monday passage of this bill, and maybe as early -- I'm going to let you in on a little secret here -- procedurally, depending on how they do it, when they say Monday, it could be Monday at 1:00 a.m. And then the House of Representatives would have to move, maybe later in the day, maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. That's Congress moving at warp speed here, Neil. Here's something that's key. I was told yesterday -- and this is something that speaks to the markets here -- by a senior source working on this that this has to be done -- quote -- \"by Monday.\" The markets are not going to tolerate inaction. This needs to be done by Monday. And I inquired further, and they kind of hearken back to what happened in 2008. The implication here is that Hank Paulson, the then Treasury secretary, called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the 18th of September 2008, and said, I need to meet with you tonight, or we're not going to have an economy by Monday. I asked this source, I said, is that what we're really dealing with here? And they said, this is pretty grim. That's why they're trying to underscore, by Monday, get this done as soon as they can. But here we are late on Friday afternoon, they still don't have bill text. And, again, they have to get Democratic buy-in, because the House of Representatives is controlled by the Democrats. And, also, there is some Republican reluctance. You're going to need 60 votes to get this through the Senate to avoid a filibuster. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, he lost eight Republicans on his side of the aisle when they move the phase two bill on Wednesday. So you have to have agreement with Democrats, Neil."

Senator, I know good intentions run rampant throughout the Capitol, and I give all of you guys great credit for that. But it's very, very clear, just if I were to look at market reaction, that any sort of stimulus that's being considered, whether it's the Federal Reserve driving interest rates down to near zero percent again, or buying trillions of dollars worth of corporate paper, Treasury paper, mortgage- backed security paper, none of that works. I'm wondering if greater effort should be placed in just addressing the virus itself."

      "utterance": "You're absolutely right, Neil. That's what -- that's where it all starts. And we're trying to deal with the symptoms. And we really need to be treating the cause. And the cause, of course, is the coronavirus, which we need a vaccine for. Obviously, in the meantime, we need to do everything we can to stop its spread, which has been the focus of all the activities by the medical professionals. And everybody is, I think, stepping in, trying to contribute to that. But we need to make it as easy as possible and get rid of the hurdles, the regulatory obstacles to getting a vaccine out there as quickly as possible. And, usually, it takes -- there are tests and -- research period, test period, all that you have to go through. I think we ought to be looking at everything we can do to streamline that process in order to get to the vaccine. We need to be able to get this and beat this, because, if we don't, obviously, it could be with us for a really long time. And, as you can tell, that's having a profound adverse impact on the economy, which is what we're trying to address here on Capitol Hill. But, ultimately, it comes down to beating this disease. And that's going to require coming up with that vaccine."

The only reason why I mentioned is, it came to light today in his press briefing, where Dr. Fauci sort of dialed back some of that optimism he had about getting this under control, that it's pretty severe, that it's not to be dismissed. I'm sort of giving it a quick read, but that he wasn't on the same page as the president, Dr. Fauci, in other words, to say that this is something the president doesn't really appreciate is getting bad?"

We have a whole battery of people up here from the administration who are working with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to craft a bill that addresses not only the health crisis, the health care crisis component, but also trying to deal with the economic harm that's been caused, not only for families and individuals and workers, but also for the small businesses that employ them. And so there is a -- it's a full-court press, I believe. I think the president understands that. I think everybody understands that. All you have to do is look around the country and see what's happening. But I think he is rightly focused on trying to come up with solutions that will beat the disease. And combating the virus and its spread is the best we can do right now. But we need to be putting all our efforts behind coming up with a solution that ultimately will treat this. And I think that's where Dr. Fauci and all the members of the president's team have their eyes and their focus right now, but, in the meantime, we have got to assist the states, we have got to assist the hospitals, health care providers, people on the front lines, and try and do something to ensure that our small businesses don't go away."

But just for those of you who tuned in here, it was an awful closing on an awful week. The Dow now is back to levels it wasn't only before the president was inaugurated, but not too far from when he was first elected, 19173. To put this in perspective for you, the Dow in little more than a few weeks has shed more than a third of its value, 35 percent from its highs, some issues 50, 60, 70 percent from their highs. It's not that the economy is bad. It's not that the underlying fundamentals are questionable. It's not that the fact that companies are doing very well is at issue. The question going forward is, can they continue to do that, when companies like AT&T and a host of others are saying, we're not so sure, when FedEx is saying, we're withdrawing guidance on the future because we don't know what the future looks like?

That echoes what New York Governor Cuomo and California Governor Newsom have done in their respective states to limit residents from getting out and going to work, doing much of anything. It's not a lockdown. But for a lot of folks who are in the middle of it, it certainly feels like that. If you look at all the states that have variations of this, you're talking 80 million Americans, so roughly, roughly a quarter of the U.S. population. Again, that could grow, out of an abundance of caution, we're told, by a number of the governors using it, including the governor of Illinois just a few minutes ago. Let's get the read on how effective such measures are to combating a virus that seems to be spiraling out of control. Dr. Bob Lahita joins us now at St. Joseph University.

You can suppress the infection, which is to keep people away from potentially infected individuals. And that's the way to go in the beginning. We're seeing an uptick in the number of aces, for sure, in the hospital emergency room, and as far as ambulance and 911 calls. So, putting people in homes and apartments is a good way to suppress the infection rate. Social distancing that we practice now will cut a hole in this epidemic. So, this is not so draconian as everybody thinks, everybody saying, oh, my gosh, the sky is falling. We got to slow the infectious process. And that's mitigation. That's the next step. But that doesn't stop the spread. So it should be the first line of defense -- it shouldn't be the first line of defense. What should be the first line of defense is to suppress things. So that's why Governor Cuomo, I think, has chosen to keep all essential -- nonessential people out of the street, out of circulation, as it were."

In fact, we're seeing many of our most acute and most of our very, very sick cases are among 20- and 30-year-olds. So the initial thoughts young people didn't have to worry is not the case. And to be in groups, closed groups, where there are more than, say, 20 people together gathered is insanity, as far as I'm concerned. And we're seeing people now, young, young people, children, actually infected. Fortunately, we haven't had any terrible situations with children, but, in young people, I'm surprised at the number of people around the state who are intubated. That means have a tube placed into their lungs so they can breathe better. These are young people and not necessarily older folks. Older folks are at the greatest risk, however, those with heart disease, diabetes, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They know who they are.

We are at levels now that are below where they were when Donald Trump first assumed office, and not all that far from when he was first elected president of the United States.

And I'm not talking just for the coronavirus, but world reaction to that virus, and, at the corner of Wall and Broad, for example, one of the worst we have seen since the financial meltdown. With today's 913-point hit in the Dow, it's barely hovering over 19000, let alone 20000. Keep in mind, a little more than a month ago, it was flirting with 30000. All of this could get a little complicating on Monday, when the New York Stock Exchange will still be trading, but without those famous floor traders you tend to see in all of these shots. It will all be done electronically. They can do that, but the question is, what is lost in that process? Could it complicate the process? Could it exasperate the process right here, exacerbate the process any? Let's get the read from Tim Anderson, the New York Stock Exchange trader. How will this affect what you do, Tim?

So, a lot of them really tailor that how they're going to manage their buy and sell orders that day, in relation to what the volume might be around the opening, and then a lot later in the day around the close. So they will be guessing a lot. Maybe there will be a little bit more tentative. Maybe the volumes will drop off a little bit.

And the reason I say that -- and I don't want to make light of a day where the Dow was down almost 1,000 points. We're down 4.5 percent kind of across the board. But with these moves early in the week and the prior week, we'd have 20 issues down for everyone that was up. I mean, some of the advanced decline stats the last two-and-a-half weeks have been mind-boggling. Today, we have got three stocks down for every two that are up. So, the -- what we call the internals of the market aren't showing nearly the across-the-board weakness that we're seeing in the market averages. That, to me, tells me we're in maybe the initial phases of trying to define maybe a low or a tradable range for the near term.

Let's get the read on whether that comes to pass, whether it should come to pass from David Neeleman, the JetBlue founder, Azul Airlines founder. He is a pioneer in the airline industry. A lot of people said JetBlue wasn't going to go anywhere, that Azul wasn't going anywhere. Well, he made mincemeat of them. So, David, let me ask you a little bit about this and the bailout that that's being kicked around. And I understand where the airlines are coming from. It's not their fault that this virus got out of control and people stopped traveling. But should they be restricted if they get it? In other words, should they be restricted on buybacks, stock buybacks, that sort of thing?   DAVID NEELEMAN, FORMER CEO, JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION: I think it depends on if it's a loan or if it's a grant. Obviously, if it's a grant, and they get money, then they should accept some of the terms. But part of the problem, Neil, that we're at -- I'm sitting here watching the stock report -- I have spent -- the last two weeks, I haven't slept three hours a night. I'm trying to figure out how to save jobs. I'm trying to figure it out. And I think the most discouraging thing for all of us is kind of the lack of uncertainty. If we could just tell us, this day, it will all end, then we will all be fine, but the lack of uncertainty. And just in the last, I don't know -- I -- I stay up all night reading stuff, because I just can't -- I just -- I'm just an innovator. And just in the last few days, I have just -- I have -- I have found hope. I have -- actually think that this thing's going to resolve itself really quickly. And how -- and I know that seems kind of crazy to all these people that are really upset right now. And -- but one of the things that, when you saw this thing, it started in December. It could have started sooner in China, and then it exploded throughout the world, and it went to 100 different countries, one thing that never really kind of made sense to a lot of people is, is, how are we only having 295,000 cases, if something exploded this much? And then I started reading some research. And a lot of people know that the denominator is wrong, but we don't know how many -- what factor it is wrong. And I started reading some things out of University of Padua out of Italy, and a study that was done in China that says, between one -- nine out of 10 people that have this thing didn't -- never had a symptom. They never had a symptom."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Good afternoon to you. And I just want to show you the Johns Hopkins map here, 258,000 total confirmed around the world. Neil, just as you were coming to us, we reset the machine here. This come from a Web site generated out of Baltimore. That was at 265,000. Now it's at 258,000. Now, I'm not trying to be overly optimistic about all this, but I just want to point this out, that this is all happening in real time. And these numbers literally change sometimes by the hour, certainly by the day here. So, the total recovered mark here is 87,000 globally. At 2:30 this afternoon, that was at 81,000. So you're getting a shift a little bit, as some of these countries and populations start to pull away from that, the time where they were worst affected by the virus, and now starting to move out of it. One place that is not the case is Italy, 47,000 cases, Neil. There are more than 4,000 deaths report in that country. They had a grim headline -- going to move across the room -- they had a grim headline today, Neil. They reported more than 670 people died today in one day alone out of Italy. And that's -- that follows a day after they reported another death toll of more than 400 in a single day. So, Italy is really getting racked on this. Neil, I want to show these to you. This is the Italian line in yellow, South Korea in blue, and the United States here in green. The Italian line is not where you want to be. We here in the U.S. were below the South Korean line yesterday. And, today, we have just ticked above that, OK? So I'm going to change something for you, Neil, and show you, perhaps in the U.S., to give us some more perspective about what's happening out there as we take in this information. This is as of late last night, so, Thursday, March 19. These are the cases in the U.S. in yellow, and the New York cases here in blue, new cases going back a couple days, 12,000 in the U.S., 6,600 in New York. Just hold on to that number and watch this graph here. Across the country, as of last night, We're at 14,250. But in New York, this is a -- this is a problem, Neil. In New York late last night, we spiked to 7,100. And that number could change rapidly. Just for a bit more perspective on New York specifically, if you're at 7,100 last night, with 35 deaths reported -- that was Thursday. But take you back to Monday to start the week, on March 16. Watch this here, 1,300 on Monday, popped to 2,300 on Tuesday, 4,100 on March 18, and then yesterday 7,100. Now, you could say that that's because we're testing more. And that's in all likelihood the case. You're getting more tests out there. People don't feel well, and they're going in for the examination. And they're coming back positive. But at the moment, for the United States specifically, New York City is the epicenter for this. And we're going to watch this throughout the weekend. New York right -- Neil, would ranked arguably eighth in the world a for, city for a single state, as opposed to all the other dozens and dozens of countries that are trying to add this up."

I have now -- AHCA has an embedded staff at the facility around the clock. But if you are an operator of one of these facilities, you need to take responsibility to protect your residents. This is a virus that is in certain communities spreading in Florida. And Broward is one of them. And you need to take action to protect your people. On a better note, I'm happy to report that, yesterday, we announced the launching of a drive-through test site in Broward County, in conjunction with memorial health care and the Florida National Guard. And I was very measured about what to expect, because most of these sites that tried to launch don't end up working out. And there's some major problems. So I told everyone, be patient, we're going to try to get it right. But I'm happy to report, as of 4:00, the initial goal, I think, was to do about 250 samples collected. They have already collected 407 samples in this one test site on their first day. This is in C.B. Smith Park, 900 North Flamingo Road, Pembroke Pines, Florida. And really the only thing you can do is go into the main gate. Hours of operation, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00, Monday through Sunday, started today, Friday, March 20. The test result is, as many of you know, there's backlogs with the private labs. Memorial Health's lab is almost online. But we're obviously -- we'd love to turn those test results as soon as possible. But this is something where they go in, they get screened. If they pass the initial screening, they go to step two. They fill out the registration and lab form. There's a collection. Then they get -- then they leave in their car, and Broward Memorial will run the lab and inform the individual of the results. And so we would like to scale this up, and hopefully replicate it around the state, because I really think that the number one thing that we need is just a lot more people to have been tested. If we have that..."

      "utterance": "All right, we are listening to Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, the Sunshine State. The problem there is, they have a lot of college kids and others enjoying the warm weather and enjoying their spring break and in crowds decidedly more than 10 or 50, more like hundreds. And the governor finally had to pull up a dad, and say, what the heck are you guys doing? Stop it. So, they have stopped it. They have not gone to shelter in place in that state. The weather is simply too nice to do that. And he's not signaled -- that is, Governor DeSantis -- that he would follow the likes of what California is doing, what New York is doing, what Illinois is doing, where they are trying to tell their residents, if you don't have to go outside, then don't. Julie Banderas has been following this very, very closely. But, Julie, it does seem to be the trend that a lot of these states and cities, municipalities, are going..."

      "utterance": "Yes, it's interesting also to note that we heard from two governors today of two very large states. We heard from Ron DeSantis just moments ago. We heard from Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has been doing, I must add, an incredible job at informing and keeping New Yorkers up to date, now that number, as Bill Hemmer just mentioned, reached over 7,000 corona cases here. The difference, though, is the lack of urgency that we have seen out of the state of Florida until today. As you mentioned earlier, the beaches weren't closed. Spring breakers were out there. Key West was still open. Well, now the Keys, the hotels, all the resorts, they have finally closed. The governor is also issuing executive orders to close movie theaters, concert houses, auditoriums, playhouses, bowling alleys, arcades, gymnasiums, what have you. He is now issuing a number of executive orders, the way that our governor here in New York did. He also mentioned something interesting to note here, that they have now opened a remote test site. Remember, Florida's numbers are nowhere near New York's. Right now, they have 520 cases in the entire state of Florida. Of course, those numbers go up as tests come in and 10 deaths at this point. In Broward County alone, which is where he mentioned they are going to be setting up that remote test site, 124 cases there, in Miami-Dade, 113 cases. They say there's two steps. Step one, you go in, and you get screened. Step two, you fill out a lab form, you go home, you wait for a phone call. So, at least Florida's finally catching up, Neil."

You have heard a lot about the denominator growing larger. And that worries folks, because when they hear that there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of potential more cases that could crop up worldwide, oh, my God, it's the end. Well, the fact of the matter is that, obviously, that would change the equation a little bit. There'd be fewer people as a percentage that are really getting hurt by, let alone killed by this. But you can survive this. And my next guest is a very good example of that. His name is John Mormando. He is a New Jersey virus survivor. He joins us out of Oakland, New Jersey, via Skype.

So, I -- he said he had pneumonia. So I didn't think anything of it. I didn't get any symptoms at all for three to four days. And then I started getting a fever, and I started getting a cough. And then I started thinking, well, maybe this could be it. So, I self-quarantined myself and went to the hospital the next day, did all the tests for everything but COVID, and now came back negative, Neil. So, we just thought it was a virus, maybe just a viral infection. I didn't go out of the country. So, I wasn't really in the demographic for COVID-19. But, as it progressed, I started picking up things and just started thinking, this is -- this might -- this might be it. So I progressed it to my doctor in another hospital. And they admitted me."

I still have a little cough, but I think that's more than the pneumonia-like substance that is still in my lungs that's part of the virus. I have no fever at all. I'm not getting any chills. So, I consider myself cured, but I'm not taking any chances. I'm still quarantined in my house away from my wife and my son. And I won't be going to work for anytime soon, or anywhere else, for that matter. I'm considering myself in self-quarantine for another two weeks, to be safe."

We will be looking at it from all angles with those who have a lot at stake and those even who do not, but looking at the long-term impact of this with a couple of big votes that will be going on through the weekend to provide more stimulus and more aid on the powers that be at both parties. Remember, we are here for you. We're following the impact of this. This is your life. It's not just about money. It's just about market gyrations. Markets will come back my friends.
