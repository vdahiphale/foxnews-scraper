      "sentences": "Vladimir Putin today in this speech that really echoed pre-Soviet maps, saying that Ukraine essentially is Russia's. And that he was going to move to declare independence for these two eastern separatist regions. And if you put up the map, you can see it on the map in the green section there, Donetsk and Luhansk, kind of the eastern section of Ukraine. And we are getting reports tonight that military transport vehicles and tanks are rolling into those areas. Put up the map in a second -- there you go. And that's called the Donbas region, and it's right there along the border with Russia and Ukraine. You see Crimea at the bottom. That's what Russia invaded and took over in 2014, just to give you a sense. And what that means is really a bigger question about whether Putin goes on to Ukraine, the yellow section there, and on to Kyiv. Let's bring in our panel, Ben Domenech is publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, and Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina. Ben, we're trying to get a grip of the big picture of what this means and this action, this speech from Putin and what we're hearing about military movements already. The administration has now moved State Department personnel out of Ukraine, and they are saying that they are going to be relocating in Poland. That sends its own signal. Where do you think we are tonight? BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think that we are on a track that a lot of people have been warning against for a long time because they understand Vladimir Putin for what he is. And the connections that were running throughout his speech today I think go all the way back to when he was a young official working during the fall of the Berlin Wall, burning all those those documents so that they didn't fall into the wrong hands when he was working for the KGB. There was real emotion, I felt like, in seeing his comments about those who would deny Russia's right to assert themselves here. And I agree with Jennifer Griffin's statements earlier that I don't think that there is any reason we should expect him to stop with this region. I think he is going to roll as far as he wants to. And the approach that this White House has used in terms of deterrence has proven to be a total waste. You can't deter people after the fact. You have to deter them ahead the fact. And what was coming here today has been telegraphed, as I said, for quite some time.",

This is a larger ambition, a larger vision than what the president -- than what President Putin shared tonight. Chris Murphy, the music needs to be lost, but I think there something is to be said there. There could be a reality to what he is saying. I think the White House and the president's occupation with dealing with NATO and keeping us resolved and united and strong may be the greatest deterrence. We'll have to wait until the morning to see how the president and his team handle what may happen overnight in Ukraine. But one thing is for certain. I think if you gave the White House a grade up until today before Putin's speech you would have to give them an A. But all bets are off now and all grades are out.
