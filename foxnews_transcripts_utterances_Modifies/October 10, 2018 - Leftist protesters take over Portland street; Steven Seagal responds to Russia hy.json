      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Trump rally in progress right now in Council Bluffs, Iowa. It's right outside Omaha. We're monitoring it, of course, as we always do. And if news happens, we'll go right there. But first, we want to bring you up to speed on what's happening here in Washington. The crack political team over at The Washington Post, our daily local newspaper, has uncovered a brand new species of fake news they think you need to know about, imaginary Left-wing mobs.  In a piece posted last night, The Post explained that in order to win the midterm elections, those Republicans have \"cast the Trump resistance movement as an angry mob.\"  Now, cast is of course here a synonym for misrepresented. The Washington Post wants you to know that these mobs are not real. They're an illusion and that may surprise you, because you may have recently seen videos of prominent Republicans being chased out of restaurants by screaming progressives.  You may have read news accounts about how a Republican Congressman from Louisiana was shot with a high-powered rifle by a Bernie Sanders supporter. You may have seen college campuses descend into rioting simply because conservatives showed up to talk. And just this past weekend, you may have watched transfixed as groups of hysterical young people yelled at Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill and then pounded in rage on the front doors of the Supreme Court.  All of this may have given you the mistaken impression that there is a threat of disorder and lawlessness from the Left building in this country, some of it funded by a man that The Washington Post neutrally describes and recording now as philanthropist George Soros. Well, rest easy says The Post. In fact, all of this talk of Left-wing mobs \"taps grievances about the nation's fast-moving cultural and demographic shifts.\" In other words, this is racism, and it's designed says The Post, \"for the benefit of white voters, particularly men.\"  Wow, so the angry Left-wing mobs you thought you had been watching on television turn out to be merely a hallucination. They're a fever dream concocted by those diabolical magicians over at Fox News. Thank heaven, you can wake up now. None of it is real, it's 1996 again.   But wait, has anyone told the angry Left-wing mobs about this? They seem to believe that they exist. In Portland, they're still blocking traffic and breaking things and screaming at old ladies in wheelchairs. Apparently, they don't get The Washington Post in Oregon. Watch.",

Assessing everything you've seen over the past year, you might be tempted to conclude that just maybe there is a growing problem with Left- wing mob violence.   But Left-wing leaders and their propagandists in the press have concluded, you'll be surprised to learn, the exact opposite. Faced with one Left-wing riot after another, they have decided the problem is actually you. You're the problem, sitting at home, you're dangerous.  In The New York Times this morning, Paul Krugman accused the Republican Party of harboring authoritarian impulses. Apparently, Republicans have been chasing prominent Democrats out of restaurants recently and banging on cars. Oh wait, there's that projection thing again. Hillary Clinton is so worried though about how dangerous the Republican Party has become, those angry Mormon grandmothers in black bandanas you're seeing in downtown Portland smashing windows, that she no longer considers Republicans Americans or even fully human.

And of course, zombie raccoons are a threat to national security and the well-being of this nation. Last summer, hundreds of them terrorized Central Park in Manhattan. And now, like so many hipsters living on their parents' time, the zombie raccoons have moved to Brooklyn, the hippest of the Burroughs. Several of these raccoons carry the distemper virus and they have been found in Prospect Park, that is a popular dog walking location for people in skinny jeans. That's terrifying because, while the distemper virus is no threat to humans, it does affect dogs. It's one thing to infect hipsters in Brooklyn, but we draw the line at endangering canines, as you should too.  Steven Seagal responds to Russia hysteria, talks new movie Well, most of Hollywood is deeply concerned about Russia. That follows a memo they presumably were sent the day after Hillary lost the election. One exception though is Steven Seagal. He has received Russian citizenship; he's moved in the other direction pretty aggressively. He is now Russia's Special Envoy to the U.S. He's even talked about running for office there.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Trump rally in progress right now in Council Bluffs, Iowa. It's right outside Omaha. We're monitoring it, of course, as we always do. And if news happens, we'll go right there. But first, we want to bring you up to speed on what's happening here in Washington. The crack political team over at The Washington Post, our daily local newspaper, has uncovered a brand new species of fake news they think you need to know about, imaginary Left-wing mobs. In a piece posted last night, The Post explained that in order to win the midterm elections, those Republicans have \"cast the Trump resistance movement as an angry mob.\" Now, cast is of course here a synonym for misrepresented. The Washington Post wants you to know that these mobs are not real. They're an illusion and that may surprise you, because you may have recently seen videos of prominent Republicans being chased out of restaurants by screaming progressives. You may have read news accounts about how a Republican Congressman from Louisiana was shot with a high-powered rifle by a Bernie Sanders supporter. You may have seen college campuses descend into rioting simply because conservatives showed up to talk. And just this past weekend, you may have watched transfixed as groups of hysterical young people yelled at Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill and then pounded in rage on the front doors of the Supreme Court. All of this may have given you the mistaken impression that there is a threat of disorder and lawlessness from the Left building in this country, some of it funded by a man that The Washington Post neutrally describes and recording now as philanthropist George Soros. Well, rest easy says The Post. In fact, all of this talk of Left-wing mobs \"taps grievances about the nation's fast-moving cultural and demographic shifts.\" In other words, this is racism, and it's designed says The Post, \"for the benefit of white voters, particularly men.\" Wow, so the angry Left-wing mobs you thought you had been watching on television turn out to be merely a hallucination. They're a fever dream concocted by those diabolical magicians over at Fox News. Thank heaven, you can wake up now. None of it is real, it's 1996 again. But wait, has anyone told the angry Left-wing mobs about this? They seem to believe that they exist. In Portland, they're still blocking traffic and breaking things and screaming at old ladies in wheelchairs. Apparently, they don't get The Washington Post in Oregon. Watch."

      "utterance": "Well, that's a fair question and the video we just showed you is real video. We didn't make it up in the basement to scare you or to win the midterm. Assessing everything you've seen over the past year, you might be tempted to conclude that just maybe there is a growing problem with Left- wing mob violence. But Left-wing leaders and their propagandists in the press have concluded, you'll be surprised to learn, the exact opposite. Faced with one Left-wing riot after another, they have decided the problem is actually you. You're the problem, sitting at home, you're dangerous. In The New York Times this morning, Paul Krugman accused the Republican Party of harboring authoritarian impulses. Apparently, Republicans have been chasing prominent Democrats out of restaurants recently and banging on cars. Oh wait, there's that projection thing again. Hillary Clinton is so worried though about how dangerous the Republican Party has become, those angry Mormon grandmothers in black bandanas you're seeing in downtown Portland smashing windows, that she no longer considers Republicans Americans or even fully human.

There's the most recent Democratic Presidential candidate, the leader of her party by default, endorsing viciousness openly against her political opponents.

Andy Ngo lives in Portland, where again he's a journalist at Quillette. He's been following this very closely and he joins us tonight. So Andy, we played a bunch of videos, some of which you publicized, what's happening in the streets of Portland.

They were protesting the police involved shooting of a man who is suspected of shooting two people. And well, the police here take a pretty hands-off approach much of the time with protesters. And what you saw on Saturday in the video is demonstrators were allowed to take over a street in downtown Portland and direct traffic and threaten drivers, stop traffic while the police looked on from a block away, because they were afraid of inflaming the situation."

And while I'm not privy to some of the internal conversations that you may have with the police department here, just based on all the events that have happened in the past, I would say there's sort of a dereliction of duty, of being -- of upholding the rule of law."

So, Richard, let's say I'm a Democrat and I'm thinking I want cheaper health care, I'm worried about my premiums, a lot of people are.

Musicians, and dancers, and actors, they are having a huge impact and they don't have any watchdogs looking at them with what they're doing and what decisions they're making. They don't do things that are transparent that we don't see them making their decisions like we do with the Supreme Court."

      "utterance": "Well, the creepy porn lawyer is many things, obviously intensely creepy, trust me. But he's also, to be fair, an astute political observer. He was throwing around spurious gang rape allegations a couple of weeks ago at Brett Kavanaugh. That didn't work, it actually hurt his party. So, he's pivoted to a new tactic, embracing the Left's newfound support for incivility and political violence. And what better way to show that support than by picking a fight literally. So, today the creepy porn lawyer challenged Donald Trump Jr. in a three- round MMA bout. Don Jr. has not accepted that challenge yet, but of course we're on that story, and we'll tell you if it develops. And then this, a fascinating new report by the Center for Immigration Studies has found that helping illegal immigrants have children in this country is a bigger priority for our government than defending the border itself. Steven Camarota is Director of Research at the Center for Immigration Studies, and he joins us tonight. Steven Camarota, thanks a lot for coming on. So, how did you measure this priority?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVEN CAMAROTA, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES",
      "utterance": "Yes, right now, we're just looking at Census Bureau data. They ask people every year, a very large census, several million people in this American Community Survey, if they're immigrants and if they had a kid in the last year. And then you can use the characteristics of people to pick out those who are likely illegal immigrants. That's what the government does to estimate illegal immigrants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMAROTA",
      "utterance": "So when you do that, you find that there are about 300,000 births to illegal immigrants each year at a cost of about $12,000 for the two- thirds that are paid for by taxpayers per right , so about $12,000 is what it costs to have a kid in the United States. That does include some of the care for the child after he's born."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMAROTA",
      "utterance": "And so, if you add all that up, it's about $2.5 billion a year we pay for the births to illegal immigrants, which as you pointed out, is more than we've spent on any kind of new wall construction or barriers at the border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Does that make us good people or masochistic crazy people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMAROTA",
      "utterance": "Well, the thing of it is, a couple of things I would say about that, look if someone's here and they're having a kid, we're going to pay for it, if they don't have insurance and two-thirds of illegal immigrants don't have insurance. So, we're going to pay for it. And since the kids born here and is a U.S. citizen, it may make sense obviously to do that. But the larger question is, as a matter of policy year after year to tolerate this and not try to encourage people to go home and not try to stop them from entering, that does seem masochistic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So just as almost a metaphysical question, if you tolerate something consistently over decades, you're welcoming it, aren't you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMAROTA",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean obviously, if we have a situation where illegal immigrants can get everything from driver's license to access all kinds of benefits on behalf of their children, get in-state college tuition, we have whole jurisdictions that won't cooperate with immigration enforcement. You have to say that it's almost amazing that we don't have more illegal immigrants in the United States--"

      "utterance": "Yes."

Some say he may run for office there. We are going to talk to him about that after the break. Immigration and Russia, by the way, two of the many issues where Washington's interests diverged completely from those of everyone else in America. That's in this new book Ship of Fools. Worth reading, stay tuned."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We vowed to keep you updated on the threat from zombie raccoons, because this show is not just about politics, we've got the whole country's concerns in mind. And of course, zombie raccoons are a threat to national security and the well-being of this nation. Last summer, hundreds of them terrorized Central Park in Manhattan. And now, like so many hipsters living on their parents' time, the zombie raccoons have moved to Brooklyn, the hippest of the Burroughs. Several of these raccoons carry the distemper virus and they have been found in Prospect Park, that is a popular dog walking location for people in skinny jeans. That's terrifying because, while the distemper virus is no threat to humans, it does affect dogs. It's one thing to infect hipsters in Brooklyn, but we draw the line at endangering canines, as you should too. Well, most of Hollywood is deeply concerned about Russia. That follows a memo they presumably were sent the day after Hillary lost the election. One exception though is Steven Seagal. He has received Russian citizenship; he's moved in the other direction pretty aggressively. He is now Russia's Special Envoy to the U.S. He's even talked about running for office there. He recently joined us to tell us about that, plus his new film. All of those came up in this conversation. Here it is."

      "utterance": "Well, I also think it's the best film I have done in over 20 years. It's a Kung-Fu movie, but really it's just the wisdom of what I consider to be a man who rises to the occasion of helping those who are in tremendous need and becomes a reluctant hero. It has all of those different scenes in it that kind of pull the heart strings of the people, the public, and it's got great action and great story, some great characters and great Chinese stars. I am proud of it. It's a wonderful motive."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "utterance": "Well, I said this before, I believe this is a situation where there is a tremendous amount of propaganda against Russia. And in my opinion, most of the things that are being said is fabricated and untrue. And I think that this whole thing with Russian collusion and the President of the United States being involved in Russian collusion, all this - I think it's all a fantasy. And I think that this has more to do with the great divide between the Republicans and democrats and the conservatives and liberals, and how at this point, certain groups will do anything in the world, they don't care if it's legal, illegal, immoral, they don't care, anything to win this battle where their agenda triumphs. And so, I really think, and I've said this before, we are at a tipping point in the United States of America where, if people don't realize that Republicans and Democrats really at one point have to start to work together in a more civil fashion and agree to disagree and understand that the truth and civility will really, really help the process of true politics instead of destroying our nation."

There are real reasons, it's all explained in \"Ship of Fools.\" That's the thesis of the book, it's at your local book store and also online. Order it, if you want to know what actually happened. That's about it for us tonight. It's an honor to do this show for an hour at 8 pm. We'll be back tomorrow at 8 pm. We are the sworn enemy, we are not joking, of lying, pomposity, smugness and group think. TDR if you can figure it out, good luck with that. Good night from Washington.
