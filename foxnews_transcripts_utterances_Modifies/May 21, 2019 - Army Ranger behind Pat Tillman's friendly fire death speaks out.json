There is sound from him today in which he suggested that he would go to court. My sense is if Nadler goes to court to try to force Don McGahn and others in the inner circle of the Trump White House to testify, he will lose. Executive privilege is asserted here by the -- by the president is not an unlimited privilege. It -- but if it applies to anybody and the courts have repeatedly, including the Supreme Court recognized that such a privilege does exist, if it applies to anyone, you would think it would apply to the White House counsel. I don't think -- I'm not sure President Trump is on very strong ground when he is refusing to or trying to block the turning over of financial documents from some third party. That's another matter. But, when it comes to the testimony of Don McGahn and Hope Hicks, and I guess, others that have now been subpoenaed, who were from his inner circle in the White House, I think he's on pretty strong ground.

And his religion tells him -- his interpretation of his religion tells him to hate all those including but not limited to America who disagrees with him. And we just have to deal with that. Now, the Obama administration thought that by making a nuclear deal with the Ayatollah, we could somehow change his behavior. As a result of that deal, the Ayatollah received between $50 and $150 billion, that's nine zeros. He didn't change his behavior.

And after graduating ranger school Pat Tillman was deployed to Afghanistan but was killed less than five months into his tour. Initially the army said he was killed by enemy combatants but the investigation revealed it was friendly fire. And Tillman's fellow ranger Steve Elliott thinks he might have fired the fatal shot and here is why. After an army Humvee broke down in the mountains, Tillman's platoon was ordered to divide up. But as the two groups traversed the rugged steep terrain, they struggled to communicate with each other. Then the second group was ambushed and Tillman's group scaled a ridge line to come back and help fellow rangers under attack. But squad leader in Steve Elliott's armored vehicle misidentified an allied Afghan soldier next to Pat Tillman as the enemy and open fire killing that Afghan. That prompted Elliott and two other rangers to open fire on what they thought were shadowy images. It turned out to be Pat Tillman and 19-year- old Brian O'Neil. O'Neil wasn't hit and the army has either never determined or never released who actually shot Tillman. But Steve Elliott and Ranger Trevor Alders were the most widely suspected. Although Steve Elliott's weapon was an M 240 Bravo machine gun and many believe the shots that killed Tillman were too precise to have come from a machine gunner, but Elliott says he was trained to fire his automatic weapon with the precision of a rifle. Steve Elliott does not know if his rounds killed Pat Tillman but says it would be disingenuous for him to say they didn't. Elliott says he struggles with guilt every day and has suffered PTSD, though this has also brought him closer to God and his family. Martha?",

And it -- and it's the kind of thing one would think would be occasion of some sadness. Life is being taken, the possibility of a birth has been -- has been aborted. And while -- you know, you might be relieved and grateful to have the right to do it under certain circumstances, it's not something that one would think you would want to celebrate. And one wonders where we have come as a country when you were cheering the idea of someone having an abortion, or cheering a politician for saying that she's had one.

What we're hearing about is people who are saying as Pete Buttigieg unmistakably did the other night without actually saying it that he couldn't think of a time in a pregnancy of a woman when an abortion wouldn't be appropriate right up until the day of birth. That is what we are looking at here among many of these Democratic candidates. And I think for the national audience, that's a risky position."

      "speaker": "HUME",

Will he go to the contempt route and attempt to start -- you know, impeachment proceedings with the, you know, the leadership would have to go along with that, or will he go to court? There is sound from him today in which he suggested that he would go to court. My sense is if Nadler goes to court to try to force Don McGahn and others in the inner circle of the Trump White House to testify, he will lose. Executive privilege is asserted here by the -- by the president is not an unlimited privilege. It -- but if it applies to anybody and the courts have repeatedly, including the Supreme Court recognized that such a privilege does exist, if it applies to anyone, you would think it would apply to the White House counsel. I don't think -- I'm not sure President Trump is on very strong ground when he is refusing to or trying to block the turning over of financial documents from some third party. That's another matter. But, when it comes to the testimony of Don McGahn and Hope Hicks, and I guess, others that have now been subpoenaed, who were from his inner circle in the White House, I think he's on pretty strong ground. I'm not sure the Democrats will win on that in court. In fact, I think, they probably won't."

Is the wording here. No -- now, you have yes, 42 percent. No, 50 percent.

The more likely it is that we are first going to go to court. And then, if he refuses court orders, he will be impeached. Just like one of those articles of impeachment over Richard Nixon was about the president resisting congressional oversight. And obstructing congressional oversight, I hope that Congressman Gaetz will agree that Congress has an absolute right to perform reasonable oversight over the president of the United States. And the president of the United States does not get to choose what is or is not reasonable. That is up to the majority in the Congress. And I'm sure that the Congressman, a William and Mary graduate, would absolutely agree with that."

There has to be a reasonable legislative purpose for oversight to occur. And what's really instructive for context here is that there is a secret memo among the major democratic chairman of the committees that lay out their attempt to harass the president on a variety of issues that don't inform on a legislative decision. Just take today. We had an empty chair in front of us because Democrats have an empty agenda. They don't have bills to bring forward to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, to deal with the crisis of illegal immigration on our border. And so, instead, we have these show hearings where we stare at an empty chair. And I would hope that people all over the country would expect more of the Congress than this type of coordinated harassment."

But you know, I guess, into some extent, the White House looks at this and says, you know when is enough, enough, and can we move past this at any given point or is it just going to go on and on and on with more subpoenas and more investigations?"

He's -- you know, trying to find some ways to push back on that now.

The truth of the matter is that Iran is a cancer. It's a cancer on the Middle East, it's a cancer on the world, not the people of Iran but their leadership, the supreme leader, the Ayatollah. He -- I don't -- he's not mixed up, he's not confused, it's not a question that his mama or daddy didn't love him enough, he just hates America. And his religion tells him -- his interpretation of his religion tells him to hate all those including but not limited to America who disagrees with him. And we just have to deal with that. Now, the Obama administration thought that by making a nuclear deal with the Ayatollah, we could somehow change his behavior. As a result of that deal, the Ayatollah received between $50 and $150 billion, that's nine zeros. He didn't change his behavior. He used that money to export terrorism, supporting Hezbollah, supporting Hamas. President Trump has responded appropriately. He send -- he send him with sanctions.

And so, if you are undocumented, it's hard to tell who is an illegal immigrant and who isn't. And he is not alone in this. you've got New York Mayor de Blasio has made such the same pledge in New York City. He is going to turn New York into a magnet for illegal immigrants who are coming to get their free healthcare. And so, I'm a little bit perplexed by some of these Democrats who are so up in arms about the idea of President Trump's suggestion that he is going to release illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities.

If you look at Justice Kavanaugh's record up to 12 years of service on the D.C. circuit, I mean, he had a -- he has a record where he has the judicial philosophy that President Trump campaigned on that he was going to appoint judges like Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. Those are the types of judges that President Trump was going to put on the bench."

Roe versus Wade whether you like it or you don't like it, it is precedent of at Supreme Court, it's been reaffirmed many times. Judges are bound by precedent. Especially lower court judges.

But it came crashing down in '04 when the army ranger was shot and killed in a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan. Now the soldier who is believed to have fired those shots is opening up about his struggles that he has battled in the 15 years since that tragic day. Steve Elliott joins me exclusively in moments. But first, Trace Gallagher with the back story."

      "utterance": "Martha, Pat Tillman and his younger brother Kevin signed up for the army in response to the attacks in 9/11. After basic training both were accepted into the Elite Army Rangers. And after graduating ranger school Pat Tillman was deployed to Afghanistan but was killed less than five months into his tour. Initially the army said he was killed by enemy combatants but the investigation revealed it was friendly fire. And Tillman's fellow ranger Steve Elliott thinks he might have fired the fatal shot and here is why. After an army Humvee broke down in the mountains, Tillman's platoon was ordered to divide up. But as the two groups traversed the rugged steep terrain, they struggled to communicate with each other. Then the second group was ambushed and Tillman's group scaled a ridge line to come back and help fellow rangers under attack. But squad leader in Steve Elliott's armored vehicle misidentified an allied Afghan soldier next to Pat Tillman as the enemy and open fire killing that Afghan. That prompted Elliott and two other rangers to open fire on what they thought were shadowy images. It turned out to be Pat Tillman and 19-year- old Brian O'Neil. O'Neil wasn't hit and the army has either never determined or never released who actually shot Tillman. But Steve Elliott and Ranger Trevor Alders were the most widely suspected. Although Steve Elliott's weapon was an M 240 Bravo machine gun and many believe the shots that killed Tillman were too precise to have come from a machine gunner, but Elliott says he was trained to fire his automatic weapon with the precision of a rifle. Steve Elliott does not know if his rounds killed Pat Tillman but says it would be disingenuous for him to say they didn't. Elliott says he struggles with guilt every day and has suffered PTSD, though this has also brought him closer to God and his family. Martha?"

I knew that rounds from my weapon definitively hit the radio operator Jay Lane and I know that that my rounds wounded him. And so, a lot of it was about the shocks certainly of losing Pat but then also in the debriefings that occurred in FAB in the coming days. Kind of the horror of all of those that we could have lost in addition because there's many others in the squad that were also right there with him."

And he was at a part where my name would been mentioned. And it was obvious he hadn't -- I mean, you don't -- there's a million Steven Elliott and you wouldn't assume that that's the one that's working right next to you. The next day I went band back and I said, you know, I'm going to feel weird if at some points you feel like maybe -- so, I was just like, I'm just going to tell you but it was exactly that sort of thing where you felt like you were a marked man."

We have to get to the points of trauma which is war. And we have to stop conflating this broken idea of masculinity with the fact that we send young men and women to do things that their hearts and minds may be trained to do but have ramifications and can carry wounds. And so, it doesn't make you tougher to go to war and have to shoot people. That's not -- that's not a masculine exercise. It's a sad exercise in our world.
