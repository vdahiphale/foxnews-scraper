What's really going on with the ballot box in Florida? Tonight, Angle investigates the corruption and dirty dealings and tells you why the GOP should unite to fight it. And lawyer to the porn stars, you heard Hannity talking about Michael Avenatti and some legal troubles of his own. And Michelle Obama taking some sidle cheap shots at President Trump. Raymond Arroyo has got it all in the seen and unseen. Plus, how will they fight the new Democratic majority in congress? Republican majority leader Kevin McCarthy and whipped Steve Scalise are here exclusively. And former independent counsel Ken Starr and Andy McCarthy are here as well. Lots of legal developments to unpack, but first, Snipes and swipes at the ballot box. That is the focus of tonight's Angle.  The integrity of our elections is imperiled tonight. We may be witnessing yet another in a series of stolen elections in Florida. Democrats are experts at pulling swifties (ph) at the ballot box, you know, it is widely believed that they resorted to voter fraud in Illinois and Texas to tilt the election of John F Kennedy over Nixon in 1960. And they may be up to their old tricks again. Ballot irregularities in Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida are front and center. The President, of course, has been very vocal about what he believes is happening there.",

Things are so bad in Palm Beach that Governor Rick Scott, who was in a tight Senate race there, sued the county election supervisor, Susan Bucher. The judge determine that she had a legal withheld over voted and under voted ballots from the canvassing board. And worst she has refused to allow public scrutiny of the ballots.

And in May, a Judge found Brenda Snipes guilty of illegally destroying ballots during a primary election in 2016. But in August, a court found her guilty of secretly opening mail in ballots, which is illegal in her state. But on Friday, Governor Scott won his lawsuit against Snipes.

The Miami Herald reports that an election worker found bags of uncounted early ballots in the Broward County elections office. Snipes also mingled rejected the provisional ballots with the accepted ones and then she proceeded to count them all in the official vote tally Neato. Now a recount is underway where the counters must discern the intent of the voters if there is a mark on the ballot here or there.  My friends, this is a complete travesty that cannot be permitted to change the outcome of this election. It sadly is not restricted to the sunshine state. We are going to show you what some Democrats are trying in Georgia in just moments. So what is next? I think as the Kavanaugh fight demonstrated, the Republicans must stand united to expose the maleficent and the fraud of the left. Because when we do, we usually win. We cannot allow this flouting of the rules and procedures by corrupt officials or political hacks, cannot let it stand. If we allow this to go unchecked, it will undermine our democracy, and like a contagion it's going to spread across the nation. 18 years? Can you believe it, since Bush v Gore? It's absolutely unforgivable that we are still dealing with these type of issues.  It is time for the Department of Justice to step in and do a top to bottom investigation regarding why these issues still persist. If necessary, people are going to have to go to jail. There has to be repercussions for willful fraudulent defiance of electoral laws. If this isn't cleaned up, I'm telling you, the GOP can kiss any hopes of restoring their majority, let alone a Presidential victory. They can kiss it bye-bye in 2020. And that is The Angle.   Joining me now, Richard Denapoli, former chairman of the Broward County GOP and current state committee man and also a recount monitor, so he is actually in the room while the votes are being tabulated in Broward. And also with me, Blaise Ingoglia, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. Richard, let me start with you tonight. Give me some insight in to what you have uncovered as you have observed what's been going on in your home state, estate we all love so much. What have you found?",

There are so many irregularities in Broward County that all confidence in her is lost as a fair arbiter in the election.

Nothing more than just \"follow the law.\" Supervisor Snipes then went to court asking them to lift that order and we had to go back to get them to put that order back in place for this election, but by her asking a judge to lift the order and all the order said was just to follow the law, that goes to show you the mind-set of a supervisor Snipes. She clearly does not want to follow the law, she wants to do what she wants to do, and what she is doing is not transparent. She is doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes outside the public eye and that is eroding the confidence in her abilities and the electoral process that you are referring to.  Here is the problem and this is the big problem. There are so many problems going on in Broward and Palm Beach counties. This is where the liberal media gets it wrong. If they keep on saying if there is no evidence of voter fraud, when I am asking is show me that there is no voter fraud going on at all, because of all of these inconsistencies, if there were fraudsters that wanted to fraud in the election all they would have to do is head to Broward or Palm Beach.",

Congressman McCarthy, I want to talk to you about this California deal, because I've been talking to a couple of committee people in California and they are enraged, because they felt like, they were outspent in that state.

What's really going on with the ballot box in Florida? Tonight, Angle investigates the corruption and dirty dealings and tells you why the GOP should unite to fight it. And lawyer to the porn stars, you heard Hannity talking about Michael Avenatti and some legal troubles of his own. And Michelle Obama taking some sidle cheap shots at President Trump. Raymond Arroyo has got it all in the seen and unseen. Plus, how will they fight the new Democratic majority in congress? Republican majority leader Kevin McCarthy and whipped Steve Scalise are here exclusively. And former independent counsel Ken Starr and Andy McCarthy are here as well. Lots of legal developments to unpack, but first, Snipes and swipes at the ballot box. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. The integrity of our elections is imperiled tonight. We may be witnessing yet another in a series of stolen elections in Florida. Democrats are experts at pulling swifties (ph) at the ballot box, you know, it is widely believed that they resorted to voter fraud in Illinois and Texas to tilt the election of John F Kennedy over Nixon in 1960. And they may be up to their old tricks again. Ballot irregularities in Palm Beach and Broward County in Florida are front and center.

Things are so bad in Palm Beach that Governor Rick Scott, who was in a tight Senate race there, sued the county election supervisor, Susan Bucher. The judge determine that she had a legal withheld over voted and under voted ballots from the canvassing board. And worst she has refused to allow public scrutiny of the ballots.

And in May, a Judge found Brenda Snipes guilty of illegally destroying ballots during a primary election in 2016. But in August, a court found her guilty of secretly opening mail in ballots, which is illegal in her state. But on Friday, Governor Scott won his lawsuit against Snipes. The court found that in this election, she continued to discover new ballots. She was found in violation of the state's public records law and has been ordered to release information to Governor Scott. So far? She hasn't complied with the order."

The Miami Herald reports that an election worker found bags of uncounted early ballots in the Broward County elections office. Snipes also mingled rejected the provisional ballots with the accepted ones and then she proceeded to count them all in the official vote tally Neato. Now a recount is underway where the counters must discern the intent of the voters if there is a mark on the ballot here or there. My friends, this is a complete travesty that cannot be permitted to change the outcome of this election. It sadly is not restricted to the sunshine state. We are going to show you what some Democrats are trying in Georgia in just moments. So what is next? I think as the Kavanaugh fight demonstrated, the Republicans must stand united to expose the maleficent and the fraud of the left. Because when we do, we usually win. We cannot allow this flouting of the rules and procedures by corrupt officials or political hacks, cannot let it stand. If we allow this to go unchecked, it will undermine our democracy, and like a contagion it's going to spread across the nation. 18 years? Can you believe it, since Bush v Gore? It's absolutely unforgivable that we are still dealing with these type of issues. It is time for the Department of Justice to step in and do a top to bottom investigation regarding why these issues still persist. If necessary, people are going to have to go to jail. There has to be repercussions for willful fraudulent defiance of electoral laws. If this isn't cleaned up, I'm telling you, the GOP can kiss any hopes of restoring their majority, let alone a Presidential victory. They can kiss it bye-bye in 2020. And that is The Angle. Joining me now, Richard Denapoli, former chairman of the Broward County GOP and current state committee man and also a recount monitor, so he is actually in the room while the votes are being tabulated in Broward.

One after another, she is faced multiple lawsuits over the years, she has illegally destroyed ballots, she has not followed the law. There are so many irregularities in Broward County that all confidence in her is lost as a fair arbiter in the election. You know just myself on Sunday night, and Avis employee from a rental agency at the airport contacted me to let me know that there was a provisional ballot box left in a rental car at the airport which contained unmarked ballots in it.

We got an order from a Judge just telling to basically to follow the law. Nothing more than just \"follow the law.\" Supervisor Snipes then went to court asking them to lift that order and we had to go back to get them to put that order back in place for this election, but by her asking a judge to lift the order and all the order said was just to follow the law, that goes to show you the mind-set of a supervisor Snipes. She clearly does not want to follow the law, she wants to do what she wants to do, and what she is doing is not transparent. She is doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes outside the public eye and that is eroding the confidence in her abilities and the electoral process that you are referring to. Here is the problem and this is the big problem. There are so many problems going on in Broward and Palm Beach counties. This is where the liberal media gets it wrong. If they keep on saying if there is no evidence of voter fraud, when I am asking is show me that there is no voter fraud going on at all, because of all of these inconsistencies, if there were fraudsters that wanted to fraud in the election all they would have to do is head to Broward or Palm Beach."

The 205 previously open provisional ballots are they included in the numbers sent to the state or not ask the reporter. Yes, they are Pettis responded.

It was such a bad job and such incompetence that they could not tell which ones were legal, which ones were illegal, so they were just, like, you know what, let's just throw them altogether. That is the problem. That is one of the reasons why we, I, the Florida GOP, we have been fighting so hard for transparency.

DAVID BOSSIE, “LET TRUMP BE TRUMP”, AUTHOR: They are doing to Brian Kemp what they did to President Trump right from the first day. He is not a legitimate President. He is not our president. He did not win a rightful election. Therefore, for the last two years, they do not respect him, they bash him, they try to further delegitimize him.

Wee this -- I look at this as potentially a stress test for how they want to go ahead and learn from this, even though they will not win everything, they stress test for 2020 so that they can between now and then figure out how to manipulate, how to through litigation and through backdoor maneuvers win these races by stealing them in 2020."

Then he goes to the Disney park, puts it in front of the train station. They warned him, because they have a policy, no flags or banners or signs that incite a crowd. He tested it again this week. He went on Splash Mountain, held a banner above his head as he went down the falls. You see him there. And they escorted him off the property, banned him from ever returning. He says it's because of the content of the sign. The truth of the matter is they do have this standing policy. My advice? Where a wear a MAGA hat. Keep your politics in the political realm, keep entertainment and fun where it belongs. Now, some people have problems with this, Laura, like Michelle Obama, who has embarked on a 13-city book tour to promote her new memoir.

I understand Judge Napolitano's point that the statute is from 1998, but the statute is not what people are complaining about. It's whether this application of the statute is constitutional or not.

There are repercussions, and the law is uniformly enforced. You have less illegal immigration, just the way it works. So your name has been floated as a possible replacement for Nielsen should he she leave her post at DHS. Are you interested?"

And in one of the greatest honors of my life has been to work for this president, and I've worked for six of them, no one has done more for border security and immigration enforcement and law enforcement and the rule of law than President Trump. Thank God he's the guy sitting in the chair right now, especially in these times."

Again, I salute this president because he's doing the right thing for this country. He's keeping his promises. And I can tell you the morale at ICE, the morale at Border Patrol has never been higher than it has been under --"

I mean when it is raining and you are cold, it is when you are in a position where people are showing a lack of respect for each other elsewhere, and you and your team are holding strong, you know. Nothing can change it. Nothing can change it."
