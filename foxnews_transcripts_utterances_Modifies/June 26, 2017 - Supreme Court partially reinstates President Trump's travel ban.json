      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she bought her beach house from Barbie in Malibu, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" The Supreme Court, those of the people on the left there, just OK'd a version of the travel ban. The gist: If you're from one of six countries with no connection to someone here, you can't come. It's a start, I'm OK with it. What I'm not OK with are the knee-jerks who call any part of this ban bigoted.  If you're shrieking that this is somehow hateful, then it's an emotional and not an intellectual response. Because on paper, it's merely a pause that allows a review of processing visa applicants from lawless lands. Although the ACLU calls it a Muslim ban, which is kind of weird considering that many Muslim majority countries that are not on the list. Why conflate high-risk radicals with all Muslims? That bigotry, ACLU, plain and simple.  What's just as bad: Those who criticize this pause without offering a single alternative but hugs and hashtags. It's my only question: Do you have anything better or do you just like to complain? Those are two questions.  It must be great to be in the media and shoot everything down because no one is driving vans into your well-protected buildings. So maybe we should ask why a travel ban now? It's a reaction to inaction, the result of one party being more obsessed with Celsius than ISIS. And so this decision is just a start. Just one tool in a set that's needed to fight terror. For we must keep thinking about the next bad thing. Because there's always a next bad thing: a dirty bomb, a power grid attack, bioterror -- stuff that can make 9/11 look small. It's no fun to think about which is maybe why only one side thinks about it.  All right. Kimberly, you are the former prosecutor here. Basically the Supreme Court slapped down the lower court, said you guys suck.",

Now, of course they have to hear the full, you know, caces when they come in October, but nevertheless, this bodes very well for the president's executive order being able to do this, being within his constitutional authority in this preview which we have said, and I said from the beginning about this as did many of the other legal scholars that in fact the courts had overstepped their bounds, they were considering things that were improper in terms of campaign statements, tweets, et cetera and trying to use that and to weave it into the reasoning to say, this is why it to be struck down because they were trying to get into the mindset of a president.  That's not what their job is to do. They shouldn't be legislating from the bench, they shouldn't be an activist, of course, the fourth or the ninth. And I believe the Supreme Court did their job. By actually being just passionate about it, reviewing it strictly based on legal principles and constitutional authority and came up with this, which I think really you look at it in terms of like forecasting what's going to happen in the fall, they're going to uphold this and it is priority.",

So, the court as a whole said, this is right. So what Kimberly said, that's their position. I find it surprising because I think there's a huge constitutional issue about religious rights and about discriminating against any group of people based on religious rights.  But they brought into the idea that this is a national security issue and I think that's what President Trump should have been arguing from the beginning, but now the court is saying, hey, OK, so if it's a national security issue, finish you r review, you wanted 90 days, you got it.

I think they have to give Trump this nickname too because this guy always looks like he's down, whether it was after the conventions, whether it was, you know, after the access Hollywood tape, you know, in the Comey memos come out, you know, the first couple travel bans get knocked down.  ObamaCare repeal vote gets pulled. And then he always come back, he's like Muhammed Ali, he rope-a-dopes these people and then he comes back with a big election win or he comes back with a great state of the union addressed of the successful ObamaCare repeal vote. And now the travel ban vote. So, you know, I think this is probably one of the most significant victories of Trump's young presidency and it's going to carry a lot of momentum into the summer. We all know how it got there.  These left wing judge shops, they get into a circuit where you would peel it up to the ninth or the fourth. And then they, you know, rule on a tweet instead of the merit. And it's a pause so they can get the extreme vetting procedures in place and, you know, I think that they were viewed in September and I would expect that the court rules that it stands. Because the president in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president of the United States broad authority and discretion to regulate our immigration.",

Because there's very little trust in all of our major institutions anymore but the Supreme Court being Supreme Court being one of them. The other thing that has held - the other thing I thought was interesting is that you have a signal from the newest Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch, and which he is saying -- he basically would have thrown the whole thing out and said, the president has the authority to do it and his executive orders are going to stand. That actually could be a significant precedent not just for President Trump but for future presidents to say that, OK, well then, I believe that I have that significance.

And it also going to be mute because at this point the president can declare victory, he can finished his extreme vetting proposal, get that policy spent and the Supreme Court has an artful dodge here led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts to say, we're never going to have to deal with this, so let's give the president a win and then I'm going to split this baby and not worry about it in October.",

But once they get health care passed and I do think it will get passed, they got tax reform and there's going to do a lot of Democrats who live in states that have big elections coming up in 2018, but also have companies who are telling them like we absolutely need this in order to be competitive. And I think that they should want to work with him on that, and I also believe that President Trump is willing to do comprehensive immigration reform. He's going to be able to show that he has done border enforcement, one, because the wall, well, may go andget the wall, but let's just say that he's been able to see number of people crossing over has decreased. Case law will probably pass. Sanctuary cities will probably pass. It's got a win in the Supreme Court. So he will be able to tell his people on the right, look at all these things I've done to enforce border security. Now, why don't we go about doing the bill to do immigration reform?

What I'm not OK with are the knee-jerks who call any part of this ban bigoted. If you're shrieking that this is somehow hateful, then it's an emotional and not an intellectual response. Because on paper, it's merely a pause that allows a review of processing visa applicants from lawless lands. Although the ACLU calls it a Muslim ban, which is kind of weird considering that many Muslim majority countries that are not on the list. Why conflate high-risk radicals with all Muslims? That bigotry, ACLU, plain and simple."

Those are two questions. It must be great to be in the media and shoot everything down because no one is driving vans into your well-protected buildings. So maybe we should ask why a travel ban now? It's a reaction to inaction, the result of one party being more obsessed with Celsius than ISIS."

Now, of course they have to hear the full, you know, caces when they come in October, but nevertheless, this bodes very well for the president's executive order being able to do this, being within his constitutional authority in this preview which we have said, and I said from the beginning about this as did many of the other legal scholars that in fact the courts had overstepped their bounds, they were considering things that were improper in terms of campaign statements, tweets, et cetera and trying to use that and to weave it into the reasoning to say, this is why it to be struck down because they were trying to get into the mindset of a president. That's not what their job is to do. They shouldn't be legislating from the bench, they shouldn't be an activist, of course, the fourth or the ninth. And I believe the Supreme Court did their job. By actually being just passionate about it, reviewing it strictly based on legal principles and constitutional authority and came up with this, which I think really you look at it in terms of like forecasting what's going to happen in the fall, they're going to uphold this and it is priority."

So, the court as a whole said, this is right. So what Kimberly said, that's their position. I find it surprising because I think there's a huge constitutional issue about religious rights and about discriminating against any group of people based on religious rights. But they brought into the idea that this is a national security issue and I think that's what President Trump should have been arguing from the beginning, but now the court is saying, hey, OK, so if it's a national security issue, finish you r review, you wanted 90 days, you got it.

I think they have to give Trump this nickname too because this guy always looks like he's down, whether it was after the conventions, whether it was, you know, after the access Hollywood tape, you know, in the Comey memos come out, you know, the first couple travel bans get knocked down. ObamaCare repeal vote gets pulled. And then he always come back, he's like Muhammed Ali, he rope-a-dopes these people and then he comes back with a big election win or he comes back with a great state of the union addressed of the successful ObamaCare repeal vote. And now the travel ban vote. So, you know, I think this is probably one of the most significant victories of Trump's young presidency and it's going to carry a lot of momentum into the summer. We all know how it got there. These left wing judge shops, they get into a circuit where you would peel it up to the ninth or the fourth. And then they, you know, rule on a tweet instead of the merit. And it's a pause so they can get the extreme vetting procedures in place and, you know, I think that they were viewed in September and I would expect that the court rules that it stands. Because the president in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president of the United States broad authority and discretion to regulate our immigration."

So, the Supreme Court makes the decision and everyone goes, oh, OK. Thank you for the clarity, this is what we needed and I would hope that if they had gone against President Trump that he was said, OK, then back to the drawing board. Because there's very little trust in all of our major institutions anymore but the Supreme Court being Supreme Court being one of them. The other thing that has held - the other thing I thought was interesting is that you have a signal from the newest Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch, and which he is saying -- he basically would have thrown the whole thing out and said, the president has the authority to do it and his executive orders are going to stand. That actually could be a significant precedent not just for President Trump but for future presidents to say that, OK, well then, I believe that I have that significance. The other thing on Ruth Bader Ginsburg on whether she refuses, so as I understood today and had to be reminded, only Supreme Court justices can recuse themselves."

Look at that. And if she doesn't, it doesn't matter because the majority of opinion is going to be for the president. And it also going to be mute because at this point the president can declare victory, he can finished his extreme vetting proposal, get that policy spent and the Supreme Court has an artful dodge here led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts to say, we're never going to have to deal with this, so let's give the president a win and then I'm going to split this baby and not worry about it in October."

But, nevertheless, when he took that podium and many other times when he took the podium subsequent top that, he never mentioned anything about it. If it was such important and significant that we now hear in fact that it was, he should have said and done something about it and I think that's where the democrats are having a hard time with him as well. The argument is, well, listen, this looks like this was a done deal for Hillary Clinton.

They are finally having a choice that they deserve. And once you have choice, guess what? To borrow a phrase from Juan, you have competition. You have different products. You might get catastrophic health insurance at some point and then you deal with the smaller things, but the point is the people leaving the exchanges are leaving because they can leave. And if you don't want to leave, you don't have to leave. That's the point of this. And by the way, the 22 million, totaling exaggerated. We know he CBO exaggerates.

What would you like? What is really troubling you here? OK, we address this, we address that, we expand Medicaid. OK, is that going to work for you? Bottom line is, why wouldn't we want choice? These are the same people that are always marching for a choice and now that they have a choice, oh, you're bad, you gave us a choice. It really makes no sense and it's so hypocritical and it's completely inconsistent with what their supposed viewpoints are of wanting choice and wanting independence and not being forced, mandated, penalized, or punished into purchasing something.

But once they get health care passed and I do think it will get passed, they got tax reform and there's going to do a lot of Democrats who live in states that have big elections coming up in 2018, but also have companies who are telling them like we absolutely need this in order to be competitive. And I think that they should want to work with him on that, and I also believe that President Trump is willing to do comprehensive immigration reform. He's going to be able to show that he has done border enforcement, one, because the wall, well, may go andget the wall, but let's just say that he's been able to see number of people crossing over has decreased. Case law will probably pass. Sanctuary cities will probably pass. It's got a win in the Supreme Court. So he will be able to tell his people on the right, look at all these things I've done to enforce border security. Now, why don't we go about doing the bill to do immigration reform? I think Juan is agreeing with me, which is very interesting. So I think that the Democrats should throw out the playbook. The resisting is not going to work.

And I think that's different because, you know, you had a tea party movement, which was primarily made up of, you know, middle-class workers that were concerned about policies and they went out and they peacefully assembled and they worked the phones and they, you know, achieved success at the ballot box. Now, the resistance, they're burning things, hanging nasty signs, they are out of the mainstream. The people are just going to regret that which is also one last thing."

However, none of those people have ever said that about the number one threat to our existence. And what exactly is an all out war from Rob Reiner? Is he going to load up his Prius with water balloons and write a really scathing piece on the \"Huffington Post\" and then order a pie and get all the crust in his beard? Here's the problem with the left that the right has never had. You can't force people to care about something. You can only persuade it. The problem with the heart of the left is that you must bend to my belief or you are damned because you are evil not wrong so you have to agree with me or you are damned. Whereas you have this -- I'll call him a Trump character. President Trump is a character who came on the scene with one goal in mind, to persuade. He shows up to persuade. He has rallies. He gets people involved. He's a salesman. He persuades. The left says you are going to die. Everybody is going -- these people are all murders. They're trying to force you to believe something that is deeply flawed because they cannot persuade."

The Trump white house also says that the U.S. now aware of this, will have a heavy price put on President Assad and his military if another chemical attack is to occur. Jesse."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, he's drawing a red line and we know he enforces redlines because we saw with those tomahawk missiles did the last time they perpetrated this kind of heinous abuse of their own civilians. Also, great intelligence by the intelligence agencies to be able to catch this and then be able to put a warning out so that he doesn't do this. This is a humanitarian statement and warning coming from the White House. Also from the same day, the travel ban was partially upheld too, one of those countries at note, Syria. So, I think it underscores the complexity of the region, you know, we're there to fight ISIS but you got this thug in power that's trying to gas his own people and you know, he's Russia's little pet and very complex. I think we're the right thing by issuing this warning."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well I think that this is a public -- basically goading Russia and saying, you're on notice. We are telling the world that we know about this, so you can't do that funny business you did a while ago where you said, oh, we had no idea, which was totally fake. So now the president is saying, we know, so now you know, even if you would pretend that you didn't, and if it happens, you are responsible. I mean, this is getting a little bit dicey because you have the Congress say, what are we doing here? Is this a proxy war that we're fighting? But the other -- let's not forget, Assad also killed innocent people and children in a lot of different ways and so despite is worth having and I think that we're on the right side of it but we have to make a commitment to find it all the way through."

    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "She's absolutely right, but we're on the right side of it. We got on the right side very late in the game unfortunately. I just say that because now we're put in his position that is very difficult but also its, you know, really going to strain and further our relations with Russia and de-confliction and that is a big problem. So now, I think it's very important what Dana said, is that the president is putting them on note -- Russia on notice, the world on notice, Syria on notice because one of the other things that Putin said was this was a total hoax, this was not something that Assad did, he did not in fact gas his own people, right."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

You can do something twice as damaging or you can go, yes, you can do something more. But what this is about is basically sending a message that we are here to eliminate ISIS, don't mess that up. I know what you guys want to do, you want to chop up all this stuff and you want to get it -- just wait a minute. Let us eliminate this and with then we'll figure this stuff out. But right now, just hold your horses and stop being such jerks or we'll kill you."

One of them, Loumonth Jack, Jr., who was in desperate need of a new heart -- and this past Father's Day, her dad Bill, cycled 1,400 miles from Wisconsin to Louisiana to raise awareness about organ donation and to meet with the man who now has Abby's life saving organ. It was a powerful reunion as you can see right here. One organ donor can save as many as eight lives."
