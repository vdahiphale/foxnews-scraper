So it is better, faster and less expensive, other than that, who knows. Thank you all for being here with a great stretch of wall. See where it is going. This is going all the way up. Much of it is like this. We have different walls. We have some that are holding back water so obviously this doesn't do that trick.   But we have a lot of good concrete divisions that hold back various parcels of water. We have a lot of water going up. But this is, I would say, the majority would be in this style and some of it is 30 feet, some is 15 feet, some of it is 12 feet, depending on the area. Much of it is reinforced heavily and very, very hard to climb. If you want to climb that, it's pretty sharp up on top, too. If you want to climb that, you deserve whatever you can get, but it is a very, very hard. It is meant anti-climb. It is called anti-climb.

This is 30-foot border walls that are pillar bollards and you can see through it. For us, it is a huge advantage to see what is on the other side because before with the old landing mat, we could not see the adversary. We couldn't see the threat that was on that side.   We would get rocked constantly. We would get items thrown at us everyday. With this 30-foot wall, we haven't had those types of incidents. Just here in these two miles, our assaults have dropped by 65 percent, just in this area. That is very important to me as a chief because I don't want our agents hurt. I want them out here protecting the country and doing their job. In these two miles, just illegal entries alone, have dropped by 75 percent just in this area.

Anyone who would suggest that we do not have a crisis on our southern border is being intellectually dishonest to the point of being dishonest with malice. We have humanitarian crisis, which is very clear and compelling. We have a compelling crisis of public safety with human trafficking, drug trafficking, sex trafficking coming up through the border.  This is not make-believe. This is something that we live with every day as border sheriffs. So we applaud the efforts of the current administration to secure the border. It is long overdue and those who would argue that we do not have a crisis on our southern border need to come to my part of the world and see what is really going on. We interdicted 58 pounds of methamphetamine just the other day and last month, 13,000 fentanyl pills. My deputies recover about 100 bodies a year in the deserts of Pima County, Arizona.

Case in point the fact that the Chicago Department of Law which is under the mayor's purview stood up and said, OK, well then, you're going to pay us back. They are absolutely flexing their muscles with how best they can try to disgorge him, used that word again in the best way that they know how. Look you owe us this money because you were lying. And in terms of that he was charged and then indicted on 16 counts and that deal was totally non- reflective of how the criminal justice system was playing out. I absolutely love this and note that the Department of Law in Chicago that's almost 300 attorneys, they do litigation, they do transactional, they do legislative stuff. It's a humongous representation of the city of Chicago. I love that they are standing up right now and it will be successful.

So it is better, faster and less expensive, other than that, who knows. Thank you all for being here with a great stretch of wall. See where it is going. This is going all the way up. Much of it is like this. We have different walls. We have some that are holding back water so obviously this doesn't do that trick. But we have a lot of good concrete divisions that hold back various parcels of water. We have a lot of water going up. But this is, I would say, the majority would be in this style and some of it is 30 feet, some is 15 feet, some of it is 12 feet, depending on the area. Much of it is reinforced heavily and very, very hard to climb. If you want to climb that, it's pretty sharp up on top, too. If you want to climb that, you deserve whatever you can get, but it is a very, very hard. It is meant anti-climb. It is called anti-climb. So, it's a great wall and it looks -- I think it looks fantastic. Very see- through, so you are able to see the other side which is a very important element, OK."

So they want the wall down in San Diego and we did it. And then you hear they don't want the wall. They want the wall if you ever took it down. They wanted that one so badly and we did a great job. We stopped everybody, virtually -- actually everybody from coming over. It's a tremendous success, but California is always the first one to complain. And I don't mean the people of California, they are fantastic. I'm talking about the politicians in California. They complain. When their forests go up, they complain. They got to take care of their forests a lot better. But when the wall, they want the wall in San Diego, but then they are always the first one. They were the first one to pull the National Guard and they need the National Guard, especially in California. So, we're proud of this. As you know, this area is an area that a lot of people used to come through. And since we've had it up, Kevin, I think not one person has been able to get through.

      "utterance": "Thank you Mr. President. You know, as the chief here in El Centro, we are very appreciative of this wall. These men and women out here in this area of two miles were experiencing a high number of assaults and use of force incidents. This was prior to this wall being built. This is 30-foot border walls that are pillar bollards and you can see through it. For us, it is a huge advantage to see what is on the other side because before with the old landing mat, we could not see the adversary. We couldn't see the threat that was on that side. We would get rocked constantly. We would get items thrown at us everyday. With this 30-foot wall, we haven't had those types of incidents. Just here in these two miles, our assaults have dropped by 65 percent, just in this area. That is very important to me as a chief because I don't want our agents hurt. I want them out here protecting the country and doing their job. In these two miles, just illegal entries alone, have dropped by 75 percent just in this area. Yes, the wall is here and people have maybe around it are breaching the area, and they are coming around, but that's OK."

So, when Gloria says 65 percent, this is 100 percent, but when they go down further -- but we are going further and further out, everyday we're building more wall and we're going further and further and you will be at 99.9, I predict."

The strategic deployment of physical barriers along our southern border will always be part of the picture of border security, which is absolutely fundamentally necessary for humanitarian reasons, public safety reasons and also for national security reasons. Anyone who would suggest that we do not have a crisis on our southern border is being intellectually dishonest to the point of being dishonest with malice. We have humanitarian crisis, which is very clear and compelling. We have a compelling crisis of public safety with human trafficking, drug trafficking, sex trafficking coming up through the border. This is not make-believe. This is something that we live with every day as border sheriffs. So we applaud the efforts of the current administration to secure the border. It is long overdue and those who would argue that we do not have a crisis on our southern border need to come to my part of the world and see what is really going on. We interdicted 58 pounds of methamphetamine just the other day and last month, 13,000 fentanyl pills. My deputies recover about 100 bodies a year in the deserts of Pima County, Arizona. So please do not tell me this is not a public safety crisis, not a humanitarian crisis and not a national security concern.

Since 2006, Mexico has been fighting militarily a kingpin strategy against all of their drug wars locally. What do we think that we are seeing? It is all of the effects from that. So it's not about simply human immigration crossing the southern border. It's because the push factors coming south of the border are so strong, so complicated and so now long-term invested that that's what we're dealing with.

And them afterward during that presser, I was just struck by what I felt was him being archaic. He seem to me like a relic or he said it, you know, the definition of progressive, that it seems to be changing, almost confused. And it seemed that while it might resonate with older voters in the Democratic Party, it didn't seem to me that he had that relevance that I can see that could galvanize the entire spectrum of the Democratic Party, which is what would be needed for him to win the primary.

And then when he did the gaggle I thought he seemed relaxed and confident and tried to make sure everybody understood he was not being perverted, and that is what I think needs to come across. That he is just maybe a little archaic as you would say or goofy, but he did struggle when he was trying to define ideologically where he was, progressive, moderate, Democrat, he finally stuck the landing and said, I'm an Obama-Biden Democrat and I think that is where he needs stay. But he's moving right now into the Elizabeth Warren territory where whatever she says doesn't matter, everybody just thinks fake Indian. And now, if you get the constant trickle of more women coming out saying that he violated my personal space week after week after week, every time you see Biden, you don't think about what he said in the speech, you just think creepy Joe."

And given his history of mental health problems, there might be an arguable defense there that he didn't knowingly - it wasn't willful, because he didn't understand. He also as was kind of alluded there, he has an extensive criminal record that also includes violating probation many times and being MIA. So, you might be able to argue well is this an example of the system failing someone. You know I honestly hate this story, because it is so painful for families like that to have that pain resurrected in the form of someone who could be as simple as just a punk, taking advantage everyone or up to a person with serious mental health issues that needs to be taken care of in that way or needs to be on medication.

The reason we got excited about the story in the beginning was that because we thought the actual child had escaped after being abducted by sexual traffickers. And we've seen this before, Elizabeth Smart, Jayme Closs, Kate Jaycee Dugard where they somehow free themselves after years of captivity and live to tell the tale and if you're a parent, you understand how incredibly resilient your child has to be in order to get out of this and how important it is to tell them that your phone number, you home address, all that stuff, so they can get that triggered."

Case in point the fact that the Chicago Department of Law which is under the mayor's purview stood up and said, OK, well then, you're going to pay us back. They are absolutely flexing their muscles with how best they can try to disgorge him, used that word again in the best way that they know how. Look you owe us this money because you were lying. And in terms of that he was charged and then indicted on 16 counts and that deal was totally non- reflective of how the criminal justice system was playing out. I absolutely love this and note that the Department of Law in Chicago that's almost 300 attorneys, they do litigation, they do transactional, they do legislative stuff. It's a humongous representation of the city of Chicago. I love that they are standing up right now and it will be successful.
