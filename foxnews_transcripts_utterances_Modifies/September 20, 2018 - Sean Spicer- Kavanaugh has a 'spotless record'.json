We told you already that member staffers of the Judiciary Committee have met with principal players and witnesses, we are told, to try to come together with a background they can get for Dr. Ford herself.  Now, Democrats on that committee opted not to participate in that.  The read on all of this with Sean Spicer, bestselling author, as well the former White House press secretary.
