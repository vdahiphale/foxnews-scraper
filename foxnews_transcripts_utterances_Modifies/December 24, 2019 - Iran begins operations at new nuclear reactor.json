      "utterance": "The holiday rush is on. Americans are taking off as folks also rush to the store for those last-minute gifts. Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World,\" and we are all over it, with Rick Leventhal, New York City, on the millions who will be driving; David Lee Miller, La Guardia Airport, on how flyers are faring; and Matt Finn in Chicago where folks are still shopping. We begin with you, Rick."

      "utterance": "Charles, 104 million Americans traveling by car this holiday season, the most ever on record according to AAA. Fortunately, they're not all on the road right now as we look at the West Side Highway, which is actually moving. The West Side Highway moving, ladies and gentlemen, on a Tuesday afternoon at the beginning of rush hour. And take a look at the George Washington Bridge where, if you're heading out of the city, it's -- it looks pretty good. But coming in, maybe not so much. We have some traffic cameras from across the nation to share as well. In Chicago, traffic flowing on the Dan Ryan Expressway. In Los Angeles, moving pretty well outside LAX. And down in Orlando on I-95, Malussa County, wide open, folks. AAA says today, tomorrow, and Saturday are actually the best days to get behind the wheel. But you might want to keep your rubber off the road Thursday and Sunday. Those are expected to be jam-packed with folks headed home. And if you can fill your tank in Missouri, you'll save some cash. Missouri offers the left expensive gas in the nation at roughly 2.20 a gallon. Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana round out the top five cheapest fuel states. The priciest, perhaps no surprise, Hawaii and California taking the top spots, an average 3.65 and 3.58 for a gallon of regular unleaded. Also, Hawaii and California are among the most popular destinations. Almost every city in the top ten 10 is a warm-weather spot, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, and Phoenix. But you also have New York City and Las Vegas there as popular holiday distinctions. According to AAA, if you are driving, just make sure your car is tip-top before you hit the road. You might also want to pack some snacks and check the weather forecast, Charles, before you put that pedal to the metal."

      "speaker": "David Lee Miller",
      "utterance": "Fliers? What fliers? Take a look around, Charles. You can see things here at La Guardia Airport as they are at most airports around the country are very quiet. This is the ticketing counter of American Airlines in Terminal V here. It is estimated that today 2.25 million people are going to fly, but the experts say that today is the least busy day of the entire holiday season. And if La Guardia is any indication, most folks are already at their distinction. Some, however, did have a rough start to the day. Morning fog in Chicago halted all incoming flights at O'Hare and Midway Airports. Ground operations have now returned to normal. But in Chicago, there have been, today, a total of 162 cancellations between O'Hare and Midway Airports. And as we know, those are hubs, and what happens there can ripple through the entire system. Today, there have been a total of 2,063 delays in the U.S. and 262 flight cancellations. And we do expect that, as quiet as things are now, things are going to change later in the week. Thursday and Friday are going to be the busiest travel days of the season, according to the experts. 2.9 million people traveling each day. The TSA says it is ready."

      "speaker": "David Lee Miller",
      "utterance": "And in total, they say 47.5 million people are going to be flying on a U.S. carrier this holiday season. That's up about 3 percent from last year.

      "utterance": "Charles, we have been talking to Christmas Eve shoppers all day here on Chicago's famed Michigan Avenue. Some families tell us it's a tradition to head out the door on Christmas Eve. Other people tell us they are looking for a good bargain. But the majority of people we talked to so far say they haven't found any extraordinary Christmas Eve deals."

      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "Honestly, I'm not really looking for deals, I'm just looking for that perfect present for the morning so that when they wake up they feel like, hey, this is the best Christmas ever."

      "speaker": "Female Speaker",

      "speaker": "Matt Finn",
      "utterance": "If you do anticipate heading out today, here are some national chains it a tell Fox News they are open today: Target, Macy's, Walmart, Lowe's, CVS, Walgreens, 7-Eleven. And if you need some coffee along the way, Starbucks and Duncan Donuts. Now, the National Retail Federation expects this shopping season to be very strong thanks to consumer confidence and a strong economy. The Black Friday weekend kicked off with very healthy numbers, 190 million shoppers spending about 4 percent more than last year. And the National Retail Federation expects shoppers to spend an average about $1,048 on holiday gifts this year. And, Charles, a lot of people that we have been talking today are parents who say they snuck out the door to grab some toys before tomorrow morning. Charles."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "A parental tradition in this country. Matt, thank you very much. You know, call it super Saturday. There's a report out today that shoppers spent a record $34.4 billion the Saturday before Christmas. Now, that tops the 31.2 billion that was spent on Black Friday. Industry watchers say solid job growth and fatter wallets have folks in a buying mood. I want to go to former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi on, if all of this holiday shopping cheer can continue into 2020. Ed, do we have that kind of momentum?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ed Rensi",
      "utterance": "I think so. My experience being in and around the restaurant industry, people are very optimistic right now in spite of all the gloom and doom that the Democrat candidates are throwing at us. They're optimistic. They look forward. Their 401-Ks are doing extremely well. The stock market's doing well. They feel more secure. They feel more confident that the future's going to be solid without all the trepidation that's come and passed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You know, that is a great point you bring up, no matter who's in office, you know, the other side points out to the weakness or perceived weakness in the economy. And you and I both also know that, you know, sometimes perception can become reality. Is the difference right now the fact that people are seeing these paychecks, particularly blue collar workers, wage increases that they have not seen in a couple of decades. Is that really making the difference here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ed Rensi",
      "utterance": "You bet. My hometown back in Oakdale, Ohio, where there's a lot of fracking going on, people have never been more optimistic. They're building new schools, they're having a good life. Things are getting better every day. The Steele industry's coming back online. They're optimistic and looking forward to the future. It's pretty hard to defeat the optimism of the American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "It really is. You know, we had a consumer sentiment report out last week, and what I -- what struck me is that Americans anticipate this to continue. A record amount of Americans think they're going to get a raise next year. They see inflation at the lowest level ever, almost a Goldilocks Utopian situation. I mean, obviously, it can't last forever, but again, because we believe it will, that does play a big role in it, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ed Rensi",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. Confidence is everything. You can't win a football game unless you think you're going to. You can't be successful in life unless you think you can. And Trump is telling everybody, \"We're going to make America great, keep America great,\" and looking forward to the future. I think there's a lot to be said for exuberance and confidence. We've just got to be careful we don't do something stupid and cause this economy to slow down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You know, one of the biggest stocks this year was target, which came out of nowhere. A lot of folks thought they were going to succumb in this Amazon era. And we've seen where, whether it's target, Costco, Walmart, they're hanging in there. These names are hanging in there. With Amazon, they found ways to compete. Is it that way down the food chain with some of the more medium sized or even smaller retailers out there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ed Rensi",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think so. In fact, I deal with small business all the time through franchising and other small consulting jobs. And they're very optimistic right now because they're finding niches that provide products and services consumers want. Let's not kid ourselves, people like to touch, feel, and experience. And as some of the people talked in your previous interviews from Chicago, it's fun. It's exciting. It's good to be out and about and meeting other people and being optimistic about what the future looks like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Ed, are you concerned about debt levels in the third quarter? You know, we saw household debt levels there. Now, the composition is different, right? Now it's student loans. But we also with credit card scores the median score went up six points. Auto scores went up eight points. And some are saying that's a sign that maybe some of these lenders got ahead of themselves, they lend to higher risk folks, and maybe curbing that could also curb this sort of the economic growth that's under retail spending."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ed Rensi",
      "utterance": "Well, we should all be very worried about debt. It is a cancer on the free enterprise system, and we need to be cautious and careful. I think the last several years have proven that this student debt is debilitating. I start to see millennials now are becoming more optimistic about the future because some of that debt's been paid down. But we need to be very, very careful about debt."

      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Thank you very much. So, with the economic, with the economy looking up, are President Trump's chances in 2020 moving up, even with Democrats looking to kick him out? We'll debate it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Donald Trump",
      "utterance": "We've never done better. So, I think it's good. 401(k)s and jobs in the country. We have the most people working right now in the United States that we've ever had in the history of our country, close to 160,000 people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Forget about impeachment, is the strong economy under President Trump's watch going to be the issue to watch in the 2020 race? Let's get the read from our power panel, Jim Awad, Michael Starr Hopkins, and Dominic Green. Dominic, let me start with you. You know, there's absolutely no doubt, no arguing that the economy is just on fire and the beautiful thing about this economy is that it has spread to the lower rungs of the economic ladder. You know, we always notice the economy going into elections. How important will it be this time around?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dominic Green",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to be absolutely crucial, Charles. I mean, as we've been hearing, real growth in wages, something we haven't seen in years, is going to have all kinds of positive economic effects. And it's probably going to be more of a factor in voters' decision making in 2020 than any amount of the impeachment circus, which is currently occupying so much of our attention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Michael Starr Hopkins, certainly the impeachment -- I'm going to borrow Dominic's terms here -- the impeachment circus hasn't stopped us from having what appears to be a record-breaking holiday spending spree, a huge stock market rally for the market in December, and overall pretty good optimism in this country this month."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Michael Starr Hopkins",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, when you look at the president's economy, you would think that he'd be on a march to reflect2. Instead, you're seeing vulnerability because of a lot of the unforced errors. I mean, if you look at the comments he made about Debbie Dingell and her husband, you're looking at the battle he's had with Nancy Pelosi, and the trade war with China, those are losses that he hasn't been able to really overcome so for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Michael Starr Hopkins",
      "utterance": "So, it's going to be interesting to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "I will push back on one thing. The trade war stuff, you know, I read a recent Democrat survey. They surveyed all the Democratic candidates in New Jersey and they actually said that Democratic candidates wished that Democrats were as strong on China as President Trump is. I don't see how that could be a loss when millions of American jobs were shipped to China and those are the very people that voted for President Trump. I think they cheered him on for the China trade war. No one else had the guts to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Michael Starr Hopkins",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at the effects it's had on farmers, in places like Iowa, it's had a really devastating effect. We're at historic highs for defaults for farmers, and that's something that's really going to play into his reelection chances."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "All right. We'll see. Jim, I want to get the read from you because, you know, you've been around the track. You've been able to corelate the markets with the economy. A month ago, there were three economic surveys, one from Moody's, one from Yale, and one from Oxford Economics. They all said that at the current pace President Trump will win in a landslide. One of the surveys actually said he would steamroll his Democratic opponents if this economy holds up. By the way, the track record for these guys are absolutely phenomenal. They took into account the states, electoral college, and they said if it holds up like this it's going to be a landslide."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jim Awad",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's quite likely. People always vote with their pocketbooks. They vote with their pocketbooks around Labor Day, just as they are approaching the election season. And it looks, based on what you're seeing now, that the economy is good and it's probably going to get better. The vulnerabilities are that he's not likeable and many people will -- they don't like him personally, but they'll vote with their pocketbooks. And then there's always the case, the possibility, that the economy gets so good that interest rates are going up and it starts to spook the financial markets and the economy. So, it's not a slam dunk, there are risks out there. But based on what you see today, you would have to say the economy is good and his chances are pretty darn good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "And ironically, Jim, I think you hit on one thing. I think probably the greatest risk for President Trump, he could be a victim of his own success. If things start to get wobbly three months into the election, and wobbly in a sense that they don't maintain a certain pace, the media will certainly say, \"Hey, we're starting to crater.\" But we'll see. I want to kind of shift gears a little bit, folks, because over the weekend New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez actually blasting the economy and the stock market. Take a listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez",
      "utterance": "GDP skyrockets, and the Dow goes up, and the Nasdaq and stock prices continue to skyrocket is not an economy that's working for us. And if we're measuring our success based on stock prices and not wages, we've got a problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "I wish I had brought my wage chart with me. I've been taking this wage chart with me on every Fox News hit that I do, Dominic, and what it shows is wages over the last 30 years. And one thing that we don't, we see over the last 30 years is that never in the last 30 years have blue-collar wages outpaced ordinary wages to the degree that they have in the last 14 months. It has been absolutely remarkable. I don't think AOC wants us to start showing a wage chart but let me have your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dominic Green",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this is in the category of unforced errors that the Democrats are making. If they put up a hard-left candidate -- for instance, a Bernie Sanders -- they're going to have enormous trouble convincing people that their idea of reality matches the ordinary worker's idea of reality. And the same, perhaps, will go for Elizabeth Warren, who's also pushing a message of economic grievance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Michael Starr Hopkins, where will the Democrats focus? Will it be on somehow, okay, the economy is booming but it's not trickling down enough? The president, we don't like his mean tweets or what he said about Debbie Dingell's husband. Where is the focus going to be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Michael Starr Hopkins",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think it's going to be on rebuilding the American dream. I think, at the end of the day, Democrats will put forth a moderate candidate. You know, I don't think Bernie Sanders is going to end up being the nominee for the Democratic Party, partly because he's not a Democrat. But I think that what Democrats need to do is tell a story and talk about how, you know, yes, the stock market may be doing very well, but the average American doesn't -- isn't invested in the stock market and, if they are, it's through mutual funds. So, I think what we need to do is talk about how we, you know, make college more affordable, how we make it so that everyone is invested in the American economy and not just those at the top level."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still sitting on those articles of impeachment against President Trump. My next guest says that if that's the game she wants to play, then Mitch McConnell should set a deadline for delivery. Quinnipiac law professor, John Pavia, joins us now. John, thanks for joining us. So, the ball is in -- still in Nancy Pelosi's court, but you say there are things that Mitch McConnell should be doing right now, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "John Pavia",
      "utterance": "Yeah, the ball is in her court, right? It's up to her to transfer those articles over to the Senate and name her House managers, which, by the Constitution, triggers, then, the Senate's authority to then take control over this process and run the trial. At that point, the Senate rules on impeachment kick in, right? And what's interesting here is these rules have been in place pretty much since the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. And here is where the president's strategist, and on the Democratic side, as well, they are reviewing those rules. And you really got to use these rules, just like any court trial, to your advantage. Because every trial, no matter where it is, is an exercise of persuasion. And I think, right now, in the court of public opinion, I think the Democrats are doing a better job in using the rules than the Republicans are."

I know that the Republicans are raising money off of that. But in the pub -- in the polls that I'm seeing --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "John Pavia",
      "utterance": "It has. But what I -- I guess my point is, I don't think there's a bunch of people out there saying, \"Boy, this was so unfair that they should stop the process right now.\" So, right now, by saying -- by Lindsey Graham coming out, and McConnell saying -- coming out and saying, \"Look, we are not going to be impartial; we are definitely partial,\" I don't know how that helps the president. I think they should -- they need to play the game, and say, \"Look, we're going to listen to the evidence and we're going to make our decision in an impartial way.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Right, because no one believes that any Democrats are going to be impartial. No one believes [LAUGHS] -- I mean, no one believes that anyone involved in this is -- quote, unquote -- \"impartial.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "John Pavia",

      "utterance": "Well, I know. But do -- I'm saying I don't think the public will -- you could wear black; you can say, \"It's a solemn day;\" you can say what you want. I don't think there's anyone on either side of the political aisle that thinks Schumer doesn't have a preconceived notion of what he wants to achieve once this process happens. But to your point, in the last 24 hours, Lindsey Graham's been pretty active on Twitter. On one, he says, \"Democrats are treating impeachment like an open bar tab. Time to cut them off, take their car keys away, and end this insanity.\""

Just in terms of the presence and what they're presenting to the public, I think they've got to do that because that's what the Democrats are doing right now. And as they go through that process, then use the rules. But, now, remember, just as one example, right? In the Senate impeachment trial, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides. And he looks like the judge, but he's not the presiding judge. He's the presiding officer. So, if he makes a ruling, that ruling can be overruled by a majority vote. Any senator can say, \"Well, you know, I disagree with ruling and I want to put it to a vote.\" And if 51 percent of senators vote against the chief justice, the ruling is overruled."

One official described to me the intelligence is \"murky.\" North Korea has already tested a dozen short-range missiles this year after testing none in the previous year. And then in a previously unreported incident more than two years ago, one of those North Korea missiles came uncomfortably close to the international space station I'm told. North Korea does not coordinate its missile launches with anyone. New satellite images from Planet Lab shows another concerning development in North Korea, a factory linked to making long-range nuclear missiles has expanded. It's the same place Kim visited before his last long-range missile test in November 2017. Earlier this month, North Korea performed two separate engine tests just as it did ahead of those long-range tests two years ago. Highlighting the danger on the Korean peninsula, the FAA has issued a warning to all commercial aviation to be on the lookout for any North Korea missiles. Charles?"

But as of right now, Kim Jong-un has steadfastly shown that he is not going to give those nuclear weapons up willingly. China and Russia continue to aid and abet the violation of sanction that's continue to prop up the regime.

None of them worked in effectively trying to rein in control from North Korea building and then gaining nuclear weapons. They have them. That is a fact. So, President Trump tried the unorthodox. It has not necessarily worked to this point. What we have given them, unfortunately, is time and space for the research and development in not only the ballistic missile technology, but potentially the miniaturization of the weapons themselves. I think at the end of the year, if they haven't come back to the table, then, as we've seen, a former national security advisor and Ambassador Bolton pointed out, we're going to have to reimpose sanctions and this time make them bite, not only to North Korea, but to China and Russia as well, and make them all start paying that price for allowing North Korea to behave this way."

We have both the capability and credibility that we have to back up to do that. But more importantly, let's face it, the only military ally that North Korea has ever had is China. China is going to be made to understand that if we have to go to North Korea, they're expected to step aside and stay out of the way. To date, they have avoided even coming to the table to discuss it. They're the 800-pound gorilla in the room. But if they want to stay like that, that's fine. It gives us more free rein."

The ideology is going to be out there. It's going to continue to exist. We still have the forces there even though we have pulled back. The Kurds are still willing to fight on our behalf in that area. But at the end of the day, we're going to have to work the deal with the devil and make sure that in coordination with both Russia, Syria, and Turkey, that we make sure that that -- any force that starts to develop gets crushed quickly and ruthlessly."

But it's a little bit of a tougher case to make in the case of Mr. Durham, who has had a long reputation for being a, you know, pretty much straight shooter, career prosecutor who tells it like it is."

And you know, once they start saying things that one political side of the aisle doesn't like, they're the worst, you know, most politically driven people out there. They shouldn't be on the case. They're careers mean nothing. I mean, this sort of thing the public has endured over and over again when it came to the Mueller investigation. Do you think it will have any sort of impact, ultimately, on the outcome of these investigations?"

      "speaker": "Steven Mulroy",
      "utterance": "I doubt seriously they'll impeach the outcome of the investigation, although I should note that in the case of Mr. Durham, he did do one thing which I think provided ammunition to his critics. He, half an hour after Attorney General Barr publicly criticized the inspector general's report -- the inspector general of the Department of Justice -- Mr. Durham then also made a critical comment. This was highly unusual for a career prosecutor to do, A, about the inspector general who usually has a reputation for being nonpartisan and well respected; and B, to make such a comment while his own investigation -- Mr. Durham's -- was ongoing. That unusual move, I think, has provided fodder for some of his Democratic critics to question whether he's really going to be a straight shooter this time like he has been in the past."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Steven Mulroy",
      "utterance": "I think it's certainly legitimate for Mr. Durham to request documents and maybe even answering questions of Mr. Brennan because the CIA was at least secondarily involved in the initial investigation back in 2016. However, I think it might be the case that the real focus here is on an FBI agent, Kleinsmith, who allegedly falsely denied in a warrant application to get a search warrant that he had gotten some of his information from the CIA. I think the focus may be on him, from what we've been hearing; and if that's the case, then CIA Director, former CIA Director Brennan is really kind of a material witness as opposed to actually being the target of the investigation himself, or at least that's what is -- it might be the case."

But even the folks that really wanted a white Christmas, a lot of places that we would typically see it are just not seeing it. In fact, take a look at this: southern Wisconsin, for example, much of Michigan, no snow out there. In fact, you have to go farther northward, places like Fargo and Duluth, in order to guarantee some snow on the ground. In fact, we've got some spring-like warmth here, across the north central U.S., and we have high temperatures, typical of what we would see in March or April. Now, for Christmas Day, much of the country is mild here. And we do have a little bit of freezing morning drizzle across parts of Wisconsin; also, into southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. That'll be something to watch out for, where that warmer air is kind of clashing with some colder air. And we've got snow and rain in the West here. California: mountain snow and rain at the coast. But for Christmas Day, we're going to see a high temperature in Chicago of 53 degrees; St. Louis checking in in the 60s. In fact, Chicago, our temperature is running 20 degrees above average for this time of year. Thursday, we're looking at a temperature of 56. And then, also in Milwaukee, our temperature's running 20 degrees above the average daytime high of 31 degrees. It's staying warm here on Thursday, as well. Now, during the middle of the week -- you talked about travel back, so maybe folks are heading back home after the holiday — we've got a storm system that could possibly form in the center of the country. It's going to be very warm and — out ahead of it, but colder air coming in behind it. This is just one of our global models. But we'll have to keep an eye on it because there's a chance for rain and snow on the back edge of this in the midsection of the country and, then, pushing towards the east as we head towards Sunday. That would create travel problems from Minneapolis down to Kansas City and Dallas on Saturday, moving eastward from Maine down to the Gulf Coast, as we head through Sunday. So, if you're traveling this weekend, keep an eye on it."
