      "sentences": "Hey there, guys. Thank you, John, and Sandra. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Martha McCallum. We've got a very busy show for you today. Here's what's happening on THE STORY for this Wednesday.   You've got brand new troubles for Governor Cuomo as we now learn there is a brand new push for a subpoena for the governor to testify before Congress on what happened in these nursing homes.  A huge rally this afternoon against that scandal, bringing it to light, people with signs all over the place about their loved ones. That whole thing is getting a little bit overshadowed today because you've got a former aide bringing new specific allegations of sexual harassment and bullying against the governor.  It is not a pretty picture for him when you put all of this together. We're going to take you live to the scene in city hall just moments from now.    Plus, they plan the Capitol Hill raid weeks in advance. It turns out new revelations about climbing ropes and pipe bombs, as Nancy Pelosi wants to investigate a 9/11 style commission. But we're now learning that she wants what was billed as a bipartisan commission to be heavily weighted with Democrats. So, what's that all about? We're going to talk about that with Senator Josh Hawley. And the brand new video of Tiger Woods just minutes before the car wreck. You see the arrow on the car as it goes by on a beautiful morning in California. What we're now learning about the reality for Tiger Woods as we get an update coming straight ahead. Brian Kilmeade and Geraldo Rivera, here to talk about that moments.   But first today, on President Biden's first day in office, he announced a 100 day moratorium on most deportations of illegals back to their countries. Even some of them criminals were allowed to stay. But now a Texas judge is stepping in and he is shutting that whole thing down.  As AOC changes her tune but still goes after Biden on the facilities where his administration is now holding hundreds of children. Moments ago Peter Doocy in another back and forth with Jen Psaki pressing on this new part of this story. Watch this.",

So obviously, that sends a signal to a lot of people south of the border that it is a good time to come.

And so, good that we got them, good that they're in a facility, good that we can now try and reunite them with their families back in the country of their origin. But let's not kid ourselves. I have a -- I have a hunting lease in South Texas. It's in that area between the highly populated lower Rio Grande Valley, and Corpus Christi in Kingsville. It's the county -- Kennedy County is half the size of Rhode Island and 400 people live in the entire county. And let me just tell you, I have seen more evidence of traffickers including more evidence of large groups of immigrants, illegal aliens coming across our hunting lease than I've seen in five or six or seven years. Water containers every, where we see people in the brush, we see evidence of large groups moving forward.  We see sacks that they've kept their food in. We see the tattered blankets they tried to keep themselves warm in. And I've never seen anything like this in the last five or six years and it is people moving north because the message is the border is open. And if you get to the Estados Unidos, you can get here. And they are paying thousands of dollars each in all likelihood to traffickers to move them in a sophisticated criminal enterprise into the United States of America.",

That Tiger is still with us today because of that. Rory McIlroy, a fantastic golfer and friend of Tiger, pointed out today. Tiger is not Superman, and for many of us, we kind of think that Tiger has this Superman effect. We do expect somehow that Tiger will come back, right? We expect that one day we're going to turn on the television and see Tiger Woods not just walking out for a ceremonial tee shot, but maybe actually to perform again professionally. Whether or not he does we don't know. Martha, he just had surgery, a fifth back surgery back in December. And the possibility to come back from that is very different than when you're talking about things like shattered bones like we were dealing with here, not just compound fractures, but where you're having bones that are broken into many pieces. We saw as Brian just brought up, Alex Smith, the quarterback of the Washington football team, has no business walking anymore, let alone playing football. And here he is starting games again for Washington. So modern medicine miracles and the power of will, and all that makes Tiger an amazing sportsman as he is, we can root for him to come back.

Even the details as laid out in that report as to when they would come back leave so many questions unanswered, how many days a week, how many hours a day, what zone, what designation will San Francisco be in at that time, will it be a requirement that every teacher is vaccinated. The long and short of it is there are still so many hurdles, unanswered hurdles, to getting kids in classrooms that your only conclusion will be, realistically, months away towards the end of the school year, possibly some elements of in-person learning.

There are major questions about the riots on January 6th that need to be answered. I can tell you from being in the hearings yesterday and asking questions, there's basic disagreement on whether the National Guard was actually ever formally requested by the Capitol Hill Police chief, when was it requested, who was responsible. We don't have answers to any of those questions. The witnesses yesterday disagreed significantly among themselves, so we need to get answers.

Here's what's happening on THE STORY for this Wednesday. You've got brand new troubles for Governor Cuomo as we now learn there is a brand new push for a subpoena for the governor to testify before Congress on what happened in these nursing homes. A huge rally this afternoon against that scandal, bringing it to light, people with signs all over the place about their loved ones. That whole thing is getting a little bit overshadowed today because you've got a former aide bringing new specific allegations of sexual harassment and bullying against the governor. It is not a pretty picture for him when you put all of this together. We're going to take you live to the scene in city hall just moments from now. Plus, they plan the Capitol Hill raid weeks in advance. It turns out new revelations about climbing ropes and pipe bombs, as Nancy Pelosi wants to investigate a 9/11 style commission. But we're now learning that she wants what was billed as a bipartisan commission to be heavily weighted with Democrats. So, what's that all about? We're going to talk about that with Senator Josh Hawley. And the brand new video of Tiger Woods just minutes before the car wreck. You see the arrow on the car as it goes by on a beautiful morning in California. What we're now learning about the reality for Tiger Woods as we get an update coming straight ahead. Brian Kilmeade and Geraldo Rivera, here to talk about that moments. But first today, on President Biden's first day in office, he announced a 100 day moratorium on most deportations of illegals back to their countries. Even some of them criminals were allowed to stay. But now a Texas judge is stepping in and he is shutting that whole thing down. As AOC changes her tune but still goes after Biden on the facilities where his administration is now holding hundreds of children. Moments ago Peter Doocy in another back and forth with Jen Psaki pressing on this new part of this story. Watch this."

We have a number of unaccompanied minors, children who are coming into the country without their families. What we are not doing, what the last administration did was separate those kids, rip them from the arms of their parents at the border. We are not doing that. That is immoral.

These children, though, only supposed to be held by Homeland Security officials before being turned over to Health and Human Services officials for 72 hours. But the White House is now admitting, some recently have been held there longer."

That is not our objective. That is not our goal. So, some, unfortunately, did state for days, five days or longer. But the objective is to move them as quickly as possible to the HHS-sponsored facilities."

      "speaker": "DOOCY",

I guess, you know, it's no surprise, given the fact that the construction on the wall stopped. That sends a big signal. They basically just walked away from all the work that was being done there. Then you have the news that deportations will be dramatically decreased. So, if you are caught, you're not going to be sent back. So obviously, that sends a signal to a lot of people south of the border that it is a good time to come.

Now, they're using a facility that they heavily criticized, that they should now be thankful for, I guess, because it's the only place where they were able to house these children.

These are not kids who wake up one day in Guatemala and say, I'm going to make my way north to the United States. In many instances, they are the victims of trafficking. And so, good that we got them, good that they're in a facility, good that we can now try and reunite them with their families back in the country of their origin. But let's not kid ourselves. I have a -- I have a hunting lease in South Texas. It's in that area between the highly populated lower Rio Grande Valley, and Corpus Christi in Kingsville. It's the county -- Kennedy County is half the size of Rhode Island and 400 people live in the entire county. And let me just tell you, I have seen more evidence of traffickers including more evidence of large groups of immigrants, illegal aliens coming across our hunting lease than I've seen in five or six or seven years. Water containers every, where we see people in the brush, we see evidence of large groups moving forward. We see sacks that they've kept their food in. We see the tattered blankets they tried to keep themselves warm in. And I've never seen anything like this in the last five or six years and it is people moving north because the message is the border is open. And if you get to the Estados Unidos, you can get here. And they are paying thousands of dollars each in all likelihood to traffickers to move them in a sophisticated criminal enterprise into the United States of America."

We are where people come when they are in trouble. We don't want people traffic in this country. What the former guy did was he would take these people who were struggling and send them back to where they were struggling or worse, send them to camps in Mexico where they were abused, and trafficked, and sometimes even killed. And worse, he would then rip them from the arms of their parents and have no plan for them getting reunited down the road. We need comprehensive immigration reform in America, Karl.

His press aide was to my right and a state trooper behind me.\" Now, Cuomo's office, less than an hour ago released flight logs from October 2017 and a statement from four people who were on those flights who said, \"We were on each of these October flights and this conversation did not happen.\" The press secretary went on to say, \"As we said before, Miss Boylan's claims of inappropriate behavior are quite simply false.\" Now, Boylan also detailed a one-on-one meeting in the governor's New York City office where she alleges Cuomo stepped in front of her and kissed her on the lips. She wrote, \"Governor Andrew Cuomo has created a culture within his administration where sexual harassment and bullying is so pervasive that it is not only condoned but expected.

I mean, Ron Kim, the politician who accused him of threatening to destroy his career, really bullying him in a way that was beyond the pale. The nursing home scandal, of course, is the most important of these scandals that he fudged the figures to make himself look better. Disguised the total nursing home toll.

When asked -- when he asked his reformer resident, do you think he can play again? He goes recreational. It's going to take a while to close the wound, make sure there's no infection. We know that with Alex Smith in Washington with a football club. By the time you close the wound, he's going to take a while to get weight- bearing on it. But he can play recreational and be in the Tigers Tiger. Who knows how much he can come back. While everything's still early, he's extremely lucky, but it's extremely focused too. Even though that leg has been damaged before with past injuries, an ACL replacement. It would be, you know, and that could be a little bit difficult in terms of weight bearing will take time, and he is 45. I don't think it's out of the question in playing again at a high level."

JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 SPORTS REPORTER: Thank goodness that Tiger was wearing a seatbelt, and that would be really a message for anybody. That Tiger is still with us today because of that. Rory McIlroy, a fantastic golfer and friend of Tiger, pointed out today. Tiger is not Superman, and for many of us, we kind of think that Tiger has this Superman effect. We do expect somehow that Tiger will come back, right? We expect that one day we're going to turn on the television and see Tiger Woods not just walking out for a ceremonial tee shot, but maybe actually to perform again professionally. Whether or not he does we don't know. Martha, he just had surgery, a fifth back surgery back in December. And the possibility to come back from that is very different than when you're talking about things like shattered bones like we were dealing with here, not just compound fractures, but where you're having bones that are broken into many pieces. We saw as Brian just brought up, Alex Smith, the quarterback of the Washington football team, has no business walking anymore, let alone playing football. And here he is starting games again for Washington. So modern medicine miracles and the power of will, and all that makes Tiger an amazing sportsman as he is, we can root for him to come back.

It also demands a free COVID tests for staff and students, and a public dashboard listing all positive cases in the schools. But after an emotional seven hour board meeting attended virtually by hundreds of staff, families and members of the UE, that's United Educators, teachers union, there's still no deal on how school days will actually look.

Eventually, the district says elementary schools will open first but before that can even happen, each campus will need to be checked and cleared by city health officials.

You know, one of the things that struck me in this editorial that was in the San Francisco Chronicle was, they point out that that the unions are making demands that no other class of essential workers in the entire country has made for their benefit. And you hear these teachers saying, well, possibly we could do three hours a day. I can't imagine any other job where anybody would have any tolerance for that kind of negotiating, especially when you're talking about the fact that this is about kids who haven't been in school since March. WILL CAIN, \"FOX & FRIENDS WEEKENDS\" CO-HOST: These teachers as represented by the teachers union in San Francisco aren't interested in educating children. It's the only logical conclusion we can come to Martha. Even the details as laid out in that report as to when they would come back leave so many questions unanswered, how many days a week, how many hours a day, what zone, what designation will San Francisco be in at that time, will it be a requirement that every teacher is vaccinated. The long and short of it is there are still so many hurdles, unanswered hurdles, to getting kids in classrooms that your only conclusion will be, realistically, months away towards the end of the school year, possibly some elements of in-person learning. But more obviously, they're just not interested in getting back. They're getting paid to perform distance learning or no learning at all, and they're not interested in getting back this year to teach the children of San Francisco."

      "utterance": "You know, I'm curious, as you watch all of this, are you concerned about the framing of this and how it's being presented and why there would be need for a 7-4, Democratic-Republican split if you genuinely want to get to the bottom of what led to this?"

    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "I'm concerned about the fact that the Democrats don't seem that interested in the facts. They seem interested in scoring political points. We've just seen them shut down the entire United States Senate, really, for weeks on end, Martha, to pursue impeachment of a guy who's not even in office. That tells you what their priorities are. There are major questions about the riots on January 6th that need to be answered. I can tell you from being in the hearings yesterday and asking questions, there's basic disagreement on whether the National Guard was actually ever formally requested by the Capitol Hill Police chief, when was it requested, who was responsible. We don't have answers to any of those questions. The witnesses yesterday disagreed significantly among themselves, so we need to get answers. But this partisan approach that Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are going after it looks very political. It looks designed to score political points. Meanwhile, it leaves the actual security questions unanswered."

God forbid if this were ever to happen again, who is supposed to notify whom and who has the authority to call the National Guard? We saw it all summer with these riots in different places in the country and the discussion of whether or not we should bring in the guard, which was, you know, really shot down in a lot of Democrats strongholds. But now, they want that protection. And in fact, they don't want it to go home at this point for the foreseeable future, senator?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's very strange to know but we've got a lot of senators are asking a question. When is the guard -- how long is the guard going to be here, what's the guards mission here, what's the end date for it. We can't get any answers to those questions. I mean, none at all. No one will actually say it. And you're right, Martha, after criticizing vehemently President Trump for deploying the guard in DC, when the White House there was a riot. When there were riots in the city, there are riots and other cities all across our country. And we heard from Democrats, oh no, we can't use the Guard. No, that's an American. No, that's wrong. And now we have a National Guard here at the Capitol without any end in sight. We need answers to these questions."

Before he even said a word, we were expecting this hearing to be a lot more contentious than the one Becerra testified at yesterday in front of the Senate Health Committee. Because this one, the Finance Committee where he is today, is the committee that has to vote on his nomination.
