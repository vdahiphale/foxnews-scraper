That group is said to be thinking about giving the moderator a mute button. The president is insisting that polls show he won the debate and the system is just fine. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight live on the North Lawn. Good evening, John.",

One is he said Barrett will almost certainly come out of committee in time to have a vote before the election, but there are a couple of concerns with that. One is really about some of these vulnerable Republican senators, somebody like a Susan Collins, who yes, she has said she wouldn't vote in favor of a justice before the election. But it's one thing to say it, and it's another thing to have to do it when you're right up against a hard election. And so I think that there is some consideration to giving someone like a Susan Collins, a Cory Gardner, a little bit of space in pushing this beyond the election. There are risks in doing that, though, particularly if President Trump loses and Democrats take back the Senate. Yes, McConnell said, and he's right, that their terms to extend, but the political dynamics could change. And there's of course the possibility that we won't know the outcome of the election for some time, particularly if it's quite close.",

But if the voters just kicked him out of office and kicked the Republicans out of office, then it really is seen -- the Americans will see it as less legitimate. They have a mandate now. They need to do it. This is a winning issue for Republicans overall. In 2016, when Donald Trump ran, 26 percent of his voters said the number one issue for them was the Supreme Court. This is a shot in the arm. Victory begets victory. If you get a Supreme Court win the week before the election, that's going to be a shot in the arm to voters.

What the difference is between mass-going Catholics, people who go to mass regularly, and those who don't, those mass-going are really much more in line with evangelicals and are indistinguishable from evangelicals on everything except transubstantiation. But the issue for Catholics in this election is that Joe Biden, if he is elected, will be the first Catholic president in American history who supports taxpayer-funded abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, which is a Democratic orthodoxy. For 47 years he supported the Hyde Amendment. He reversed it in order to get this nomination. That is a scandal for the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church teaches, and it's not an optional view for faithful Catholics, that human life is sacred and the taking of unborn life is a grave moral evil. Joe Biden dissents from that position. And so his candidacy is a scandal for the Catholic Church. And the bishop's silence on this, the fact that they're going to have a Catholic president who rebuts them on the fundamental issue of human life, that's a scandal. Their silence is a scandal.",

Senator Tillis, who's trailing his Democratic opponent in recent polls, declared white supremacy or any organizations that are antagonistic should be condemned 24/7. Senator Daines, who's in a tough reelection race, quipped, it was a barroom brawl and as we say in Montana, it got a little Western at times. So, it just takes some days away from the campaigns."

And some states have adopted an approach to this with regard to the counting of mail-in ballot, it could delay the results. It could happen. Would have to wait to find out who won. But there's nothing that federal government can do about that. If a given state decides to conduct an election in a certain way, that's the way it will be conducted. In my state, for example, we used to mostly vote in person. This time, there'll be more mail-in voting because of the coronavirus. I accept that as the outcome in my state of how the election is going to be conducted, and I'll adjust my campaign accordingly. Who knows? I mean, we think this will be settled well before the end of the year no matter, you know, how many states may end up having short-term election disputes. We saw it in 2000, go on for five weeks.

      "utterance": "Yes, there are a couple of considerations that McConnell is weighing here. One is he said Barrett will almost certainly come out of committee in time to have a vote before the election, but there are a couple of concerns with that. One is really about some of these vulnerable Republican senators, somebody like a Susan Collins, who yes, she has said she wouldn't vote in favor of a justice before the election. But it's one thing to say it, and it's another thing to have to do it when you're right up against a hard election. And so I think that there is some consideration to giving someone like a Susan Collins, a Cory Gardner, a little bit of space in pushing this beyond the election. There are risks in doing that, though, particularly if President Trump loses and Democrats take back the Senate. Yes, McConnell said, and he's right, that their terms to extend, but the political dynamics could change. And there's of course the possibility that we won't know the outcome of the election for some time, particularly if it's quite close."

The president has -- it's the height of legitimacy up until Election Day because he's got a mandate from the voters from the last election. Once the voters go to vote, yes, he is still president, yes, the Senate still has those powers until a new Senate is seated. But if the voters just kicked him out of office and kicked the Republicans out of office, then it really is seen -- the Americans will see it as less legitimate. They have a mandate now. They need to do it. This is a winning issue for Republicans overall. In 2016, when Donald Trump ran, 26 percent of his voters said the number one issue for them was the Supreme Court. This is a shot in the arm. Victory begets victory. If you get a Supreme Court win the week before the election, that's going to be a shot in the arm to voters. They're going to go out and they're going to vote Republican to reward the president and say we want more of this."

      "utterance": "Terrible idea. I want the candidates to self-mute little more. I don't want anybody external to mute them. It's not appropriate. And any moderator who puts themselves in the position of muting the man running for president, the sitting president, and the former vice president running for president -- think about that person after the debate is over. You muted one candidate 52 times. You only muted the other 30 times. This is not the appropriate way to conduct a debate. It's up to the candidates. And the candidates are going to either be seen for their merits and their warts. And if they have each, we need to know it as a country. So it's live TV, the candidates on stage have to show America who they are, how they behave, how they speak, and how polite they are. And if you don't think being able to hear a candidate is an important issue, then don't worry about interruptions. If you're like me and you thought that debate was a train wreck because you couldn't hear what people were saying because all they did was talk on top of each other, then you want them to behave better standing on that stage. So self-mute."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. The format of that debate I think may actually act as the biggest change in candida behavior here. It's not just going to be two of them on stage. They are going to have voters with them. And so much of that debate is about how the candidates seem to interact with those voters, particularly when they are taking really personal questions about things going on in these people's lives. And I think both of the candidates will have to take that into consideration. What do you want your posture, your attitude to be when you're literally surrounded by Americans who are bringing pressing questions to you?"

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Joe Biden in the debate mentioning that he's Irish Catholic. No one saying the Catholic vote is monolithic, but it is important -- 11 of the past 12 elections, the winner had the winner of the Catholic vote as well. This as the Senate continues to Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader saying about this confirmation process, quote, \"Not a single Democrat will make these attacks or make personal religious beliefs an issue.\" Republicans putting out that Mazie Hirono yesterday saying she is not sure whether her, Barrett's, closely held views can be separated from her ability to make objective, fair decisions. The Republicans inferring religious views. We're back with our panel. Marc, what about this and the Catholic vote?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "First of all, there really isn't a Catholic vote per se. If you look at the numbers in 2018, about 50 percent of Catholics voted for the Democrats and about 49 percent voted for Republicans, and they tend to split more on issues along party affiliation than church affiliation. What the difference is between mass-going Catholics, people who go to mass regularly, and those who don't, those mass-going are really much more in line with evangelicals and are indistinguishable from evangelicals on everything except transubstantiation. But the issue for Catholics in this election is that Joe Biden, if he is elected, will be the first Catholic president in American history who supports taxpayer-funded abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, which is a Democratic orthodoxy. For 47 years he supported the Hyde Amendment. He reversed it in order to get this nomination. That is a scandal for the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church teaches, and it's not an optional view for faithful Catholics, that human life is sacred and the taking of unborn life is a grave moral evil. Joe Biden dissents from that position. And so his candidacy is a scandal for the Catholic Church. And the bishop's silence on this, the fact that they're going to have a Catholic president who rebuts them on the fundamental issue of human life, that's a scandal. Their silence is a scandal."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PACE",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, Biden's Catholic faith is something he has talked about for quite some time. He is a churchgoer, he brings a press pool with him when he goes to church now on Sundays because he's the nominee. So he certainly doesn't hide his faith. And he also has talked pretty openly over the years about this kind of balance between his faith and some of his public positions, particularly about abortion. And it has been a bit of a kind of tortured process, and he is pretty open about that. And I think that he tries to speak to Catholics who have that same internal debate about the teachings of the church and perhaps their own views."

    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. If the Democrats at that hearing say anything that makes it appear as if she is not qualified to sit on the Supreme Court because of her faith, because the dogma lives too loudly in her, as Senator Dianne Feinstein said, it's going to put the Democrats in a very uncomfortable position. We are a very tolerant country, and we understand that one of the things that people have in them that makes them good people is a mix of issues. It's your ideology, it's your personality, it's your faith, it's your traditions, it's your heritage. All of this goes into making us who we are as individuals. And when someone he says that the religion in you speak steel loudly, we offend. That is an offensive thing to say. Now, in the public square we don't make rulings based on religion, but we welcome everybody into the public square no matter whether they're religious or irreligious, and that's the line the Democrats have to walk. So they better stick to ideological attacks, not religious attacks."

Her father was overwhelmed with emotion when he read the label saying \"Drink this for me. You're a grandpa to be.\" You see the wine bottle's label had that message and an image of her sonogram. Great news. As Randy Long cleaned out his garage in Montgomery, Alabama, he found an old bucket of baseballs and donated them to a local batting cage. With that, the 72-year-old left a note of how he used to pitch those same balls to his son and then to his grandson. He hopes the next generation of dads and grandpas will continue that tradition, passing on some good pitches. From one generation to another. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
