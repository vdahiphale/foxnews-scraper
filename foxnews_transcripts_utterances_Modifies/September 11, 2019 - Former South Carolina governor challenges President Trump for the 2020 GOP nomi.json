It is a very different Lower Manhattan today, just as we are a very different country today. And you know what? We're all over it today, as we should be, remembering a nation that has bounced back and markets that had bounced back too. Both weren't supposed to happen. Both are remarkable stories.  And that's why we are leading with this story. It's that big and important, with Eric Shawn at Ground Zero on remembering those who lost their lives, market watchers Ted Weisberg and Art Hogan remembering how investments were considered lost, but came back, and then the former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on what needs to be done to avoid a repeat of that horrible day.  We begin with Eric in New York City -- Eric.",

And although it's been 18 years, it, at times, feels frankly that not one day has gone by. And today, this morning, we witnessed the familiar ritual. The family members, loved ones and officials gathered again here at what was Ground Zero and is now the gleaming World Trade Center to remember the loved ones who were lost. There was the reading of the names, the two moments of silence for when each tower fell, and the other two for when the buildings were hit, and then collapsed.  Their attributes and tears and, for many, the pain and sorrow, despite the years, have not receded.",

And, Neil, sadly, that number is expected to surpass the death toll of that day in a few years.  There was one noted speaker, Nicholas Haros, whose 76-year-old mother, Frances, was killed on 9/11. He tore into Michigan Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and the so-called Squad after her comments about -- quote -- \"Some people did something on 9/11.\"   Here were some of his blunt and direct comments directed at Omar.  NICHOLAS HAROS JR., SON OF 9/11 VICTIM: I was attacked. Your relatives and friends were attacked. Our constitutional freedoms were attacked. And our nation's founding on Judeo-Christian principles were attacked. That's what some people did. Got that now?",

      "sentences": "Eric, thank you very, very much.  People forget that this was an attack also on the financial capital of the world, New York. It wasn't by accident that those towers were chosen that day.   And just to put it in perspective, the stock market never opened that day because of the attacks. It wouldn't open for another six days, but the day before, the Dow had finished at 9605. When trading did resume on the 17th, there was almost a freefall, stocks careening 684 points, the biggest loss up until that time in a single day, about 7.1 percent. By the time the week ended, a collapse of about 1,370 points, 14 percent. But I want to put that in some perspective with this chart, showing from where we went down to where we are now, the Dow within a couple hundred points of a brand-new record right now. We have essentially tripled in that period of time, a reminder that the chart itself can be jagged and confusing, and if you live in any of those down jagged moments, a little bit disquieting, to put it mildly.  But it is a testament to capitalism, as well as maybe us in this country, that we always come back. We always see the chart inexorably going up.  These gentlemen know it very well. They follow that chart and follow these markets well before then, since then, and even now. Ted Weisberg, Art Hogan joining from outside the New York Stock Exchange.

I mean, this is -- this is America. This is the psyche of America. And this is one thing that the rest of the world, unfortunately, has trouble understanding.

And you're living in those moments. You can't make light of them or dismiss them, but, inexorably, we get through them. We go -- like, we go up from them.

It represents our country. And we have had our ups and downs. 1987, obviously, that felt like that was the end of the world, when the market crashed in October. We certainly -- a couple of times in the last nine years, we have certainly gone in and out of terrible times in this market.   But when you step back and look at this, this is a country that has been able to pull itself up by its bootstraps and recover from a lot of terrible things; 9/11 was probably one of the worst.",

Even now, to this day, 18 years later, when you're inside that building, and you hear a loud bang out in the street, everything stops and everybody starts looking towards the windows. But none of us that were there then will ever forget it. And Dick Grasso was the spirit of the stock exchange.

That's such an important thing to remind everybody about, because, obviously, there are times in our history where we think about how divided we can be politically. And there were no Democrats and no Republicans in the weeks and months after 9/11.  The same thing was true in our industry, one of the most competitive industries in the world. And one of our largest competitors at the time needed a great deal of help, because they lost most -- most of their employees and a lot of their technology.  And all of us stepped in to make sure the people that were still around could get up and go and have a place to go to work and keep their business running.  So I think that that's the important part of what we can take away from this today is your reminder that that's what we do as a country.

E-cigarettes are not even indicated for kids under the age of 18. And we're finding that these flavors, the bubble gum, the mango, the you name it, is probably the main thing that's luring kids. So, no, if we have a chance to curb that, even if it's at the expense of adults' choice, I will be honest with you, Neil, the family doctor in me is really coming out here. OK, so the adult doesn't get the mango flavor. I know that they want it. But if we know that kids are going to be less likely to use these products, and we can potentially affect millions of lives, I'm all for that. And the other thing is, Neil, the other thing is, you're right. There are a lot of people in terms of adults who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Now, I will be honest with you. There's a lot we can talk about with that. But there's -- it's not necessarily an FDA-approved way to quit smoking for adults. This is what I would say. If they help you quit smoking, I think that's great. But there are many people who use e-cigarettes and still smoke cigarettes.",

He preferred corporate reformer to corporate raider. And for this oilman turned all sorts of energy alternatives man, it was about making sure it was America, and only America, providing those energy sources, not OPEC, not anyone else. Energy independence was his goal. In no small way, he made it a reality. He bet big. He won big. He lost big. He was that big. But for this billionaire who only liked to joke it was only money, just his talking about his exploits in corporate raids would end up making him still more money. Pickens' book \"The First Billion Is the Hardest\" became a sensation, unusual for a business book. As The Wall Street Journal pointed out, his fans were legion, young and old, liberal and conservative. Presidents sought him out here office and, in the case of Ronald Reagan, relied on his financial support for the library he would build after leaving office. They valued his counsel as much as his cash and his cachet. To hear him was to want to hear more from him and the epic corporate battles that would define him. Pickens would electrify audiences, as much as he would petrify executives. He was that rare corporate figure, bigger than life, on a mission to say energy self-reliance should be this country's mission in life.

And that's why we are leading with this story. It's that big and important, with Eric Shawn at Ground Zero on remembering those who lost their lives, market watchers Ted Weisberg and Art Hogan remembering how investments were considered lost, but came back, and then the former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson on what needs to be done to avoid a repeat of that horrible day.

The family members, loved ones and officials gathered again here at what was Ground Zero and is now the gleaming World Trade Center to remember the loved ones who were lost. There was the reading of the names, the two moments of silence for when each tower fell, and the other two for when the buildings were hit, and then collapsed.

And, Neil, sadly, that number is expected to surpass the death toll of that day in a few years. There was one noted speaker, Nicholas Haros, whose 76-year-old mother, Frances, was killed on 9/11. He tore into Michigan Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and the so-called Squad after her comments about -- quote -- \"Some people did something on 9/11.\" Here were some of his blunt and direct comments directed at Omar. NICHOLAS HAROS JR., SON OF 9/11 VICTIM: I was attacked. Your relatives and friends were attacked. Our constitutional freedoms were attacked.

It wasn't by accident that those towers were chosen that day. And just to put it in perspective, the stock market never opened that day because of the attacks. It wouldn't open for another six days, but the day before, the Dow had finished at 9605. When trading did resume on the 17th, there was almost a freefall, stocks careening 684 points, the biggest loss up until that time in a single day, about 7.1 percent. By the time the week ended, a collapse of about 1,370 points, 14 percent. But I want to put that in some perspective with this chart, showing from where we went down to where we are now, the Dow within a couple hundred points of a brand-new record right now. We have essentially tripled in that period of time, a reminder that the chart itself can be jagged and confusing, and if you live in any of those down jagged moments, a little bit disquieting, to put it mildly. But it is a testament to capitalism, as well as maybe us in this country, that we always come back. We always see the chart inexorably going up. These gentlemen know it very well. They follow that chart and follow these markets well before then, since then, and even now. Ted Weisberg, Art Hogan joining from outside the New York Stock Exchange.

I mean, this is -- this is America. This is the psyche of America. And this is one thing that the rest of the world, unfortunately, has trouble understanding. As you pointed out, the stock market has tripled since those trading lows following 9/11/2001, a lot of ups and downs, a lot of hand-wringing, a lot of tears, but the general direction has been up, which is a reflection of this great country that we all live in."

And you're living in those moments. You can't make light of them or dismiss them, but, inexorably, we get through them. We go -- like, we go up from them.

And I think when you back up and look at a chart like that -- and, Neil, you're very good at that at look -- taking the longer-term perspective and saying, this doesn't just represent capital -- the capitalist country that we are, the ability to raise capital for companies that are starting and the long-run success we have had. It represents our country. And we have had our ups and downs. 1987, obviously, that felt like that was the end of the world, when the market crashed in October. We certainly -- a couple of times in the last nine years, we have certainly gone in and out of terrible times in this market. But when you step back and look at this, this is a country that has been able to pull itself up by its bootstraps and recover from a lot of terrible things; 9/11 was probably one of the worst."

But it's what we all did, because that's what we do. We all went to work on that Monday, a lot of our raw emotions. Even now, to this day, 18 years later, when you're inside that building, and you hear a loud bang out in the street, everything stops and everybody starts looking towards the windows. But none of us that were there then will ever forget it. And Dick Grasso was the spirit of the stock exchange. And to this day, he -- in some respects, he's still the spirit of what we do over there every day and what's been -- what's been done over there every day for the last couple of hundred years."

They sang, held hands on the steps of the Capitol. But for the money guys on Wall Street, it was something a little different. They all cooperated with each other, helped each other out to get up and running again. And that was even more remarkable, in a financial sense, because you guys are normally going at each other tooth and nail, right?"

      "speaker": "HOGAN",

That's such an important thing to remind everybody about, because, obviously, there are times in our history where we think about how divided we can be politically. And there were no Democrats and no Republicans in the weeks and months after 9/11. The same thing was true in our industry, one of the most competitive industries in the world. And one of our largest competitors at the time needed a great deal of help, because they lost most -- most of their employees and a lot of their technology. And all of us stepped in to make sure the people that were still around could get up and go and have a place to go to work and keep their business running. So I think that that's the important part of what we can take away from this today is your reminder that that's what we do as a country. We help each other out, we pull together, and then we get better and heal together."

But it's certainly something that I expect that President Trump will be looking forward to in 2020 going to key areas with these swing districts, where the GOP is hoping to win back, especially some of these suburban districts, from the Democrats, and using the same strategy. Also, there was a whole lot of money pouring into this race, outside money, in a very, very competitive race.

We cannot continue to pretend that this financial storm is not about to come ashore, because I believe absolutely certainly that it is. I mean, think about this. If you look at the last 70 years, household -- I'm going to get into numbers. In fact, I won't get into numbers. I'm going to get too wonky real fast. But think about this. We will spend more on interest than we do on national defense in 36 months. We will spend more on interest than we do an all children's programs at the federal level in one year.

In the meantime, what I would like to talk about today is something that's going to be really important for Americans. This is the issue of the Universal Postal Union, Neil, which is an organization we -- which America helped found hundreds of years ago. Basically, what it does is set international postal rates. And last year, the president found out that, under the system of that organization, Americans were really getting taken to the cleaners. We were -- were importing a lot of small packages, and only about 40 percent of those costs were being borne by the foreigners. So he said, fix it. We issued a notice of withdrawal from the Universal Postal Union last October. This is coming to a head this month in Geneva. I'm going over with a delegation with the State Department. And we have on the table two options that an extraordinary Congress could vote on that would keep us in the UPU, but really get a great deal for America. But if we don't, we're out."

So I have got nothing to say about what's going to happen. I have got nothing to speculate on. We negotiate behind closed doors. Take the president at his word that we are going to get a great deal or no deal. Take Ambassador Lighthizer at his word that he's going to negotiate in good faith. Take the Chinese at their word that they're coming here in October.

For kids, if you want a separate -- I get that. But I guess some of the fruit and related flavors that are an enticement to kids, but what if they're an enticement to adults? They can't have them.

E-cigarettes are not even indicated for kids under the age of 18. And we're finding that these flavors, the bubble gum, the mango, the you name it, is probably the main thing that's luring kids. So, no, if we have a chance to curb that, even if it's at the expense of adults' choice, I will be honest with you, Neil, the family doctor in me is really coming out here. OK, so the adult doesn't get the mango flavor. I know that they want it. But if we know that kids are going to be less likely to use these products, and we can potentially affect millions of lives, I'm all for that. And the other thing is, Neil, the other thing is, you're right. There are a lot of people in terms of adults who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Now, I will be honest with you. There's a lot we can talk about with that. But there's -- it's not necessarily an FDA-approved way to quit smoking for adults. This is what I would say. If they help you quit smoking, I think that's great. But there are many people who use e-cigarettes and still smoke cigarettes."

Boone Pickens might have caused hell for big oil executives on whose companies he had set his sights, but, for Pickens, it wasn't personal, it was just business. He preferred corporate reformer to corporate raider. And for this oilman turned all sorts of energy alternatives man, it was about making sure it was America, and only America, providing those energy sources, not OPEC, not anyone else. Energy independence was his goal. In no small way, he made it a reality. He bet big. He won big. He lost big. He was that big. But for this billionaire who only liked to joke it was only money, just his talking about his exploits in corporate raids would end up making him still more money. Pickens' book \"The First Billion Is the Hardest\" became a sensation, unusual for a business book. As The Wall Street Journal pointed out, his fans were legion, young and old, liberal and conservative. Presidents sought him out here office and, in the case of Ronald Reagan, relied on his financial support for the library he would build after leaving office. They valued his counsel as much as his cash and his cachet. To hear him was to want to hear more from him and the epic corporate battles that would define him. Pickens would electrify audiences, as much as he would petrify executives. He was that rare corporate figure, bigger than life, on a mission to say energy self-reliance should be this country's mission in life. And he preached it everywhere, including this show, many, many times."
