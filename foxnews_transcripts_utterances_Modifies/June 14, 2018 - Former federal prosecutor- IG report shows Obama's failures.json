Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And a world of fast-paced developments just as the Justice Department's inspector general issues his scathing report, claiming that former FBI Director James Comey broke with protocol, among other things. We're hearing that two FBI agents were bent on stopping this president from ever becoming president. The New York attorney general, meanwhile, going for broke with a lawsuit targeting this president and his family and his Trump Foundation, of all days, a coincidence. And the Dow dropping as word of that lawsuit hit. So what does that really mean and why does the Dow drop every time things look potentially bad for the president? We're on top of that, fascinating developments today. We have got House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows on the timing issue, Florida Democratic Congressman Val Demings on the whole Comey-Clinton issue, and what it could mean for Democrats in the election. And the former Whitewater special prosecutor Robert Ray on if all this is a very big issue for one Robert Mueller. First, FBN's Edward Lawrence at Justice Department with the latest on that I.G. report -- Edward.",

      "sentences": "Well, Neil, the big takeaway on all of this is that the -- President Trump's confirmation of, so to speak, bias within the FBI, the inspector general's report points to a number of items that might be suspicious in terms of bias in the FBI here.Now, specifically, it pulls out these text messages between the man who was in charge of the FBI Clinton e-mail investigation, who has now left the FBI, and also an FBI attorney, Lisa Page.Now, let me show you exactly what these text messages said. They said,first: \"Trump's not ever going to become president, right? Right?\"And that's from the former attorney Lisa Page in the FBI.Peter Strzok says: \"No, No, he's not. And we will stop it.\"Now, the report was very critical of former FBI Director James Comey, in fact, at one point calling him insubordinate, saying he did not follow proper protocols in some cases, and that led to a possible bias perception within the FBI.Now, they specifically pointed to the July 5 announcement from Comey that he made in saying that there should be no reasonable person bringing charges against Hillary Clinton because of her e-mail controversy there.Now, again, the report very critical of Comey on that front.  Now, it also finds that Clinton's e-mail servers were in fact hacked. They were in fact hacked by foreign actors or bad foreign actors, possibly other foreign countries, getting e-mails. At least one of those e-mails that was taken was listed as secret.Now, all of this has Republicans in Congress very upset, very concerned about exactly what's going on. Senator Lindsey Graham coming out and saying that he's very concerned about the people in charge of the Clinton investigation as to whether they were really in the tank or not. Now, we do have some word from James Comey about all this. He tweeted out just after the report was released, saying that he respect the inspector general's report. He says that he urged them to do this review. The conclusions are reasonable, he says, even though he disagrees with some.He says people of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently. He prays that no director faces this again -- Neil.",

Now, we have been conducting oversight. And yet DOJ and FBI has consistently stonewalled and obstructed our investigation, constitutional responsibility to investigate.And they haven't given us the information. But I think that the last thing is, is that this the tip of the iceberg. Not only are we seeing the fact that classified information actually was compromised, contrary to Director Comey's sworn testimony.But we're also seeing that there was a real bias, a rush in to go into the Russia investigation, at the expense of everything else.

And what we found was is, in that, certainly in those critical times in September and October of 2016, Peter Strzok and the investigative team made a decision to go one direction which would be more damaging to this president than following up on other leads as it relates to Hillary Clinton.

And that's taking it up through May of 2017 in some of the correspondence that we have reviewed. And so, when you look at that, yes, it could delay it. What it should do is send off the alarm bells, because a number of people that showed bias in this report actually worked on the Russia investigation.   And, again, it is just extremely concerning that we would have this kind of bias in the premier law enforcement agency in the world.

In the middle of this day we were going to get the I.G. report, out of nowhere, the New York attorney general all of a sudden went after the Trump Foundation, the Trump family, Donald Trump himself. And a lot of people are reading into that, man, oh, man, that takes sort of the attention off of the I.G. report. And when the markets digest this about an hour and 15 minutes after trading, they went from being up a lot to down a lot. And, as the day ensued, it really could never recover.  So, this is a reminder yet again, whether you like the president, dislike the president, these guys, I always say, are not red or blue on Wall Street. They are green. They love money. They like to make money. And they think that this president, things as they are, is a way to make money, good numbers, good economy, good markets. So, that was potentially disrupted by the unknown, whether that's fair or not. Let's get the read from Catalina publisher Cathy Areu. We got American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, and, last, but last least, Jonas Max Ferris. Jonas, what do you make of that?

Rather, we determined that they were based on the prosecutor's assessment of the facts, the law and past department practice. What the I.G. did conclude was that James Comey violated Department of Justice policies on three occasions, with his July 5 press conference, his October 28 letter to Congress, and his November 6 notification to Congress. Now, many of us agree on that conclusion. And the I.G. report repeatedly says that the Justice Department forbids discussion about ongoing investigations. Again, let me read a quote from the report: \"Comey engaged in ad hoc decision-making based on his personal views, even if it meant rejecting longstanding department policy or practice. We found unpersuasive Comey's explanation as to why transparency was more important than department policy and practice with regard to the reactivated midyear investigation., while, by contrast, department policy and practice were more important to follow with regard to the Clinton Foundation and the Russia investigations. Department policy and practice is to not discuss investigations.\" And, for me, that is the key takeaway today.",

And that includes the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the deputy, Sally Yates, and indeed even President Obama, who commented early on in the investigation and frankly did considerable damage as a result of his comments from October of 2015, suggesting that there was really no there there regarding the Clinton e-mail investigation. So, you know, in the vacuum that was created as the result of the fact that, frankly, Loretta Lynch was someone who should have stepped aside from leading the investigation and didn't, and, similarly, you know, Sally Yates seems to be intimidated by Jim Comey, and then, Jim Comey, of course arrogates to himself the powers of being a prosecutor, rather than just simply limiting himself to being the FBI director.",

Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And a world of fast-paced developments just as the Justice Department's inspector general issues his scathing report, claiming that former FBI Director James Comey broke with protocol, among other things. We're hearing that two FBI agents were bent on stopping this president from ever becoming president. The New York attorney general, meanwhile, going for broke with a lawsuit targeting this president and his family and his Trump Foundation, of all days, a coincidence. And the Dow dropping as word of that lawsuit hit. So what does that really mean and why does the Dow drop every time things look potentially bad for the president? We're on top of that, fascinating developments today. We have got House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows on the timing issue, Florida Democratic Congressman Val Demings on the whole Comey-Clinton issue, and what it could mean for Democrats in the election. And the former Whitewater special prosecutor Robert Ray on if all this is a very big issue for one Robert Mueller. First, FBN's Edward Lawrence at Justice Department with the latest on that I.G. report -- Edward."

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, the big takeaway on all of this is that the -- President Trump's confirmation of, so to speak, bias within the FBI, the inspector general's report points to a number of items that might be suspicious in terms of bias in the FBI here.Now, specifically, it pulls out these text messages between the man who was in charge of the FBI Clinton e-mail investigation, who has now left the FBI, and also an FBI attorney, Lisa Page.Now, let me show you exactly what these text messages said. They said,first: \"Trump's not ever going to become president, right? Right?\"And that's from the former attorney Lisa Page in the FBI.Peter Strzok says: \"No, No, he's not. And we will stop it.\"Now, the report was very critical of former FBI Director James Comey, in fact, at one point calling him insubordinate, saying he did not follow proper protocols in some cases, and that led to a possible bias perception within the FBI.Now, they specifically pointed to the July 5 announcement from Comey that he made in saying that there should be no reasonable person bringing charges against Hillary Clinton because of her e-mail controversy there.Now, again, the report very critical of Comey on that front. Now, it also finds that Clinton's e-mail servers were in fact hacked. They were in fact hacked by foreign actors or bad foreign actors, possibly other foreign countries, getting e-mails. At least one of those e-mails that was taken was listed as secret.Now, all of this has Republicans in Congress very upset, very concerned about exactly what's going on. Senator Lindsey Graham coming out and saying that he's very concerned about the people in charge of the Clinton investigation as to whether they were really in the tank or not. Now, we do have some word from James Comey about all this. He tweeted out just after the report was released, saying that he respect the inspector general's report. He says that he urged them to do this review. The conclusions are reasonable, he says, even though he disagrees with some.He says people of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently. He prays that no director faces this again -- Neil."

With us now, House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows from the beautiful state of North Carolina.Chairman, what do you make of all this? REP. MARK MEADOWS, R—NORTH CAROLINA: Well, obviously, I was in a briefing earlier, started reviewing this I.G. report around 11:00 this morning. And here are some -- three takeaways. One is, why is Peter Strzok still working for the FBI based on this, 17 months of knowingly having a conflict and bias in this damning report? And yet he still there working.The second part of this is..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I don't mean to belabor the report. The reason why I ask is because I thought he was still getting paychecks, but he's not working at the FBI. But you could be right. Go ahead. I'm sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, but it's still -- I mean, he shouldn't be working for the FBI, based on this report.And the fact of the matter is, Rod Rosenstein knew about many of these issues before that.What we also know, that indeed that some of the information that came out in this, Congress has not seen. Now, we have been conducting oversight. And yet DOJ and FBI has consistently stonewalled and obstructed our investigation, constitutional responsibility to investigate.And they haven't given us the information. But I think that the last thing is, is that this the tip of the iceberg. Not only are we seeing the fact that classified information actually was compromised, contrary to Director Comey's sworn testimony.But we're also seeing that there was a real bias, a rush in to go into the Russia investigation, at the expense of everything else. So, as people start to read through this, I think you will find that not only are we troubled by it, but we should be alarmed by it. And I, for one, will continue to work and report back to you, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Chairman, one of things I was reading in the report myself is that the inspector general accused the former FBI Director James Comey of a lot of things, including insubordination, big-footing his bosses at the Justice Department, who should normally make any public pronouncements, stumbling through how he handled the whole e-mail thing with Hillary Clinton, but that, for all of that, he exhibited no bias. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the reason. And we got some clarification. So I want to let you know that, in there, they were saying there were a number of individuals that showed extreme bias. But because there were so many people in the decision-making process, they came to the conclusion that not all of them could have worked together and having a biased recommendation. Yet, when you read the report, you can see not one, not two, but five or more FBI investigators had bias and really should have recused themselves in this. And so pages 420 and 421 start to give some analysis of what really the inspector general thought of the biased claims."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, I know the instructor general, Mr. Horowitz, or will be up on Capitol talking to both branches here. So, ahead of that, something that comes up is that a number of Democrats are saying, for all the Republicans' whining about whether this whole thing is a trumped-up thing against Donald Trump, no pun intended, sir, it was his investigation and stumbling around, James Comey, they're referring to, that cost our candidate the election. What do you make of that? That almost seems to be the official position I have heard from not all, but many on the left."

Let me tell you why he won the election. Because the American people have had enough of Washington, D.C.'s business-as-usual attitude. And it's not the Russians. It's not Director Comey. It's not any of that. It was the American people that..."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "No. I mean, you can't read the report and actually -- a thinking person cannot read the report and actually have that conclusion, because what we do know, Peter Strzok, when the Anthony Weiner laptops came out, he made a choice not to go after that and not to look at that and to focus on the Russia of collusion investigation. So he made a conscious choice to go after what he thought would be most damaging to this president, instead of actually going and following..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do we know that for sure? Now, I didn't read the report. You have had more access to it than I, sir. And I'm just wondering, when they were referring and when he and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were texting back and forth with one another, this guy couldn't be president, we want to make sure this guy, referring to Donald Trump, doesn't become president, was it just their anger, they hated the guy, or were they privy to information on this Russia thing that made them really hate the guy and really fear the guy becoming president? Do we know the context for those remarks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, great question, Neil. And I'm glad you're -- you're wanting classification, because it's not just the text messages. If you look at the decisions, the investigative decisions that were made, there was one standard for Hillary Clinton. There was another for President Trump. And what we found was is, in that, certainly in those critical times in September and October of 2016, Peter Strzok and the investigative team made a decision to go one direction which would be more damaging to this president than following up on other leads as it relates to Hillary Clinton. And you can see that in the context of it. But everybody will dissect that. But it's not just the text messages. And I appreciate you clarifying that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Real quick question on how this affects the Robert Mueller investigation. As you know, he was talking back and forth quite a bit to James Comey. And, of course, now he has to think about how much he goes and presents forward based on conversations and/or questioning he had of Mr. Comey. Earlier on, he had fired Peter Strzok and Lisa Page himself. So, I'm just wondering, in a weird way, just to make sure he has got all the I's dotted and the T's crossed, this delays his final investigation, because he has got to make sure no embarrassments pop up in term of, like, oh, this person said these disparaging remarks, or this person was doing this on the side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the interesting thing. In this I.G. report and in the communication that went back and forth -- and you have got to figure that, at this particular point, in some of the overlooking that we have with this I.G.'s report, there is no mention of any -- in any way of any possible collusion. And that's taking it up through May of 2017 in some of the correspondence that we have reviewed. And so, when you look at that, yes, it could delay it. What it should do is send off the alarm bells, because a number of people that showed bias in this report actually worked on the Russia investigation. And, again, it is just extremely concerning that we would have this kind of bias in the premier law enforcement agency in the world. And I think it's time that we clean house and that we start over and make sure that we return them to the position of honor that most Americans, including myself, hold them."

What did the FBI and largely the DOJ's know and do during the Clinton e-mail investigation? And, more broadly, I think they want to know what role that politics may have played during that investigation and some of the decisions made thereafter. I asked the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, about that recently released I.G. report today during the briefing. And here's what she told me:"

Also, today, Neil, very interesting, the New York state attorney general hit the Trump Foundation with a lawsuit, looking for nearly $3 million in fines and damages, alleging illegal conduct by the front -- by the foundation, including, apparently, they suggest, trying to assist the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Clearly unimpressed by the suit, Sarah Sanders also said today during the briefing that she was basically echoing the president's sentiment that this is a political hit job."

By the way, that lawsuit, Neil, that you and I were just discussing, the one in New York, is the latest in a series of suits the White House would suggest to you that are sort of basically rolled out by Democrats and their backers in this sort of effort to distract the president, maybe getting his taxes. They say this is just more of the same, from their vantage point -- Neil."

From my perspective, it confirms a lot of what we have been hearing both about Director Comey's misjudgments, Attorney General Lynch's misjudgments, and, of course, the blatant bias exhibited by some of the folks inside the FBI. I think what is notable is that this is a report generated by an Obama- appointed official, the inspector general, who is a neutral independent arbiter of these issues. And I think this will be seen in many quarters at least as the definitive report of what actually happened behind the scenes in 2016."

I had a crackpot theory that, if Bob Mueller is doing his work, and a lot of it has relied on conversations he's had and questions back and forth he's had with James Comey, to say nothing earlier on of the research he got from the likes of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page -- and, of course, we know what happened to them -- he's going to have to be extra vigilant and extra careful now in coming up with his final report and recommendations. And could that potentially mean delaying that report to make sure everything is right, that there's no possible boomerang here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "I think that's a fair concern, Neil. I think, if you're Bob Mueller, you have to view Jim Comey at this point as a tainted witness. Right? If you say I'm going to rely on something that Jim Comey told me, I think all Americans by this point are going to take that with multiple grains of salt. So I think, if you're Bob Mueller, you have got to make sure that in whatever conclusions you are going to draw, based on your investigation, that you have independent evidence to support it and you're not going solely on the word of Jim Comey."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "That is a fascinating conclusion, Neil. And I'm not quite sure what to make of it. I think I understand the inspector general basically to be saying that, look, Comey made all sorts of misjudgments. He circumvented the ordinary DOJ procedures in these situations, but I don't find that he was acting based on some political motive. And I think that's one of the hardest things, frankly, for any inspector general to get his head around, because you can never see into Jim Comey's mind to figure out what was driving him to make these decisions. But, at the end of the day, there's no question that, whatever was motivating Comey, he blatantly violated DOJ rules."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, he will argue he violated those rules because the DOJ wasn't moving. He talked to Loretta Lynch about all of this and what he wanted to do. And it seemed like felt stymied or they weren't going to do anything about it, and they weren't keen on him making any pronouncements about it. Yet he did. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes. That's what he says. And, look, I think, right now, a lot of us are kind of sick of this whole holier than thou persona. We have seen it in spades on his book tour. And I think reflected in the I.G.'s report, in that this was an example of Jim Comey basically saying, I'm going to be a one-man band here. I'm not going to follow the protocol. I'm not going to loop in other folks at the Justice Department because I and I alone know what the right thing to do here is. And I think it's backfiring."

One thing that is a little heartening is that, although the inspector general certainly found evidence of bias and bad actors on the part of the FBI and DOJ, it's not clear to me how broadly that bias spread. And I believe to this day that the vast majority of men and women at the FBI are honest, independent, law-abiding, law-enforcing people who are serving their country honorably."

In the middle of this day we were going to get the I.G. report, out of nowhere, the New York attorney general all of a sudden went after the Trump Foundation, the Trump family, Donald Trump himself. And a lot of people are reading into that, man, oh, man, that takes sort of the attention off of the I.G. report. And when the markets digest this about an hour and 15 minutes after trading, they went from being up a lot to down a lot. And, as the day ensued, it really could never recover. So, this is a reminder yet again, whether you like the president, dislike the president, these guys, I always say, are not red or blue on Wall Street. They are green. They love money. They like to make money. And they think that this president, things as they are, is a way to make money, good numbers, good economy, good markets. So, that was potentially disrupted by the unknown, whether that's fair or not. Let's get the read from Catalina publisher Cathy Areu. We got American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, and, last, but last least, Jonas Max Ferris. Jonas, what do you make of that? The markets, I always think, are driven by their basic greed and interest and it's been coming to their advantage to just go with this president and stuff happening under this watch."

Also, after a very successful North Korean summit, all of a sudden, you have this come out. So, yes, call me a little skeptical on the timing of it. And then they're defining it as persistent criminal behavior.

And everyone was very happy when Mueller got on this case, because he is a guy who dots his I's, crosses his T's. He's always been careful.

What the I.G. did conclude was that James Comey violated Department of Justice policies on three occasions, with his July 5 press conference, his October 28 letter to Congress, and his November 6 notification to Congress. Now, many of us agree on that conclusion. And the I.G. report repeatedly says that the Justice Department forbids discussion about ongoing investigations."

We found unpersuasive Comey's explanation as to why transparency was more important than department policy and practice with regard to the reactivated midyear investigation., while, by contrast, department policy and practice were more important to follow with regard to the Clinton Foundation and the Russia investigations.

You know, we did the sales tax increase back in 2006 that I wouldn't vote for. And they said if we did the sales tax, it would fix everything. It was $1.8 billion. That's what 1 percent is. And, unfortunately, we have had it 12 years now, and nothing is fixed."

Well, investments is spending and revenues are taxes. You can call it whatever you want. But when they say, well, we need the investment side, well, that is the spending side. And the revenue side is the tax side. And we're not talking about the things that need to be done, because look, our pensions and health care are going to take up 30 percent of our budget pretty soon. That's insane."

Its average property tax is $8,600 a year. It's well beyond middle class and working poor people to be able to afford to stay here. The problem is, they're the ones that can't leave. The wealthy can."

I feel a little better after our chat, because all the calls we have made to Governor Murphy's office, I thought he just didn't get back to me because he doesn't like overweight anchors. It turns out he ignores bigwigs in his own party. So, I feel a little better. Senator, thank you very, very much."

We are a half away -- hour away, I should say, or thereabouts from hearing from Christopher Wray, the FBI director, to comment on a lot of these developments today and what he makes of the I.G. report. Ahead of that, I have Robert Ray, the former Whitewater independent counsel, what he makes of it all. I am confused, Robert, because Democrats find something to complain about, and it's fair game. A lot of Republicans, the same thing. What about you?"

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "What I think it reflects a colossal failure of leadership, not only within the Department of Justice, but also from President Obama on down. Now, remember, the report, in part, faults a number of people, prominently among them Jim Comey. But there are others who do not escape criticism. And that includes the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the deputy, Sally Yates, and indeed even President Obama, who commented early on in the investigation and frankly did considerable damage as a result of his comments from October of 2015, suggesting that there was really no there there regarding the Clinton e-mail investigation. So, you know, in the vacuum that was created as the result of the fact that, frankly, Loretta Lynch was someone who should have stepped aside from leading the investigation and didn't, and, similarly, you know, Sally Yates seems to be intimidated by Jim Comey, and then, Jim Comey, of course arrogates to himself the powers of being a prosecutor, rather than just simply limiting himself to being the FBI director."

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "I think he -- I mean, he has a point. It's understandable. Michael Horowitz, the inspector general, I think appropriately, weighs in with, wait a minute now, but department procedure is that investigators do investigations. They don't act as prosecutors. They don't announce decisions. And it's contrary to the Department of Justice policy. I think all that is true. Jim Comey in an op-ed that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times that it's not such a simple decision. These were all very, very hard decisions. And I grant him that. But you're right. In the vacuum that was created by the absence of leadership, Jim Comey stepped in. You can criticize that judgment. I think he probably felt that he did the best he could under the circumstances. But the -- basically, all of the sort of collateral consequences that flow from the lack of leadership from the top on down, that's the mess that was created that occasions this 500-page report."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, Robert, I remember the July 2016 presser. It wasn't a presser. It was a statement, what have you. And one of the things that struck me at the time was that he made it very clear at the beginning, I'm not going to take this any further, and then afterwards said she was sloppy, she was reckless and all that stuff. And I talked to a lot of legal scholars who look at this and said he should have taken harsher action, and didn't. I know it's water under a legal bridge here. What do you make of that?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "RAY",

We're going to hear from the present FBI director and what he makes of all of this, Christopher Wray. Very rare to him to have a statement on this. And, of course, he will talk to reporters and get his take on this and what happens to the FBI, where to from here. So much more. That will do it for us. \"The Five\" is next and, of course, that presser coming up as well. END <Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
