Thanks for being with us tonight. And thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and \"Liars, Leakers, & Liberals\" is still on the New York Times bestsellers list. And we're going to hear from the President in a moment on a wide range of topics at his campaign style rally in West Virginia that only just finished up. Plus, my take on the Brett Kavanaugh situation in tonight's \"Opening Statement\" is just moment away.  And then I'll be joined live here in New York in a \"Justice\" exclusive by House Intel Commission Chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, as well as conservative commentator, Michelle Malkin; and NRA TV host Dan Bongino and more.  But first, you watched it here live, the President of the United States fired up a packed crowd in Wheeling, West Virginia in another raucous rally taking on his opponents and touting a long list of accomplishments. Here are some of the highlights.",

This November 6th, you have a chance to reject these disgraceful political hacks. But you can only do it - you have got to vote Republican. I mean, we have good people. They have been taken so far left where Pocahontas is now considered a conservative in the Democratic Party. She is like a conservative person. Pocahontas. Elizabeth Warren, she is considered like a conservative person. These people - they have gone crazy. They have gone loco. How about Cory Booker. Did you watch the performance? He ran Newark, New Jersey into the ground and now, he wants to be President, right? What was the moment he said he had?   I don't think so.

      "sentences": "Yes. More from the President's rally throughout the hour. But first my open. Is it just a he said-she said? Is it really that simple? And why is this now in the hands of the FBI? Why? Because the establishment of Republicans have buckled, caved and bowed to the Democrats or should I say demon rats. That's what I said, demon rats.  The spectacle I saw this week was one of the most of pathetic, disheartening, saddest displays to which this nation has ever stood witness. It was for all intents and purposes a crucifixion of a man who has led the kind of exemplary life few of us can mirror.   Now, you already know I was a felony court judge. I had been both a prosecutor and then the DA. Sex crimes and crimes against women and children were my crusade. I assessed whether cases should go forward, whether the accused should be charged and convicted and if so, as a judge what the sentence should be. No one sympathizes more than I when it comes to women who are the silent victims of crimes. I created the first domestic violence unit in the nation which was the Department of Justice pilot program.  Christine Blasey Ford is a lovely lady who is credible and I believe something happened to her. But she is in over her head and she is being used. No matter how many indelible hippocampus brain comparisons she made. She couldn't remember the fundamentals -- whose house it was, where it was, when the party was, how she got to the house or how she got home -- she waits 36 years not telling her mother, a friend, a high school counselor or anyone before now. If Ford said no one was there, that it was just she and Kavanaugh or it was just he and she alone in the parking lot, then it's a true he said-she said. But once she chose to say there were four people there, it's a they said. Yet all four of they said something happened. They weren't there. They don't know what she is talking about. Now what does that tell you about Ford's memory? If they weren't there, is it possible Kavanaugh wasn't there either?  Now crucial here is Ford's therapy visit in 2012. For the first time in three decades, she says she mentioned Kavanaugh's name. If true, why was the name Kavanaugh not in the therapist notes. And why would Ford's lawyers withhold those therapist notes, at least the part that referred to this alleged event? Why was Ford so evasive when questioned by the prosecutor on this issue? Why did her attorneys interfere with her answering in her testimony on this point? Were methods used to help her recall whatever traumatic event occurred?  If a rape victim undergoes hypnosis, sometime prior to testimony, for the purpose of refreshing her memory of the incident, the court and jury is entitled to know. Because of the risk of confabulation of recent events like television, newspapers that impact one's memory, it is not a reliable means of refreshing one's recollection. Ford's attorneys said she was afraid to fly and had to drive across the country. Yes, we now know she was never told the committee was willing to come to her. We find out she is not afraid to fly. The woman has flown all over the country and the world, the South Pacific and Hawaii. But move all of that out of the way. What we are dealing with here is hypocrisy, not who is right and wrong, who's guilty and who's innocent. This is about people desperate to win at all costs.  Take a man and his family down, no problem. It's the battle of the hypocrites. Jeff Flake is the perfect example. He says after the hearing he's going to vote for Kavanaugh. But the man buckles after two women scream at him while preventing his elevator door from closing.",

But don't you dare blame Brett Kavanaugh for your victimization.  Only when Jeff Flake is dumb enough, weak enough to not even get it. And Cory Booker, the wannabe Spartacus has the gall to stand up and criticize a man who has literally an altar boy on the politics of sexual assault. The ultimate hypocrite, Booker admits groping another young woman when he was 15. Why aren't we going after him? And that genius Senator Mazie Hirono who allegedly graduated from high school, either skipped the presumption of innocence class or she is willing to throw it all away for her political gain. And Mazie, your hypocrisy knows no bounds. When you have the nerve to say the Republicans - the Republicans have tossed out the rules, you are the one who declared Kavanaugh guilty before hearing any testimony simply because it was a woman who was the accuser and you all men shut up.   And you're willing to openly say conservatives are simply not entitled to the presumption of innocence? Who are you? But my favorite, Dianne Feinstein.

That what happened in that therapist office is that a memory was recovered by some means, possibly hypnosis as you suggested in your \"Opening Statement\" and that makes it absolutely inadmissible both in the state of New York and in the state of Maryland and then, frankly, most of states in the union. The reason being, that hypnosis can often cause co confabulation, the creation of a false memory that the affiant, the declarant, the victim firmly believes is true. Now, you and I both agree, something happened to Dr. Ford. We can't say when it happened.

Thanks for being with us tonight. And thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and \"Liars, Leakers, & Liberals\" is still on the New York Times bestsellers list.

Plus, my take on the Brett Kavanaugh situation in tonight's \"Opening Statement\" is just moment away. And then I'll be joined live here in New York in a \"Justice\" exclusive by House Intel Commission Chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, as well as conservative commentator, Michelle Malkin; and NRA TV host Dan Bongino and more. But first, you watched it here live, the President of the United States fired up a packed crowd in Wheeling, West Virginia in another raucous rally taking on his opponents and touting a long list of accomplishments. Here are some of the highlights."

For the last 18 months, Democrats have spent every minute trying to overturn the results of the last election. We had one of the great - we had one of the great - everyday, it's like a job. It's like part of your job description. Get up and fight them. Honestly, the Democrats are a disgrace. They are. They are a disgrace."

They really are. They are so bad. You don't even get it. You'd think they'd like low taxes. You'd think they like a strong military. No crime, strong borders. They don't. They don't. This November 6th, you have a chance to reject these disgraceful political hacks. But you can only do it - you have got to vote Republican. I mean, we have good people. They have been taken so far left where Pocahontas is now considered a conservative in the Democratic Party. She is like a conservative person. Pocahontas. Elizabeth Warren, she is considered like a conservative person. These people - they have gone crazy. They have gone loco. How about Cory Booker. Did you watch the performance? He ran Newark, New Jersey into the ground and now, he wants to be President, right? What was the moment he said he had? I don't think so. I think we'd take Kirk Douglas in his prime, don't we agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes. More from the President's rally throughout the hour. But first my open. Is it just a he said-she said? Is it really that simple? And why is this now in the hands of the FBI? Why? Because the establishment of Republicans have buckled, caved and bowed to the Democrats or should I say demon rats. That's what I said, demon rats. The spectacle I saw this week was one of the most of pathetic, disheartening, saddest displays to which this nation has ever stood witness. It was for all intents and purposes a crucifixion of a man who has led the kind of exemplary life few of us can mirror. Now, you already know I was a felony court judge. I had been both a prosecutor and then the DA. Sex crimes and crimes against women and children were my crusade. I assessed whether cases should go forward, whether the accused should be charged and convicted and if so, as a judge what the sentence should be. No one sympathizes more than I when it comes to women who are the silent victims of crimes. I created the first domestic violence unit in the nation which was the Department of Justice pilot program. Christine Blasey Ford is a lovely lady who is credible and I believe something happened to her. But she is in over her head and she is being used. No matter how many indelible hippocampus brain comparisons she made. She couldn't remember the fundamentals -- whose house it was, where it was, when the party was, how she got to the house or how she got home -- she waits 36 years not telling her mother, a friend, a high school counselor or anyone before now. If Ford said no one was there, that it was just she and Kavanaugh or it was just he and she alone in the parking lot, then it's a true he said-she said. But once she chose to say there were four people there, it's a they said. Yet all four of they said something happened. They weren't there. They don't know what she is talking about. Now what does that tell you about Ford's memory? If they weren't there, is it possible Kavanaugh wasn't there either? Now crucial here is Ford's therapy visit in 2012. For the first time in three decades, she says she mentioned Kavanaugh's name. If true, why was the name Kavanaugh not in the therapist notes. And why would Ford's lawyers withhold those therapist notes, at least the part that referred to this alleged event? Why was Ford so evasive when questioned by the prosecutor on this issue? Why did her attorneys interfere with her answering in her testimony on this point? Were methods used to help her recall whatever traumatic event occurred? If a rape victim undergoes hypnosis, sometime prior to testimony, for the purpose of refreshing her memory of the incident, the court and jury is entitled to know. Because of the risk of confabulation of recent events like television, newspapers that impact one's memory, it is not a reliable means of refreshing one's recollection. Ford's attorneys said she was afraid to fly and had to drive across the country. Yes, we now know she was never told the committee was willing to come to her. We find out she is not afraid to fly. The woman has flown all over the country and the world, the South Pacific and Hawaii. But move all of that out of the way. What we are dealing with here is hypocrisy, not who is right and wrong, who's guilty and who's innocent. This is about people desperate to win at all costs. Take a man and his family down, no problem. It's the battle of the hypocrites. Jeff Flake is the perfect example. He says after the hearing he's going to vote for Kavanaugh. But the man buckles after two women scream at him while preventing his elevator door from closing."

Hundreds of thousands of women have been abused in this country. Take your anger out on the person who abused you. Go to court, convict him, send him to jail, spit on him, I don't care. But don't you dare blame Brett Kavanaugh for your victimization. Only when Jeff Flake is dumb enough, weak enough to not even get it. And Cory Booker, the wannabe Spartacus has the gall to stand up and criticize a man who has literally an altar boy on the politics of sexual assault. The ultimate hypocrite, Booker admits groping another young woman when he was 15. Why aren't we going after him? And that genius Senator Mazie Hirono who allegedly graduated from high school, either skipped the presumption of innocence class or she is willing to throw it all away for her political gain. And Mazie, your hypocrisy knows no bounds. When you have the nerve to say the Republicans - the Republicans have tossed out the rules, you are the one who declared Kavanaugh guilty before hearing any testimony simply because it was a woman who was the accuser and you all men shut up. And you're willing to openly say conservatives are simply not entitled to the presumption of innocence? Who are you? But my favorite, Dianne Feinstein.

It was clear that you had outside groups funding an attack on him. And they knew, I guarantee you, many outside groups knew that they were going to drop this bomb because it was their last-second chance to try to stop Kavanaugh from becoming a Supreme Court justice.

So there's 20 pages of the rest of the content of the FISA that we want out, and what this is so important is because this gets to the insurance policy that remember Strzok and Page were talking about? We believe this was the insurance policy, okay, the content that's left. You also have people who are saying, \"Oh, they're really bad stuff.\" It really wasn't the dossier, it wasn't the dossier that was used, the Chris Steele dossier and it wasn't the fake news stories, it was really all that stuff that's behind the redactions. Okay, so it's not true what's behind those redactions, the American people do need to know about."

But I wonder, is this connected to Rod Rosenstein? He's fired or he's not fired. There is a meeting, there is not a meeting. Is this about Rosenstein applying leverage of some sort?

They say that we are going to - we are going to ruin national security. And what happens every time? The information comes out and it makes the Department of Justice, FBI and all the Clinton campaign people and Fusion GPS, they all look bad."

And I think all they are trying to do is stall until after the midterms. I've always believed this, but we are right at the end, right? We have got 20 pages of the content, which is the insurance policy. We have the Bruce Ohr 302s, right? Which are the reports."

Women who know men, who have been falsely accused of exactly the crimes of crimes that Judge Kavanaugh has been accused of. And they know what it's like to fight for five, 10, 15, 20 years to clear innocent men's names. The thing is that, and you are a veteran of the criminal justice system. And you have seen so many times, Judge, people lie. People are capable of lying about all sorts of things.

But with that said, what I would have focused on would be the visit to the therapist in 2012 by Dr. Ford. People are struggling with this conundrum, Judge, how can two people be so credible when one of them demonstrably has to be lying. The answer may very well be that neither one of them are lying. That what happened in that therapist office is that a memory was recovered by some means, possibly hypnosis as you suggested in your \"Opening Statement\" and that makes it absolutely inadmissible both in the state of New York and in the state of Maryland and then, frankly, most of states in the union. The reason being, that hypnosis can often cause co confabulation, the creation of a false memory that the affiant, the declarant, the victim firmly believes is true. Now, you and I both agree, something happened to Dr. Ford. We can't say when it happened. But I was very, very troubled by not pinpointing how is it that she is able to identify Brett Kavanaugh as her attacker."

I don't have you on to discuss that, but more the reality that there are people out there who are honest in their claims but just can't be specific enough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZPATRICK",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I prosecuted the lead case in New York 35 years ago. A woman was brutally raped. For months and months, we were so frustrated, she couldn't identify her assailant. We finally went to hypnosis and she was able to identify her assailant and he was convicted and that case was reversed. Fortunately, he was convicted again, but the Court of Appeals said, look, it's just not reliable. You can't cross- examine someone effectively who absolutely believes they are telling the truth and that's only as a result of false memory that was created by hypnosis."
