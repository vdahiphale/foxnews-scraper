Judge, what do you make of James Rosen's story that led the show about a top Justice Department official meeting with people involved in Fusion GPS and the so-called Russia dossier, and did we learn anything from Director Wray's testimony today about alleged irregularities in the investigations both of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump?",

They didn't follow up with aggressive questions. He hid behind the, oh, this is being investigated by the inspector general and I can't really comment on it.  But as for James Rosen's report, this is a profound story. It is one thing for an FBI agent to dislike or even detest that target. They're pursuing mobsters, they hate the mob. They're pursuing terrorists in Times Square, they're not morally ambivalent about a terrorist.   It's quite another thing for a senior person in the Justice Department to have secret relationships with one of the instruments used in the political campaign. Quite frankly, I had never heard of this gentleman before, but even I, who was a bit jaded when it comes to this thing, am scandalized by it. When General Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday last week, he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, not lying to Mother Teresa. You don't expect FBI agents to be saints. They are tough people and they have political opinions like the rest of us. But you also don't expect their bosses in the Justice Department like the number four person there to have some sort of political or perhaps even financial relationships with one of the candidates for president or an instrument that her campaign used.

And they asked all sort of lines of questions, like was the dossier actually used as an impetus to start the investigation into Russia? Were people being paid that were affiliated with the dossier? Was the dossier used to secure a FISA warrant against a Trump affiliate? In each case Wray declined to answer citing the ongoing special counsel investigation.   But the question is whether the actual special counsel investigation itself was not compromised by its involvement with this dossier. And I think the American people deserve to know whether it was, and most importantly I think they deserve to know whether that wiretap application was in any way related to the dossier.
