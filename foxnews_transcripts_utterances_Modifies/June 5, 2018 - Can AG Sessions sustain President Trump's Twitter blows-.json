We're going to show you what did happen today at 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue.  But first, Jeff Sessions has become the president's favorite Twitter target again. So can this steam blows like this, \"The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself.\" The president wrote, \"I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined, and Sessions knew better than most but there was no collusion.\" In moments, President Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, weighing on that. And also, how the president will top the Make America Great Again slogan.

At the time, then-Senator Jeff Sessions was among Donald Trump's more outspoken supporters. In fact, Sessions' close ties with the Trump campaign is why the president tweeted today that Sessions in part, \"knew better than most that there was no collusion.\" And president believes that had Sessions not recused himself, he could have ended the Russia investigation or at the very least, not allowed the appointment of a special counsel.  Instead, Sessions stepped aside the investigation felt that deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Robert Mueller. And two months into the Mueller probe, the president's criticism began, quoting, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes. Where are e-mails and Democratic National Committee server and Intel leakers?\"   That tweet prompted speculation that Sessions would soon be fired. He wasn't, although, the criticism continued. But late last month, President Trump appeared to switch his critical focus posting a flurry of tweets on what he calls the witch hunt like this one, quoting, \"The fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record-setting economic numbers, and so, they keep talking about the phony Russian witch hunt. But then South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy went on CBS and appeared to pop open the can of worms. Watch.   REP. TREY GOWDY, R—S.C., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: If I were the president, and I pick someone to be the country's chief law enforcement officer. And they told me later, by the way, I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated, too. That's how I read that.

BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP'S 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: You know, I mean, I don't think, I make my job any more difficult. Look, I had a relationship with Jeff Sessions over the campaign, as you know, I was one of the very first people on the campaign. I was there since February of 2015.  You know, it's a disappointment for myself, as well. You knows, he knows as much as I do that there was no collusion. He was there, he was around, it wasn't like he was in there making larger decisions, but he was -- he was watching.

I mean, we run the largest date operation survey work in the country, and we see that America is starting to see that their personal economies are getting better, national security is getting better. The things that around there happening. And I think, they're starting to see this accomplishment. As much as the media doesn't want outside of a couple of stations and a couple people, how much they don't want to talk about accomplishments, they're starting to get through. And that's why today, one of the things I'm introducing today is PromisesKept.com. And because that site has every accomplishment almost that Trump has done, you know there might be a few missing we're going continue to add. And there's so many accomplishments, almost every 24 to 36 hours there's another one since he's become, president. And 500 days, he's accomplished so much.   He's turbocharged the economy, he's crushed ISIS, he's killed all these -- you know, regulations that were killing jobs. I mean, he just continues to do these things, but on the site, those are the top things that people know about, but all these little things, hundreds of them the people can go through and see.  The media doesn't talk about those things, and I think when suburban people see that and they see this personal economy, that improvement, that they can put their kid in ballerina class, they can buy a new car, they can do these things.

The 55-year-old fashionista was found dead in her Manhattan apartment by her housekeeper. Kate Spade was one of the first of a powerful wave of American female designers in the 1990s. Her brand is associated with bright, colorful prints and fantastic bags and it literally any young woman who grew up during this period was dying to have a piece of what Kate Spade was designing and making. She was an inspiration to many. She was survived by her husband, Andrew, of 24 years. She just recently sold her business for a lot of money to coach. She has a 13-year-old daughter, Frances, and our thoughts are with them tonight. What a terrible, terrible story that surfaced this morning. Also developing this evening, tonight they are calling it now a competition and not a pageant. That is the new motto of the Miss America organization which announced today that they are banishing the signature bikini portion of the pageant. Instead, contestants will now take part in a live interactive session with the judges and the organization is also getting rid of the evening gown portion of the competition. What is going to be left telling women that they should wear whatever makes wear uncomfortable. I think some people might show up in sweatpants in that case. Is this enough or is these changes that shouldn't be happening? Shannon Bream, our good friend, joins us tonight. It's so great to be here with Tucker and Shannon and all these great people.

So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined, and Sessions knew better than most but there was no collusion.\" In moments, President Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, weighing on that.

At the time, then-Senator Jeff Sessions was among Donald Trump's more outspoken supporters. In fact, Sessions' close ties with the Trump campaign is why the president tweeted today that Sessions in part, \"knew better than most that there was no collusion.\" And president believes that had Sessions not recused himself, he could have ended the Russia investigation or at the very least, not allowed the appointment of a special counsel. Instead, Sessions stepped aside the investigation felt that deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Robert Mueller. And two months into the Mueller probe, the president's criticism began, quoting, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes. Where are e-mails and Democratic National Committee server and Intel leakers?\" That tweet prompted speculation that Sessions would soon be fired. He wasn't, although, the criticism continued. But late last month, President Trump appeared to switch his critical focus posting a flurry of tweets on what he calls the witch hunt like this one, quoting, \"The fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record-setting economic numbers, and so, they keep talking about the phony Russian witch hunt. But then South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy went on CBS and appeared to pop open the can of worms. Watch. REP. TREY GOWDY, R—S.C., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: If I were the president, and I pick someone to be the country's chief law enforcement officer. And they told me later, by the way, I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated, too. That's how I read that.

Thanks for being here tonight. You know you listen to Trace's reporting there. How difficult does that kind of stuff make your job in terms of the tweets, the Jeff Sessions' issue? BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP'S 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: You know, I mean, I don't think, I make my job any more difficult. Look, I had a relationship with Jeff Sessions over the campaign, as you know, I was one of the very first people on the campaign. I was there since February of 2015. You know, it's a disappointment for myself, as well. You knows, he knows as much as I do that there was no collusion. He was there, he was around, it wasn't like he was in there making larger decisions, but he was -- he was watching.

Blue-collar voters, the forgotten men and women of America that the president talked so much about. You say that the data so far looks really good. What about those groups? How are you going to get them to turn out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARSCALE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, there's a couple of things here. And you got two parts, this said. First is, the data has never looked better for the president. I don't say that and people articles are written that I say that just to make it happy, it's just not true. I mean, we run the largest date operation survey work in the country, and we see that America is starting to see that their personal economies are getting better, national security is getting better. The things that around there happening. And I think, they're starting to see this accomplishment. As much as the media doesn't want outside of a couple of stations and a couple people, how much they don't want to talk about accomplishments, they're starting to get through. And that's why today, one of the things I'm introducing today is PromisesKept.com. And because that site has every accomplishment almost that Trump has done, you know there might be a few missing we're going continue to add. And there's so many accomplishments, almost every 24 to 36 hours there's another one since he's become, president. And 500 days, he's accomplished so much. He's turbocharged the economy, he's crushed ISIS, he's killed all these -- you know, regulations that were killing jobs. I mean, he just continues to do these things, but on the site, those are the top things that people know about, but all these little things, hundreds of them the people can go through and see. The media doesn't talk about those things, and I think when suburban people see that and they see this personal economy, that improvement, that they can put their kid in ballerina class, they can buy a new car, they can do these things. It's going to have a significant impact."

Because there are -- you know, people in some of these suburban areas who are watching all that, and they're kind of wondering whether or not the wheels are coming off."

And coming into Washington, D.C., you really learn what a bubble is. And I think that people see so much different view here than the American. When Americans coming home in suburban Philadelphia, they're saying, how am I going to, you know, pay my car payment? How am I get my kid to the soccer camp tonight? You know, the noise level is a lot less, and what they really feel and what they go vote for is the things that really affect them. And the D.C. and the media can spin up all these stories they want, but what's funny about it the more they do it the more Trump continues to rise."

And it really worries me, it worries me that possibly three to four executives have enough control to control exactly what you read, what you -- what you listen to, what you see. And I think that it can have a biased opinion on people, and I think that what we need to do is have an open area, and I think of a freedom that you can consume all types of content and make decision yourself.

And what you can do is log on this web site, Promiseskept.com, and you can see that each and every promise he's made, which is hundreds in. I mean, one on nearly every 36 hours, he's trying to keep more promises kept in probably any president in the history of this country."

Here now the Democratic congressional candidate for California's 48th District Omar Siddiqui. He is also an FBI National Director of Special Projects and as a former adviser with the CIA on counterterrorism issues. Omar, thank you very much for being here tonight. It's good to have you here. Did that -- did that really happen? What happened? OMAR SIDDIQUI, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 48TH DISTRICT: Hi Martha. Thank you so much. Well, what happened was I had some California delegates come up to me and say by far you're the best candidate, you have the most experience. You're an engineer, you're a lawyer, you have government experience. You've worked with the FBI. But you know what, the name of Omar Siddiqui will not work in Orange County. You need to change your name. And you can imagine that was just unacceptable to me. I do not want to be judged on the color of my skin but rather the content of my character."

      "speaker": "SIDDIQUI",
      "utterance": "Well, what I did was I told them point-blank, I said I'm not going to change my name. I'm not going to drop out of the race because I think someone of the name of Omar Siddiqui is not going to have a chance in Orange County and I moved forward. And we ran an excellent campaign, a clean campaign, and we did very well so I'm very excited about the results that are going to come out tonight."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Another -- you talk a lot about the division in the country and that you'd like to be someone who heals those divisions. Do you think that you know, that that was part of your message problem as far as those Democrats in power were concerned in your district?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIDDIQUI",
      "utterance": "I love that. Well, the Democratic Party it's supposed to be the party of the underrepresented and the party of the marginalized. During the course of our campaign, we knocked on thousands and thousands of doors and one thing was a recurring theme was that the underrepresented communities were not getting attention point-blank. So yes party -- to have party unity you need to reach out to the under marginalized. We needed to make sure that we had all races, all cultures, they are a significant portion of our constituency here in Orange County. I mean, you basically have a civil war of sorts going on in California. Now you have the more rural areas that would like to see more conservative governance and then you have the you know, very (INAUDIBLE) in blue areas that have you know, a lot of issues with high taxes and people fleeing the state, you know, so how would you work to pull that back together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIDDIQUI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what we need to do is we need to make sure that we put representation back in your representative. And I think Congressman Rohrabacher has been absent from the district. The only time he shows up at the district is when it comes to City Council meetings to spread hate and divide the county, and that's the wrong -- that's the wrong message. What we need to do for the county is focus on issues that affect everyone and everywhere, homelessness for example, environmental issues, the economy for example. But you don't see any of that from Rohrabacher but you'll see that from our campaign for sure when we win."

Thank you very much, Sir."

The whole bet with the Democratic Party in California is the changing demographics win it for them. And the right to some extent, immigration has turned it from one of the most reliably Republican states to the most reliably Democratic state. The question now is about the economy. Can you have a state that is basically Latin American in its economic structure, huge pool of poor people, a small group of rich people, no middleclass? That's what California is trying. Its leaders are basically self-consciously pushing policies that results in that. Half of all Californians asked this week said they'd prefer to leave the state, a lot of them already have. What happens then when there's no sort of normal middle-class, you know people making $95,000 left with kids? I think that's actually where California is going. I don't know what happens."

And so if you live in a state where Jerry Brown is considered sort of sensible industry it tells you a lot. It looks like Gavin Newsom the former Mayor of San Francisco is going to get it. Also pretty interesting, the seat -- not just liberal but the same species of sort of pro-tech liberal will be running the state. I don't see anybody and I talked to people in California a lot in state politics at a prominent level who's concerned about the death of the state's middle class, they act like it's just not a big deal. But you know, the Venezuelan economic model doesn't work. You know, in the end, it collapses. You need a middle class to sustain an economy and they're losing there's."

      "utterance": "What's terrifying -- I'm interested in standards and their decline for a bunch of different reasons, diversity is one of them or the sort of ideology of diversity. But under the Obama administration, they change -- the FAA changed the standards for becoming an air traffic controller and instituted a screen, a biographical test that awarded points based on how little you knew. So for example, if you were unemployed for the last three years, you've got more points than if you had a job. If you knew nothing about science, you've got more points than if you were a licensed pilot. This is again for an air traffic control job. The intentional result, the least qualified --"

How did this make us safer? Air traffic control is a big deal. It's a linchpin of our economy for one thing. They couldn't answer that because they don't care. That's the point, they don't care whether it makes --"
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's really hard to imagine -- I mean there are a few other areas but an air -- when you look at those maps that show you how many planes are flying across the country at any given moment, it's really hard to imagine a more important job in some ways for safety in this country that the people who are watching the air traffic control."

And by the way, it's not just happening there, it's happening in a lot of other critical parts of American life. But the maintenance of standards, this is an impressive country because we can trust our air traffic control, we take that for granted. We shouldn't and so it's worth fighting back again."

But you know, he's got to face the fact, we are in a different moment now. Let's think about this. The Monica Lewinsky time, it was a different moment for feminism. It was, I am women hear me roar, she's empowered, she's a woman. People would yes, but she's just a girl. No, no, she's a woman, she can make her own decisions. Now Monica is coming to a realization, maybe I was taken advantage of. You sure were taken advantage of, you are also implicit in what you did.

Her brand is associated with bright, colorful prints and fantastic bags and it literally any young woman who grew up during this period was dying to have a piece of what Kate Spade was designing and making. She was an inspiration to many. She was survived by her husband, Andrew, of 24 years. She just recently sold her business for a lot of money to coach. She has a 13-year-old daughter, Frances, and our thoughts are with them tonight. What a terrible, terrible story that surfaced this morning. Also developing this evening, tonight they are calling it now a competition and not a pageant. That is the new motto of the Miss America organization which announced today that they are banishing the signature bikini portion of the pageant. Instead, contestants will now take part in a live interactive session with the judges and the organization is also getting rid of the evening gown portion of the competition. What is going to be left telling women that they should wear whatever makes wear uncomfortable. I think some people might show up in sweatpants in that case. Is this enough or is these changes that shouldn't be happening? Shannon Bream, our good friend, joins us tonight. It's so great to be here with Tucker and Shannon and all these great people. She's 'Fox News @ Night' of course and a former Miss America contestant."

The Miss America pageant for me was a godsend because I won scholarship money through that that put me through school, undergrad, and a lot of my law school as well. And I didn't come from a family that have a lot of money a lot of means. We were hardworking. A teacher and my dad was a cop. And so for me this was a really fun way to stretch myself. It was terrifying at times but it really pay for school for me so it was a great experience for me. I'm not sure anyone wants to see my swimsuit pictures now."

I was from New Jersey where pageants were really not that big but to win Miss Florida and Miss Virginia, where are all these gorgeous girls in Florida and Virginia, so you know, I mean, you did really, really well. But I do have to ask myself, you know, are we passed this whole thing as a society? You know, as women, is this really, you know, is there another way to have a good scholarship contest in this country."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, it's interesting because you know, Miss America started out years ago in the 20s on the boardwalk there in New Jersey. In Atlantic City, it was a swimsuit contest that the chamber of commerce the local business people came up with to keep people in town for another week or two around Labor Day. It was a really big event. And it evolved over time, so it's not just about swimsuits. And they added talent and interview and evening gown and all these other things. You know, swimsuit now is still just a very tiny portion, and it's going away completely but it becomes such a small portion. I don't know that it ever really decided the winner ever any way. So if they think it's a better idea now to say, we want people of all different shapes and sizes, and people may not have considered the pageant before it's going to be a competition now, it's going to be something different and we want more people to be included. I think that's interesting. I'm all about tradition. And when I competed it taught me a lot about taking care of myself, having a cleaning up my college diet and learning how to work out. And it was grueling a year of serving as Miss Virginia leading it to the Miss America pageant. I was on the road all the time."

So you know, I just want to get your thoughts on this as well quickly before we go. Because also tonight, four former Houston Texan cheerleaders are suing the league for better pay and equal treatment. The women delivering their demands directly to the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. Watch this."

Those are the reasons that people are buying tickets or to come to see them. Now, if these women are alleging that they were paid minimum wage at times and then they were asked to go to appearances that they never got paid for but the teams got paid for to have them there, those are some interesting questions. You are never going to make what an NFL player is going to make, and you shouldn't make anywhere near what they are making. But if they are not being paid for hours they worked, as a former labor unemployment attorney, that does concern me."

My next guest has been digging back into this tragic moment in American history including the somber cross-country flight that carried RFK's body back east. On board, widows Ethel Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy and Coretta Scott King. Joining me now, David Margolick, the man who writes about that historic flight in the Washington Post. He is also the author of \"The Promise and the Dream: The Untold Story of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy,\" which is a fascinating topic all of it in its right.

      "speaker": "MARGOLICK",
      "utterance": "I thought it was just the most extraordinary thing that these three women were on that flight and no one had written about it before. And I mentioned it in my book but I wanted to go even further than that. I thought there were some elaborating to do, so I dug down very deep. I talked to the only surviving Secret Service man who was on the flight. I talked to any passengers I could find who were still around, and you know, there was -- there was one moment when these three women were actually standing or sitting in the same place on the flight and talking to one another. And we'll never know what they said that. We can only imagine the kind of commiserating that went on in that one, five or 10 minute window when they were actually physically together."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARGOLICK",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a little bit puzzling and it's another mystery to the story that all of that Kennedy's family got on the front of the plane with the casket and surrounded the casket and held hands as it was lifted into the front of the plane. And Jacqueline Kennedy entered from the rear for whatever reason she wasn't part of the family unit. She sort of went in there and made a very separate entrance. She got on the plane as you say only after she was assured that it was not the same air force one. There are several different air force ones. She had to be assured that it was not the same one that had brought her back with her husband's body from Dallas. And there was one moment when she wouldn't get out of the car actually until she got that assurance."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARGOLICK",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a very complicated relationship. You know, I have the story in the New York Times this afternoon about the song Abraham, Martin and John and we like to think that these guys are tied together forever, the two Kennedys and Martin Luther King but their relationship was much rockier than that and much more complicated than that. They were dependent on each other, they resented each other, they interacted all of the time, not literally directly, I mean, there is very little correspondence between them. There's not even really a good photograph of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy alone together. I mean, they kept their distance from one another but they were vital to one another's interests and they were completely interdependent really, and that's the story in the book that I was exploring."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARGOLICK",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we should resist the temptation to canonize anybody because very few people are saints. And Robert Kennedy is more interesting in fact because he wasn't the saint and because his attitude toward race and King and all of the staff varied and evolved over the years. And he had his moments, he had his relapses. He was tolerant, he was intolerant, he was interesting. He was real."
