The president beefing up the White House staff with what you call that \"war room,\" basically, aimed at getting much tougher onto big issues. Pushing back against leakers inside the so-called \"deep state of government\" and dealing with the various investigations of the Russia allegations.  Phase one of all this was the president picking as his outside counsel, this tough New York attorney Marc Kasowitz. One advisor telling me that Kasowitz is \"ready to rumble.\" Phase two of this, the spotlight is now on Dave Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. They are two trusted hands from the Trump campaign who could be - I stress, could be added to the White House staff. Advisors say that both men would prefer to stay on the outside, help the president there, but this is such a critical moment in his presidency that they would be hard-pressed to say no if they ask them directly. In fact, look at how Lewandowski answered the question when our own Tucker Carlson pressed him directly on whether he might join the White House staff for crisis communications.",

All of these moves, by the way, are aimed at walling off the president from the investigations, so you can focus on the economy and health care. But again, he is going to have to stick to the playbook, not get focused on going off message as we've seen before. Martha.",

They stuck to the message they wanted to send. They established a discipline, planned approach. If the president comes home and remains disciplined, that he's willing to be the leader of a team rather than just a -- somebody who goes off on his own or whenever he feels like it. He could become very formidable. And my advice to him would be, to get a guy the caliber of a Dave Bossie and a Corey Lewandowski. Let them do the fighting. You go out and talk about jobs, you talk about health care, you talk about infrastructure, you bring the country together, you're the positive creator of these things and stick within the boundaries of working with the team.

That's what NATO did fair share or not. I don't oppose getting others to pony up, but it makes no real difference, it's a very narrow view of NATO. And right now, what's important is not to turn into an anti-terror instrument, it's the clumsiest to do it. Anyway, all of the 28 nations are in the anti-ISIS alliances as nations. So, now what's happened with Trump's trip? NATO as an institution is going to be part of it. That will not change anything.

Sky News can confirm that this is the home of that Salman Abedi shared with his family, and the video shows a man believed to be Salman Abedi taking out the trash. So, it's a bit strange that this person walking outside and putting rubbish in a canister here in Manchester. Again, can't confirm 100 percent if this is Salman, but people who've seen this say they believe it is.  And Sky News has confirmed that this is his home which is the piece of video that surfaced of this man who was believed to have carried out Monday night's terror attack. And of course, the investigation into this attack remains at a very high pace. Police have been carrying out a raid across the city and across the suburbs, including one about 40 minutes north of us in a town of Wigan tonight. And that led to the evacuation of the neighborhood when the police found what they believed were suspicious materials inside the home. They called in the bomb disposal teams, eventually, they lifted the cordon and allow the neighbors to come back but the investigators remained unseen. And police tell us that all of these raids or many of these raids have actually resulted in compelling and important clues. And they say that the arrest of eight people in the U.K. so far had been significant. The was arrested, including the suspect Salman Abedi's older brother here in Manchester, his father and younger brother arrested in a Tripoli, Libya, where authorities say the 18-year-old brother Hashim confessed to knowledge of the plot and said that he and Salman Abedi belong to ISIS. Authorities say that Salman may have gotten terror training in Syria, but they're also very concerned about leaks of the investigation to the American press, including the suspect's name and evidence photos of the bomb aftermath that were published in the New York Times that led to a lid on info sharing between Manchester police and U.S. authorities. We are told tonight that the lid, Martha, has been lifted, that the British authorities got reassurances from the U.S. that those leaks would be clamped. And President Trump has also asked the Justice Department for a thorough investigation of this, but again, we're told the lid has been lifted and these two sides are now sharing information again.",

Gentlemen, thank you for being here this evening. You know, there's so much that we're learning in this case reports today that he called his mother and said forgive me on the phone just shortly before he went in there and killed parents who were waiting for their children, killed children who were waiting for their parents. I mean, it is an absolutely horrific crime.   We also know that there were several attempts by the Muslim community that he lived in, to put up red flags on him. People contacted - the Libyan Muslim community leader contacted the National Terrorism hotline and said, we're concerned about him, he's expressing militant viewpoints. And then, an Eman at the Didsbury Mosque did the same thing. So, we have a couple of things to take on here. Marc, let me first ask you about this intelligence sharing and the photos that surfaced in the New York Times and CBS, which the Trump campaign - Trump presidency got some backlash for.

He walked into the room, and we just-- introduced him selves, exchange some pleasantries, started talking about food in Bozeman, very nice. And then, about 2 minutes into the conversation, Ben Jacobs with the Guardian walked in and started asking questions about the congressional budget office score on the Republican health care bill. And as you just heard, Gianforte said that he would get to him later. Jacobs so persisted and Gianforte then again told him to talk to Shane who was his press guy.  And then at that point, that's when the three of us saw Gianforte take his hands and put them up on either side of his neck, grabbed him, take him, push him, throw him onto the ground, kind of jump on him on the side and start punching him. He punched him about two to three times, saying I'm getting sick and tired of this. At that point, we said Jacobs kind of scrambled to his knees and try to collect his glasses, and you've heard him talk about how they were broken. He was on the ground when he said that. And then got up and started asking us what our names were. We were sitting there -- honestly, just in stunned silence, couldn't believe what we were witnessing. And Martha, as you mention, this was yesterday on the eve of the special election and the polls close here in about two and a half hours. But I should also mention that Montanans have been voting for the past -- almost four weeks now, and this morning when the polls open, 37 percent of the voters that already cast their ballots when the polls open.

The president beefing up the White House staff with what you call that \"war room,\" basically, aimed at getting much tougher onto big issues. Pushing back against leakers inside the so-called \"deep state of government\" and dealing with the various investigations of the Russia allegations. Phase one of all this was the president picking as his outside counsel, this tough New York attorney Marc Kasowitz. One advisor telling me that Kasowitz is \"ready to rumble.\" Phase two of this, the spotlight is now on Dave Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. They are two trusted hands from the Trump campaign who could be - I stress, could be added to the White House staff. Advisors say that both men would prefer to stay on the outside, help the president there, but this is such a critical moment in his presidency that they would be hard-pressed to say no if they ask them directly. In fact, look at how Lewandowski answered the question when our own Tucker Carlson pressed him directly on whether he might join the White House staff for crisis communications."

I'm told by the president's advisors there's nothing imminent on Spicer or other top aides right now, and that this is more about addition than subtraction in terms of beefing up the White House staff. All of these moves, by the way, are aimed at walling off the president from the investigations, so you can focus on the economy and health care. But again, he is going to have to stick to the playbook, not get focused on going off message as we've seen before. Martha."

He's coming off of a trip which is historic, a trip where he was disciplined, where he didn't tweet randomly, where there were Spicer wasn't holding various press gaggles. They stuck to the message they wanted to send. They established a discipline, planned approach. If the president comes home and remains disciplined, that he's willing to be the leader of a team rather than just a -- somebody who goes off on his own or whenever he feels like it. He could become very formidable. And my advice to him would be, to get a guy the caliber of a Dave Bossie and a Corey Lewandowski. Let them do the fighting. You go out and talk about jobs, you talk about health care, you talk about infrastructure, you bring the country together, you're the positive creator of these things and stick within the boundaries of working with the team.

He needs to remember what messages he's trying to send and measure his weekly performance against getting across his messages. The fact that he's able to beat these folks, which he can.

Second, the Republicans need to understand something. They're going to lose the House if they get involved in a civil war over President Trump. And I think the idea of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker in 2019, she's sober every Republican in the country.

There's an unknown source that have told us today, I find that frankly sickening. These people -- you know, you have a President with a great, amazing, historic tour. He was very successful with the NATO, he was very successful with the Pope yesterday, and he was unbelievably historic in Riyadh with 58 leaders. But three unnamed sources this afternoon, having a drink with a Washington Post reporter, secretly leaked; how do you know any of it is true? And furthermore, if it's from Mueller's investigation, he should be enraged and he got to lock somebody up. I mean the people who - the people who leaked the British story were not in the White House. They were in the Intelligence Community and they ought to go to jail."

He was scoffed at roundly by many in the media. So, is Charles Krauthammer's scoffing or is he praising? He's coming up next. Also, as police ramp up the hunt for more accomplices and potential plots in the wake of the Manchester massacre, here's why hospital trauma units are now on standby in England tonight.

American congressional leaders coming back to the 50s have complained about NATO's lack of contribution, lack of support. There's nothing new there. But what was new and I think the real headline was, that after everything had been teed up for the president of the United States to reassure NATO that we would stand with them, the president refused to say the simple phrase: \"we will honor article five,\" which is if one of us is attacked, all of us is attacked. And the fact that he was speaking at a ceremony to commemorate the fact that it's only been invoked once when the European states-"

      "utterance": "Declared - he pointed it out, but that's not why he was there to remember some history. The reason he was there, was because he campaigned talking ambivalently about NATO, saying it was obsolete, threatening America withdrawal. He had sent his surrogates to Europe to sell yes, of course, we're going to honor article five. He didn't say it. It's the omission that is the huge news here, and it's barely incomprehensible because it means that whatever deterrent exists from the United States is thereby weakened by simply not saying the phrase everybody was waiting for."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

I mean, he spoke a lot about what he saw as the shortcomings of NATO, and you have them all lined up there. They have not done - you know, it's an alliance. So, an alliance means that it's an agreement. Part of the agreement is that everybody finds a way in the budget of their country to carve out enough money to give 2 percent towards their own defense so that the alliance works, right? The other part of this alliance that has been missing in the minds of many people is that they have been attacked time and time again by Islamic radical terrorists. They've lost hundreds of people on their own soil. And the president - and so, he got three things; he got them to sort of come towards the idea of paying their fair share print, he got them to agree to better intelligence sharing in a new unit that they said that they would construct, and he got them to agree to be part of this coalition that will fight ISIS as a group. So, you know, do not see those as small victories at the very least?"

There is nothing new here and yet through all that time when we had to bear the unfair burden - if you want to put it in Trump's terms - which was protested, particularly in Congress for decades. All that time we prevented: A. a nuclear war; and second, Russia marching into Western Europe and we preserved a continent we, in fact, liberated the eastern half of that, by means of NATO. That's what NATO did fair share or not. I don't oppose getting others to pony up, but it makes no real difference, it's a very narrow view of NATO. And right now, what's important is not to turn into an anti-terror instrument, it's the clumsiest to do it. Anyway, all of the 28 nations are in the anti-ISIS alliances as nations. So, now what's happened with Trump's trip? NATO as an institution is going to be part of it. That will not change anything. And just beside the point, the one thing that Trump overlooks, the NATO nations are represented in Afghanistan. Many of them have a higher per capita loss of their soldiers then we do. So, the idea that they haven't lifted a finger to fight terrorism is simply wrong."

Sky News can confirm that this is the home of that Salman Abedi shared with his family, and the video shows a man believed to be Salman Abedi taking out the trash. So, it's a bit strange that this person walking outside and putting rubbish in a canister here in Manchester. Again, can't confirm 100 percent if this is Salman, but people who've seen this say they believe it is. And Sky News has confirmed that this is his home which is the piece of video that surfaced of this man who was believed to have carried out Monday night's terror attack. And of course, the investigation into this attack remains at a very high pace. Police have been carrying out a raid across the city and across the suburbs, including one about 40 minutes north of us in a town of Wigan tonight. And that led to the evacuation of the neighborhood when the police found what they believed were suspicious materials inside the home. They called in the bomb disposal teams, eventually, they lifted the cordon and allow the neighbors to come back but the investigators remained unseen. And police tell us that all of these raids or many of these raids have actually resulted in compelling and important clues. And they say that the arrest of eight people in the U.K. so far had been significant. The was arrested, including the suspect Salman Abedi's older brother here in Manchester, his father and younger brother arrested in a Tripoli, Libya, where authorities say the 18-year-old brother Hashim confessed to knowledge of the plot and said that he and Salman Abedi belong to ISIS. Authorities say that Salman may have gotten terror training in Syria, but they're also very concerned about leaks of the investigation to the American press, including the suspect's name and evidence photos of the bomb aftermath that were published in the New York Times that led to a lid on info sharing between Manchester police and U.S. authorities. We are told tonight that the lid, Martha, has been lifted, that the British authorities got reassurances from the U.S. that those leaks would be clamped. And President Trump has also asked the Justice Department for a thorough investigation of this, but again, we're told the lid has been lifted and these two sides are now sharing information again."

Gentlemen, thank you for being here this evening. You know, there's so much that we're learning in this case reports today that he called his mother and said forgive me on the phone just shortly before he went in there and killed parents who were waiting for their children, killed children who were waiting for their parents. I mean, it is an absolutely horrific crime. We also know that there were several attempts by the Muslim community that he lived in, to put up red flags on him. People contacted - the Libyan Muslim community leader contacted the National Terrorism hotline and said, we're concerned about him, he's expressing militant viewpoints. And then, an Eman at the Didsbury Mosque did the same thing. So, we have a couple of things to take on here.

I mean, if you think about it, in the last two weeks, we had two major leaks that have, A, burn two major allies, U.K. and Israel as sources of intelligence on ISIS, and B, helped ISIS by giving them information about sources and methods about how we collect intelligence. The leak that the fact that Israel was behind intelligence we had on an ISIS plot to blow up planes using bombs on computer hard drives, and now this information about not just the photos of the bomb but the name of the bomber. I mean, these are intelligence trails that are intelligence committee has to follow in order to find out if there's an entire network behind this, they may have other plots. They may have plots for the United States or against U.S. interest in the world. We need to keep those intelligence trails warm. And leaks are incredibly damaging to us."

The three of us were in the room setting up for a prescheduled interview with Greg Gianforte. We were in the middle of setting up. He walked into the room, and we just-- introduced him selves, exchange some pleasantries, started talking about food in Bozeman, very nice. And then, about 2 minutes into the conversation, Ben Jacobs with the Guardian walked in and started asking questions about the congressional budget office score on the Republican health care bill. And as you just heard, Gianforte said that he would get to him later. Jacobs so persisted and Gianforte then again told him to talk to Shane who was his press guy. And then at that point, that's when the three of us saw Gianforte take his hands and put them up on either side of his neck, grabbed him, take him, push him, throw him onto the ground, kind of jump on him on the side and start punching him. He punched him about two to three times, saying I'm getting sick and tired of this. At that point, we said Jacobs kind of scrambled to his knees and try to collect his glasses, and you've heard him talk about how they were broken. He was on the ground when he said that. And then got up and started asking us what our names were. We were sitting there -- honestly, just in stunned silence, couldn't believe what we were witnessing. And Martha, as you mention, this was yesterday on the eve of the special election and the polls close here in about two and a half hours. But I should also mention that Montanans have been voting for the past -- almost four weeks now, and this morning when the polls open, 37 percent of the voters that already cast their ballots when the polls open. So it really is something that we can't say whether -- how it's going to impact this election in terms of the results, but it's definitely had an impact here in Montana, and everywhere else, obviously."

The principal issued a statement saying she signed the school pledge, and then broke it, adding, quote, Maddi is being disciplined not because she's pregnant but because she was immoral. But Maddi think she's being punished because her mistake is visible, and she believes the school is missing an opportunity to set an example for the pro-life community. And pro-life groups are now defending her saying her school is making it more likely that young women will choose abortion over embarrassment.

      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "Well, after I told my school, the punishment that they gave me was just like a normal punishment to any other kids whose broken student pledges received before. I was given an unofficial suspension. I was taking out of all my leadership positions, and so punishment was done and over with. And then I came back and they said -- four months, you're not going to be able to walk in your graduation. So it was just dragging out my punishment over six months because they found out the end of January and graduation is in June. So I thought that was way harsh and is not like anything any of the other kids who've broken the student pledge have received before."

      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And the first thing that they did, if I understand this correctly, was they wanted to hold an assembly, essentially to publicly shame you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "Yeah, that's how it came off because my principal said that this matter are kept between the student, the school, and their families, but then he was there saying that he wanted to publicly announce what I have done and I told him if that's going to be the case that I'm going to tell students myself, and parents were invited to the assembly too. It was the high school and some of the parents showed up, and so I told them what I had done."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You stood up there in front of everybody. What did you say?"

    {
      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "I wrote a statement up just telling them what had happened, that I'm pregnant, and that I was being sent away from school. And I got up there, my parents were sitting behind me, my brother was sitting in the front row. And I immediately started crying because I was so embarrassed that I had to sit there and admit my mistake when no other kid has ever had to admit what they have done wrong. And my dad wrote through the statement, the first task and he got choked up and then I finish reading it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you stepped in and you took over. They put out the statement that Trace just showed and they said, you know, Maddi is being disciplined not because she's pregnant but because she was immoral. How do you feel about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "I agree I had to be disciplined. I broke the rules. I have no problem with that. I accepted the consequences. But I never thought that my consequences would be drag out. No kid has ever had consequences drag out like this."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "utterance": "What did they said about you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "Just nasty things. I need to grow up, keep my mouth shut, take my consequences, I'm 18, and that's not the point. I'm not trying to get my school. I'm not mad that I have to suffer the consequences. It just the fact that I have been punished over the course of six months, and that sends a message to people, you know, you confess, you're going to be made an example of, you're going to be embarrassed, but if you keep it, good job, we're just keep turning our heads away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "Definitely abortion at first because I was so scared. And I'm a Christian, I'm a practicing Christian, and you know, I knew it was wrong. I knew I should be thinking that, but I had seen the way girls like me had been treated and I didn't want to be that girl."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you kept the baby and you were punished do you think unjustly, Christian students for life. I know she could have gone to Planned Parenthood she said, but she felt like they're not empowering to women which I thought it was quite interesting. What do you think about all this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTAN HAWKINS, STUDENT FOR LIFE AMERICA PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "That's right. I mean, that's the message that Planned Parenthood stands every day to teens across the country that you're not strong enough to do this. And what's so amazing about Maddi's story was she was courageous and she went to her parents, told them what happened. She volunteered to speak in front of her entire school. How many of us would be willing to go and confess (INAUDIBLE) publicly? But what's happening right now, was so sad about this situation is that this is a national conversation that's needed to happen a long time ago. About how Christians handles the sin of premarital sex, but then if a woman gets pregnant."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What about the mercy and the forgiveness part?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWKINS",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And that is exactly -- that's the question I asked the principal. What about grace? What example have you shown to every student in the school, what they have done has told every girl in that school it's better just to have an abortion and cover this up."
    },

      "speaker": "RUNKLES",
      "utterance": "Becoming a mom at 18. I'm still growing up myself, and I have no idea what to expect."

      "utterance": "One last story, Queen Elizabeth brought smiles to the victims and their families today, when the 91-year-old monarch visited the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. She who has seen so many victims of war and attacks in all her years called this one, quote, very wicked. And she assured the parents and the children that, quote, everyone was united behind them. And she added that the awful thing was that everyone was so young. Today, we learn the names and the identities of more of these victims. Let's put them up so you can see them. Chloe Rutherford, 17 and her boyfriend Liam Curry, 19. Eilidh Macleod, 14 years old from the Scottish island of Barra. Off-duty police officer Elaine McIver, her husband and children are among the injured, and Philip Tron and his stepdaughter Courtney Boyle. That's the story tonight.
