      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Jesse Watters, Juan Williams and she jets ski on a water bug, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" Where's McGarrett when you really need him?  So after that false incoming missile alert in Hawaii, launch notifications will now require verification by two people. You'd think that would have been in place already. And may be a warning that prompts you to double-check a message before it goes out. I mean, when I want to delete an email, I'm asked, \"Are you sure you want to delete an email?\" And that's for an email not a state alert telling people they're about to die. And here's a thought: Maybe don't have the menu item for \"incoming missile\" so close to one that says, \"just testing.\" That's like having the kid's trampoline next to a wood chipper.  This screw-up cannot be overstated. Imagine if it were you: your family being told you're all going to die and for 40 minutes, that's your reality. Then someone comes along and says oops. My wife was there in Hawaii. She saw mothers sobbing uncontrollably, realizing that they would never see their kids again. She watched families saying goodbye. And yet the press is already back to the swearword. What a contrast between real terror and phony posturing. The same people who report this missile accident with such restraint just days ago were melting over \"s-hole.\" When the press conference in Hawaii hit, we took it live. CNN ran a repeat interview with Michael Wolff. A repeat. Maybe if that false missile warning had s-hole in it, CNN would have gone wall-to-wall.  It's disgusting that an event that led mothers to place children in storm drains is of less interest to the press than a crude phrase uttered in a meeting. But I guess if you can't blame the usual villain then why bother. Oh, wait, you can.",

I wouldn't have that big a meeting in order to try to come sort of a deal. You need a smaller group of people that can actually speak on others' behalf and get to the deal that way, because if you have 22 people in the room, it's going to be impossible to do that. And they should designate somebody as the honest broker. Because now, there's a dispute over what was offered as a possible deal and what was gearing up to agree to. And if you don't even have agreement on what was presented as a possibility of this framework of the deal and it turns into name-calling by the end of the week, they're in big trouble.

They were talking and the president was intent. I mean, he televised that session to demonstrate his capacity to hold negotiations, to be forceful. He had some missteps there, you remember, when he was saying, oh, yeah, I will give you a clean DACA deal, and then Kevin McCarthy had to come in and say, oh, Mr. President, hold on. So then he goes back on that. But once the stuff about calling those countries, that unfortunate name comes out, then, clearly, it discombobulated the whole set of negotiations. He's now trying to get back at it by saying, oh, the Democrats don't care about any kind of border security. And that's clearly his talking points. I don't know how you can say that. I mean, I go back to the gang of eight. The deal that was attempted when President Obama was in office and part of that deal was a large increase in spending on border security, approved by Democrats and Republicans. Who scuttled the deal? The far right talk show host of the Republican Party. I mean, that's also true, by the way, going back -- I think it's '06 in the Bush administration attempt to an immigration deal. There was lots of added border security. We're now at the point where last week they said we're at the lowest point in 45 years in terms of border crossing.

You don't know why so-and-so is gone. And then you find out. And it's like, wow, that was a -- that's weird. Because that's not like Harvey Weinstein. That's not like sexual assault. That's, like, a clumsy pass. That's weird. And then -- and then what happens is you have this climate of fear affecting men, and women are understanding it. Now, Margaret Atwood, she wrote \"Handmaid's Tale.\" This is the feminist dystopian classic idolized by the Hollywood left; won awards at the Golden Globe. The \"#MeToo\" movement loves this book. But the author of this book, embraced by the \"#MeToo\" movement, is saying accusations without due process leads to extremism. And now she is getting blowback. The person who wrote \"The Handmaid's Tale\" is getting blowback for saying, \"Watch it. This is going too far.\" And then you have Catherine Deneuve. I think that's how you say it. She said this is -- we've got to pull back on this. She had to apologize for saying, \"Maybe let's slow down. Let's take a look at this.\" So it shows you how dangerous it is even for women to step out of line. And that's a dangerous sign, because if you are telling people to be quiet over a cause, that's going to lead to what Margaret Atwood said, which is pure, unadulterated extremism, a massive panic.

And may be a warning that prompts you to double-check a message before it goes out. I mean, when I want to delete an email, I'm asked, \"Are you sure you want to delete an email?\" And that's for an email not a state alert telling people they're about to die. And here's a thought: Maybe don't have the menu item for \"incoming missile\" so close to one that says, \"just testing.\" That's like having the kid's trampoline next to a wood chipper."

What a contrast between real terror and phony posturing. The same people who report this missile accident with such restraint just days ago were melting over \"s-hole.\" When the press conference in Hawaii hit, we took it live. CNN ran a repeat interview with Michael Wolff. A repeat. Maybe if that false missile warning had s-hole in it, CNN would have gone wall-to-wall. It's disgusting that an event that led mothers to place children in storm drains is of less interest to the press than a crude phrase uttered in a meeting.

So, I don't think that this is something they can run on. And I think that that's wrong for on a lot of reasons. Not just politically, but the policy. I think it's time -- if they were really that close last Tuesday, they should be able to get this done. It sounds to me like they need to figure out if they're going to have more meetings. I wouldn't have that big a meeting in order to try to come sort of a deal. You need a smaller group of people that can actually speak on others' behalf and get to the deal that way, because if you have 22 people in the room, it's going to be impossible to do that. And they should designate somebody as the honest broker. Because now, there's a dispute over what was offered as a possible deal and what was gearing up to agree to. And if you don't even have agreement on what was presented as a possibility of this framework of the deal and it turns into name-calling by the end of the week, they're in big trouble. And I don't know really how they get it done by Friday. I think what they might have to do is pass some sort of a spending measure to keep the government open and maybe continue to talk about this."

It's always a tug-of-war with a pitbull with Trump and, I think, as long as there's time. I think they already have that deal, but why accept it now when you can get a little bit more out of it.

We're going to do the art of the deal. And then, they're like, went ahead anyway in bad faith and called him a racist. I agree with Rand Paul. It's a nonstarter. How could this go forward if you're accusing the person you're trying to negotiate with of being a racist? It's like, where do you go from there? Because it's basically saying that any of his intentionality as it relates to DACA is malignant, is bad, that this is a guy who's racist. He's not going to have the best interest of all Americans, only some Americans. And there's just no proof or evidence, whatsoever, to support that.

Let's get back to DACA for a second. I think the president clearly is back on his heels. If this was a prize fight, he was knocked back by what happened last week. They were talking and the president was intent. I mean, he televised that session to demonstrate his capacity to hold negotiations, to be forceful. He had some missteps there, you remember, when he was saying, oh, yeah, I will give you a clean DACA deal, and then Kevin McCarthy had to come in and say, oh, Mr. President, hold on. So then he goes back on that. But once the stuff about calling those countries, that unfortunate name comes out, then, clearly, it discombobulated the whole set of negotiations. He's now trying to get back at it by saying, oh, the Democrats don't care about any kind of border security. And that's clearly his talking points. I don't know how you can say that. I mean, I go back to the gang of eight. The deal that was attempted when President Obama was in office and part of that deal was a large increase in spending on border security, approved by Democrats and Republicans. Who scuttled the deal? The far right talk show host of the Republican Party. I mean, that's also true, by the way, going back -- I think it's '06 in the Bush administration attempt to an immigration deal. There was lots of added border security. We're now at the point where last week they said we're at the lowest point in 45 years in terms of border crossing. We have more border security in terms of the people from immigration -- whatever you call it, ICE, whatever, on the border. We have more drones."

You don't know why so-and-so is gone. And then you find out. And it's like, wow, that was a -- that's weird. Because that's not like Harvey Weinstein. That's not like sexual assault. That's, like, a clumsy pass. That's weird. And then -- and then what happens is you have this climate of fear affecting men, and women are understanding it. Now, Margaret Atwood, she wrote \"Handmaid's Tale.\" This is the feminist dystopian classic idolized by the Hollywood left; won awards at the Golden Globe. The \"#MeToo\" movement loves this book. But the author of this book, embraced by the \"#MeToo\" movement, is saying accusations without due process leads to extremism. And now she is getting blowback. The person who wrote \"The Handmaid's Tale\" is getting blowback for saying, \"Watch it. This is going too far.\" And then you have Catherine Deneuve. I think that's how you say it. She said this is -- we've got to pull back on this. She had to apologize for saying, \"Maybe let's slow down. Let's take a look at this.\" So it shows you how dangerous it is even for women to step out of line. And that's a dangerous sign, because if you are telling people to be quiet over a cause, that's going to lead to what Margaret Atwood said, which is pure, unadulterated extremism, a massive panic.
