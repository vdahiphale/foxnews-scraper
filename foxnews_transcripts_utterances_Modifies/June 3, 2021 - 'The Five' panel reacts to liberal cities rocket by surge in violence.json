They revealed his relationship with the Wuhan lab that is facing new scrutiny in the global pandemic that has killed millions. Senator Rand Paul claims Fauci lied to America about that lab potentially doing research that could make viruses more deadly.",

The real villain to me is the media and the Democrats, A, for pushing impeachment exactly, exactly as the virus was exploding. Countless lives were lost because they hated Trump.

But if you got rid of Twitter trends, what happens is that's a sorting mechanism that shows you that stuff that's bubbling up.

The best part of working with Gutfeld isn't listening to sharp takes on air, it's listening to his provocative ramblings in the commercial breaks. Here is just a small random sample of direct quotes uttered by Gutfeld between segments. So you have to buy the book in order to get that kind of action.

They revealed his relationship with the Wuhan lab that is facing new scrutiny in the global pandemic that has killed millions.

So, he knows its gain of function and he needs to be pinned down in this. I don't think having trust of Chinese scientist with gain of function research was very wise. In fact, it was so naA_ve that we shouldn't have Dr. Fauci in a position of advising the U.S., the world or anybody else because he shown such poor decision making."

This thing looks engineered and then now he is on e-mail scrambling to see if his fingerprints are on gain of function. That's not my opinion. Those are the facts. And \"Vanity Fair\" came out with a big expose blowing the lid off the cover-up. U.S. government telling investigators don't look into this because U.S. money went into this lab, manpower, know how, money. Went into this lab that ended up killing 3.5 million people.

You heard Dr. Fauci again today saying we have to be careful with China because we need to be able to cooperate with them. It's been over a year. They haven't exactly been transparent with the WHO or anyone else. I'm -- listen, Dagen, I like you grew up in the south and we believe you get more flies with honey but when the flies are full of committing a human rights atrocities and not giving you any information, it's time to get rid of the honey and maybe go with some tabasco or something maybe a little bit stronger."

So, the idea, like, I always wonder how many investigations are stopped when somebody says that's a Pandora's Box. It's like maybe you should open the Pandora's Box and see what's going on in there. Look, we talked about this last week. One of the reasons why they wanted to blame the wet markets it's not just because of the lab, it's because we are involved in the lab. We have money there. We were thinking, you know, it's the Chinese protecting themselves. No, we're actually trying to protect ourselves because we, if we're -- I mean, these are our experts, these are our scientists. If this was -- consider if these were the plot to a movie, right. Scientists in government engage in highly controversial and risky research. Two, there is an accident. Nobody is saying that this was deliberate."

The scientists and the experts and the politicians scramble to protect their vital research and cover-up the plausible cause. If that were -- that's a Michael Crichton movie, but it's not. It's real. And I think that's why you have to have an investigation. Is Fauci the villain in this? I just think he is an overly diplomatic bureaucrat. The real villain to me is the media and the Democrats, A, for pushing impeachment exactly, exactly as the virus was exploding. Countless lives were lost because they hated Trump. And number two, labelling anybody a racist who dared to criticize China, that helped -- that steered the debate towards something totally stupid like a pangolin, which still sounds like a musical instrument I wouldn't want to play, but it does have scales."

You know, put your money where your mouth is. You don't put them among poor people, elderly people in Chinatown. Sure, the prisons are less crowded, but the E.R. in Chinatown is now full with people with black eyes or bruises. They need to use Kendra's Law more where, you know, you can force -- you know, you can compel the insane, the deranged into treatment. They stopped doing that as much as they used to. If you just drive up one block in New York, you could see it everywhere. These are grown men hitting elderly women, okay. There has to be a class action suit against the city. If you got all these victims together maybe that would make the politicians understand that you can't do this because there seems like there is no retribution. Like you never hear any of the politicians talking about this. We are the only people pointing this out. Why is that? Because there is no retribution. There is no consequences as a politician.

They are carcasses everywhere. When I go for my runs every day, it's crunchy. It literally is crunchy because they're everywhere. My dog will not stop eating. I have to say this really quick. The U.N. says we shouldn't be making fun of eating insects because they're highly nutritious. They could be a healthy food source, high in fat, protein, vitamins, fiber, and mineral. If I'm going to splurge on something high in fat, it is not going to be a crunchy bug."

I can tell you that safely. No one's eating cicadas. But CNN buys the idea that oh, this is good for the environment, right? We should be moving away from a meat-based diet and start eating insects. You know it's healthier if you just get over your -- if this is inside a media bubble. Perhaps maybe it might help Brian Stelter to go on an all-insect diet, but I wouldn't even ask him to do that because that would be cruel and inhuman punishment. And his ratings are so low. All he is hearing is crickets or cicadas. Yes, that was three insults in one sentence."

They think they're interesting people because they're eating bugs. Instead, just go to a nice restaurant, order normal food, impress people with the book that you've read, like How I Save the World."

Here is just a small random sample of direct quotes uttered by Gutfeld between segments. So you have to buy the book in order to get that kind of action. Preorder it now and you'll get it on July 6."

You usually get all the crazy junk from Florida, but check this out, so sweet. This is a little girl, 3-year-old Lincoln. She's at the grocery store with her mom. She's got cerebral palsy. And her mom said when they walked in there -- normal she's got a walker -- she completely abandoned it when she saw this kid- size grocery cart and just started walking. They've never seen her do anything like this before. This is in the very famous Winn Dixie. Mom captured this. By the way, they decided to hold this big celebration for her when they figured out that she was really comfortable walking with this. They gave her her own special personalized cart at Winn Dixie. And what I love is the employee who gave it to her was a guy who's worked there 35 years. He's got cerebral palsy too. And he told her, you can do anything. I love it, Lincoln."
