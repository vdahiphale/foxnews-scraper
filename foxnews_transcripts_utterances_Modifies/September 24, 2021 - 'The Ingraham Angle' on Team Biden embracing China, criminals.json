They never speak about illegal aliens, or refugees, who commit unspeakable crimes with such condemnatory tones.  It's not an exaggeration to say that the Biden administration now speaks more charitably about the Taliban than it does about U.S. law enforcement. And by the way, they can all stop pretending now to care about the American working class. They don't even wait for an investigation. They just spew poisonous rhetoric about line border patrol officers who are overwhelmingly Hispanic, by the way. And they're paid annually, only a fraction of what Hunter pockets from one lousy painting.  Yet by mimicking Al Sharpton on race, Joe and Kamala just make themselves look more petty and less serious. It's all one big change the subject move on there part, from the images of migrant squalor in Del Rio to the images of slave trader border agents on horseback.  Well, the truth is, Biden is to blame himself for both images, which is why his poll numbers are in freefall. And he's violating not just his unity promise, but his I'll follow the science promise as well.

Some quick highlights, this year 66 percent said they found it somewhat acceptable to shout down a campus speaker, and 23 percent said it was acceptable to use violence to stop a campus speech. And speaking as free speech, California State University Sacramento has now set up a new bias incident reporting website where anyone in the Sac State Community can report a person to be investigated for an alleged incident of bias. That includes, quote, \"a person does, says, or expresses anything that is motivated by bias related to one or more identities such as citizenship, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, sexual orientation, or more.\" And Penn State University says it has, quote, grown out of a male-centered world and stopped using male-centric terms like \"freshmen\" and \"upperclassmen\" because they can be interpreted as sexist. Instead students will be referred to the first-year, second-year, and beyond. And Brandeis University made headlines with its oppressive language list, urging students and faculty to stop using words like \"picnic,\" \"trigger warning,\" and \"rule of thumb\" because of their links to violence and oppression.

The radicals running the Democrat Party will cry racism whenever they believe it helps them politically. The facts just don't matter. And just as they did with Nick Sandmann, in that case, remember, staring at the indigenous man years ago, the left is seizing on an image, one image to make unfounded defamatory claims.

Again, Biden and Harris never speak in this manner, this kind of very aggressive tone about China, which is actually committing genocide. They never speak about illegal aliens, or refugees, who commit unspeakable crimes with such condemnatory tones. It's not an exaggeration to say that the Biden administration now speaks more charitably about the Taliban than it does about U.S. law enforcement. And by the way, they can all stop pretending now to care about the American working class. They don't even wait for an investigation. They just spew poisonous rhetoric about line border patrol officers who are overwhelmingly Hispanic, by the way. And they're paid annually, only a fraction of what Hunter pockets from one lousy painting. Yet by mimicking Al Sharpton on race, Joe and Kamala just make themselves look more petty and less serious. It's all one big change the subject move on there part, from the images of migrant squalor in Del Rio to the images of slave trader border agents on horseback. Well, the truth is, Biden is to blame himself for both images, which is why his poll numbers are in freefall. And he's violating not just his unity promise, but his I'll follow the science promise as well. His CDC panel overwhelmingly rejected recommending vaccine boosters for all but older Americans, but Joe doesn't care."

So spare me the supposed concern about spreading disease and using up hospital resources. Oh, by the way, and where's all the concern about social distancing here? Who really believes that only 18 to 20 percent of these migrants are testing positive for COVID. We're lucky, at this point, we can find anyone who still wants to work in Border Patrol, given this nightmarish and dangerous situation. You know, I was thinking today, the lies oftentimes come so fast from Biden that it sometimes it's just hard to keep up and I'm a fast typer when I'm watching this stuff.

In other words, President Trump handed Biden an incredible vaccine rollout. All Biden had to do was execute it. So any vaccine failures at this point are all on Joe.

What they were doing, when you see them twirling the reins, it's to distract the horse so it doesn't go in the way of the individuals that they're trying to detain. So what they were doing was protecting those people. But this administration and leadership with this - within this agency can't give an honest answer. And now you got the President of the United States, saying that these individuals will pay. Pay for what? They did nothing. And he should look at that. He should actually speak to leaderships from this agency and ask them to see the training, so he knows what really happened. It's all a witch hunt and it's disgusting.

Governor Greg Abbott took the action, deployed state resources - state assets to the southern border, Texas Department of Public Safety, the Texas military department to Del Rio. When I got here Saturday, 15,000 plus migrants underneath that bridge, there was thousands more from Mexico waiting to come in. If it wasn't for our men and women from Texas DPS and our military department, this situation would have been chaotic. But we are here to support our federal partners. Right now, they need all the support they get. They're getting scrutinized for an incident that took place.

So why did they do it? Well, just to say Shay Biden's political whims? I don't know. Not only is it a blatant power grab, it's remarkably anti-science. Here now is Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale School of Medicine and epidemiologist. Dr. Risch, you your reaction to this move. I think the vote originally was 16 to 2 against widespread booster shots, recommending them only for 65 and up. So are these boosters necessary for all adults from basically 16 up?"

They had a finite lifespan that they seemed to be effective over four to six months for reducing serious infection. And I think that's probably what one would expect. The question really is, how much more adverse events are going to be created in people who didn't have them before, but now on a third or fourth, or whatever booster will see those adverse events. And this is again, the same trade off that people have had to deal with, where they're not really high risk. High risk people, the trade off is clearer. As long as they can tolerate the vaccines, it's in their favor to protect them from bad reactions to the COVID. But younger people don't have those high risks.

And you should be glad to know that Steve Scalise, our Republican whip, conservative leader himself, came to the Republican Study Committee meeting that I chair on Wednesday before our members and made the formal announcement that House Republicans are formally opposed to the infrastructure bill, meaning that we're unified on the House side. But it's enraging to see some Republicans, a few Republicans come out for this bill, even though that the chairman of the Democratic National Committee told Axios earlier this week, that if Democrats pass the infrastructure bill, they're going to campaign on it. Their message to the voters in the midterm election will be, we passed the infrastructure bill Democrats deliver. Why would any Republican want to play into their hands on that?"

We can't fill jobs. And yet we're bringing in millions of, as we talked about last segment, millions of over years, illegal immigrants, and now refugees who are going to come in and clearly undercut wages for low and middle income workers in this country. And still we can't find people to fill jobs. So I guess we'll have refugees and illegal immigrants filling those jobs."

This is a crisis and a disaster that is intentional. This is what's important. Remember, Laura, this is all intentional on the part of the Biden administration. It is not incompetence, it's intentional. They want to flood the United States with cheap labor. And they want to grant amnesty to all of these illegals that are coming into our country to turn them into Democrat voters.

Likewise, military courts would be exempted from having to provide full due process rights to defendants when issuing emergency protective orders.

So the states have a proceeding, if this needs to be done. But the second thing, that's really concerning to me is a trend to lawyerize the military. To put - take things away from the commander and put them in an unaccountable, legal silo. They're starting to try and do that with sexual assault cases. And now they want to do it with, whether you should be allowed to have your own private weapons. See, the thing is, Laura, in the military you can have one chain of command. If you have multiple chain of command, you got problems. A commander handles discipline.

And what happens here in the due process issue you raised, it's basically saying notice an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence must be provided within a reasonable time not to exceed 30 calendar days.

If you've got to prove that somebody should be deprived of a basic constitutional right, you should be able to present it right away. And the person whose right is being infringed upon should have right to come back with legal counsel, and in fact, they should get JAG support because in the military, you get a JAG whenever you get any kind of disciplinary measure asserted against you. In fact, the procedures in the military under the Uniform Code of Military Justice actually give you more benefits and more rights than in civilian criminal court. And I think that's the least we can do for our troops. You've got to ask yourself, Laura, do we really want to trust the administration with this kind of power?

The 2021 college free-speech ranking show Claremont Mckenna College in California ranks as the most open to free speech. Marquette and DePauw University tied for last. These rankings are based on more than 37,000 students who we're surveyed about their school's free speech climate. Some quick highlights, this year 66 percent said they found it somewhat acceptable to shout down a campus speaker, and 23 percent said it was acceptable to use violence to stop a campus speech. And speaking as free speech, California State University Sacramento has now set up a new bias incident reporting website where anyone in the Sac State Community can report a person to be investigated for an alleged incident of bias. That includes, quote, \"a person does, says, or expresses anything that is motivated by bias related to one or more identities such as citizenship, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, sexual orientation, or more.\" And Penn State University says it has, quote, grown out of a male-centered world and stopped using male-centric terms like \"freshmen\" and \"upperclassmen\" because they can be interpreted as sexist. Instead students will be referred to the first-year, second-year, and beyond. And Brandeis University made headlines with its oppressive language list, urging students and faculty to stop using words like \"picnic,\" \"trigger warning,\" and \"rule of thumb\" because of their links to violence and oppression. And at the elementary level, a P.E. teacher at Leesburg Elementary School in Virginia was suspended, saying he loves all have his students but would not comply with the district's rules of using students' preferred pronouns or allowing transgender students to use the bathroom or play on a sports team of the gender they identify with."

This is not normal in any sense, but God forbid as student of the liberal descent wants to be respected on campus. The organizations and the university bow head over hell to make sure that they're safe. But when it comes to conservative campuses, we don't feel that same love. Freshman year I dealt with threats of violence, my door was violated. Sophomore year, I dealt with being threatened to be doxed from other students, and nothing has been done to this day.
