You know, and you've got all of the information that we heard earlier about, they're paying each other's bills and who gets a cut of what. But I think what's interesting is how it's all being managed now. So, Hunter comes out with -- yes, Hunter comes out with this book, a beautiful thing or whatever, and now he's an artist, he's a great guy came clean. The wife comes out with a book. And the book is all about how I didn't know we had a problem. I didn't see the alcohol. I didn't see the drugs. I didn't see the prostitutes and the horse. I didn't even know anything about expenses. But here's the thing. What she's signaling to the Feds is don't call me as a witness, OK. Everything is orchestrated. It's all theater. And Joe and Jill, when they find out he's sleeping and having an affair with his -- with his brother's -- dead brother's wife while he's still married, they say, you know, OK, we're going to accept that. And when she's asked on television, the ex-wife, how did Joe and Jill feel about the fact that, you know, your husband is sleeping around his dead brother's wife. She said, well, they were concerned about the girls and they've always loved the girls. These people can pivot and dance like no one I've ever seen. This is a major theater orchestration.",

And they lied to us every day. And they don't feel the pain that senior citizens are paying -- are feeling and so many Americans are feeling. Every one of us here at this table is gainfully employed. OK? We don't have any idea what's going on in middle America. People who have to make a decision whether they're going to drive to work or drive to the doctor's office. And this administration is lying. He gets up, Putin -- Biden, and he says there's no question Putin is principally responsible for the intense financial pain that American people and families are bearing. That's a lie, Mr. President, and you know it. Because we know that we get 51 percent of our petroleum, our gas and oil from Canada, 8 percent from Mexico. And it was 8 percent from Russia before we started cutting back because of what's happening in Ukraine. So, to blame everything on Russia -- so we got all of our gas from them in the first place is an outright lie. And they are corrupt too. Jennifer Granholm, OK, she violated the stock disclosure law nine times. And she has exercise $1.6 million in stock options in electric cars. These people are canning us. They don't feel our pain. They are giving us a run around with a letter to the oil industry, give me a break."

As with AOC, Mayra Flores is a wonderful role model for young Latinos, particularly but I think for young ladies. And youngsters throughout -- throughout the land. And the fact that her back story so heroically American, six years old, work -- comes as an immigrant with her parents working in the field as a young child, you know, being hip and modern. Quickly a brief anecdote. In 2019, I was in McAllen, Texas with President Trump who is visiting the border. There was a big anti-Trump demonstration in McAllen. Across the street was an equally big pro-Trump demonstration. It was pretty clear then that the Rio Grande Valley was going to the center. It was going Republican. And Greg is absolutely right. Ronald Reagan said it, Latinos are Republicans natural born, they may not know it yet but they'll figure it out. I think that that is what's happening.

So, Hunter comes out with -- yes, Hunter comes out with this book, a beautiful thing or whatever, and now he's an artist, he's a great guy came clean. The wife comes out with a book. And the book is all about how I didn't know we had a problem. I didn't see the alcohol. I didn't see the drugs. I didn't see the prostitutes and the horse. I didn't even know anything about expenses. But here's the thing. What she's signaling to the Feds is don't call me as a witness, OK. Everything is orchestrated. It's all theater. And Joe and Jill, when they find out he's sleeping and having an affair with his -- with his brother's -- dead brother's wife while he's still married, they say, you know, OK, we're going to accept that. And when she's asked on television, the ex-wife, how did Joe and Jill feel about the fact that, you know, your husband is sleeping around his dead brother's wife.
