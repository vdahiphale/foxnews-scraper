Plus, a massive breach of trust by Facebook peddling access to your private messages. Has Mark Zuckerberg's company finally gone too far? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz.  With much of the government shutdown at least through Christmas, with Defense Chief Jim Mattis leaving, with U.S. troops pulling out of Syria, with stock market sharply declining, the media are now pushing this narrative as described by The Washington Post. \"Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling.\"  Politico says Trump allies are privately expressing new levels of concern about the president's erratic behavior. Some pundits on the right joined in the criticism when the president agreed to a stop-gap funding compromise with zero funding (ph) from the wall. And under pressure from House conservatives, Trump then bowed not to sign any bill without that funding, leading to this weekend's partial shutdown. Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios; and Philippe Reines, a former State Department official under Hillary Clinton.  Mollie, some stories are saying we have a partial government shutdown because Donald Trump was coward and coerced by conservative commentators on Fox, by Rush Limbaugh, by Ann Coulter who hammered him for initially going along with that stop-gap funding bill, that wouldn't funded the wall at all.",

And then it sounded like maybe there was some backtracking on that. So absolutely conservative media pushed back because they wanted to make sure he wasn't backtracking. And here we are. So, it's a good reflection that people's sentiment was somehow expressed in the media either through conservative media or otherwise.",

This undoubtedly is a result of the harsh resignation letter that Mattis wrote. The president I think not pleased moving up the date. All right. Getting back to other news.

Check out my new, Media Buzz Meter. We kick around the day's five most important or fascinating or silly or otherwise stories. You can subscribe at Apple iTunes, Google Play, or tune in at foxnewspodcasts.com. Let's continue the conversation on Twitter, @HowardKurtz. I think a lot of you probably already tweeted at me on a lot of these issues of this past week, whether it is the shutdown, whether it's the stock market, whether it's Jim Mattis and the pull-out from Syria. So I will enjoy reading most of those and responding. Also, take a look at our Facebook page. I post my daily columns there and a lot of original videos. All part of our efforts to keep communicating with you and making this a two-way conversation. Despite the holidays, we will back here next week, 11:00 Eastern.

      "utterance": "How did the media miscalculate the handling of Flynn's guilty plea with some prognosticators even saying the case could be tossed out? Plus, a massive breach of trust by Facebook peddling access to your private messages. Has Mark Zuckerberg's company finally gone too far? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz. With much of the government shutdown at least through Christmas, with Defense Chief Jim Mattis leaving, with U.S. troops pulling out of Syria, with stock market sharply declining, the media are now pushing this narrative as described by The Washington Post. \"Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling.\" Politico says Trump allies are privately expressing new levels of concern about the president's erratic behavior. Some pundits on the right joined in the criticism when the president agreed to a stop-gap funding compromise with zero funding (ph) from the wall. And under pressure from House conservatives, Trump then bowed not to sign any bill without that funding, leading to this weekend's partial shutdown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Joining us now to analyze the coverage",
      "utterance": "Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios; and Philippe Reines, a former State Department official under Hillary Clinton. Mollie, some stories are saying we have a partial government shutdown because Donald Trump was coward and coerced by conservative commentators on Fox, by Rush Limbaugh, by Ann Coulter who hammered him for initially going along with that stop-gap funding bill, that wouldn't funded the wall at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, and that's because Donald Trump himself said - he said that he believed border security was important enough, that if it weren't funded, if this wall weren't funded, he would take credit for a government shutdown. And then it sounded like maybe there was some backtracking on that. So absolutely conservative media pushed back because they wanted to make sure he wasn't backtracking. And here we are. So, it's a good reflection that people's sentiment was somehow expressed in the media either through conservative media or otherwise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Interesting. It's not every week that Fox & Friends, the president's favorite show, criticizes Trump, in this case on both issues, Syria which we will get to and the wall and the shutdown maneuvering. Is it that certain pundits on the right are so powerful or are they seen as reflecting the views of Trump's base which as we know are important to him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAAL UNDER HILLARY CLINTON",
      "utterance": "Well, from my perspective as a Democrat who comes into the belly of the beast pretty often, it seems to me that what triggers Republican on Republican violence is usually immigration. And I think the problem is, that Mollie just touched on, is that the president is not hardcore believer in much of anything to the extent that he has no problem coming off these things. So, it happened with DACA where you saw another one of these meetings where --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",

And I think it brings up a larger -- it brings up two, one is the -- but also brings that these are self-inflicted wounds. The president is so used to wanting cameras that he brings them in at times that they shouldn't be there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And speaking of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, and Mollie just referenced this, question for you, Sara, I want to play this soundbite that is being endlessly replayed by the media, that meeting less than two weeks ago."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA FISCHER, MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "That's right. Some even comparing this to George H.W. Bush's read my lips, no new taxes. When you verbally promise something to the American people with cameras involved, you have to be ready for any kind of push back when you go back from your word and that's exactly what Donald Trump is facing right now with his base and conservative members of the media saying, wait a minute, that's not what you just did and said last week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The withdrawal of the 2,000 troops from Syria was portrayed in the press as kind of a shocker. But Trump did say during the campaign and since that, you know, he is opposed to extend it or enlist military entanglements overseas, is he up against essentially a media establishment that favors military intervention?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely and we saw this - it's actually kind of a crisis. When you are seeing all these stories about pulling back our presence in Syria, you're getting nothing but quotes from people who think that we should have perpetual presence in Syria. It is true that a lot of people in the foreign policy establishment all think the same way. They all supported lengthy intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan which is on 17 years --"

      "utterance": "-- and they are for now that we accomplished our stated mission in Syria, they are trying to change the stated mission from military defeat of ISIS into enduring defeat of ISIS, which is something that could mean that we will be there for 17 years. So, you are not getting a lot of diversity of viewpoint and it's a serious problem. It is something that media people need to make sure they are getting that viewpoint from people who don't believe in endless intervention in Syria."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You know, president just fight this by saying ISIS has been defeated or largely defeated. Seems to be liberals have to be restrained on this because Barack Obama, you worked in that administration, pulled out of Iraq, got hammered by the right for it, and he also in a way shared Donald Trump's aversion to endless war in these places."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "I don't think this is a high-minded debate about where the U.S. should be deployed. I think this is more simply about congressional Republicans which is basically Donald Trump's firewall, that he has on occasion basically dared to leave him first with Charlottesville, then with -- now with this, with the Saudi killing. He's leaving them no choice but to criticize them. I don't think that's an intervention or non-intervention thing. It is don't trifle with the people who are doing your bidding --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I actually think that one of the problems we have seen in media coverage has been this perception that only - that Republicans only disagree with him. You have multiple senators who are supporting him including Senator Mike Lee and Senator Rand Paul. You have people on both sides of the aisle who do not believe that we should have this perpetual presence."
    },

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Of course. But even more than that, only 18 percent of Americans last year supported having troops in Syria and Tim Kaine, my senator from Virginia, has been trying to get a new resolution passed to support this endless situation in Syria and he has had no success. So I think this is a false narrative that is being perpetuated --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me move on from Lindsey Graham to Jim Mattis, because look, widely respected. He is leaving a very big story. But is the press going a little overboard in portraying him as the last man standing between Donald Trump and the collapse of the western alliance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "Of course. I mean, we have a large defense department, we have a large defense infrastructure. However, he was viewed as one of the biggest sounding boards in one of the most fundamental rocks when it comes to foreign policy. And so him leaving does scare a lot of people. Going back to your point though about media and how they are taking a look at this, you now, I was watching CNN this morning. They had Bob Corker on and they had Rand Paul on. I think that we have to make sure that we are watching each individual's show and taking into account which views they put on. It's not always so one-sided."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "And just one other thing I want to mention, not all the media coverage has been bad. I think it was a CNN story or somewhere where I read that eight months ago, Donald Trump told General Mattis, we need to be out of Syria within six months, eight months ago. So, learning some of the contexts of the situation --"

Washington is pretty rattled. New York is rattled. What about the media just making this all one big bowl of Trumpian chaos? And watching the banners on CNN, MSNBC, they are all like shutdown looms as Mattis resigns as stock market tanks or stock market tanks as Mattis resigns, a shutdown loom. CNN's favorite is Trump tailspin. What do you make of its all Trump?"
    },

It's also true that it has been forced by inaction among both parties, both houses, and this is something that you - by noticing it doesn't mean you're the cause of the problem. By saying we finally have to deal it with doesn't mean you're the cause of the problem. It just means you're saying this has to get done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Philippe, is the coverage of the Syrian pull out influenced by the fact that essentially Trump's style, he did this against the advice of many White House aides, he overruled Mattis, he didn't tell his congressional allies, he didn't tell allies in foreign capitals, and so does that add to the media sensible arm?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",

And I think there is some psychology going on."

The judge in this case has a long reputation of being someone who says, if you plead to something, you better have done it. And so he gave them every opportunity to pull back on their plea.

One one on-the-record comment which is a denial. My had a name for junk articles like this. Birdcage lining.\" Ah, gossip, birdcage lining. Who does that remind you of? Politico spokesman Brad Dayspring responded, \"it's hard to know what the criticism of the piece is, since the congresswoman-elect doesn't specify not has she or anyone from her staff asked for a correction. We stand by our reporting\" Now, even some conservatives are saying that Ocasio-Cortez kind of reminds them of Donald Trump with her uncanny knock for drawing media attention, her tendency toward fact-challenge comments, and a willingness to pick fights with the press. She accused a Washington Examiner reporter who said her wardrobe didn't match her low income status of misogyny. Birdcage lining may be her version of fake news. Germany's Der Spiegel has fired a reporter in a massive scandal involving years of fabricated stories and made-up characters. Now, U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell has written its top editor demanding an outside investigation of \"anti-American bias at the magazine that has exploded since the election of Donald Trump.\" Grenell, a former Fox News contributor, says Der Spiegel routinely doesn't call for comment (ph) and that the U.S. has lost faith in its editing and fact-checking.

Suddenly, conservative commentators, in which you have been one, you're an author, you hosted a radio show, have so much power they can tell the president what to do in this new meme because they objected to the initial compromise that would averted the shutdown, but also had zero funding for the border wall."

The press needs to make up its mind. Is it Limbaugh, is it Ann Coulter, is it Laura Ingraham, or is it Donald Trump. Well, maybe there are a lot of conservatives with opinions and strong opinions. But we've never had a president like him. And for all those who complained year after year to the press that you know it's too staged, it's too phony, it's too artificial. This is not an artificial president."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "utterance": "Yeah, sure. I mean, I think, it sips through the air vents. It troubles people. But at the end of the day what matters to people is whether things get done, so that their individual lives are better. And I think he's making a very good case on that front. We'll see. The American people can stand a lot more than people think. We are not delicate flowers, we can handle it."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Despite that reporting, CNN, MSNBC, and other outlets stuck with the narrative that Mattis was quitting in protest. BRIAN WILLIAMS, THE 11th HOUR ANCHOR: Perhaps the most of grave and consequential of the Trump presidency thus far, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has resigned in protest of Trump's policies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now, Gillian Turner, our Fox News correspondent and a White House national security official in the Bush and Obama administrations. So, Gillian, Fox News' Jennifer Griffin, CNN's Barbara Starr, two best Pentagon reporters said Mattis was forced out. Others have disagreed. Obviously, he did rebuke the president in his resignation letter saying here's what I believe, you're entitled to have somebody who shares your belief. What's your take?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "I think that both things can be true at once, as this is the case with a lot of senior White House officials, cabinet officials who have policy disagreements with the sitting president, they will negotiate and exit. So it's a little bit of one side wants out, the other side wants them out. And so, they come together and make it happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And that matches my own reporting, which is that Mattis while clearly frustrated, has been telling friends, a number of friends, I will never ever quit. He said that out of loyalty to the soldiers. At the same time, Trump had sent signals he would like Mattis to move on. And when he couldn't change the president's mind on Syria and also possibly withdrawing half the troops from Afghanistan, by that point, I think it was mutual. I can't remember another cabinet officer, maybe going back to Jim Baker who was portrayed by the president as being as indispensable as this one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Which is interesting. I mean, it's interesting that we've gotten to the point where Jim Mattis is now perceived by the media as sort of an all- star American hero. Because if you remember back to 2016, when his name was first circulated, it was Jim Mattis, Mad Dog Mattis. He's good on the ground, the troops love him, but is he strategic enough? Can he really make policy, does he have enough policy-making experience? And now, suddenly, because President Trump and he had parted way, he's an American hero."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, heroism can be situational in the way media cover it. The president tweeting just yesterday, if your favorite president announced -- if anyone other than, excuse me, your favorite president announced we're going to bring our troops back off from Syria after decimating ISIS, they would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the fake news media. Crazy. That's one view of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It is one view of it. I think what the president -- I hate doing this, what President Trump really meant to say. But..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He feels he's been unfairly hammered."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "He feels he's been unfairly hammered. The very obvious reality to anybody that pays attention to military policy is that there is never a good time to withdraw American troops from the midst of an ongoing civil war in another country. But if you don't ever make the decision..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You were there for a hundred years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "And so, to me, the very obvious response from the Trump administration to all of this should be, this is a hard choice. It's not an obvious choice. There are risks inherent in whatever decision we make. But we said we would pull out and so now, we're pulling out. There is never a good time to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. David Sanger had a fair-minded analysis in the New York Times, writing Trump's view, the American forces cannot alter the strategic balance in the Middle East and should not be there. It's fundamentally shared by his media predecessor, Barack Obama, who of course, pulled out of Iraq. It's being portrayed as Trump is doing this radical thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "This radical thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Obama ran against it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I think the media has a really important role to play here at this moment, which is to hold Congress accountable. Congress, both sides of the aisle, are now railing about the president withdrawing. They've never given the president authorization to send American troops into Syria in the first place. The troops that are there fighting in the Syrian civil war are there in violation of U.S. and international law. And I think it's the media's job to point out that Congress is playing wolf and being a bunch of hypocrites."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "As you say, there are no good choices here. But I have to say, along with Mattis as a hero -- look, I highly respect Jim Mattis and his service to the country, and the job he did in the Pentagon. There is also this other view that I think is getting -- playing the press, which is a lot of people don't want troops to be there forever. How much can they accomplish in a war-torn country, military crisis like Syria?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I mean, name a Democrat in 2020 that is going to run on a platform..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Send more troops. Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Sending more troops to the Middle East. There is no one. Maybe Joe Biden, maybe he would. It seems like he wants to get the job done finally. OK, that's fine, but he's the only one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think you have put it in a perspective just with that one observation. Gillian Turner, thanks for joining us this Sunday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "You got it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Still to come, Facebook letting other corporations snoop on your private messages. And the backlash is building. That's next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "This is a Fox News alert, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who said in his resignation letter that he would stay on through the end of February is leaving as of January 1. President Trump just tweeted this news. He will be replaced on an interim basis, acting secretary, the Deputy Pentagon Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over. This undoubtedly is a result of the harsh resignation letter that Mattis wrote. The president I think not pleased moving up the date. All right. Getting back to other news. Facebook has been battered by a series of scandals. But what maybe the biggest and broadest breach of trust, the New York Times reports that the social network made deals with such companies as Netflix and Spotify, allowing them to access your private messages, personal communications that you thought you have every right to expect were safe from corporate snooping. Joining us now, Shana Glenzer, a technology analyst here in Washington. So unlike all these other investigations, it seems like this hits people in the gut. Private messages, personal, confidential stuff, to me, it seems pretty outrageous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHANA GLENZER, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST",
      "utterance": "People are understandably on edge. They feel like they cannot trust Facebook. And yet, here is another reason why. So, while I don't think it's totally outrageous that Netflix could see messages created on Netflix using Facebook technology, it's really not the point. It feels incredibly invasive. It's feels like yet another betrayal in this year of Russian infiltration and data breaches from Facebook. And people are not being reassured that Facebook gets it, that Facebook understands that they're worried and they're concerned, and maybe deleting their accounts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a lot more intrusive. I understand if you are on Netflix and talking about movies with someone else. But why should we believe Facebook that that's all it is? I mean, once another corporation has access -- I mean, I always thought these private messages were sacrosanct, maybe I don't want other people to know what you're talking about or who you are talking to. It feels to me like another betrayal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So the messaging technology is something they loaned out to other companies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "A lot of other companies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "A lot of other companies. They didn't do a good job communicating this. They also didn't a good job this week with any responses to this report. I mean, they missed the mark by miles in again reassuring people. They were super defensive about they did nothing wrong here. And I think people are looking for Facebook to do more than just meet the letter of the law. They're sharing all these personal information on Facebook. They want to be reassured that it's safe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Facebook has put out a statement saying it wasn't really a breach of privacy, it wasn't a breach of consent decree settled with the Federal Trade Commission. But we can do better. And no apology or video from Mark Zuckerberg -- I think Facebook is just being a little tone deaf here. Even if it thinks it did nothing wrong, they got to understand how much it upsets people. Now, technology reporter Walt Mossberg who started out at the Wall Street Journal, has worked in other places, announcing he is deleting his account because his values no longer match those of Facebook. MSNBC anchor Casie Hunt doing the same thing. What do you make of that? Is there a growing backlash over privacy issues against the social network?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "This certainly seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back for several high profile names like Casie. However, I think most of people have become pretty desensitized to this news. They've heard it over and over again this year from Facebook. It's the new normal relationship with Facebook where they say, listen, I don't trust them. But I'm still going to post pictures of my kids on Facebook. They just come to expect that these things will happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I'm not predicting a great wave of people leaving their accounts, unless the younger people think Facebook is no longer hip enough. But doesn't it erode the brand that was once a glittering brand, that of Facebook?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "It certainly does. And Facebook will feel the pain of losing some of these high-profile names, less engagement with reporters on Facebook. And a lot -- you know, highly less ad dollars as well. So Facebook will feel the pain. And certainly, it's tarnished much yet again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The new normal, as you put it. And perhaps something they will need to get used to, many social networks criticized this week on the Russia business. Shana Glenzer, great to see you. Thanks for stopping by. Well, that's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. Merry Christmas to you and your families on this holiday weekend.
