That's a tough number early in a midterm election year for the President of the United States. Now why is this happening? This is fascinating. We asked people, what has President Biden done for you that you approve of? Fifty-six percent of Americans, nearly six in 10 Americans. That means a decent amount of Democrats said nothing. They disapprove of everything that has happened.",

And that's coming from CNN. So, I would double it. I take everything I get from CNN and double it, including Brian Stelter's BMI. Of course, CNN defended Joe pointing out that he passed that infrastructure plan. And King worries that the good stuff Joe didn't -- did, is it really sinking in. Maybe because like our Olympic athletes, we can't name one. But also, we're now a country plagued by random crime, hopeless violence, inflation, government tracking, and a disintegrating border. Where is this good stuff that we were promised? The same poll about COVID. Another 60 percent said they were angry, and 75 percent were burned out. It's like Joe is turned to all of us into the V.P.'s former staffers. No wonder Biden's minions are desperately trying to pretend he's been leading us all along.",

Yes, it's if you're going to feel better when you ask the cashier why you're paying 60 bucks for two pork chops. And she says, don't worry, Paul Krugman says prices will be back to normal next year. And it makes you wonder why this almost only happens under Democrats. Well, because thanks to some of the disciples in the media, they can. Check out this NPR headline, it reads, inflation hits another 40-year high. It's bad, but older folks say they've seen worse. Now technically, they could be right if they were talking about Pearl Harbor, the Hindenburg or scrunchies. But imagine if you use the -- it's been worse excuse about climate change or racism. Yet they use it on crime and inflation. The things that affect the poor and working class and minorities that they claim to protect. Look on the bright side. It's not an all-time high for murder, just a 25-year high. Right now, as inflation rises, so does mass theft, which is close to closing stores and forcing remaining businesses to lock up their goods and then raise more prices. Prices are so high. I was in a CVS in Times Square and I saw Jesse Waters slipping three boxes of Rogaine into his pants. It's no wonder there's yet another horrible poll for Pete for Joe. According to Pew, only one in five Americans believe he will ever be successful. But this doesn't even register with Joe who's busy competing with Kamala for who wants to be seen less. So, the reason why Americans think Joe is doing nothing for them is because he's doing nothing for them. And his own loony left whom he relies on now for everything thinks the public concerns are laughable. Al Sharpton of all people says the government must end the crime wave. And he got mocked for it by the left. He was complaining how drugstores have to lock up toothpaste now. And really the last thing we want is someone with a mouth as big as his, not to brush his teeth. But let the fiction writer Nikole Hannah-Jones says who cares? There's always been theft. Also coming out against shoplifting only encourages the prison state. And here I thought the left was OK with China. So, we're at weird times when suddenly Al Sharpton sounds like William F. Buckley. I wonder what Joe has to say.",

Who can handle that? Besides plywood salesman. Well also rich whites who just order off Amazon or send their assistants to another store. So, the Dems are screwed, and they deserve it. Here's why. You can't obsess over woke concerns and also fight crime or inflation. The hard-left priorities have taken up all this shelf space in Joe's limited brain. So, there's an opportunity cost to this identity politics, and ironically, it's affecting the identities that the left claim to defend. So, you got an aimless unconcerned president who seems to be the only person that wants to go to vacation in Delaware in winter. You got the media and party trying to salvage a dying administration. And you have an emboldened left who think crime is what you deserve. Remember when the press said this was going to be so much better than Trump? Who knew they meant better for murderers, thugs, thieves, and 2022 Republican candidates?",

Back in January, their lazy writers published a hit piece on Mike referring to him as just another young white guy not qualified to be a head coach. They argue the NFL should focus on black candidates more deserving of the job. After learning McDaniel was in fact, biracial, they were forced to update the story days later. So, good for Mike for not playing the identity politics game. But here is a crazy idea. Hire him and let him prove if he's qualified or not. I'm not saying coaching football is an easy job. But I've seen 12-year olds who are amazing at playing Madden. And chances are there is always going to be someone more deserving of a job than the person hired.

We asked people, what has President Biden done for you that you approve of? Fifty-six percent of Americans, nearly six in 10 Americans. That means a decent amount of Democrats said nothing. They disapprove of everything that has happened."

And that's coming from CNN. So, I would double it. I take everything I get from CNN and double it, including Brian Stelter's BMI. Of course, CNN defended Joe pointing out that he passed that infrastructure plan. And King worries that the good stuff Joe didn't -- did, is it really sinking in. Maybe because like our Olympic athletes, we can't name one. But also, we're now a country plagued by random crime, hopeless violence, inflation, government tracking, and a disintegrating border. Where is this good stuff that we were promised? The same poll about COVID. Another 60 percent said they were angry, and 75 percent were burned out. It's like Joe is turned to all of us into the V.P.'s former staffers. No wonder Biden's minions are desperately trying to pretend he's been leading us all along."

Yes, it's if you're going to feel better when you ask the cashier why you're paying 60 bucks for two pork chops. And she says, don't worry, Paul Krugman says prices will be back to normal next year. And it makes you wonder why this almost only happens under Democrats. Well, because thanks to some of the disciples in the media, they can. Check out this NPR headline, it reads, inflation hits another 40-year high. It's bad, but older folks say they've seen worse. Now technically, they could be right if they were talking about Pearl Harbor, the Hindenburg or scrunchies. But imagine if you use the -- it's been worse excuse about climate change or racism. Yet they use it on crime and inflation. The things that affect the poor and working class and minorities that they claim to protect. Look on the bright side. It's not an all-time high for murder, just a 25-year high. Right now, as inflation rises, so does mass theft, which is close to closing stores and forcing remaining businesses to lock up their goods and then raise more prices. Prices are so high. I was in a CVS in Times Square and I saw Jesse Waters slipping three boxes of Rogaine into his pants. It's no wonder there's yet another horrible poll for Pete for Joe. According to Pew, only one in five Americans believe he will ever be successful. But this doesn't even register with Joe who's busy competing with Kamala for who wants to be seen less. So, the reason why Americans think Joe is doing nothing for them is because he's doing nothing for them. And his own loony left whom he relies on now for everything thinks the public concerns are laughable. Al Sharpton of all people says the government must end the crime wave. And he got mocked for it by the left. He was complaining how drugstores have to lock up toothpaste now. And really the last thing we want is someone with a mouth as big as his, not to brush his teeth. But let the fiction writer Nikole Hannah-Jones says who cares? There's always been theft. Also coming out against shoplifting only encourages the prison state. And here I thought the left was OK with China. So, we're at weird times when suddenly Al Sharpton sounds like William F. Buckley. I wonder what Joe has to say."

You can't obsess over woke concerns and also fight crime or inflation. The hard-left priorities have taken up all this shelf space in Joe's limited brain. So, there's an opportunity cost to this identity politics, and ironically, it's affecting the identities that the left claim to defend. So, you got an aimless unconcerned president who seems to be the only person that wants to go to vacation in Delaware in winter. You got the media and party trying to salvage a dying administration. And you have an emboldened left who think crime is what you deserve. Remember when the press said this was going to be so much better than Trump?

On Thursday, the Biden administration urged Justin Trudeau to use federal power to end the blockade, but as often says there's a willingness to respond with whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to end it. Seems like what it would take is to end the mandates. Others like CNN analyst Juliette Kayyem advocated vigilantism tweeting, slashed the tires, empty gas tanks, arrest the drivers and move the trucks. Geez, Juliette. We'd love to know how to move the trucks after you slashed their tires. Typical woman. A sexist would say. But she later backtracked saying she wasn't promoting vigilantism. Adding, people have the freedom to protest, governments have the responsibility to protect public safety. That's what I intended to say.

They argue the NFL should focus on black candidates more deserving of the job. After learning McDaniel was in fact, biracial, they were forced to update the story days later. So, good for Mike for not playing the identity politics game. But here is a crazy idea. Hire him and let him prove if he's qualified or not. I'm not saying coaching football is an easy job.

Finally, the people of Colorado pick the Brian Stelter biopic, 40-Year-Old Virgin. Around the horn, we don't have much time, Liz. You are -- you and -- you got a favorite rom-com for Valentine's Day?"
