      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Donald Trump Jr., is here tonight to set the record straight about his June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. He will join us for an exclusive in-depth interview. That's coming up in just a minute. And by the way, for all the members of the destroy media that have to tune into my show tonight, get out your pad and your pen. You may actually learn a thing or two. And we have a message for you, so maybe you want to take notes. Now, we're going to lay out the real scandals that you are not covering that you should be covering. If you were actual journalists, you would be.  But first, let's lay out the facts of this story. And that is tonight's very important \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, so earlier today after The New York Times started reporting on the content of email exchanges prior to this meeting at Trump Tower, Donald Trump Jr., released what he says is the entire email chain. Now, contact was initiated by Rob Goldstone. He's a music publicist who represents a Russian pop star who knows the Trump family from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that took place in Moscow.  And on June 3, 2016, Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., quote, \"Good morning. Emin\" -- the Russian pop star -- \"just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information, but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump, helped along by Aras and Emin. So what do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly? I can also send this information to your father via Rhona, but it's ultrasensitive so wanted to send to you first. Best, Bob Goldstone.\" About 20 minutes later, Donald Trump, Jr., replied, quote, \"Thanks, Bob. I appreciate it. I am on the road at the moment, but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back? Best, Don.\"  And in following emails, the two go back and forth about setting up that phone call. And then they eventually work out a time for a sit-down meeting with this Russian lawyer. Now, Donald Trump Jr., also released a statement earlier today explaining that he was releasing the emails to be transparent. He also detailed why he took the meeting.  His statement reads, in part, quote, \"The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research. I first wanted to just have a phone call, but when that didn't work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. As we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was the most inane nonsense I have ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.\"   In addition to all of that, the Russian lawyer at the center of this story spoke to NBC News where she denied working for the Russian government. Take a look.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Now, NBC is also quoting the Russian lawyer as saying, quote, \"I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that.\" And in a previous statement, Donald Trump Jr. said the same thing, that the lawyer never produced solid information about Hillary Clinton. In fact, he says she didn't even really make sense when talking about Clinton.  And it's worth noting, by the way, that President Trump's legal team pointed out that they think the whole meeting could have been a setup that was made to look like potential Russia collusion. Now, the legal team also says that this Russian lawyer is connected to Fusion GPS, which is the opposition research firm that produced the discredited Christopher Steele dossier on Donald Trump.   And by the way, as The New York Post has reported, Fusion GPS has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies and even Planned Parenthood. So from looking at the facts as we have them, a friend of the Trumps offered to coordinate a meeting to share opposition research on Hillary Clinton, which Donald Trump, Jr., agreed to. Nothing came of it because there was no information exchange. And it ended there.  Democrats, the mainstream media are right now hysterical over the story. By the way, we're glad you're all watching. But they have completely ignored an example of actual election interference, and I would argue probably because it involves a Democrat. So to be fair to you, the American people, tonight -- and we want to be balanced -- we need to point this out. And the question you people in the media need to start asking yourselves is, why don't you tell the American people every story? For example, back in January, the Politico, hardly members of the right-wing conspiracy, published this explosive report. Quote, \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\" Now, the report there lays out how a DNC operative and Ukrainian government officials tried to aid and assist Hillary Clinton and damage Donald Trump.  Now, this DNC operative, who according to Politico used to work at the Clinton White House, well, spearheaded this entire effort, including by meeting with Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to go after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Now, this operative even told Politico the Ukraine diplomats were, quote, \"helpful\" in tracking leads.  And then there's this bombshell. Quote, \"She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton's campaign.\" And on top of all of that, the operative claims that she gave guidance and off the record information to, quote, a lot of journalists who were writing about Paul Manafort and Donald Trump's potential ties to Russia.\" Now that you, our audience, have evidence from both sides, you got to decide for yourself. We report, you decide. What's worse? And I'll pose this question to everybody in the media that's forced to tune in tonight. Which is worse? Why haven't you covered that story? And better yet, well, why didn't news organizations extensively report on Ukrainian collusion? Now, Politico -- they did all the heavy lifting for you. All you had to do was follow up.  Is it because many of the so-called top news organizations in this country exposed before the election as having colluded with the Clinton campaign? Remember WikiLeaks? And if you're interested, really interested in election interference, why didn't you care that a congressional investigation found in 2014 an Israeli political group used a $300,000 Obama State Department grant to create a political apparatus to try and defeat our ally, our friend, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? Or how about the WikiLeaks email that shows a Clinton a campaign ad talking about how a Chinese ambassador wanted to have a private off-the- record meeting?   So in other words, do you members of this corrupt media, do you even know about these stories? And by the way, since you are so interested in prosecuting people and accusing them of crimes, well, let's talk about real crimes that have been committed that you in the media so often ignore. Hillary Clinton -- let's see. We know she mishandled and destroyed top secret special access program classified government information. But what about a real Russian collusion conspiracy? That's the Uranium One deal. Remember, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, she signed off on giving up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. And all those people in the deal? Well, they kicked back over $100 million to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. And let's not forget the Clinton Foundation. They took millions of dollars from countries that have the most atrocious human rights records.  And how about a Senate report showing that the Trump administration has had to deal -- since he took office, the president --with 125 deep state leaks in 126 days, which, by the way, are all likely felonies and happened at a rate which is seven times greater than the previous two administrations.  What about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn? You all followed the story. Have you been reporting on the fact that he was unmasked and that intel, raw intelligence, was leaked to the press? Well, that would be a crime. Then there's James Comey, a report from The Hill saying that four of Comey's seven memos contained classified information and that the considers the memos to be government property, meaning that Comey may have committed two felonies, broken the law, removing those files from the FBI.   Now, I'll end it on this note to the mainstream media. You have zero credibility left. You have been caught time and time again spreading fake news stories -- you'll be critical of all my interviews -- and you carry out your personal attacks against the president, against his family and anybody that dares to be associated with the president. By the way, here's just one minor small example. Liberal Joe, NBC -- what has he called the president of the United States? A schmuck, a goon, a thug, mentally unhinged. And then the president fights back a little and you in the mainstream media, are you proud of how NBC News handles things, or CNN? My guess is you probably have defended all this.  Since, really, the media in America today, we have an information crisis -- overpaid, lazy, rigid left-wing ideologues. But that's for another night.  Tonight, we have Donald Trump, Jr. We will ask him every single question I can think of on this topic. Don Jr., good to see you. Welcome back.",

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Donald Trump Jr., is here tonight to set the record straight about his June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. He will join us for an exclusive in-depth interview. That's coming up in just a minute. And by the way, for all the members of the destroy media that have to tune into my show tonight, get out your pad and your pen. You may actually learn a thing or two. And we have a message for you, so maybe you want to take notes. Now, we're going to lay out the real scandals that you are not covering that you should be covering. If you were actual journalists, you would be. But first, let's lay out the facts of this story. And that is tonight's very important \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, so earlier today after The New York Times started reporting on the content of email exchanges prior to this meeting at Trump Tower, Donald Trump Jr., released what he says is the entire email chain. Now, contact was initiated by Rob Goldstone. He's a music publicist who represents a Russian pop star who knows the Trump family from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that took place in Moscow. And on June 3, 2016, Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr., quote, \"Good morning. Emin\" -- the Russian pop star -- \"just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information, but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump, helped along by Aras and Emin. So what do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly? I can also send this information to your father via Rhona, but it's ultrasensitive so wanted to send to you first. Best, Bob Goldstone.\" About 20 minutes later, Donald Trump, Jr., replied, quote, \"Thanks, Bob. I appreciate it. I am on the road at the moment, but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back? Best, Don.\" And in following emails, the two go back and forth about setting up that phone call. And then they eventually work out a time for a sit-down meeting with this Russian lawyer. Now, Donald Trump Jr., also released a statement earlier today explaining that he was releasing the emails to be transparent. He also detailed why he took the meeting. His statement reads, in part, quote, \"The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research. I first wanted to just have a phone call, but when that didn't work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. As we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was the most inane nonsense I have ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.\" In addition to all of that, the Russian lawyer at the center of this story spoke to NBC News where she denied working for the Russian government. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIER SIMMONS, NBC CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Have you ever worked for the Russian government? Do you have connections to the Russian government?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA, RUSSIAN ATTORNEY (through translator)",
      "utterance": "No."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, NBC is also quoting the Russian lawyer as saying, quote, \"I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that.\" And in a previous statement, Donald Trump Jr. said the same thing, that the lawyer never produced solid information about Hillary Clinton. In fact, he says she didn't even really make sense when talking about Clinton. And it's worth noting, by the way, that President Trump's legal team pointed out that they think the whole meeting could have been a setup that was made to look like potential Russia collusion. Now, the legal team also says that this Russian lawyer is connected to Fusion GPS, which is the opposition research firm that produced the discredited Christopher Steele dossier on Donald Trump. And by the way, as The New York Post has reported, Fusion GPS has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies and even Planned Parenthood. So from looking at the facts as we have them, a friend of the Trumps offered to coordinate a meeting to share opposition research on Hillary Clinton, which Donald Trump, Jr., agreed to. Nothing came of it because there was no information exchange. And it ended there. Democrats, the mainstream media are right now hysterical over the story. By the way, we're glad you're all watching. But they have completely ignored an example of actual election interference, and I would argue probably because it involves a Democrat. So to be fair to you, the American people, tonight -- and we want to be balanced -- we need to point this out. And the question you people in the media need to start asking yourselves is, why don't you tell the American people every story? For example, back in January, the Politico, hardly members of the right-wing conspiracy, published this explosive report. Quote, \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\" Now, the report there lays out how a DNC operative and Ukrainian government officials tried to aid and assist Hillary Clinton and damage Donald Trump. Now, this DNC operative, who according to Politico used to work at the Clinton White House, well, spearheaded this entire effort, including by meeting with Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to go after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Now, this operative even told Politico the Ukraine diplomats were, quote, \"helpful\" in tracking leads. And then there's this bombshell. Quote, \"She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton's campaign.\" And on top of all of that, the operative claims that she gave guidance and off the record information to, quote, a lot of journalists who were writing about Paul Manafort and Donald Trump's potential ties to Russia.\" Now that you, our audience, have evidence from both sides, you got to decide for yourself. We report, you decide. What's worse? And I'll pose this question to everybody in the media that's forced to tune in tonight. Which is worse? Why haven't you covered that story? And better yet, well, why didn't news organizations extensively report on Ukrainian collusion? Now, Politico -- they did all the heavy lifting for you. All you had to do was follow up. Is it because many of the so-called top news organizations in this country exposed before the election as having colluded with the Clinton campaign? Remember WikiLeaks? And if you're interested, really interested in election interference, why didn't you care that a congressional investigation found in 2014 an Israeli political group used a $300,000 Obama State Department grant to create a political apparatus to try and defeat our ally, our friend, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu? Or how about the WikiLeaks email that shows a Clinton a campaign ad talking about how a Chinese ambassador wanted to have a private off-the- record meeting? So in other words, do you members of this corrupt media, do you even know about these stories? And by the way, since you are so interested in prosecuting people and accusing them of crimes, well, let's talk about real crimes that have been committed that you in the media so often ignore. Hillary Clinton -- let's see. We know she mishandled and destroyed top secret special access program classified government information. But what about a real Russian collusion conspiracy? That's the Uranium One deal. Remember, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, she signed off on giving up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. And all those people in the deal? Well, they kicked back over $100 million to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. And let's not forget the Clinton Foundation. They took millions of dollars from countries that have the most atrocious human rights records. And how about a Senate report showing that the Trump administration has had to deal -- since he took office, the president --with 125 deep state leaks in 126 days, which, by the way, are all likely felonies and happened at a rate which is seven times greater than the previous two administrations. What about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn? You all followed the story. Have you been reporting on the fact that he was unmasked and that intel, raw intelligence, was leaked to the press? Well, that would be a crime. Then there's James Comey, a report from The Hill saying that four of Comey's seven memos contained classified information and that the considers the memos to be government property, meaning that Comey may have committed two felonies, broken the law, removing those files from the FBI. Now, I'll end it on this note to the mainstream media. You have zero credibility left. You have been caught time and time again spreading fake news stories -- you'll be critical of all my interviews -- and you carry out your personal attacks against the president, against his family and anybody that dares to be associated with the president. By the way, here's just one minor small example. Liberal Joe, NBC -- what has he called the president of the United States? A schmuck, a goon, a thug, mentally unhinged. And then the president fights back a little and you in the mainstream media, are you proud of how NBC News handles things, or CNN? My guess is you probably have defended all this. Since, really, the media in America today, we have an information crisis -- overpaid, lazy, rigid left-wing ideologues. But that's for another night. Tonight, we have Donald Trump, Jr. We will ask him every single question I can think of on this topic. Don Jr., good to see you. Welcome back."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "With him. OK. So he sends you this email. We'll put it back up on the screen, and give you a chance to look at this. This is the one that says the crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father, meaning Emin's father, and in their meeting, offered to provide the Trump campaign with documents, information that could incriminate Hillary Clinton, et cetera. Obviously, highly sensitive information. But it's part of Russia and its government's support of Mr. Trump. And then they ask the best way to handle this. This email comes in. What are you thinking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Honestly, my takeaway, when all of this was going on, is that someone has information on our opponent. You know, things are going a million miles an hour. You know what it's like to be on a campaign. We just won Indiana, but we're talking about a contested convention. Things are going a million miles an hour again. And Hey, wait a minute, I've heard about all these things, but maybe this is something. I should hear him out."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Honestly, I don't know. I mean, I think -- this was, again, just basic information that was going to be possibly there. I didn't know these guys well enough to understand that if this talent manager from Miss Universe, you know, had this kind of thing -- so I wanted to hear him out and play it out and see what happens. But you know, people are trying to reach out to you all the time with this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So you spent a lot of time talking about, and you actually said at one point that, Hey, if it turns out to say what you say it is..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Of course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "What did you think it might be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Listen, I'd been reading about scandals that people were probably underreporting for a long time. So maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things. I mean, this is her perhaps involvement with the Russian government. So you know, again, I didn't know there was any credibility. I didn't know if there was anything behind it. I can't vouch for the information. You know, someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me, you know? I read it. I responded accordingly. And if there was something interesting there -- I think that's pretty common."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "What about the timeline of this? This is pre, for example, WikiLeaks and the DNC emails..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Well, honestly, this is pre, like, Russia fever. This is pre Russia mania. You know, this is 13 months ago, before I think the rest of the world was talking about that, trying to build up this narrative about Russia. So I don't even think my sirens, you know, went up or the antennas went up at this time because of it because it wasn't the issue that it's been made out to be over the last, you know, nine months, ten months since it really became a thing. So I think there is an element of context to that. At the time, it wasn't this big news story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Right. What did you know about Emin -- Emin's father? What did you know about them from Moscow? Was it just the pageant you met them at and the Doral concert..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "That they had the pageant and they're successful real estate developers over there. So you know, that's the extent of, you know, my knowledge with them. I'd met Emin one or twice and you know, maintained a casual relationship there, talked about some potential deals, and then (ph) to that (ph) the extent of it. They really didn't go anywhere."

But as you can see from the emails, the pretext of the meeting was, Hey, we have information. And there was, you know, some small talk. I don't even remember what it was. It just was sort of nonsensical, inane and garbled, and then quickly went on to, you know, a story about Russian adoption and how we could possibly help. And really, that's when we shut it down, which is, Wait a second, what does this have to do with what we were talking about?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, and he did say -- at the end of your statement today, you did point out, as Goldstone said today, the entire meeting was the most inane nonsense I've ever heard. And I'm actually, you know, agitated by it."

I think what happened -- he sort of goosed (ph) up. He built up. There was some puffery to the email, perhaps to get the meeting, to make it happen, and you know, in the end, there was probably some bait and switch about what it was really supposed to be about.

      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Well, I imagine I did. I mean, I was probably pressing because the pretext of the meeting was, Hey, I have information about your opponent. It was this, you know, Hey, some DNC donors may have done something and Russia and they didn't pay taxes -- I was, like, What does this have to do with anything? You know, especially in light of everything that was out there, I was, like, This isn't ..."

I also talked about a lot of other issues, the V-15 group that Obama's operatives and taxpayer dollars went to defeat Bibi. If going after foreign countries' elections is so bad -- very little media coverage. Real crimes have been committed in this country. I would argue Hillary Clinton destroying emails, mishandling, destroying them. I would argue Hillary Clinton, the Uranium One deal and the 100 million plus dollars kicked back to her. Comey, we know it's classified information and we know a violation of the Records Act. Loretta Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac, 125 leaks from the deep state in 126 days.

And I think the mainstream media has probably done themselves a pretty big disservice by going so far, by going so extreme, by being so sensational. And I think it's pushing regular people away because they want to see what my father campaigned on. They want to see jobs. They want to see the numbers that he's putting up. The stock market keeps breaking hits. We have the all-time highest employment in the country in terms of overall numbers, all these things that he promised he would do, they're happening.

Releasing the full email chain unlike Secretary Clinton who deleted her emails. Let's put that in perspective, number one. Number two, you look at it from a legal perspective here. There's no illegality in the meeting. The fact is nothing transpired. So what do we have here? I think Donald Trump Jr. said it correctly. There's a media frenzy on Russia right now. This has been going on for several months. But when you look to see what actually took place, a meeting took place. Nothing happened as a result of this 15 or 20 minute meeting. And at the end of the day, there's no illegality. So the people -- they want to create a media hysteria on this.

But there you have DNC operatives meeting with Ukrainian officials, swapping information back and forth. So let's put that in perspective. So here what do you have? A meeting that takes place and nothing happens. And then you raise the issue which I've been concerned about for a long time, and that was the whole issue of State Department funding going over to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars to a group that's running political campaigns against the Prime Minister in the state of Israel. Talking about engaging in electioneering in a foreign country, there you have it. But again, it's not even fair to say double standard.

He released the email, answered every question, explained what happened and didn't happen. It seems consistent with what the woman says, the lawyer from Russia, Jared says. I don't know what Manafort was saying. I don't know what there there is, and wouldn't every campaign, if they were told there's information, op research, isn't that what Hillary's campaign, the DNC did with Ukraine?"

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Remember, let's put this into the perspective of what was going on. They were in the middle of a campaign that was in the heat of the campaign here. What happens? Someone comes forward with opposition research. Is anybody saying, by the way, why did the DNC have their operatives meeting with the Ukrainians and actually getting information? Why is that not one standard and this is another? But let's look at again what law was violated here? Some of the theories that some of the commentators have put forward are ridiculous. There was no illegality in that meeting. In the end, on top of that, there was no information that was obtained. So there you have it."

      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently. Again, this is before the Russian mania, this is before they were building it up in the press. For me this was opposition research. They had something, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I had been hearing about but were probably underreported for years, not just during the campaign. So I think I wanted to hear it out. But really it went nowhere and it was apparent that that wasn't what the meeting with actually about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So it's being reported tonight -- Donald Trump, by the way, from our exclusive interview tonight. Jay Sekulow, who is with the American Center for Law and Justice, chief counsel, also a counsel for the president. Here is what the amazing thing -- we've got Ukraine. We've got the Bibi Netanyahu, Obama tried to impact that election. You've got the MI6, the intelligence guy from Great Britain, his dossier. Who paid for that? And then we've got real crimes. For example, do you believe or have any doubt that Hillary Clinton committed crimes, mishandling and destroying classified, top secret special access program information?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Look, we could start with the server that was held in the townhouse in Colorado. Then you go to what James Comey said when he saw the evident, that it was extreme carelessness, which, by the way, is the definition of gross negligence which is what the criminal statute has for mishandling. Then let's talk about James Comey and add him to this. Here's a guy that leaks information, think about this, he leaks information based on conversations he had with the president of the United States, leaks them to go to a reporter through a friend of his at Columbia Law School for the sole purpose of doing what? Obtaining a special counsel which ends up getting appointed. So basically, look at this, Sean. The special counsel is appointed based on evidence that was illegally distributed. Think about that for a moment with the legitimacy of this entire process. And instead what we've got now is Donald Trump Jr. comes forward, releases all the emails, the emails chains, and the media is in a frenzy because he released the emails, unlike the opposition, who did not."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And over $100 million gets kicked back to the Clinton Foundation, and she's one of nine people that signed off on a waiver that allows 20 percent of America's uranium potentially to go to Vladimir Putin and Russia. Where I grew up, that's called bribery, pay to play, use whatever phrase you want. Do you doubt that was inappropriate and illegal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Let me tell you who would have never signed a deal like that for the United States. President Trump would have never authorized a deal like that, period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Agreed with that. And then we have got other issues. Then we've got Loretta Lynch, the tarmac meeting, it's a matter, it's not an investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "But look what she did. Look what Loretta Lynch did. She has this meeting with President Clinton while President Clinton's wife, the former secretary of state, Democratic nominee for president, is going to be interviewed that very weekend. She has this meeting with the president on the tarmac, right? Did she recuse herself from the investigation? No. She said she will abide by whatever the FBI decides but she did not formally recuse herself. So think about this for a moment. You talk about a double standard at play here. This is the ultimate discussion or ultimate example of a double standard. But look, I think at the end of the day, when you look at all of the evidence, there is one thing that becomes clear, and that is no illegality in that meeting. So the media could talk about it, but show me the criminal statute that is actually met with that kind of situation."

And this Trump colluding with Russia, it is all a dream, it is all a fairy tale, it is fake news, it is part of y'all denial stage. It is part of depression. Go home and get some rest."
