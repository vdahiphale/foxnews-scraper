      "sentences": "Thank you, John and Sandra. Great to see you today. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Martha McCallum live here in New York. Here's the story that is happening right now. Here we go. Congress is now taking up the latest piece of the second largest government spending stimulus package in history. This part of it is $1.9 trillion on top of the $4 trillion. We have never been in this territory before folks of the previous relief packages.   This as new research emerges that shows, you know what states actually did better during the pandemic than originally thought. And Americans saved $1.5 trillion as they hunkered down, didn't go to restaurants and go to bars, all of that and saved a ton of money. That is pent up right now once this economy gets out moving. Still, despite those realities, and a reopening of the economy in a number of places and a declining virus. The President believes politically that passing this bill is crucial, and this is important to his larger agenda.",

In fact, President Biden just finished meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers about his infrastructure plan, but a lot of the specifics are on hold until after the COVID relief package gets through, and so is the President's first address to a joint session of Congress.

And this is the first step, and obviously a $1.9 trillion bill, which is second to the Cares Act that we passed a year ago, the largest spending bill ever in the history of the country. At a time when we've got, you know, enormous amounts of debt, all this is borrowed money.   And we ought to be thinking about how do we target this? How do we do it in a fiscally responsible way? How do we help people who really need help to the pandemic? But, but look at what we can do to get the economy growing and expanding again and creating jobs, Martha, that's ultimately what we want to see happen. And the way to do that, obviously, is to keep taxes low, regulations low have a good energy policy; it isn't to have a lot more government spending on things that, frankly, are totally unrelated to the pandemic.",

Yes, we'd probably scraped, you know, a few 100 billion off of this bill, but you know, it is what it is, and it's about to get voted on. I mean, it's pretty astonishing.",

But it also has a big impact on people across the country when things that they have to buy go up in price when interest rates on their mortgages and their car loans. All those things go up, that squeezes family budgets as well. And I think that what we're talking about here, obviously, is something that has a lot of payoffs to Democrats, special interests, the state and local money, 350 billion, you mentioned it.   I mean, if you look year over year, cumulatively, all the states in the country, one-tenth of one percent, off of the previous year's revenue, and yet we're going to send California $27 billion in this bill, and they've got a surplus in California this year. So, the question is, the taxpayers in places like South Dakota, and North Carolina, and Georgia and Arizona have to spend their hard-earned tax dollars to bail out states like California, New York and places, which really, frankly, as all the evidence we have, are doing pretty well.",

Do you, are you a believer that that's a good thing to do for people, you know, how does that help you in terms of drawing attention to the points that you're making?

This should be the most bipartisan thing we do. It's pandemic relief. When we had the majority last year we did five coronavirus relief bills, all bipartisan, all at the 60 vote threshold normally required in the Senate under regular order.   The Democrats chose to bypass that; they didn't want a single Republican vote on this. They didn't talk to the committees have had no input into this. This was rushed to the floor and what they get now in terms of delays and, and an opportunity for us finally, to talk about the bill to offer amendments that we've been cut out of the process up until now. So, you know, it's up to Republicans to shine a light on what they're doing here, not only in terms of the process, but all the unnecessary un-COVID related spending that's in this bill. 95 percent of the money for education doesn't get spent this year. How can you call that an emergency? It gets spent in 27 and 28? Those, that's not, that's not that's not an emergency, Martha, that's not urgent. That's not what this should be about.",

BOB SAMBHAL, FOUNDER, BOB's STEAK AND CHOP HOUSE: Well, I was surprised, I was I was expecting to go into 100 percent capacity. I was not expecting him to lift the mask mandate. I feel it's a little premature. We've gotten used to it, bringing them, my customers have gotten used to wearing them. I would have waited a little bit longer. I think that what he wanted to do was to put it again in the in the hands of the business owners and the people rather than government restrictions.  I think it was very calculated what he did. I'm a big fan of Governor Abbott, I think he's a good governor. But it was Texas Independence Day, weather's getting nicer more and more people are outdoor dining, more and more people are doing outdoor activities. I think it has a good chance that there won't be any major disruption to the decline in numbers. Because it is so -- what we're going to do is we're going to insist all our employees management myself are going to will still wear masks.

I mean, if you believe in structural racism, and you look at the record of our big city public school systems, in teaching poor black and Latino kids.

Congress is now taking up the latest piece of the second largest government spending stimulus package in history. This part of it is $1.9 trillion on top of the $4 trillion. We have never been in this territory before folks of the previous relief packages. This as new research emerges that shows, you know what states actually did better during the pandemic than originally thought. And Americans saved $1.5 trillion as they hunkered down, didn't go to restaurants and go to bars, all of that and saved a ton of money. That is pent up right now once this economy gets out moving. Still, despite those realities, and a reopening of the economy in a number of places and a declining virus. The President believes politically that passing this bill is crucial, and this is important to his larger agenda."

The White House is still hoping to get that on the President's desk on or before March 14th, which is just 10 days away. So, a very tight timeline. And once that happens, then President Biden is really going to begin focusing on some of his other big ticket items, things like infrastructure and immigration. In fact, President Biden just finished meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers about his infrastructure plan, but a lot of the specifics are on hold until after the COVID relief package gets through, and so is the President's first address to a joint session of Congress. The White House still won't say when that will be. Here's the White House Press Secretary on Wednesday."

So, sort of not focus so much on the dollar figures and what's in it, but just that politically it's really important. He says, we want to demonstrate that to people that the government has your back. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "I think your reporting earlier on covered it. I mean, this is part of a much broader far-left agenda. And I've said this before, but Bernie Sanders wing of the Democrat Party is running the show up here on Capitol Hill. And this is the first step, and obviously a $1.9 trillion bill, which is second to the Cares Act that we passed a year ago, the largest spending bill ever in the history of the country. At a time when we've got, you know, enormous amounts of debt, all this is borrowed money. And we ought to be thinking about how do we target this? How do we do it in a fiscally responsible way? How do we help people who really need help to the pandemic? But, but look at what we can do to get the economy growing and expanding again and creating jobs, Martha, that's ultimately what we want to see happen. And the way to do that, obviously, is to keep taxes low, regulations low have a good energy policy; it isn't to have a lot more government spending on things that, frankly, are totally unrelated to the pandemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you know, I guess one of the questions is, does that matter to the majority of Americans anymore, those kinds of fiscal responsibility points that you just made, and I was reading, you know, list of economists, including Mark Zandi and others, who said, you know, if we could write this bill again, this 1.9 trillion, given what we know now about how things are improving across the country? Yes, we'd probably scraped, you know, a few 100 billion off of this bill, but you know, it is what it is, and it's about to get voted on. I mean, it's pretty astonishing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "It is, and if you look at there's a lot of economic analysis being done out there right now, that suggests that continuing to flood the economy with more and more money, increasing the money supply, we're starting to see inflation tick up that interest rates will follow that has dramatic implications for the federal government and its fiscal picture. But it also has a big impact on people across the country when things that they have to buy go up in price when interest rates on their mortgages and their car loans. All those things go up, that squeezes family budgets as well. And I think that what we're talking about here, obviously, is something that has a lot of payoffs to Democrats, special interests, the state and local money, 350 billion, you mentioned it. I mean, if you look year over year, cumulatively, all the states in the country, one-tenth of one percent, off of the previous year's revenue, and yet we're going to send California $27 billion in this bill, and they've got a surplus in California this year. So, the question is, the taxpayers in places like South Dakota, and North Carolina, and Georgia and Arizona have to spend their hard-earned tax dollars to bail out states like California, New York and places, which really, frankly, as all the evidence we have, are doing pretty well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, the effort. Just, you know, from your side, in terms of the Senate how this proceeds. Ron Johnson wants to read the entire bill, I think its 600 or 700 pages long. It's going to take hours and hours to discuss the amendments and all of that. Do you, are you a believer that that's a good thing to do for people, you know, how does that help you in terms of drawing attention to the points that you're making? And do you think that you'll, there'll be the support for a roll call vote so that every member has to stand up and be counted on this bill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "There will be a roll call vote at the end and every Republican should vote against it. And the reason why is they completely cut us out of the process. This should be the most bipartisan thing we do. It's pandemic relief. When we had the majority last year we did five coronavirus relief bills, all bipartisan, all at the 60 vote threshold normally required in the Senate under regular order. The Democrats chose to bypass that; they didn't want a single Republican vote on this. They didn't talk to the committees have had no input into this. This was rushed to the floor and what they get now in terms of delays and, and an opportunity for us finally, to talk about the bill to offer amendments that we've been cut out of the process up until now. So, you know, it's up to Republicans to shine a light on what they're doing here, not only in terms of the process, but all the unnecessary un-COVID related spending that's in this bill. 95 percent of the money for education doesn't get spent this year. How can you call that an emergency? It gets spent in 27 and 28? Those, that's not, that's not that's not an emergency, Martha, that's not urgent. That's not what this should be about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, education spending, they've already got 67 billion allocated, and they've only spent 4.4 billion of it. It's pretty tough to wrap your head around why you need another 130 billion when you've got 67 billion that's already been allocated, but not even spent yet. So, Senator, we'll be watching this process closely. And we thank you very much for joining us this afternoon. Good to see you."

Major grocery chains, including Kroger and target say they will continue requiring employees and customers to wear face coverings. Governors and states lifting mass requirements say they still want people to follow safety protocols, but they want to take government out of the business of enforcing them. And today, Martha, Alabama governor Kay Ivey announced that she is extending her mask mandate through April 9th, just to give businesses in her state time to develop their own safety protocols.

We've gotten used to it, bringing them, my customers have gotten used to wearing them. I would have waited a little bit longer. I think that what he wanted to do was to put it again in the in the hands of the business owners and the people rather than government restrictions. I think it was very calculated what he did. I'm a big fan of Governor Abbott, I think he's a good governor. But it was Texas Independence Day, weather's getting nicer more and more people are outdoor dining, more and more people are doing outdoor activities. I think it has a good chance that there won't be any major disruption to the decline in numbers. Because it is so -- what we're going to do is we're going to insist all our employees management myself are going to will still wear masks. And instead of the sign on the door that says you must walk in with a mask or face covering. We're going to say, we suggest you walk in with a mask or face covering."

But living with a virus that is that easily spread, and then in one day, we were told that it was 100 percent. So, we were open. And then the mask mandate was being pulled back.

Joining me now for wise words, Wall Street Journal Columnist and Editorial Board Member, Bill McGurn, and Columnist Jason Riley, also a Senior Fellow with the Manhattan Institute. Jason and Bill, great to have you both with me today. Thank you for being here. Jason, I'd like to start with you. You heard in the introduction, the head of the L.A. Teachers Union, who basically said that if you link funding to in person training, to in person schooling, you are propagating structural racism, and she blamed white parents for that. What do you think about that argument?"

And the teachers continuing to get paid without doing their job. And I think more and more people are coming to see what's really going on here, which is that the unions are putting their own interest ahead of the parents and ahead of the children who they claim to be, to care about. And, and I think their position is just continuously untenable and more and more untenable, as this stretches out. And you see the backlash not only in places like New Jersey, but another wealthy suburbs, you know, Brookline, Massachusetts, outside of Boston, we've seen this, the Philadelphia suburbs, we've seen this. And these are not Republicans necessarily; they are not Trump supporters, Martha, these are places that voted, you know, 80 90 percent for Joe Biden."

      "utterance": "But they're also parents that, you know, Carolina about education in some cases rearrange their entire life to make sure that their kids can go to the right schools. They bought homes in certain neighborhoods. They pay exorbitant property taxes, all for the purposes of education. They look around, they see restaurants open. They see gyms open. They see private schools open, colleges. They see public transit workers doing their job and they say to the teachers, why can't our kids go back to school?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And they see other schools that are wide open, and they see very low transmission rates. You know, Bill, I'm very interested in the legal side of this, and I actually want to put up this screen about teen mental health claims. Overdoses up 119%, anxiety up 94%, depression up 84%, these are from FAIR Health. They study the insurance claims that are put forward, in the diagnosis and the symptoms to mark those numbers. But at what point, you know, when you pay your taxes, as Jason says, right? You pay your taxes, you pay the school system, at what point do to the families win? Do they say, you know what, you're taking away our civil right to a public education. We've paid for this education with our tax dollars. We expect to receive it. So, if you're not going to come and do it, then let's get someone else to do it. Let's go outside the union and hire some teachers who are not in the union to carry out the duty that you have committed to do with these tax dollars."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL MCGURN, FOX CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think Jason partly answered that. The problem with public schools, especially in our big cities, is that the schools are not run by the mayors and city councils, and the administrators, it run by the teachers unions, and then run for the benefit of teachers. You know, the numbers you rattle off, remind me there was a report issued last year by the Brightbeam Foundation. And it was called the \"Secret Shame: How America's Most Progressive Cities Betray Their Commitment to Educational Opportunity for All.\" All these kids are suffering. You know, we're never going to even know how many kind of futures were sacrificed because of this, because that, you know, some people couldn't learn remotely and so forth. There's going to be a tremendous human cost. And, you know, the teachers union person who talked about structural racism. I mean, if you believe in structural racism, and you look at the record of our big city public school systems, in teaching poor black and Latino kids. It's a national disgrace and it should be changed. And it seems that the teachers unions, their number one priority is to keep any of these kids who need some help from going to a Catholic school or charter school, where they get a decent education."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, they don't want that. And that has provided an opportunity. I saw the saddest story the other day, community worker was driving through the streets of Detroit searching for kids that have completely dropped off the radar. They don't show up for their Zoom classes. And this man was so, you know, his heart was so in the right place. He's like if I see a bicycle outside, I think maybe they're still there, trying to track down these children who have completely, they call the disappearing children, who had disappeared from the entire school system since it started. And it is absolutely heartbreaking and I commend him for, you know, doing what he can to try to find these children. But, boy, you're right. We're going to we're going to reap the outcomes of this for quite some time. Jason, thank you, Bill. Thank you. Great to see you both today."

That force alone could cost up to $130 million a year. Capitol Police warned of a possible plot to breach the Capitol today, March 4th, until 1933, March 4th, was our country's inaugural day.

GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE GREAT US-CHINA TECH WAR\": Well, that approach has really dominated thinking and administration's liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats since the end of the Cold War. But the problem is, you can't really have a collaborative relationship with a country that has declared a \"people's war\" on us, and that's China. They did that in May of 2019.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",

Because he realizes that you've got -- he's got a problem with his economy, but he's more important got a problem with demography. China right now is four times, more than four times more populous than the United States. By the end of this century, it's probably going to be less populous than the US. That's the most dramatic collapse in demography in history, absent war or disease. And if Beijing doesn't achieve its objectives in the next, let's say, five years, it has no hope of catching up and surpassing us."

Basically, China is our main adversary, and countries like Russia, Iran, North Korea, they are only able to challenge the international system because China gives them strength. So really, this is a China issue. It's not an Iran issue or a Russia issue. It's basically one that's centered in Beijing, because China is extremely hostile to the United States inherently hostile in the nature of that regime."

I do not want it anymore. I do think it's time passed, no longer to have thought a crime. I do hope one day to see across my country (inaudible) books used to read and learn, instead of set ablaze to burn. Our heritage for all to share, little patriots everywhere. Our nation's story rich and vast, our true history taught in class, a special place for all to be a place known for its liberty. You know, those are the kinds of things that Dr. Seuss did. He encouraged people. He made people believe that everybody was equal. And, you know, it's appropriate that we're talking about children's books because as a society, we're acting like children, like a child who's in charge who doesn't like peas. So he says, let's ban peas. Anybody eating peas or growing peas shall be killed. You know, that's childish thinking. That's what we're doing right now and it's absolutely absurd. And I think the rest of the world is having a good belly laugh. And it's time for us to mature to grow up to recognize. You know, America was the beacon of liberty. It was the place where people came so that they could express themselves, so they could believe what they want to believe, so they could have religious freedom. It was a place where we believe that our liberties and freedoms came from God and not from government. And, you know, the socialists believe that everything comes from government. We can't abide it."

It didn't really turn out very well in most cases. I remember when, you know, the discussion was \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" and classics, which we should always be taught in the context of the time in which they were written and published. You know, I was actually heartened to see that the New York Public Library says that they're going to keep all of their Dr. Seuss books in publication and in circulation, I should say, at the library. But the fact that that encourages us, you know, just says something about where we are right now. And I agree with you that other countries must look at this.
