Throughout the hour, we're going to break it all down A to Z. Information I promise you're not going to get anywhere else. It's not as complicated as they are making it elsewhere.  In other words, the Mueller witch hunt should put real fear in the hearts of every law-abiding citizen, every American. It doesn't matter where your politics are. There is no equal justice under the law. There is no equal application under the law and the blatant political bias around every turn.  We are criminalizing political differences in America. A dangerous precedent is being set now and Mueller, he's not only on a mission. He's not a mission for truth and justice. He's on a crusade to destroy, delegitimize, disrupt the Donald Trump presidency.  And also coming up tonight, I'm going to weigh in on the recent developments as they relate to Michael Cohen, Jerome Corsi, Roger Stone.  We'll break down in detail the disgusting two-tier justice system in this country tonight. And also, after widespread pressure, fake news CNN had to fire one of their contributors over an awful bigoted, anti-Semitic rant. We're going to show you how CNN's far left, Trump-obsessed rage has fostered what is a corrosive, abusively biased environment at the \"facts first\" network. It's worse than it's ever even.  All right. We're going to get through it. It's going to take the full hour. Stay with us. Time to start with our breaking news opening monologue.",

They are frenetic.  They're going to the well 70 hours Michael Cohen apparently spent with the special prosecutor. One time Trump attorney pled guilty to a charge of lying to Congress over something called the Moscow project.   Now, Cohen is now claiming that the Trump Organization continued to negotiate the finance by Russia, name lease of Trump deal of a potential building in Russia during the 2016 election. He first said discussions had ended in January of 2016. Now, he's saying they ended in June of 2016. The destroy Trump media, of course, used these anonymous sources, they are saying that Cohen, get this, allegedly told investigators he was negotiating a deal in Moscow to maybe give Vladimir Putin a $15 million penthouse in the proposed building project that Donald Trump wasn't paying for, so that rich Russian oligarchs would want to live there. And just moments ago, John Roberts reported a source close to the president calling it, quote, nuts. It would be a stupid idea. And the president never heard of any such deal.   And, by the way, this deal, guess what, it never, ever, ever happened. The project never got off the ground. No Trump organization investments were ever made and today, the Trump Organization has no buildings in Russia.  You wouldn't know it if you're watching the mainstream media. There's -- by the way, even if it had happened, this is the most fascinating part, there's no crime here. None whatsoever. Donald Trump was a real estate mogul in New York, that's what he did his whole adult life and how he made a living. And he invested in many countries.  By the way, doesn't every politician that gets paid with our money, don't they get paid when they are out campaigning for the next election by us?   In 2017, this potential project was widely reported everywhere by just about every outlet. Fake news CNN, ABC News, so did \"The Hill\", almost every other news network. In other words, we knew this. This is not a story. In any way is it a news story. It's been reported on extensively. However, that doesn't matter to the left. And it certainly didn't matter to Robert Mueller. He is more interested in making the mainstream media bubble and fizz like Alka-Seltzer in water and he is just desperate. All he wants to do every day is mention Russia in some way, indicting all these, you know, former KGB guys, all their intelligence people that he's never bringing to the United States ever, under any circumstances, just so he can mention Russia, fomenting breathless reporting, to give credit to its never ending witch hunt.  And, by the way, Robert Mueller is playing your media with their bias in their hate of Trump just like a fiddle. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "And, by the way, we're going to get to this issue, I call it the Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano syndrome if you will, how prosecutors offered deals. Tell us this, and you get a get out of jail free card, or lower sentence, less sentence. Now, the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, he also weighed in. He said, quote, Michael Cohen is lying. It's no surprise that Cohen lied to Congress. He is a proven liar who's doing everything he can to get out of a long-term prison sentence for serious crimes of bank and tax fraud that had nothing to do with the Trump Organization.  Look, I know Michael Cohen. He has a wonderful family. I can't imagine the pressure that he is under. I'm not going to pile on. He's got a lot of hard things that he is facing, but this is important. If this is Mueller's big witness, it is fair to ask, who are we to believe -- the Michael Cohen then or the Michael Cohen now? That's a fair question.   This is just the latest example of what is Mueller's concerted effort to turn the screws on everyone who was ever associated with President Trump.  Let's look at the list.  Michael Flynn, no Russia collusion, he pled guilty to lying to investigators. They ruined his life, he had to sell his house. And they probably threatened his kid is my guess. George Papadopoulos, he is spending two weeks in jail. Nothing about Russia. Lying to investigators. He now will have a felony on his track record forever. Paul Manafort had a book thrown over him. Oh, let's see, financial crimes dating back to 2007? Bank loan applications, taxes, nothing Russian.  Nothing. What's amazing is he got a cooperation deal that ended likely because, well, he wouldn't lie like Jerome Corsi wouldn't lie.   Meaning he's -- think about this: Paul Manafort tonight is willing to risk dying in prison than lie as the prosecutors would want. Jerome Corsi on the show last night, on my radio show for a full hour this afternoon rejecting another lying investigators plea deal. He might die in prison. He is 72 years old. He could have gotten to get out of jail free card and now is under Mueller's microscope, potentially facing life in prison, dying in prison like Paul Manafort. And as he said last night on my radio show today, he is willing to do that because he can't lie before his God. That's what he said. His faith won't let him.   Roger Stone is also literally feeling the special counsel's wrath.  Now, none of the men I just mentioned to you have pled guilty to or admitted to anything related to Russia collusion. There's no evidence of any Russia collusion. None of them are being tried for any crimes related to collusion. Five hundred and sixty-one days of what? Now, here's the problem and this is where we get to the crux of the matter.  We have to analyze this deeply. What's happening is instead of seeking truth and justice, instead of applying our laws, equally applying our laws to everybody, equal justice under the law, what you are watching is a special counsel that has spun out-of-control, left way beyond his mandate, laying just perjury traps and literally trying to coerce people into what we call testi-lying.  In other words, Mueller is telling people. If you just say what we want.  I mean, Corsi give me full detail in my radio show today. Look, there was -- just tell us. You won't even get probation. You know, if not, you're going to die in jail. That's the choice. And to think he is saying, I'm not going to lie, I won't lie. I believe in God, Jesus. I'm not going to do it.  It's similar prosecutorial treatment that, remember, Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano -- you may not remember the case, I'll remind you. Killed at least, get this, that guy right there killed at least 19 people. He got off on no jail time. Then he just had to literally testify against John Gotti.  And then after that, he was rewarded. Not only did he not go to jail, he was in the witness protection program when he got a nice new house in Arizona. Isn't that nice? Nineteen people. No time in jail.  Meanwhile, if you are not a notorious gangster or a Trump ally, the wheels of justice are turning much differently. Mueller's team collects lying to investigator, guilty pleas like they're going out of style. They can't get the underlying crime or these people to say things that they don't live to be true. Top Democrats, deep state bureaucrats, they lie to get away scot- free. I've got the list. Look at the longtime Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, blatantly lied when they told investigators that they had no knowledge of Hillary's private emails. Really? Because they actually emailed there.  Our friend and reporter here on the Fox News Channel, special report, Catherine Herridge reporting either DOJ official Bruce Ohr or Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson likely lied due to their contradictory testimony. Dirty dossier author Christopher Steele, not only did he lie, he lied and leaked and was fired by the FBI. And then guess what? He was working still with Bruce Ohr, fourth most powerful guy at the Justice Department, and now we have notes that show that he was trying to feed Bruce Ohr whose wife Nellie worked for Fusion GPS information he was trying to feed Robert Mueller. And meanwhile, remember, Steele doesn't even stand by his own dossier when challenged in an interrogatory in Great Britain. James Clapper, let's go to the videotape. He lied under oath about national surveillance programs. So too John Brennan. He also lied under oath about leaking. James Comey lied under oath when he said the report about the Clinton investigation and not been written before she was interviewed lie. Comey's second-in-command, Andrew McCabe, he was actually fired because of his pattern of lying. Where are the federal cases against these liars? Against these people lying to Congress? Instead, what, we are pushing for charges, fired FBI Director Comey actually defended the DOJ's pattern of lying on the view, literally saying, I lied, McCabe lied, but you can still be a good person if you lie.  Well, unless you're a Republican, then they're going to put you in jail.  MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": Your second in command, McCabe, was fired for lying multiple times within the FBI. You defended his character on Twitter. That's OK. Lying is OK internally?",

You want real Russia collusion, we got it with all the evidence that Mueller doesn't have about drum. We've got the fixed email investigation, violation of the Espionage Act, the biggest obstruction of justice case I've ever seen, the dirty dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Why? To lie to voters and convince voters of Russian hookers urinating in Trump's bed in Moscow so that they won't vote for him.   I wonder how many Americans didn't vote for Trump because of that leaked lie, that paid for lie. The FISA fraud abuse, lying to FISA judges, literally a FISA fraud extravaganza. And, of course, omissions that don't even tell the judges that Hillary paid for it. And then we got insurance policies, leaking policies. Is Robert Mueller even going to ever look in that direction? I thought we were looking for the truth, for real Russia collusion. We've got evidence on all of this and it's a slam-dunk case. Why is he not? Because there's one set of rules in this country now for one group of Americans, the swamp creatures, or if you are a liberal Democrat or your name is Clinton. Another set of rules for everyone else. Try this at home. You are subpoenaed, you delete the email subpoenaed, you acid wash your hard drive. You have your devices busted and you have SIM cards taken out. Good luck to you. It's not going to work.  In other words, we don't have equal application of the law, equal justice under the law. This is a two-tier justice system. You as an American, every American tonight, it should scare the hell out of you. If the president of the United States and those who surround him are subject to what is now clearly a double standard political persecution, nobody in this country is safe. Nobody. This is a United States of America. We're not a banana republic. At least we're not supposed to be. This is not how our constitutional republic and system of justice is supposed to work.  We can do better, we better do better. We better demand better. We'll have more on this throughout the show.

Everything the media people like Barack Obama, everything they were telling you completely false. That's the subject of tonight's mini monologue. Still camped out in Tijuana, Mexico, following clashes with U.S. border patrol officers Sunday. Just today, DHS release more information on what are extremely dangerous conditions for many people where higher women who were assaulted during this journey. Griff Jenkins reporting that some migrants are actually self-deporting as they face diminishing prospects of entering the U.S. legally. And he is also uncovering that despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the vast majority in the caravan happened to be men. And health officials they are telling that one-third of the people traveling in the caravan are being treated for various health issues including lice, skin infections, three confirmed cases of tuberculosis, four confirmed cases of chicken pox, and more. And by the way, I think we should on a humanitarian basis help. Let me be clear, I said many times, I want many people in the caravan. I know that they are searching for a better life. But storming the border, attacking border patrol rocks, bottles, and other projectiles, that's not seeking asylum. When do you, so-called asylum-seekers act like that? We're also learning tonight none of the migrants involved in the clashes will face any the prosecution despite the president's bow that lawlessness on the border will not be tolerated. Meanwhile, the threat of more violence is even prompting the Department of Justice now to send DEA agents and U.S. marshals service personnel to Southern California. And just last night, we learned that an admitted MS-13 gang member was recently arrested at the border crossing east of Tijuana. And he's been identified as a 29-year-old Honduran. Telling authorities, he was part of the caravan. Despite mounting evidence, the media is continuing to downplay that real threat all while ignoring the failures of the Obama administration and what they did. They shot pepper spray and tear gas at people that try to come into the country illegally. Nobody reported on it then. Joining us now, NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino, and Fox News contributor our friend, Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, you know, you got me so mad one night because I said to you, I told you this was coming.

Throughout the hour, we're going to break it all down A to Z. Information I promise you're not going to get anywhere else. It's not as complicated as they are making it elsewhere. In other words, the Mueller witch hunt should put real fear in the hearts of every law-abiding citizen, every American. It doesn't matter where your politics are. There is no equal justice under the law. There is no equal application under the law and the blatant political bias around every turn. We are criminalizing political differences in America. A dangerous precedent is being set now and Mueller, he's not only on a mission. He's not a mission for truth and justice. He's on a crusade to destroy, delegitimize, disrupt the Donald Trump presidency. And also coming up tonight, I'm going to weigh in on the recent developments as they relate to Michael Cohen, Jerome Corsi, Roger Stone.  We'll break down in detail the disgusting two-tier justice system in this country tonight. And also, after widespread pressure, fake news CNN had to fire one of their contributors over an awful bigoted, anti-Semitic rant. We're going to show you how CNN's far left, Trump-obsessed rage has fostered what is a corrosive, abusively biased environment at the \"facts first\" network. It's worse than it's ever even. All right. We're going to get through it. It's going to take the full hour. Stay with us. Time to start with our breaking news opening monologue."

They are frenetic.  They're going to the well 70 hours Michael Cohen apparently spent with the special prosecutor. One time Trump attorney pled guilty to a charge of lying to Congress over something called the Moscow project. Now, Cohen is now claiming that the Trump Organization continued to negotiate the finance by Russia, name lease of Trump deal of a potential building in Russia during the 2016 election. He first said discussions had ended in January of 2016. Now, he's saying they ended in June of 2016. The destroy Trump media, of course, used these anonymous sources, they are saying that Cohen, get this, allegedly told investigators he was negotiating a deal in Moscow to maybe give Vladimir Putin a $15 million penthouse in the proposed building project that Donald Trump wasn't paying for, so that rich Russian oligarchs would want to live there. And just moments ago, John Roberts reported a source close to the president calling it, quote, nuts. It would be a stupid idea. And the president never heard of any such deal. And, by the way, this deal, guess what, it never, ever, ever happened. The project never got off the ground. No Trump organization investments were ever made and today, the Trump Organization has no buildings in Russia.  You wouldn't know it if you're watching the mainstream media. There's -- by the way, even if it had happened, this is the most fascinating part, there's no crime here. None whatsoever. Donald Trump was a real estate mogul in New York, that's what he did his whole adult life and how he made a living. And he invested in many countries. By the way, doesn't every politician that gets paid with our money, don't they get paid when they are out campaigning for the next election by us? In 2017, this potential project was widely reported everywhere by just about every outlet. Fake news CNN, ABC News, so did \"The Hill\", almost every other news network. In other words, we knew this. This is not a story. In any way is it a news story. It's been reported on extensively. However, that doesn't matter to the left. And it certainly didn't matter to Robert Mueller. He is more interested in making the mainstream media bubble and fizz like Alka-Seltzer in water and he is just desperate. All he wants to do every day is mention Russia in some way, indicting all these, you know, former KGB guys, all their intelligence people that he's never bringing to the United States ever, under any circumstances, just so he can mention Russia, fomenting breathless reporting, to give credit to its never ending witch hunt. And, by the way, Robert Mueller is playing your media with their bias in their hate of Trump just like a fiddle. Watch this."

Tell us this, and you get a get out of jail free card, or lower sentence, less sentence. Now, the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, he also weighed in. He said, quote, Michael Cohen is lying. It's no surprise that Cohen lied to Congress. He is a proven liar who's doing everything he can to get out of a long-term prison sentence for serious crimes of bank and tax fraud that had nothing to do with the Trump Organization. Look, I know Michael Cohen. He has a wonderful family. I can't imagine the pressure that he is under. I'm not going to pile on. He's got a lot of hard things that he is facing, but this is important. If this is Mueller's big witness, it is fair to ask, who are we to believe -- the Michael Cohen then or the Michael Cohen now? That's a fair question. This is just the latest example of what is Mueller's concerted effort to turn the screws on everyone who was ever associated with President Trump.  Let's look at the list. Michael Flynn, no Russia collusion, he pled guilty to lying to investigators. They ruined his life, he had to sell his house. And they probably threatened his kid is my guess. George Papadopoulos, he is spending two weeks in jail. Nothing about Russia. Lying to investigators. He now will have a felony on his track record forever. Paul Manafort had a book thrown over him. Oh, let's see, financial crimes dating back to 2007? Bank loan applications, taxes, nothing Russian.  Nothing. What's amazing is he got a cooperation deal that ended likely because, well, he wouldn't lie like Jerome Corsi wouldn't lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Meaning he's -- think about this",
      "utterance": "Paul Manafort tonight is willing to risk dying in prison than lie as the prosecutors would want. Jerome Corsi on the show last night, on my radio show for a full hour this afternoon rejecting another lying investigators plea deal. He might die in prison. He is 72 years old. He could have gotten to get out of jail free card and now is under Mueller's microscope, potentially facing life in prison, dying in prison like Paul Manafort. And as he said last night on my radio show today, he is willing to do that because he can't lie before his God. That's what he said. His faith won't let him. Roger Stone is also literally feeling the special counsel's wrath. Now, none of the men I just mentioned to you have pled guilty to or admitted to anything related to Russia collusion. There's no evidence of any Russia collusion. None of them are being tried for any crimes related to collusion. Five hundred and sixty-one days of what? Now, here's the problem and this is where we get to the crux of the matter.  We have to analyze this deeply. What's happening is instead of seeking truth and justice, instead of applying our laws, equally applying our laws to everybody, equal justice under the law, what you are watching is a special counsel that has spun out-of-control, left way beyond his mandate, laying just perjury traps and literally trying to coerce people into what we call testi-lying. In other words, Mueller is telling people. If you just say what we want.  I mean, Corsi give me full detail in my radio show today. Look, there was -- just tell us. You won't even get probation. You know, if not, you're going to die in jail. That's the choice. And to think he is saying, I'm not going to lie, I won't lie. I believe in God, Jesus. I'm not going to do it. It's similar prosecutorial treatment that, remember, Sammy \"The Bull\" Gravano -- you may not remember the case, I'll remind you. Killed at least, get this, that guy right there killed at least 19 people. He got off on no jail time. Then he just had to literally testify against John Gotti. And then after that, he was rewarded. Not only did he not go to jail, he was in the witness protection program when he got a nice new house in Arizona. Isn't that nice? Nineteen people. No time in jail. Meanwhile, if you are not a notorious gangster or a Trump ally, the wheels of justice are turning much differently. Mueller's team collects lying to investigator, guilty pleas like they're going out of style. They can't get the underlying crime or these people to say things that they don't live to be true. Top Democrats, deep state bureaucrats, they lie to get away scot- free. I've got the list. Look at the longtime Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, blatantly lied when they told investigators that they had no knowledge of Hillary's private emails. Really? Because they actually emailed there. Our friend and reporter here on the Fox News Channel, special report, Catherine Herridge reporting either DOJ official Bruce Ohr or Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson likely lied due to their contradictory testimony. Dirty dossier author Christopher Steele, not only did he lie, he lied and leaked and was fired by the FBI. And then guess what? He was working still with Bruce Ohr, fourth most powerful guy at the Justice Department, and now we have notes that show that he was trying to feed Bruce Ohr whose wife Nellie worked for Fusion GPS information he was trying to feed Robert Mueller. And meanwhile, remember, Steele doesn't even stand by his own dossier when challenged in an interrogatory in Great Britain. James Clapper, let's go to the videotape. He lied under oath about national surveillance programs. So too John Brennan. He also lied under oath about leaking. James Comey lied under oath when he said the report about the Clinton investigation and not been written before she was interviewed lie. Comey's second-in-command, Andrew McCabe, he was actually fired because of his pattern of lying. Where are the federal cases against these liars? Against these people lying to Congress? Instead, what, we are pushing for charges, fired FBI Director Comey actually defended the DOJ's pattern of lying on the view, literally saying, I lied, McCabe lied, but you can still be a good person if you lie. Well, unless you're a Republican, then they're going to put you in jail. MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": Your second in command, McCabe, was fired for lying multiple times within the FBI. You defended his character on Twitter. That's OK. Lying is OK internally?"

      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "No, it's definitely not. In fact, the McCabe case illustrates what an organization that is committed to the truth looks like. We investigated to hold -- I ordered that investigation. We investigated and hold people accountable. Good people lie. I laid out on the book, I think I'm a good person, where I have lied. I still believe Andrew McCabe is a good person. But the inspector general found that he lied and there are severe consequences in the Justice Department for lying as they should be throughout the government."

      "utterance": "Good people, they live. The only problem is, they're not giving Mueller wants, oh, then you're going to be charged with perjury. It's what I've been telling you. You want real Russia collusion, we got it with all the evidence that Mueller doesn't have about drum. We've got the fixed email investigation, violation of the Espionage Act, the biggest obstruction of justice case I've ever seen, the dirty dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Why? To lie to voters and convince voters of Russian hookers urinating in Trump's bed in Moscow so that they won't vote for him. I wonder how many Americans didn't vote for Trump because of that leaked lie, that paid for lie. The FISA fraud abuse, lying to FISA judges, literally a FISA fraud extravaganza. And, of course, omissions that don't even tell the judges that Hillary paid for it. And then we got insurance policies, leaking policies. Is Robert Mueller even going to ever look in that direction? I thought we were looking for the truth, for real Russia collusion. We've got evidence on all of this and it's a slam-dunk case. Why is he not? Because there's one set of rules in this country now for one group of Americans, the swamp creatures, or if you are a liberal Democrat or your name is Clinton. Another set of rules for everyone else. Try this at home. You are subpoenaed, you delete the email subpoenaed, you acid wash your hard drive. You have your devices busted and you have SIM cards taken out. Good luck to you. It's not going to work. In other words, we don't have equal application of the law, equal justice under the law. This is a two-tier justice system. You as an American, every American tonight, it should scare the hell out of you. If the president of the United States and those who surround him are subject to what is now clearly a double standard political persecution, nobody in this country is safe. Nobody. This is a United States of America. We're not a banana republic. At least we're not supposed to be. This is not how our constitutional republic and system of justice is supposed to work. We can do better, we better do better. We better demand better. We'll have more on this throughout the show. But, first, we turn to a network whose motto is -- well, about as fake as their coverage, the so-called \"facts first\" network, CNN, forced to fire a longtime contributor but only after widespread outcry over his anti-Semitic rant during a speech at the U.N.

But they didn't have to cooperate with the governments. They didn't have to answer questions from Congress. They didn't have to provide information to the Department of Justice.

Construction project that was abandoned in Russia, that has nothing to do with Trump and Russian collusion. If there was evidence of collusion then Michael Cohen would've been charged. Instead, Cohen and four others have been charged with these processed crimes which as the professor points out are actually a creation of the special counsel's presence and have nothing to do with Trump or Trump, Russian collusion.

I've used the term devastating just like the story report was devastating and Iran-Contra was devastating. But it's devastating only if it is unrebutted which is why it is absolutely essential for the president's team to demand that the Justice Department not allow the release of the Mueller report until they've had a chance to review it and rebut it.

And you also talked about this being political now with Mueller. I want to ask through his prism. Isn't it true based on the Pentagon papers, the Supreme Court decision, six to three. That the New York Times and Washington Post, they can publish stolen material as long as they didn't steal it."

Maybe it could have been, you know, we know Hillary's computer is in the bathroom closet were hacked by at least six foreign intelligence services if not more. So my question to you is, based on that, that would mean that these e-mails be it WikiLeaks or the New York Times that published to WikiLeaks which is ironic. If they didn't hack and it was given to them from sources doesn't that mean that what they printed is legal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. The president has the same authority and the president's campaign has the same authority as the New York Times and Washington Post. They are allowed to print material that they know was stolen as long as they didn't tell the people to steal it or give them directions how to hack. Nobody alleges that of the president's campaign. And therefore, they have completely the right to do it. The problem is Mueller is throwing away from his mandate to find crime. It is now looking for political sin. Building buildings in Moscow, using stolen material from Assange. These are not crimes. He has no authority to be a roving commissioner to find political sins. So far, I don't see any evidence of crimes except for ones he helped to facilitate by getting people to lie in front of his own investigators."

The fact is that Mueller is presenting to these witnesses a narrative of Trump Russia collusion. He is demanding under a threat they support it.

Everything the media people like Barack Obama, everything they were telling you completely false. That's the subject of tonight's mini monologue. Still camped out in Tijuana, Mexico, following clashes with U.S. border patrol officers Sunday. Just today, DHS release more information on what are extremely dangerous conditions for many people where higher women who were assaulted during this journey. Griff Jenkins reporting that some migrants are actually self-deporting as they face diminishing prospects of entering the U.S. legally. And he is also uncovering that despite what the mainstream media has been telling you, the vast majority in the caravan happened to be men. And health officials they are telling that one-third of the people traveling in the caravan are being treated for various health issues including lice, skin infections, three confirmed cases of tuberculosis, four confirmed cases of chicken pox, and more. And by the way, I think we should on a humanitarian basis help. Let me be clear, I said many times, I want many people in the caravan. I know that they are searching for a better life. But storming the border, attacking border patrol rocks, bottles, and other projectiles, that's not seeking asylum. When do you, so-called asylum-seekers act like that? We're also learning tonight none of the migrants involved in the clashes will face any the prosecution despite the president's bow that lawlessness on the border will not be tolerated. Meanwhile, the threat of more violence is even prompting the Department of Justice now to send DEA agents and U.S. marshals service personnel to Southern California. And just last night, we learned that an admitted MS-13 gang member was recently arrested at the border crossing east of Tijuana. And he's been identified as a 29-year-old Honduran. Telling authorities, he was part of the caravan. Despite mounting evidence, the media is continuing to downplay that real threat all while ignoring the failures of the Obama administration and what they did. They shot pepper spray and tear gas at people that try to come into the country illegally. Nobody reported on it then. Joining us now, NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino, and Fox News contributor our friend, Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, you know, you got me so mad one night because I said to you, I told you this was coming. What do you want to do, Sean? You want to shoot? No. I don't. I have acknowledged to you how many times that I probably 99 percent want a better life and I sympathize. I really do. My heart goes out to them. I want humanitarian health care. We have -- we can help them with TB and check them. We need to do it. But the problem is, loss, sovereignty, borders. That's what matters and the identified criminals that have infiltrated the caravan."

CNN has somewhere to around 40 to 50 contributors underneath their umbrella. So, firing Marc Lamont Hill isn't that hard of a thing to do because you have three, four dozen other people you can just plug in there. The other bigger names that you show during that montage, people that are on the air more of people that are anchors on that network or host shows. There are a lot harder to fire in this situation.

      "utterance": "There is no -- they say they are reporters. I'm a talk show host. I do some objective reporting, investigative reporting. I do a lot of opinion. I'm the whole newspaper. But they say they're news. They're dishonest."

      "utterance": "Then that's the thing, right. I mean, if we are talking about say, a Don Lemon, for example, he is called an anchor on the network. He is somebody who gives opinions. It gets confusing after a while. Same thing with Anderson Cooper or Chris Cuomo. They are anchors; therefore, they should be on there asking questions and gathering information. Or Jim Acosta at White House briefings asking questions and gathering information. Instead, all these people share their innermost feelings on certain topics. Their emotions. They debate in certain situations and that's not what the job is. And I think that's where mistrust comes to within people watching at home and watching the media. They don't know who the anchors are from the opinion people from the pundits anymore."

      "utterance": "-- when they hear a side being given, then they don't know what to conclude from that because it sounds like you're trying to draw the viewer to a conclusion instead of letting them draw their own conclusion. Ad I think that's a big problem in our industry right now. No question."

They say they do one thing. They don't. Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh have been phenomenal this week on radio. Here is part of Rush coming up next."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "utterance": "We have been lied to our ourselves. We have been misled, we have been misdirected by a willing accomplice drive by media working with Robert Mueller and his staff of anti-Trump lawyers and the entire Democratic Party combined with the Washington establishment to create in the minds of the American people a story that didn't happen, couldn't happen, nobody can ever prove it happened. Where is the tampering of votes? Where is the meetings? Where is the strategy? Where is the evidence that Trump got together with Russians to sabotage the Hillary campaign, which is what everybody has been led to believe happened here? Robert Mueller has nothing because there is nothing on what everybody in this country has been misled to believe for the past two years."

It's on hannity.com, 3:00 to 6:00 every afternoon. And let not your heart be troubled. The news continues.
