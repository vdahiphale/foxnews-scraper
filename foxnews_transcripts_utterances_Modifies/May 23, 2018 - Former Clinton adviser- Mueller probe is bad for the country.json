Everyone involved in this plot to help Hillary Clinton and destroy President Trump are now being exposed. Lock up, get ready, it is going to be huge.  The president's now blasting what he is calling the criminal deep state and taking on James Comey, James Clapper, who are now trying to cover their tracks in a full panic tonight. Also, Judicial Watch is learning the FBI will order anti-Trump FBI lovebirds Strzok and Page to preserve bureau records and their personal accounts and personal devices. I hope they didn't acid-wash them.  And Senator Chuck Grassley saying one of these text messages actually is suggesting that the, quote, Obama White House is running this, running, what? Referring to an unspecified investigation. Plus, the standoff between GOP chairman Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy and the DOJ over classified documents is now coming to a big head. We're going to tell you what to expect at tomorrow's meeting and also, Rod Rosenstein created an unmitigated deep state disaster by appointing Robert Mueller. We have a law professor is now calling what Rosenstein did unconstitutional.  And brand-new tonight, the American Center for Law and Justice, they are reporting that 30,000 emails exist between the Clinton State Department and the Clinton Foundation proving that there was collusion. Plus, former Clinton pollster chief strategist, this is a game changer, Mark Penn is blasting the entire Mueller investigation. He joins us live tonight.  But, first, a very important breaking news opening monologue.",

We've been saying that. Didn't we call this the year of the boomerang? It's exactly what this is. You have a criminal deep state and it's all coming out at breakneck speed.

Comey fired off a pair of tweets this morning. 'Facts matter, the FBI's use of confidential human sources the actual term we calm spies is tightly regulated and essential to protecting the country. Attacks on the FBI and lying about its work will do lasting damage to the country, how will Republicans explain this to their grandchildren?' Well, here's a better idea, Jim. How will you explain what you did to your grandchildren? And you have to love how Comey is using FBI official jargon, confidential human sources to try and spin this. Did you have a spy in the Clinton campaign? Did you have a spy in that campaign?  He continues: 'dangerous time when our country is led by those who will lie about anything, backed by those who will believe anything based on information from media sources that will say anything. Americans must break out of that bubble and seek truth.'  Speaking of lying, that's exactly what Comey did under oath in front of Congress, when he falsely claimed that he didn't decide to exonerate Hillary Clinton before interviewing her and 17 other key witnesses. They were writing it months before. And you know why? Because Comey is corrupt. Thank god the president fired him, and he can't keep his big mouth shut. We advise he has the right to remain silent.  And the president is right to fire back at the disgraced former FBI director. Let's take a look at what he said.",

      "sentences": "This is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in this country's history. It shows you just how pretentious, how egotistical people like Clapper and Comey really are.   They don't see that the crossfire hurricane -- well, it's now coming their way. The wind has shifted the direction. And like we have been warning they both have the right to remain silent apparently not listening to me. What Comey and Clappy -- Clapper have done here is orchestrate a massive abuse of power, the biggest in American political history. Look at investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson out with another great article: 'Eight signs pointing to a counterintelligence operation that was deployed against Trump's campaign.' Here they are: code name the FBI had one, Crossfire Hurricane, from Jumping Jack Flash in the Stones, which is the operation where they spied on the Trump campaign. Wiretap fever, Sharyl Attkisson is pointing out how seventh Trump associates were caught up in this surveillance web.   You also have the massive abuse of power, FISA abuse, lying to FISA judges on four occasions, spying on Carter Page, using a Clinton bought and paid for dossier, not telling of course the judges in that case never verifying, never corroborating. National security letters, the FBI bypassing all judicial approval to obtain phone records by using these national security letters. In other words, the power of our intelligence community.  We saw the unmasking, a dramatic 350 percent increase from key Obama officials, wow, magically in the 2016 election year, changing the rules remember in December of 2016, Clapper making it easier to share intelligence across all these government agencies that helps them cover media strategy. Clapper, Brennan, both regulars in the liberal media, Clapper reportedly leaking details about this phony bought and paid for Russian dossier to fake news CNN where he now works and is paid, leaking anonymous sources. They have been running to friendly outlets to selectively put out information, all designed to propagandize and lie to the American people and damage President Trump. And friends, informants, snoops, the FBI had this informant, maybe others, spying on the Trump campaign. Comey had his friend leaking to \"The New York Times\" to get a special counsel, which by the way that probably was illegal. And the bureau working with former British spy in other words, oh, a foreign operative Christopher Steele, he put together this Clinton bought and paid for dossier.  The evidence of wrongdoing is overwhelming. It is incontrovertible, not to mention as we told you last night and Sara Carter further explained, the FBI's timeline is now collapsing and the investigation is not adding up. Former Obama A.G. Loretta Lynch telling Congress at the FBI, the DOJ officials were discussing Trump campaign associate Carter Page in spring of last year, maybe that would have been a good time to go say, Mr. Candidate, Mr. Trump, I want you to watch there might be some people that we have an eye on. Remember, Trump said the most exculpatory thing he said to Comey was, is anyone around my campaign, I want you to -- you know, I want you to do your job.  And we've been told the investigation officially started in July with George Papadopoulos. So, this timeline is way off. It's going to the spring of 2016, which is why Congress needs to now see all the documents. Attorney General Sessions, I hope you're watching tonight.  Also, Judicial Watch learning that the FBI will order Trump-hating FBI lovebirds Strzok and Page to preserve agency records on their personal accounts and on their personal devices, if they haven't already acid washed them.  And according to Judicial Watch, earlier this week, a judge ordered the FBI to start processing 13,000 pages of previously undisclosed emails between Strzok and Page. We can only imagine what are in those text messages and emails, seeing how they trashed Trump constantly in their text messages, and struck at the center of all of this. And then you have Senator Grassley, he's raising a red flag in a very disturbing message from Strzok and Page that actually suggests the White House of Obama is running this, meaning the Obama administration. It's unclear what investigation specifically they're referring to, which is why everything needs to be unredacted, but they did talk an awful lot about Trump.  And another top story tonight is absolutely stunning. Carrie Pinkett, she's at \"The Daily Caller\" reporting several FBI agents want to be subpoenaed by Congress so they can finally expose all the misconduct and corruption under Comey, and, of course, Andrew McCabe. These FBI agents, they're also saying that they want to see McCain prosecuted since he lied on the old three times, and the inspector general, one that what General Flynn was accused of? Oh, and by the way, we know that nobody in the FBI thought he lied. This is why we always say, it's the upper echelon here at the FBI, in the intelligence community, the DOJ, who are the deep state actors. Not rank-and-file, they're helping us get to the truth. And if it wasn't for these people the FBI, we wouldn't know the truth in the end. They are serving our country with honor and dignity and integrity and respect. They are ashamed of what their former bosses did, and furious about what has happened. That's why it is so important for all of us to get the truth, release the documents. Also tonight, it's put up or shut up time for Rod Rosenstein, the king slow-walking, stonewalling and obstruction. Republican Committee Chair Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy, they're set to be tomorrow with top FBI, DOJ intelligence officials about the documents they have been requesting forever to see.  And I got to tell you, given Rosenstein's track record, there's no way he's going to hand everything over. It's only going to be a briefing and here's why -- Rod Rosenstein, he wants to be able to control the flow of information, just like he's been doing from the get-go, begging Paul Ryan. Oh, don't release the information about FISA abuse.  Remember, Sara Carter reporting information that Congress is trying to see will hold the keys to all of this spying on the Trump campaign. Rod Rosenstein has more problems than just stonewalling tonight. Look at what law professor Steve Calabresi is now arguing, that Rod Rosenstein's appointment of Robert Mueller is in fact unconstitutional, as the great one Mark Levin said last night. He cites the majority opinion in Morrissey versus Olson. The basic problem being that Mueller is more powerful than all 96 U.S. attorneys. Mueller was also never nominated, never confirmed by the U.S. Senate. And because Robert Mueller's appointment is unconstitutional and that renders everything that he has done since May 17, 2017 null and void. And that's why we heard just a couple of Fridays ago, Judge T.S. Ellis III demanding to see Rod Rosenstein's scope memo that gave Mueller the ability supposedly to carry out this witch hunt. Judge Ellis just eviscerated Mueller's team and his pit bull Andrew Weissmann for going after Paul Manafort on a 2005 tax fraud allegation. That has nothing to do with Russia.  And he called out Mueller for putting the screws, the judge's words, to Manafort. Why? To get him to sing. Remember, singers can also compose and flip on Trump so they can prosecute or impeach him. And as far as Rod Rosenstein goes, Steve Bannon says Rosenstein could in fact be fired and very soon. We'll have to wait and see what that's all about. Also tonight, take a look at this headline from the American Center for Law and Justice. 'It was a favor factory, deep state forced to turn over thousands of Clinton-era State Department emails to/about the Clinton Foundation debunking supposed firewall.' The ACLJ reporting that the State Department will be turning over nearly 30,000 emails between Hillary Clinton's State Department and her family foundation. This is why I keep saying, I know it takes more time than you want. We're unpeeling layers of an onion, and that means they were in constant communication.   And as the AP discovered in 2016, more than half of these people who met with the Clintons while she was serving as secretary of state ended up either personally or through an organization giving money and funneling it back to the Clinton Foundation. And another major development tonight: clock is ticking for the DOJ and the FBI to hand over documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley about this highly suspicious case of Michael Flynn, a man who served this country for over 30 years. Grassley wants to see the documents related to Flynn's FBI interview as James Comey told Congress the FBI agents had talked to Flynn. They didn't think he lied. So, why did Robert Mueller charge General Flynn with lying in the first place? And also tonight, President Trump revealing new details about his potential June 12th summit with little rocket man. \"Fox & Friends\" co-host, our own Brian Kilmeade, spoke with the president earlier today out on Long Island after his roundtable on MS-13 gang violence.

You're right that on the spygate issue, as the president dubbed it today, the relentless pressure from President Trump is succeeding in at least one way tonight. He is turning the tables on former Obama officials like James Clapper, James Comey. Today, Comey -- Clapper rather being forced into playing defense on CNN and denying that he ever committed crimes. New, tonight, Clapper is telling PBS the intent was not to spy on the Trump camp but to figure out what the Russians were doing. That's a mile apart from March 2017 when Clapper completely denied there was surveillance of the Trump campaign. All this leading the president today to call Clapper a lying machine. Today, he added it was a good thing for the country that he fired James Comey because of what the president called the former FBI chief's tremendous lies about surveillance and other matters. Notice that Comey today shifted his own story as well. Look at this tweet. He says facts matter. The FBI's use of confidential human sources, the actual term, is tightly regulated and essential. So, he's saying it happened but it's regulated and essential to protecting the country. Attacks on the FBI and lying about its work will do lasting damage to our country. How will Republicans explain this to their grandchildren?  Well, Democrats today tried to stop Republican Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy from meeting tomorrow to review this classified intelligence about surveillance with the FBI Director Christopher Wray and other officials. Chuck Schumer insisting Democrats be added because he thinks the GOP lawmakers are doing the bidding of the president. But White House officials tonight shut that talk down by saying Democrats will get a second briefing after Memorial Day. While the president today told reporters he wants the truth.",

What was behind the warrant? What kind of techniques do these prosecutors used where they're raiding people and shaming them and threatening relatives. This doesn't seem like an American democracy. It seems like a star chamber of series of events. And now this thing is opening up after a year and testimony by every one of these former intelligence chiefs, they never said that they were using this kind of intelligence.

The president's now blasting what he is calling the criminal deep state and taking on James Comey, James Clapper, who are now trying to cover their tracks in a full panic tonight. Also, Judicial Watch is learning the FBI will order anti-Trump FBI lovebirds Strzok and Page to preserve bureau records and their personal accounts and personal devices. I hope they didn't acid-wash them. And Senator Chuck Grassley saying one of these text messages actually is suggesting that the, quote, Obama White House is running this, running, what? Referring to an unspecified investigation. Plus, the standoff between GOP chairman Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy and the DOJ over classified documents is now coming to a big head. We're going to tell you what to expect at tomorrow's meeting and also, Rod Rosenstein created an unmitigated deep state disaster by appointing Robert Mueller. We have a law professor is now calling what Rosenstein did unconstitutional. And brand-new tonight, the American Center for Law and Justice, they are reporting that 30,000 emails exist between the Clinton State Department and the Clinton Foundation proving that there was collusion. Plus, former Clinton pollster chief strategist, this is a game changer, Mark Penn is blasting the entire Mueller investigation. He joins us live tonight.

We've been saying that. Didn't we call this the year of the boomerang? It's exactly what this is. You have a criminal deep state and it's all coming out at breakneck speed.

He's running from liberal media outlet to liberal media outlet, promoting his new book just like James Comey did and trying to spin what is a false narrative. Take a look what he said with the ladies on \"The View\"."

      "speaker": "Look at investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson out with another great article",
      "utterance": "'Eight signs pointing to a counterintelligence operation that was deployed against Trump's campaign.' Here they are: code name the FBI had one, Crossfire Hurricane, from Jumping Jack Flash in the Stones, which is the operation where they spied on the Trump campaign. Wiretap fever, Sharyl Attkisson is pointing out how seventh Trump associates were caught up in this surveillance web. You also have the massive abuse of power, FISA abuse, lying to FISA judges on four occasions, spying on Carter Page, using a Clinton bought and paid for dossier, not telling of course the judges in that case never verifying, never corroborating. National security letters, the FBI bypassing all judicial approval to obtain phone records by using these national security letters. In other words, the power of our intelligence community. We saw the unmasking, a dramatic 350 percent increase from key Obama officials, wow, magically in the 2016 election year, changing the rules remember in December of 2016, Clapper making it easier to share intelligence across all these government agencies that helps them cover media strategy. Clapper, Brennan, both regulars in the liberal media, Clapper reportedly leaking details about this phony bought and paid for Russian dossier to fake news CNN where he now works and is paid, leaking anonymous sources. They have been running to friendly outlets to selectively put out information, all designed to propagandize and lie to the American people and damage President Trump. And friends, informants, snoops, the FBI had this informant, maybe others, spying on the Trump campaign. Comey had his friend leaking to \"The New York Times\" to get a special counsel, which by the way that probably was illegal. And the bureau working with former British spy in other words, oh, a foreign operative Christopher Steele, he put together this Clinton bought and paid for dossier. The evidence of wrongdoing is overwhelming. It is incontrovertible, not to mention as we told you last night and Sara Carter further explained, the FBI's timeline is now collapsing and the investigation is not adding up. Former Obama A.G. Loretta Lynch telling Congress at the FBI, the DOJ officials were discussing Trump campaign associate Carter Page in spring of last year, maybe that would have been a good time to go say, Mr. Candidate, Mr. Trump, I want you to watch there might be some people that we have an eye on. Remember, Trump said the most exculpatory thing he said to Comey was, is anyone around my campaign, I want you to -- you know, I want you to do your job. And we've been told the investigation officially started in July with George Papadopoulos. So, this timeline is way off. It's going to the spring of 2016, which is why Congress needs to now see all the documents. Attorney General Sessions, I hope you're watching tonight. Also, Judicial Watch learning that the FBI will order Trump-hating FBI lovebirds Strzok and Page to preserve agency records on their personal accounts and on their personal devices, if they haven't already acid washed them. And according to Judicial Watch, earlier this week, a judge ordered the FBI to start processing 13,000 pages of previously undisclosed emails between Strzok and Page. We can only imagine what are in those text messages and emails, seeing how they trashed Trump constantly in their text messages, and struck at the center of all of this. And then you have Senator Grassley, he's raising a red flag in a very disturbing message from Strzok and Page that actually suggests the White House of Obama is running this, meaning the Obama administration. It's unclear what investigation specifically they're referring to, which is why everything needs to be unredacted, but they did talk an awful lot about Trump. And another top story tonight is absolutely stunning. Carrie Pinkett, she's at \"The Daily Caller\" reporting several FBI agents want to be subpoenaed by Congress so they can finally expose all the misconduct and corruption under Comey, and, of course, Andrew McCabe. These FBI agents, they're also saying that they want to see McCain prosecuted since he lied on the old three times, and the inspector general, one that what General Flynn was accused of? Oh, and by the way, we know that nobody in the FBI thought he lied. This is why we always say, it's the upper echelon here at the FBI, in the intelligence community, the DOJ, who are the deep state actors. Not rank-and-file, they're helping us get to the truth. And if it wasn't for these people the FBI, we wouldn't know the truth in the end. They are serving our country with honor and dignity and integrity and respect. They are ashamed of what their former bosses did, and furious about what has happened. That's why it is so important for all of us to get the truth, release the documents. Also tonight, it's put up or shut up time for Rod Rosenstein, the king slow-walking, stonewalling and obstruction. Republican Committee Chair Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy, they're set to be tomorrow with top FBI, DOJ intelligence officials about the documents they have been requesting forever to see. And I got to tell you, given Rosenstein's track record, there's no way he's going to hand everything over. It's only going to be a briefing and here's why -- Rod Rosenstein, he wants to be able to control the flow of information, just like he's been doing from the get-go, begging Paul Ryan. Oh, don't release the information about FISA abuse. Remember, Sara Carter reporting information that Congress is trying to see will hold the keys to all of this spying on the Trump campaign. Rod Rosenstein has more problems than just stonewalling tonight. Look at what law professor Steve Calabresi is now arguing, that Rod Rosenstein's appointment of Robert Mueller is in fact unconstitutional, as the great one Mark Levin said last night. He cites the majority opinion in Morrissey versus Olson. The basic problem being that Mueller is more powerful than all 96 U.S. attorneys. Mueller was also never nominated, never confirmed by the U.S. Senate. And because Robert Mueller's appointment is unconstitutional and that renders everything that he has done since May 17, 2017 null and void. And that's why we heard just a couple of Fridays ago, Judge T.S. Ellis III demanding to see Rod Rosenstein's scope memo that gave Mueller the ability supposedly to carry out this witch hunt. Judge Ellis just eviscerated Mueller's team and his pit bull Andrew Weissmann for going after Paul Manafort on a 2005 tax fraud allegation. That has nothing to do with Russia. And he called out Mueller for putting the screws, the judge's words, to Manafort. Why? To get him to sing. Remember, singers can also compose and flip on Trump so they can prosecute or impeach him. And as far as Rod Rosenstein goes, Steve Bannon says Rosenstein could in fact be fired and very soon. We'll have to wait and see what that's all about. Also tonight, take a look at this headline from the American Center for Law and Justice. 'It was a favor factory, deep state forced to turn over thousands of Clinton-era State Department emails to/about the Clinton Foundation debunking supposed firewall.' The ACLJ reporting that the State Department will be turning over nearly 30,000 emails between Hillary Clinton's State Department and her family foundation. This is why I keep saying, I know it takes more time than you want. We're unpeeling layers of an onion, and that means they were in constant communication. And as the AP discovered in 2016, more than half of these people who met with the Clintons while she was serving as secretary of state ended up either personally or through an organization giving money and funneling it back to the Clinton Foundation."

But then they found the weak link, a 20-some year old George Papadopoulos. And here's what's been reported and it's really when you think about it and I started researching it today -- George Papadopoulos is told by a professor with close ties to the Kremlin that the Russians have Hillary's emails. That's in April. In May, George finds himself at a bar in London and some gorgeous blonde comes up and starts buying him drinks, my goodness.

Our nation was founded in a rejection of the capricious usurpation of power. That's why we had the revolutionary war. Now, it's happening in the Obama administration at the highest level of the intelligence community.

You're right that on the spygate issue, as the president dubbed it today, the relentless pressure from President Trump is succeeding in at least one way tonight. He is turning the tables on former Obama officials like James Clapper, James Comey. Today, Comey -- Clapper rather being forced into playing defense on CNN and denying that he ever committed crimes. New, tonight, Clapper is telling PBS the intent was not to spy on the Trump camp but to figure out what the Russians were doing. That's a mile apart from March 2017 when Clapper completely denied there was surveillance of the Trump campaign. All this leading the president today to call Clapper a lying machine. Today, he added it was a good thing for the country that he fired James Comey because of what the president called the former FBI chief's tremendous lies about surveillance and other matters. Notice that Comey today shifted his own story as well. Look at this tweet. He says facts matter. The FBI's use of confidential human sources, the actual term, is tightly regulated and essential. So, he's saying it happened but it's regulated and essential to protecting the country. Attacks on the FBI and lying about its work will do lasting damage to our country. How will Republicans explain this to their grandchildren? Well, Democrats today tried to stop Republican Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy from meeting tomorrow to review this classified intelligence about surveillance with the FBI Director Christopher Wray and other officials. Chuck Schumer insisting Democrats be added because he thinks the GOP lawmakers are doing the bidding of the president. But White House officials tonight shut that talk down by saying Democrats will get a second briefing after Memorial Day. While the president today told reporters he wants the truth."

At first it seemed like it was a good process. Maybe it made sense. But as more and more questions came really to the fore -- how did this get started? What kind of techniques were used? What was behind the warrant? What kind of techniques do these prosecutors used where they're raiding people and shaming them and threatening relatives. This doesn't seem like an American democracy. It seems like a star chamber of series of events. And now this thing is opening up after a year and testimony by every one of these former intelligence chiefs, they never said that they were using this kind of intelligence.

It is about all campaigns of all president as I said in the piece. We cannot allow the deep state to operate in this manner. We've got to get to really get to the bottom of what's going on here for sure."

We have FISA judges lied to, Hillary Clinton bought and paid for dossier that own the author said in interrogatory, that wrong intelligence, maybe 50/50.

So they've been used to getting away with things since 1979, 1990. Then you have the people who covered up for her corruption, and I'm counting in the whole thing with the e-mails as part of the corruption. So that's a second layer. Then you have the fear, my God, Trump could win and now you have a third layer which is how do we get the very people who are protecting her. And Andy McCarthy had a wonderful line, he said."
