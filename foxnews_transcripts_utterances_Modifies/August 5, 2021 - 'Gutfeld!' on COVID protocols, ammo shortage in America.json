Isaac Newton once said that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning much like my nightly massage therapists, forces always come in pairs. And in this case, it's fear and response to fear. Firearm sales have soared during the crime wave creating an ammunition shortage. Of course not among the gangs of Chicago in New York City. But the bullet shortage is so bad gangbangers have agreed to limit their shootings to bystanders who aren't vaccinated. As firearm sales jumped by over 20 million last year, with over eight million new purchases, the ammo started running out. And now firearm instructors are so short on ammo. They're canceling their courses, which sucks for new shooters like me. Instead, we're practicing with this.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So if you're surprised by this, then you must be surprised by sunrises or tax day or how dumb Joy Behar is. Any -- that gets applause. I got to remember that. And anyone with half a brain could see this coming, or half a brain in total. The run on guns is a direct response to a legitimate fear. It's no different than the sales increase in plywood during and after the riots. But oddly, the fear isn't stoked by the media hysteria which is usually the case. They'll get worked -- they'll get you worked up over any imaginary crisis like sharks or fried eggs or sharks frying eggs. But growing violent crime, you hear crickets. Instead it's the media's denial that fuels the gun mania, the media is no different than Hunter Biden's saying what drug problem? But turn on the local news and it's all there. A woman gets sucker punched on the street, 10 people shot over a weekend in a big city. Another woman dies after a brutal mugging every day. It's a new story that adds to the chilling statistics. Meanwhile, the national news runs from the story like a female staffer running from Andrew Cuomo. And that creepy denial creates more suspicion like these crime waves are somehow acceptable, because it's fine with the ruling class and they're well-armed security. Not a lot of street crime at a party in Martha's Vineyard. But if Martha owned a convenience store in Baltimore, she's out of luck. And yet the media tells you you're nuts to think violence is happening even when you see it with your own eyes. And that is people like me buying guns for protection. Can you imagine? I can't go on certain carnival rides. But me buying a tactical shotgun is a snap. I love this country. And the media make sure this trend is not going to stop. The gun store shelves are now as empty as Kat's medicine cabinet after a long weekend. And for once the media can't blame right-wing media or the NRA or even Trump like the blood of a gunshot victim. It's kind of on them. The media is mocking denial and crime statistics. The cheering of police to funding while dismissing the threat to small business owners often minorities is fueling this rise, including among law abiding women and minorities. They're buying the guns. Finally, diversity as a tool for good. It's about time. It's Gutfeld's rule number 33. Buying a gun is a gateway drug to leaving leftism. Gun ownership leads to immediate wisdom. It's like the time you saw what damage FICA did to your first paycheck. Oh. If you don't know what that means, then you're not working. Meanwhile, the media and the Dems will drive gun purchases up even more. Smith and Wesson should be sending a Whitman sampler to CNN. It's a cheap chocolate. Instead of focusing on the bad guys however, the media will use the vague phrase gun violence to nationalize the issue while calling crime a local issue. Weird. It's incompatible and it's malicious. It's an epidemic they'll say. Lumping all gun owners and illegal gun owners into this same group. But when is the last time you saw a gangbanger with a 10-point buck tied to the roof of their Escalade? It's like saying drinking a glass of water is harmful since other people are drowning in the ocean. The common denominator is water, but that's idiotic. So rather than focus on the criminal, they shall focus on the law abiding, which is like remaking jaws with swimmers as the bad guys. Why do that? Because it's easier. Law abiding people actually will abide by the laws that are made in criminals. They won't, they're criminals. So today's lawmakers just make it easier for themselves by making shoplifting and retail theft, car chases and assault unworthy of arrest. It's all part of a greater mission to remake society to something new by destroying it first. And what does that do? Well, Newton also said what goes up must come down. The more the Dems in the media try to reduce your security. It's up to the rest of us to enhance it. At this rate by 2022 we'll all be driving tanks.",

Isaac Newton once said that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Meaning much like my nightly massage therapists, forces always come in pairs. And in this case, it's fear and response to fear. Firearm sales have soared during the crime wave creating an ammunition shortage. Of course not among the gangs of Chicago in New York City. But the bullet shortage is so bad gangbangers have agreed to limit their shootings to bystanders who aren't vaccinated. As firearm sales jumped by over 20 million last year, with over eight million new purchases, the ammo started running out. And now firearm instructors are so short on ammo. They're canceling their courses, which sucks for new shooters like me. Instead, we're practicing with this."

      "utterance": "Yes. So if you're surprised by this, then you must be surprised by sunrises or tax day or how dumb Joy Behar is. Any -- that gets applause. I got to remember that. And anyone with half a brain could see this coming, or half a brain in total. The run on guns is a direct response to a legitimate fear. It's no different than the sales increase in plywood during and after the riots. But oddly, the fear isn't stoked by the media hysteria which is usually the case. They'll get worked -- they'll get you worked up over any imaginary crisis like sharks or fried eggs or sharks frying eggs. But growing violent crime, you hear crickets. Instead it's the media's denial that fuels the gun mania, the media is no different than Hunter Biden's saying what drug problem? But turn on the local news and it's all there. A woman gets sucker punched on the street, 10 people shot over a weekend in a big city. Another woman dies after a brutal mugging every day. It's a new story that adds to the chilling statistics. Meanwhile, the national news runs from the story like a female staffer running from Andrew Cuomo. And that creepy denial creates more suspicion like these crime waves are somehow acceptable, because it's fine with the ruling class and they're well-armed security. Not a lot of street crime at a party in Martha's Vineyard. But if Martha owned a convenience store in Baltimore, she's out of luck. And yet the media tells you you're nuts to think violence is happening even when you see it with your own eyes. And that is people like me buying guns for protection. Can you imagine? I can't go on certain carnival rides. But me buying a tactical shotgun is a snap. I love this country. And the media make sure this trend is not going to stop. The gun store shelves are now as empty as Kat's medicine cabinet after a long weekend. And for once the media can't blame right-wing media or the NRA or even Trump like the blood of a gunshot victim. It's kind of on them. The media is mocking denial and crime statistics. The cheering of police to funding while dismissing the threat to small business owners often minorities is fueling this rise, including among law abiding women and minorities. They're buying the guns. Finally, diversity as a tool for good. It's about time. It's Gutfeld's rule number 33. Buying a gun is a gateway drug to leaving leftism. Gun ownership leads to immediate wisdom. It's like the time you saw what damage FICA did to your first paycheck. Oh. If you don't know what that means, then you're not working. Meanwhile, the media and the Dems will drive gun purchases up even more. Smith and Wesson should be sending a Whitman sampler to CNN. It's a cheap chocolate. Instead of focusing on the bad guys however, the media will use the vague phrase gun violence to nationalize the issue while calling crime a local issue. Weird. It's incompatible and it's malicious. It's an epidemic they'll say. Lumping all gun owners and illegal gun owners into this same group. But when is the last time you saw a gangbanger with a 10-point buck tied to the roof of their Escalade? It's like saying drinking a glass of water is harmful since other people are drowning in the ocean. The common denominator is water, but that's idiotic. So rather than focus on the criminal, they shall focus on the law abiding, which is like remaking jaws with swimmers as the bad guys. Why do that? Because it's easier. Law abiding people actually will abide by the laws that are made in criminals. They won't, they're criminals. So today's lawmakers just make it easier for themselves by making shoplifting and retail theft, car chases and assault unworthy of arrest. It's all part of a greater mission to remake society to something new by destroying it first. And what does that do? Well, Newton also said what goes up must come down. The more the Dems in the media try to reduce your security. It's up to the rest of us to enhance it. At this rate by 2022 we'll all be driving tanks."

And so a lot of people have decided we have to protect ourselves. And even people as you mentioned right million new gun owners, people who would have never considered Westchester buying guns.

The contest judges bathrooms and a variety factors including design, cleanliness, and innovation, which is better than how New Yorkers judge them. Is there a homeless person living there? That's how we judge. Everyone can vote as many times as they want for the winner until August 23rd. They can admit they're clinically depressed.
