These acts of intimidation are also affecting educational services and school board governance. Some have even led to school lockdowns.\" Bill, your thoughts? BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, my thoughts, that may all well be true, but it's not a federal offense. And though the attorney general didn't mention terrorism, his memo came in response to a National School Board Association letter suggesting that people that are demonstrating like this are domestic terrorists and might be prosecuted under the Patriot Act. This is just insane. And a lot of this stuff -- look, school boards are at the forefront of some of the most contentious issues in America today -- critical Race Theory, COVID policy with masking and so forth, Affirmative Action to some of our elite public schools. There is a lot of issues. And the left seems intent on labeling anyone who disagrees with them an insurrectionist or a terrorist or a white supremacist. And I think people are tired of it.",

They had letters detailing specific threats against school board members, and even in some cases, threats against teachers. I think a lot of this is unfortunate, but you can't bury from the idea that public servants and people performing a public service should be protected. No one is saying that you can't speak out at a school board meeting. This is about threats and violence and intimidation, and that's the response. Now, what you are seeing here, of course, and I think Bill pointed this out, is a lot of this is a response to arguments, political arguments over Critical Race Theory, over the use of masks in cool to protect children against COVID.
