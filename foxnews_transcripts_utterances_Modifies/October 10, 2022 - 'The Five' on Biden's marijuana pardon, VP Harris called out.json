Remember gas prices had started to tick down. They -- we had the Kansas result about the abortion issue referendum. Even though that was badly worded, it still seemed like it gave them some momentum. They had some money behind them. And Republicans had really been beaten up in their primaries in this, you know, and it's taken them a while to crawl back. But what's really helped them is the Democrats, and it's mostly President Biden and people being able to look at this and say, my 401k sucks right now. And that is something that will matter to them when they think about their overall economic picture. They're paying more for gas, they're bringing more for groceries, and then you have the OPEC decision. And that's going to increase prices even more. So, I don't see some sort of economic miracle happening for the Biden administration, and the Republicans have been very effective for a long time, saying that the spending proposals that the Biden team were putting forward were going to exacerbate inflation. And they've stuck to that message. One, because it's true, and also because it was effective and now people are being -- are able to draw those direct lines between one policy to the next. And I don't think that people, if they decide to vote for Republicans, believe that all of a sudden everything is going to turn.

And whip Clyburn didn't sign onto it and Steny Hoyer didn't. But Nancy Pelosi said, quote, \"that she was a bridge to the next generation of leadership.\" And I understand the frustration, not only because of what's going on with the numbers here, but there are a lot of really good people that have won these highly competitive swing districts have these incredible backgrounds. Like in 2018, we had what was referred to as the camo wave where all of these people who had served like Abigail Spanberger and Elise Slotkin got, into office and they're looking at this saying, when is it going to be our time? In terms of Biden's approval rating, though, if you go back and you look at history in 2010 and 2014, Obama was underwater and Democrats did pick up Senate seats. They picked up, I think eight in total. Three in 2010. And then, five in 2014. The numbers were not as big as, you know --",

I think Glenn Youngkin obviously has created a pretty good playbook for Republicans on how to talk about this. And I've mentioned on the show before that even though for some people CRT or woke policies was the issue, he was talking about the brass tacks of getting kids in school maskless to be able to work with teachers and to learn. He wasn't talking about all the other peripheral stuff that would then persuade a moderate or maybe conservative Democrat to come out and support a Republican. I think the implications of Terry McAuliffe his comment during that race, where he said that the kids don't belong -- right, that kids are part of the system is going to ripple potentially for decades, right? This is so fundamental to how parents feel about their kids' education no matter who you vote for. And I think that Democrats should be running aggressively on it to talk about how they're going to improve public education, because Republicans consistently fall back on we want to give you options, take your $7,000 and go to a charter school.

But that is in no way superior to or even equal to a parent. And so, the concept that we have that literally fight for our parental rights policy is absurd. And it's part of this whole movement that we're experiencing with wokeness, and social justice, and with the pandemic. You know, the kids are learning, crime is going up, we don't have as much money, everything's going to hell in a handbasket. And we've got to pull back at some point and whether or not it's going to a charter school, or a religious school or taking your money, the money follow the child. You know, the schools don't own the kids, they think they do because they get money from the government. The more kids they have, the more money they get. Let's not kid each other. Let's also not kid each other that the billions that they got, they haven't spent yet. They shouldn't have to give that money back. Where is it? What did you do with it?

Remember gas prices had started to tick down. They -- we had the Kansas result about the abortion issue referendum. Even though that was badly worded, it still seemed like it gave them some momentum. They had some money behind them. And Republicans had really been beaten up in their primaries in this, you know, and it's taken them a while to crawl back. But what's really helped them is the Democrats, and it's mostly President Biden and people being able to look at this and say, my 401k sucks right now. And that is something that will matter to them when they think about their overall economic picture. They're paying more for gas, they're bringing more for groceries, and then you have the OPEC decision. And that's going to increase prices even more. So, I don't see some sort of economic miracle happening for the Biden administration, and the Republicans have been very effective for a long time, saying that the spending proposals that the Biden team were putting forward were going to exacerbate inflation. And they've stuck to that message. One, because it's true, and also because it was effective and now people are being -- are able to draw those direct lines between one policy to the next. And I don't think that people, if they decide to vote for Republicans, believe that all of a sudden everything is going to turn. But they do think that the excessive spending will hopefully come to a stop."

Because in 2018 there was this big almost insurrection led by Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan, where they didn't want her to have the speakership again, and Marcia Fudge was going to run against her, and they brokered this deal where she essentially term limited herself. And whip Clyburn didn't sign onto it and Steny Hoyer didn't. But Nancy Pelosi said, quote, \"that she was a bridge to the next generation of leadership.\" And I understand the frustration, not only because of what's going on with the numbers here, but there are a lot of really good people that have won these highly competitive swing districts have these incredible backgrounds. Like in 2018, we had what was referred to as the camo wave where all of these people who had served like Abigail Spanberger and Elise Slotkin got, into office and they're looking at this saying, when is it going to be our time? In terms of Biden's approval rating, though, if you go back and you look at history in 2010 and 2014, Obama was underwater and Democrats did pick up Senate seats. They picked up, I think eight in total. Three in 2010. And then, five in 2014. The numbers were not as big as, you know --"

And this is the ultimate and selfishness that I'm seeing, is that you see prominent voices in politics and the media will admit that Biden is objectively a terrible president, but they will still take him over Trump because they're no longer stressed out. Right? So, they'd rather have everybody in America is suffering with crime and inflation, just so they get like a maybe 20 minutes more of sleep because that's their suffering.

But with how blue New York has drifted, you'd expect more obviously at this point. I do think though, in terms of Lee Zeldin being able to actually win this race, that it does hurt him that Donald Trump ended up endorsing him and did a fundraiser with him in September. So, they raised a lot of money, which is important. I think it was like $1.2 million. But if you're trying to get moderates and Democrats to swing over, especially on this law-and- order issue, the Trump brand is just anathema to us.

He wasn't talking about all the other peripheral stuff that would then persuade a moderate or maybe conservative Democrat to come out and support a Republican. I think the implications of Terry McAuliffe his comment during that race, where he said that the kids don't belong -- right, that kids are part of the system is going to ripple potentially for decades, right? This is so fundamental to how parents feel about their kids' education no matter who you vote for. And I think that Democrats should be running aggressively on it to talk about how they're going to improve public education, because Republicans consistently fall back on we want to give you options, take your $7,000 and go to a charter school.

But that is in no way superior to or even equal to a parent. And so, the concept that we have that literally fight for our parental rights policy is absurd. And it's part of this whole movement that we're experiencing with wokeness, and social justice, and with the pandemic. You know, the kids are learning, crime is going up, we don't have as much money, everything's going to hell in a handbasket. And we've got to pull back at some point and whether or not it's going to a charter school, or a religious school or taking your money, the money follow the child.

And there are issues regarding if you have a secret clearance, for example, if you're working on big important CIA new jets and equipment, things like that, should you be able to have smoked marijuana. I think that what happened last week is that if John Fetterman was 10 points ahead, Joe Biden would not have made that announcement. And also, it happened to be a nice change of subject from the OPEC face plant that they had last week. And these are two very flawed messenger you're talking about marijuana and an -- from an 80-year-old and somebody who used to put them in jail. I do think though however, I feel very strongly that anyone can smoke pot whatever you want to do. But if you throw that joint down and my dog --"

My friend Bill Fitzpatrick in 2019 is a DEA in Onondaga County. He said it was a simple matter of justice he tosspot convictions. But folks, we're not talking about a kid smoking a joint. Most of these convictions are accompanied by a significant amount that indicates that you are trafficking in this, OK.
