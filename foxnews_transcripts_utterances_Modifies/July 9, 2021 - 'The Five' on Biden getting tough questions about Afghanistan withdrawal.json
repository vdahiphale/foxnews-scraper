So the decision has been made but you can leave in a way that his dignity and is not so sloppy. The other thing that is really bothering me is the issue of the Afghan interpreters who sacrificed, works for us, and you have people like Congressman Michael Waltz and Dan Crenshaw who both served and who will say that their interpreters saved their lives. Well, they are supposed to be able to come here and because the Taliban want to kill them. And so there is a whole bunch (inaudible) stuck over there, but this case that's really bothering me this week is there is a man named Niazy Zalmay. He lives in Iowa. He's been there since 2014. When he found out -- he came for a conference. He found out that the Taliban was going to try to kill him, applied for political asylum. He's been living in Iowa. He has a business, he has employees. He's an exemplary record. He goes in for his interview to finally get his approval to stay, and they said -- \"Department of Homeland Security, have you ever had any interaction with the Taliban?\" And he says, \"Well, I can't tell a lie. When I was nine years old the Taliban came to me and said I had to go get them a piece of bread from my mom. So I went to my mom, I got the bread and I gave it to the Taliban and my mom yelled and called them smugglers (inaudible). Okay, he was nine years old. The Department of Homeland Security has sent him a letter that says \"because of your interaction with the Taliban, you are not allowed to stay.\" And they are going to deport him on this ridiculous technicality. And the White House is like, well, that's what the law says. And I just think that is extremely hard to believe.

If you remember Robert Gates who served Bush, Obama, and when he wrote his book he said -- this is his words not mine -- that \"Joe Biden has been wrong on every foreign policy issue since the '70s.\" And I'm not going to debate whether we should leave Afghanistan. So the decision has been made but you can leave in a way that his dignity and is not so sloppy. The other thing that is really bothering me is the issue of the Afghan interpreters who sacrificed, works for us, and you have people like Congressman Michael Waltz and Dan Crenshaw who both served and who will say that their interpreters saved their lives. Well, they are supposed to be able to come here and because the Taliban want to kill them. And so there is a whole bunch (inaudible) stuck over there, but this case that's really bothering me this week is there is a man named Niazy Zalmay. He lives in Iowa. He's been there since 2014. When he found out -- he came for a conference. He found out that the Taliban was going to try to kill him, applied for political asylum. He's been living in Iowa. He has a business, he has employees. He's an exemplary record. He goes in for his interview to finally get his approval to stay, and they said -- \"Department of Homeland Security, have you ever had any interaction with the Taliban?\" And he says, \"Well, I can't tell a lie. When I was nine years old the Taliban came to me and said I had to go get them a piece of bread from my mom. So I went to my mom, I got the bread and I gave it to the Taliban and my mom yelled and called them smugglers (inaudible). Okay, he was nine years old. The Department of Homeland Security has sent him a letter that says \"because of your interaction with the Taliban, you are not allowed to stay.\" And they are going to deport him on this ridiculous technicality. And the White House is like, well, that's what the law says. And I just think that is extremely hard to believe.

We went to Afghanistan to avenge 9/11. We killed Bin Laden. It was graced to be on the air and to break that news to the nation that Bin Laden had been killed by our great SEAL warriors. We should have left then in 2011. We stayed 10 years too long. Afghan is a failed state. It's a narco state. It provides all the heroin that's consumed in Europe. We had a -- and once I was with the Marines in Helmand province. They actually camping in poppy fields there. It's a disgusting, savage place. It's going to splinter. There was no holding it together. In terms of our -- I have Akbar Shinwari, our dear interpreter, my guy, the guy saved my life. Same thing, you know, we worked for Sky News at some point. They talk to the Taliban. You know, you can get them on the telephone. So now, he's got to straighten all that out before he can get here. People we know on a first-name basis that risked everything. Having said that, I also want to say, my god, our G.I.'s, our warriors that gave so much, some their lives, you know, I get pictures during the time when I was the war correspondent. I get pictures from their families. You interviewed airman so-and-so. He died here and there. It was, you know, it's a horrible experience. We should have learned from the Alexander the Great and the British Empire and the Soviet Union, that you can't remake a country in our own image. You will never make Afghanistan France.

There is really no difference if you look at Vietnam and Afghanistan. Not winnable wars in the traditional sense. Nixon recognized it. You have the Vietcong hiding underground in tunnels, in jungles assimilating within the population, they jump out at any time and shoot a G.I. They had to get out and you're never going to win in the traditional sense. So, the Taliban only force right now in play there, they reconstituted. That was inevitable.

And maybe this kind of warfare that we were dealing with is almost irrelevant and antiquated especially when you talk about the drones and you talk about the threats that we are seeing with ransomware which we can't even get a handle on. And we need to concentrate on things like ransomware and bioterror, drones, and things like that. The way to look at it is Afghanistan isn't going anywhere, but thanks to technology, we can go anywhere. And that means that, you know, we don't have to be there. We may not have to occupy anyplace anymore to keep us safe. And I think we kind of knew that and I think it's time. And people should not think of this is any kind of defeat.

I'm doing a little book signing there. I'm also at the Nixon library in Yorba Linda, California -- fun word to say Yorba Linda -- on July 26. So, go to the website and get tickets.
