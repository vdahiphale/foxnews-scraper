Yes, finally the media and the activist politics made their wedded bliss transparent.

Nothing but war, assassination, communism, domestic terror, riots, crime -- all that was missing was Alec Baldwin eating a sack of donuts on a bus toilet. I don't even know why I said that. The fact is the media wants you to think 2018, a time of peace and prosperity is worse -- far worse than '68, a time of division and war. And as we call them on it, they can't handle it.

Dogs, cats, and miniature horses are still allowed but pigs, ferrets, spiders, reptiles, rabbits and hedge hogs have all been nixed. Airline's suspect that since certifying support animals is easy to do online, people do it now to avoid in-cabin pet fees. Earlier this year, a woman tried to bring a support peacock on a United flight and US Airways once booted a support pig and its owner after it defecated in the cabin. The pig, not the owner. You don't want to be that guy, trust me. Bottom line, too many people are gaming the system and it's not fair to people who legitimately need service animals.

Then, you're going to love the Donald Trump super extreme Presidential luxury library. Yes, we're not waiting until he's out of office because that's stupid. The Donald Trump super extreme Presidential luxury library is half luxury yacht and supersonic jet located inside Mount Rushmore within the skull of George Washington. You want exhibition? Check out our historical recreations of Trump fighting a meteor, Trump wrestling Bigfoot and Trump fighting his evil twin Zoltar Trump on the surface of Saturn's moon. None of this happened, which is why the super extreme library is [bleep] awesome. Plus, the water fountains are not filled with water, but actual liberal tears squeezed from the faces of former Clinton staffers. Listen to Trump shares, listen to the state of rallies and be waited on by (inaudible) base serving nothing but super well-done burgers. There's also a special hall of Trump's achievement honoring when he cured all diseases with drugs he found on Mars, discovered cold fusion powered by TV ratings, replaced war with puppies, and made every day the Fourth of July, except for Christmas which last two weeks. Mementos of the Presidency include the actual pantsuit Hillary Clinton wore when she found out she lost, John Brennan's security clearance and the entire country of Canada. It's a Donald Trump super extreme Presidential luxury library."

In my day -- wait, we didn't really protest much in the '80s and '90s and we were cool. My grandparents, they had real protest over real issues. We protest everything, which means we protest nothing. So every time I hear there's a protest, I change the channel, so I am assuming it's over, word has it, pop tart changed their flavor, #hellno. Like, there was a big uproar over Lucky Charms and Frosted Flakes got together and had a bastard child that everyone was like, \"It's too much sugar.\" It's just a box of cereals, but it's changed and no one likes change. The fact that these protests now and I guess, you need like, seven or eight people for an actual protest."

They are making rodents their opponents. This week Southwest Airlines became the latest carrier to crack down on emotional support animals on flight. Dogs, cats, and miniature horses are still allowed but pigs, ferrets, spiders, reptiles, rabbits and hedge hogs have all been nixed. Airline's suspect that since certifying support animals is easy to do online, people do it now to avoid in-cabin pet fees. Earlier this year, a woman tried to bring a support peacock on a United flight and US Airways once booted a support pig and its owner after it defecated in the cabin. The pig, not the owner. You don't want to be that guy, trust me. Bottom line, too many people are gaming the system and it's not fair to people who legitimately need service animals. It's why I came up with a brand-new product that could solve all of this."
