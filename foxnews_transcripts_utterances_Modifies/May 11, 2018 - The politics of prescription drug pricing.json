We are very much eliminating the middleman.  We will work with Congress to pass legislation that will save Americans even more money at the pharmacy.",

Drug pricing goals, increased competition in the drug markets, you heard him there, give Medicare Part D plans better tools to negotiate on behalf of senior citizens, decision new incentives for drug manufacturers, develop options to lower patients' out of pocket spending. You have got these prescription drugs in the U.S., 18,000 plus approved and available, and this number, $328 billion spent on drugs. And 49 percent of Americans have used a prescription drug in the last 30 days. Amazing stats as you go down the line there.  Let's start there and bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief for The Weekly Standard; Karen Tumulty, opinion writer for the Washington Post, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist. Karen, ambitious for the president to go down this road. We have seen other administrations try to do it. What about this?",

To the point about the stock market showing that -- it wasn't just drug companies but also the pharmacy benefit managers, their stocks also went up. I think that what was really interesting about the plan was that it does get more generics into the marketplace. That's really key. That's key for lowering the prices and its' the most substantial thing. The rest seems to be more about sharing among the different groups, who gets to get all this money? So it's also true if you're going to pass something like this you need Democratic support.
