Coming up: the walls closing in on the origins of the coronavirus, as Dr.  Anthony Fauci feels the heat. China's role and Joe Biden's response -- coming up.  We will talk with Ohio Congressman Mike Turner on what the intelligence says about the intent behind COVID-19 and the impact of Joe Biden's agenda.  Then, four-Star General and former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army General Jack Keane the strength and courage of the U.S. military defending America during dangerous days, why the Chinese Communist Party has been ramping up its military. Plus: madness at the border, unknowns running into the country, disappearing into the interior of the U.S., hundreds of thousands of got- aways at the halfway mark of 2021, and a peak surge expected in the months to come, Memorial Day weekend the unofficial kickoff to summer, when 200,000-plus apprehensions a month are expected at the Southern border, reaching record highs.  Former acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on the Biden administration's plans to house and accommodate thousands of new migrants coming in. Then, highlights from the air, water and land from our exclusive coverage of the Southern border, where more fentanyl has been seized so far this year than all of 2020, the consequences for America today right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  And first this morning, China's coronavirus cover-up may finally be unraveling, with President Biden ordering the intelligence community to investigate the origins of the pandemic.   This comes just days after Dr. Anthony Fauci finally admitted that COVID-19 may not have originated naturally, after all, and that the NIH did, in fact, fund coronavirus research at the Wuhan Lab of Virology.

This really shows, I think, a grave concern of both the activities that were there and raises the concern about U.S. involvement. And then, of course, it goes to the Biden administration being completely unwilling to continue to pursue the original origins of the virus.   This is something that the Biden administration is now taking up because of the public outcry because of the report that's coming from the Republicans in the House Intelligence Committee.

He told our Peter Doocy the subject of the origins of coronavirus never came up.

It shows really the fear of coming to the conclusion of what China has been doing.  But our intelligence community all the way back to 2010 had been identifying concerns that China had been working on manipulating viruses for biological weapons that could have grave impact worldwide. And we certainly are seeing the effects of this, where unbelievable deaths have occurred and incredible impacts to the economy. The Chinese government needs to be held accountable.

This research has been reportedly tied to the Chinese military and the Wuhan lab for nefarious intent. So, you go to the next step even, and you get to take the curtain back to see that the Communist Party and the Chinese government have real threats to the world. In addition to just negligence and an accidental leak, they're clearly doing irresponsible research. They're clearly doing things that put lives at risk. And, clearly, this is worldwide.

Now he wants to pay for it. They're doing it. Last month, Border Patrol reported over 178,000 apprehensions. That's a 20-year high. Yet, as of last week, only 455 minors were in their custody. So, where are all of these people going? Joining me right now is former DHS acting Secretary Chad Wolf. He's currently a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Secretary, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for being here. Well, it looks like we are pushing the migrants into the interior of our country as much as possible. The administration has built a lot more housing to house these people, but they're also trying to help them connect with so-called sponsors or family that they say they have in cities across the country.

You talked about DHS and the progress they have made, that the department and the administration are trying to take a victory lap at the moment, talking about how they're moving migrants, mainly minors, from one government facility to another government facility and saying, we have solved the problem and the crisis. And that's anything -- they have done anything but that. Solving the crisis is actually trying to stop the illegal behavior. They're not interested in doing that. They have torn down a number of programs that we put in place back in 2019 and 2020. And they have not replaced it with any programs and policies to address the illegal behavior. Again, they're just simply facilitating more and more of these migrants coming across the border.",

They need to show the migrants and the cartels and the smugglers that it's not OK to continue to smuggle minors and families across that border. But, more importantly, it's to make sure that there's a consequence to that behavior. So, as long as those populations stay in the U.S. once they come across that border, these numbers and this flow is going to continue. It's not until these folks are removed promptly back to their home countries, back to Mexico and elsewhere, that you're going to see some of this start to decrease. It's what we did in 2019 and 2020. And guess what? It worked. The numbers went down. The crime went down. The apprehensions went down. And we got the border under control. So we know what works. There is a playbook.

So, despite this massive surge, the budget is unchanged. But now President Biden is asking for more money to pay for all of this housing. I mean, it just gets me that there's absolutely no effort whatsoever to stop people from coming here illegal, jumping the line in front of people who are actually trying to do it legally, get their green cards. And, instead, he's asking for money through Congress. He wants money to pay for technology and these additional housing facilities that they just built.",

So, it's not only the Southwest border and the migrant and the humanitarian and the security crisis that we're dealing with, but it's also cybersecurity. And it's a variety of these other threats, threats from China that we're dealing with here in the homeland, that the department needs to continue to push forward. At the end of the day, we need to make sure that Americans are safe and secure. And it's going to take resources to do that. And so the fact that the administration is not focusing on that and is focusing on building these facilities and giving more money to HHS to build more of these facilities, again, shows me that they're not serious about trying to stop the problem. Instead of managing the crisis, they need to solve the crisis. And, again, they're not -- they're not currently doing that. We heard the secretary just yesterday talk about possibly reprogramming money within the department to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the Southwest border. So, clearly, there's a resource need there. Clearly, they're spending more money than they have at the moment. And so, as you look towards the next fiscal year, that's going to continue, as these numbers in the second half of the year, these numbers continue to increase.",

There are too many minors in custody for the amount of facilities that they have. So, what do they have to do? They then have to move those individuals to other parts of the country. And so what we say now is that every city, every state in the country is now a border state and a border community, because they are pushing these populations all across the country because they have broken the system. The system has never been designed or accounted for to hold these number of individuals and to process these numbers of individuals. These are historic highs, 21-year high in the amount of folks that are coming across that border and into facilities. So she's exactly right. They are moving these minors, these family units and others to all sorts of communities across the country. So, she's 100 percent correct on that. Look, I have significant concerns with the DHS secretary and the types of policies that he is pursuing. I think they're making the country less safe. They're making our men and women of Border Patrol, the law enforcement officers, less safe. And at the end of the day, they're doing a disservice to the migrants, when they encourage these migrants to make this dangerous trek up. And then, at the same time, he continues to say the border is closed and the border is secure. And that is a lie. That's a lie to the American people. He's misleading the American people on purpose, because he's done it -- he's done it multiple, multiple times. And so you have to account for that. And you have to wonder why he is doing that.

And I said that when the Biden administration came in, while it looked like they were going to move in the right direction on China, wasn't sure about Russia, but I was convinced that they had a potential for a strategic blunder in the Middle East. And that is unfolding right before our eyes, because they're failing to recognize something that Director -- former Director Ratcliffe mentioned. Iran is the chief sponsor of the proxy wars that are taking place in the Middle East and of terrorism in the Middle East. So the three major organizations that were firing on Israel just recently for those 11 days, the Hezbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hamas, who did most of it, all of them are -- work for the ayatollah in Iran. He sponsors them. And, believe me, the attack by Hamas would not have happened if Iran did not OK it, Maria. And that is the link that has to be established. The other problem we have there is the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas for 16 years has rejected all the concessions that Israel has wanted to make. That is why the Arab nations walked away from the Palestinians. And it's not that they don't care about the suffering there. It's not that they don't want the situation resolved with Israel. But it's a recognition that they have much more in common with Israel and confronting Iran, who's the major stabilizer in the region, than they have with the Palestinians in trying to resolve what appears to be an intractable situation, with terrorists running Hamas and Gaza, and corrupt leadership, Mahmoud Abbas, taking the donor money in the Palestinian Authority and making no progress. So, the fact that we're not dealing with Iran is a major flaw by this administration. They should have been called out immediately. We should have got up from our chairs in Vienna, where the deal is being negotiated, the nuclear deal, where we're attempting to revisit the original 2015 nuclear deal that so many of us feel is fundamentally flawed. We should have stopped those negotiations immediately, because Iran was behind the attack on Israel.",

And then you overlay the reports, as you were indicating, that even include perhaps collaboration between the Wuhan lab and the Chinese military, which are referenced in the House Republican Intelligence report, which you can see online, dating back to 2012, where there are concerns about the lab's operations and its coordination with the Chinese military."

So, if you go to page 12 of the report, it lays out the concerns about the activities that are happening at Wuhan and then the occurrences at the lab right before the virus breaks out and goes worldwide, both lack of activity and reports of individuals becoming sick. This really shows, I think, a grave concern of both the activities that were there and raises the concern about U.S. involvement. And then, of course, it goes to the Biden administration being completely unwilling to continue to pursue the original origins of the virus. This is something that the Biden administration is now taking up because of the public outcry because of the report that's coming from the Republicans in the House Intelligence Committee. But even so, the Biden administration has limited the review to a 90-day time period, indicating that either the Intelligence Committee already has the information and is not providing it or they want to limit the scope of the review, which is still of grave concern."

He told our Peter Doocy the subject of the origins of coronavirus never came up. It also never came up in the Alaska meeting where U.S. officials were getting schooled by the Chinese Communist Party. Your thoughts on what this is? Now, all of a sudden, Biden's feeling the walls are closing in, he wants an investigation, which you and your colleagues have already done.

This is clearly an administration that has no interest in pursuing China. But think about this also. If there had been even an accidental leak from a U.S. lab that had resulted in any sickness whatsoever, you would have protests around the world in all capitals. It shows really the fear of coming to the conclusion of what China has been doing. But our intelligence community all the way back to 2010 had been identifying concerns that China had been working on manipulating viruses for biological weapons that could have grave impact worldwide. And we certainly are seeing the effects of this, where unbelievable deaths have occurred and incredible impacts to the economy. The Chinese government needs to be held accountable. Certainly, everything points to the Wuhan lab. We need to get to the bottom of it.

So, what's your take on what's behind sharing the vaccine secrets with the rest of the world, including China?

They were getting pressured from the CCP. They postponed the ban on trading Chinese stocks of companies that are tied to the military. So, my question is, why is Joe Biden protecting the Chinese Communist Party, and why is China hiding the origins of coronavirus? I asked this same question to Jamie Metzl last weekend on this program. He has a background of Asian history.

And you can go the next step of even just -- there's the accidental leak possibility, but then there's also the nefarious intent. This research has been reportedly tied to the Chinese military and the Wuhan lab for nefarious intent. So, you go to the next step even, and you get to take the curtain back to see that the Communist Party and the Chinese government have real threats to the world. In addition to just negligence and an accidental leak, they're clearly doing irresponsible research. They're clearly doing things that put lives at risk. And, clearly, this is worldwide.

So, you have got, reductions in defense spending, reduction in homeland security, when those are the two crises that we're facing right now. When you look at the out-of-control spending in other areas, it shows that, clearly, we're robbing from our future security. But China and Russia are fielding new weapons. They're fielding new weapons that are directed at the United States and our capabilities.

We took a boat ride with the A.G., who said the numbers are spiking because they know there are no consequences to breaching America's borders. They will get processed and many sent to holding areas, which are much bigger now than they were earlier. HHS has built out the complex, putting many more tents to hold many more people. The biggest worry are the ones who get away. The numbers are rising of the so-called got-aways, those people wanting to intentionally evade apprehension. They are seen on surveillance video cameras getting into the country, and they are believed to travel to the interior of the country, going to big cities like New York and Chicago.

You talked about DHS and the progress they have made, that the department and the administration are trying to take a victory lap at the moment, talking about how they're moving migrants, mainly minors, from one government facility to another government facility and saying, we have solved the problem and the crisis. And that's anything -- they have done anything but that. Solving the crisis is actually trying to stop the illegal behavior. They're not interested in doing that. They have torn down a number of programs that we put in place back in 2019 and 2020. And they have not replaced it with any programs and policies to address the illegal behavior. Again, they're just simply facilitating more and more of these migrants coming across the border."

And so they need to bring back either the migrant protection protocols or asylum cooperative agreements. They need to show the migrants and the cartels and the smugglers that it's not OK to continue to smuggle minors and families across that border. But, more importantly, it's to make sure that there's a consequence to that behavior. So, as long as those populations stay in the U.S. once they come across that border, these numbers and this flow is going to continue. It's not until these folks are removed promptly back to their home countries, back to Mexico and elsewhere, that you're going to see some of this start to decrease. It's what we did in 2019 and 2020. And guess what? It worked. The numbers went down. The crime went down. The apprehensions went down. And we got the border under control. So we know what works. There is a playbook. This administration simply chooses not to institute some of those policies."

The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Mayorkas, told lawmakers that the administration is seeking $52.2 billion in funding for the coming fiscal year, leaving the agency's budget unchanged. So, despite this massive surge, the budget is unchanged. But now President Biden is asking for more money to pay for all of this housing. I mean, it just gets me that there's absolutely no effort whatsoever to stop people from coming here illegal, jumping the line in front of people who are actually trying to do it legally, get their green cards. And, instead, he's asking for money through Congress. He wants money to pay for technology and these additional housing facilities that they just built."

So, it's not only the Southwest border and the migrant and the humanitarian and the security crisis that we're dealing with, but it's also cybersecurity. And it's a variety of these other threats, threats from China that we're dealing with here in the homeland, that the department needs to continue to push forward. At the end of the day, we need to make sure that Americans are safe and secure. And it's going to take resources to do that. And so the fact that the administration is not focusing on that and is focusing on building these facilities and giving more money to HHS to build more of these facilities, again, shows me that they're not serious about trying to stop the problem. Instead of managing the crisis, they need to solve the crisis. And, again, they're not -- they're not currently doing that. We heard the secretary just yesterday talk about possibly reprogramming money within the department to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the Southwest border. So, clearly, there's a resource need there. Clearly, they're spending more money than they have at the moment. And so, as you look towards the next fiscal year, that's going to continue, as these numbers in the second half of the year, these numbers continue to increase."

The system has never been designed or accounted for to hold these number of individuals and to process these numbers of individuals. These are historic highs, 21-year high in the amount of folks that are coming across that border and into facilities. So she's exactly right. They are moving these minors, these family units and others to all sorts of communities across the country. So, she's 100 percent correct on that. Look, I have significant concerns with the DHS secretary and the types of policies that he is pursuing. I think they're making the country less safe. They're making our men and women of Border Patrol, the law enforcement officers, less safe. And at the end of the day, they're doing a disservice to the migrants, when they encourage these migrants to make this dangerous trek up. And then, at the same time, he continues to say the border is closed and the border is secure. And that is a lie. That's a lie to the American people. He's misleading the American people on purpose, because he's done it -- he's done it multiple, multiple times. And so you have to account for that. And you have to wonder why he is doing that. And I think he needs to be held accountable for that."

      "utterance": "Let's be real clear about this. Those 4,000 rockets that went into Israel were not Hamas rockets. They were Iranian rockets. They were paid for or built by or put together by Hamas militants trained by Iran in aerodynamics and propulsion necessary to attack Israel. And you don't have to take my word for it. Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini two days ago took credit for the victory, what he claimed was the victory over Israel by Iran. And Hamas' leader thanked Iran for its help in that victory. So, to watch what the Biden administration and how they have emboldened Iran, when, as you said, we warned them specifically, look, if you reverse these policies and embolden Iran, you're going to jeopardize this hard-earned Middle East peace."

Four months later, Gaza lies in ruins, the U.S. has pledged nearly $400 million to the Palestinians, and our own secretary of state did not even utter the word Iran once during his recent trip to Israel. Joining me right now is FOX News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. He is also a retired four-star Army general and a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, the highest civilian honor. The Memorial Day weekend, sir, we thank you for your service. General, it's good to see you."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, what is your take on all of this, the cease-fire in place? Does it last? What are your thoughts about all of the money sent to the Palestinian Authority? Have we changed course entirely in the Middle East?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, we're beginning to. And I said that when the Biden administration came in, while it looked like they were going to move in the right direction on China, wasn't sure about Russia, but I was convinced that they had a potential for a strategic blunder in the Middle East. And that is unfolding right before our eyes, because they're failing to recognize something that Director -- former Director Ratcliffe mentioned. Iran is the chief sponsor of the proxy wars that are taking place in the Middle East and of terrorism in the Middle East. So the three major organizations that were firing on Israel just recently for those 11 days, the Hezbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hamas, who did most of it, all of them are -- work for the ayatollah in Iran. He sponsors them. And, believe me, the attack by Hamas would not have happened if Iran did not OK it, Maria. And that is the link that has to be established. The other problem we have there is the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas for 16 years has rejected all the concessions that Israel has wanted to make. That is why the Arab nations walked away from the Palestinians. And it's not that they don't care about the suffering there. It's not that they don't want the situation resolved with Israel. But it's a recognition that they have much more in common with Israel and confronting Iran, who's the major stabilizer in the region, than they have with the Palestinians in trying to resolve what appears to be an intractable situation, with terrorists running Hamas and Gaza, and corrupt leadership, Mahmoud Abbas, taking the donor money in the Palestinian Authority and making no progress. So, the fact that we're not dealing with Iran is a major flaw by this administration. They should have been called out immediately. We should have got up from our chairs in Vienna, where the deal is being negotiated, the nuclear deal, where we're attempting to revisit the original 2015 nuclear deal that so many of us feel is fundamentally flawed. We should have stopped those negotiations immediately, because Iran was behind the attack on Israel."

I can tell you this, that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his people around him gave Secretary Blinken an earful about Iran's complicit behavior here."

The Global Times is a newspaper backed by the Chinese Communist Party. And the Global Times is recommending the CCP bomb Australia. They actually go through areas of Australia where it would be a positive to strike Australia, says the Global Times. And this is all because, of course, as you know, Australia was one of the countries to push back on the CCP, demanding answers to the COVID-19 origins. Australia raised its hand, said, we want to know how this pandemic started, killing 3.5 million people across the world. Immediately, the CCP cut off Australia, stopped sending imports into Australia, tried to publicly denounce Australia. And now we get this from the Global Times, with recommendations for the CCP to strike Australia. Your reaction?"

Lookit, if anything like that happened, there would be a major war with the United States and our allies against China. President Xi is not that foolish to do something like that. But, listen, the pattern that he has established since he's been in power going back to 2012 and 2013 is, he's a predator economically and also militarily. And he uses intimidation and coercion to break people's will, to wear them down, to break their resolve. That's what he did in Hong Kong. And that is what he's done in -- with our allies in the region."
