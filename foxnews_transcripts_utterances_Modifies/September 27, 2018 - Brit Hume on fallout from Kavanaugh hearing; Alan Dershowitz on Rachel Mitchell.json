      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" A remarkable day, Brett Kavanaugh has stepped away from the microphone in the Senate hearing room. He spent three and a half hours there, it was a remarkable moment, stunning in many ways like without precedent in the lifetimes of many who watched it. Until this afternoon, Kavanaugh had struck, many who watched him, as bookish and academic, the classic temperament of a federal judge.  He emerged though this afternoon transformed, a man on fire, fighting with everything he had to save his family, himself in the presumption of innocence. Kavanaugh began his testimony today with an unequivocal denial of the allegations against him. I did not sexually assault Christine Blasey Ford or anyone else at any time, he said his voice rising, the charges are false.  But then Kavanaugh did something entirely unexpected. He broadened his response and he aimed it directly at the Senate Democrats sitting before him.",

The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy.  Since my nomination in July, there's been a frenzy on the Left to come up with something, anything, to block my confirmation. Shortly after I was nominated, the Democratic Senate leader said he would \"oppose me with everything he's got.\" A Democratic Senator on this committee publicly referred to me as evil. Evil, think about that word, and said that those who supported me were \"complicit and evil.\" Another Democratic Senator on this committee said \"Judge Kavanaugh is your worst nightmare.\" A former head of the Democratic National Committee said \"Judge Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.\"  I understand the passions of the moment, but I would say to those Senators, your words have meaning. Millions of Americans listen carefully to you.   Given comments like those, is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent email to my wife, to make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends to blow me up and take me down. You sowed the wind for decades to come. I fear that the whole country will reap the whirlwind.",

Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein began the questioning for Democrats. She seemed to suggest that Kavanaugh was secretly a sexual predator. Reading from a script, Feinstein referred to a woman called Julie Swetnick, who was a college student in suburban Washington when Brett Kavanaugh was in high school. Yesterday, as we told you, Swetnick claimed that she witnessed at least ten public gang rapes in which Brett Kavanaugh was supposedly present and participating. It was a remarkable charge, and yet Feinstein never mentioned that part of Swetnick's claim. Why is that?   Well, because the story is ridiculous. It clashes with common sense and it's lunatic. Nobody believes it. So, Feinstein left that part out in order to smear Kavanaugh in front of the world and omitted highly relevant information about his accuser, indeed the entire accusation. It was reprehensibly dishonest behavior, especially for a U.S. Senator, and Kavanaugh all but said so.",

Democrats claimed they held these hearings for her, because they care deeply about her well-being. It was Democrats who leaked her name to the press against her wishes and dragged her into this maelstrom. Who did that? Well, likely someone in Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein claims she was not involved. She'd like the presumption of innocence on that. OK, so who was it? If you care about Christine Ford, about all victims of sexual assaults, you'd be very anxious to know. Maybe we could have a new investigation to that.   Republicans would start one immediately like tomorrow. Would Democrats participate in an investigation to find out who leaked Christine Ford's name to the press? Probably not. They seem strikingly uninterested in talking about Christine Ford today. They rarely asked about her when Judge Kavanaugh was on the set.

      "sentences": "An FBI investigation sounds reasonable. It would be the seventh FBI investigation that has looked deeply into Brett Kavanaugh's personal conduct. He was once Staff Secretary to the President of the United States and at the highest level of security clearance this country gives, one that gave him access to America's nuclear codes.  He got that clearance because the FBI spoke at length to a cross-section of everyone he'd ever met, going back to high school and earlier, and there were no hints of sexual assaults, none. There's nothing left to investigate here, everyone knows that, this is a political tactic, and is disingenuous. Why are they doing it? Well, simple, Democrats know that if the vote on Brett Kavanaugh has held soon, he will be confirmed. If it is delayed by pointless FBI investigations being demanded by demagogues in bad faith, he will not be confirmed, because the accusations will never end. The incentive to make them is too strong. You'll see more anonymous claims that he led gang rapes on sailboats in Rhode Island or whatever, and this grotesque circus will continue. Our ancient standards of justice will further degrade with the help of the Senate Democratic Conference.  But Democrats will retain power and that is the point, is the only point of all of this. But for now, and until and if that happens, no Republican Senator who watched Brett Kavanaugh testify today is likely to vote against him. Those who did would be quickly punished by voters. Many viewers at home wept as they watched Kavanaugh speak today, maybe you did as you saw it. Those of us who have been falsely accused of sexual assault by strangers understood well the feeling of terror and loneliness that's shown on Kavanaugh's face. Prove you didn't do it or everything you have will be taken from you by force. That's not an easy task for anyone. Kavanaugh came as close as a man can to clearing his own name. He didn't get a lot of help from Senate Republicans other than Lindsey Graham. The next time you're falsely accused of a crime, don't ask them for backup. Brett Kavanaugh did it all himself; he had no choice. As his life collapsed around him, he stood bravely and he spoke clearly and it's hard to imagine a fiercer test of a man's character than that.  Brit Hume on fallout from Kavanaugh hearing Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume breaks down political implications of the Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.   We're going to be considering all for the next hour what happened in the Senate today and its implications, but we're going to begin fittingly with Fox senior political analyst Brit Hume, who spent all day covering this story.

And then, as I rather anticipated, came her testimony which was emotional as was his and powerful in its way. And I thought to myself, now the burden is even higher on him and the Republicans did next to nothing in the hired questioner they had -- through the hired questioner they had to cast doubt on her testimony.  And politically speaking, that might have been wise. So, it all is up to him, and I was wondering whether he could do it and whether the mild- mannered young man -- young compared to me that he is -- would be effective in this setting under these circumstances. I have to say I think he was extremely effective. I think his emotion, his - at times he was near tears, was -- made his testimony credible.

And the only corroborative evidence really that were produced where his old calendars and diaries that he produced. They're not dispositive, but they are something.

I hope the American people can see through this sham that you knew about it and you held it. You had no intention of protecting Dr. Ford, none. She's as much of a victim as you are. God, I hate to say it, because these have been my friends. But let me tell you when it comes to this, you're looking for a fair process, you came to the wrong town at the wrong time, my friend. You have interacted with professional women all your life, not one accusation. You're supposed to be Bill Cosby, when you're a junior and senior and high school. And all of a sudden, you got over it. It's been my understanding that if you drug women and rape them for two years in high school, you probably don't stop.  Here's my understanding, if you've lived the good life, people won't recognize it. To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics. You want this seat; I hope you never get it. I hope you're on the Supreme Court, that's exactly where you should be and I hope that the American people will see through this charade, and I wish you well and I intend to vote for you, and I hope everybody who's fair-minded will.",

He spent three and a half hours there, it was a remarkable moment, stunning in many ways like without precedent in the lifetimes of many who watched it. Until this afternoon, Kavanaugh had struck, many who watched him, as bookish and academic, the classic temperament of a federal judge. He emerged though this afternoon transformed, a man on fire, fighting with everything he had to save his family, himself in the presumption of innocence. Kavanaugh began his testimony today with an unequivocal denial of the allegations against him. I did not sexually assault Christine Blasey Ford or anyone else at any time, he said his voice rising, the charges are false. But then Kavanaugh did something entirely unexpected. He broadened his response and he aimed it directly at the Senate Democrats sitting before him."

Since my nomination in July, there's been a frenzy on the Left to come up with something, anything, to block my confirmation. Shortly after I was nominated, the Democratic Senate leader said he would \"oppose me with everything he's got.\" A Democratic Senator on this committee publicly referred to me as evil. Evil, think about that word, and said that those who supported me were \"complicit and evil.\" Another Democratic Senator on this committee said \"Judge Kavanaugh is your worst nightmare.\" A former head of the Democratic National Committee said \"Judge Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.\" I understand the passions of the moment, but I would say to those Senators, your words have meaning. Millions of Americans listen carefully to you. Given comments like those, is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent email to my wife, to make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends to blow me up and take me down.

Reading from a script, Feinstein referred to a woman called Julie Swetnick, who was a college student in suburban Washington when Brett Kavanaugh was in high school. Yesterday, as we told you, Swetnick claimed that she witnessed at least ten public gang rapes in which Brett Kavanaugh was supposedly present and participating. It was a remarkable charge, and yet Feinstein never mentioned that part of Swetnick's claim. Why is that? Well, because the story is ridiculous. It clashes with common sense and it's lunatic. Nobody believes it. So, Feinstein left that part out in order to smear Kavanaugh in front of the world and omitted highly relevant information about his accuser, indeed the entire accusation. It was reprehensibly dishonest behavior, especially for a U.S. Senator, and Kavanaugh all but said so."

What kind of lack of self-awareness would it take to say something like that? Remarkable. Underneath all of this though hung the most obvious question of the day which nobody asked out loud, who did this to Christine Ford? Democrats claimed they held these hearings for her, because they care deeply about her well-being. It was Democrats who leaked her name to the press against her wishes and dragged her into this maelstrom. Who did that? Well, likely someone in Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein claims she was not involved. She'd like the presumption of innocence on that. OK, so who was it? If you care about Christine Ford, about all victims of sexual assaults, you'd be very anxious to know. Maybe we could have a new investigation to that. Republicans would start one immediately like tomorrow. Would Democrats participate in an investigation to find out who leaked Christine Ford's name to the press? Probably not. They seem strikingly uninterested in talking about Christine Ford today. They rarely asked about her when Judge Kavanaugh was on the set. Instead, they peppered Kavanaugh with questions about his Georgetown Prep yearbook and how much beer he drank in high school and college. Here's one of his responses to that line of questioning."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "An FBI investigation sounds reasonable. It would be the seventh FBI investigation that has looked deeply into Brett Kavanaugh's personal conduct. He was once Staff Secretary to the President of the United States and at the highest level of security clearance this country gives, one that gave him access to America's nuclear codes. He got that clearance because the FBI spoke at length to a cross-section of everyone he'd ever met, going back to high school and earlier, and there were no hints of sexual assaults, none. There's nothing left to investigate here, everyone knows that, this is a political tactic, and is disingenuous. Why are they doing it? Well, simple, Democrats know that if the vote on Brett Kavanaugh has held soon, he will be confirmed. If it is delayed by pointless FBI investigations being demanded by demagogues in bad faith, he will not be confirmed, because the accusations will never end. The incentive to make them is too strong. You'll see more anonymous claims that he led gang rapes on sailboats in Rhode Island or whatever, and this grotesque circus will continue. Our ancient standards of justice will further degrade with the help of the Senate Democratic Conference. But Democrats will retain power and that is the point, is the only point of all of this. But for now, and until and if that happens, no Republican Senator who watched Brett Kavanaugh testify today is likely to vote against him. Those who did would be quickly punished by voters. Many viewers at home wept as they watched Kavanaugh speak today, maybe you did as you saw it. Those of us who have been falsely accused of sexual assault by strangers understood well the feeling of terror and loneliness that's shown on Kavanaugh's face. Prove you didn't do it or everything you have will be taken from you by force. That's not an easy task for anyone. Kavanaugh came as close as a man can to clearing his own name. He didn't get a lot of help from Senate Republicans other than Lindsey Graham. The next time you're falsely accused of a crime, don't ask them for backup. Brett Kavanaugh did it all himself; he had no choice. As his life collapsed around him, he stood bravely and he spoke clearly and it's hard to imagine a fiercer test of a man's character than that. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume breaks down political implications of the Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. We're going to be considering all for the next hour what happened in the Senate today and its implications, but we're going to begin fittingly with Fox senior political analyst Brit Hume, who spent all day covering this story. You were on the set from 9:45 this morning until now. What was that experience like, as someone who's watched a lot of Senate hearings?"

      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, it was personally distressing to me that we even got to this point, where we had to - where these squalid allegations came after the matter was essentially closed, and he had to respond to it in such a way that he had to try to prove a negative, which is virtually impossible to do. And then, as I rather anticipated, came her testimony which was emotional as was his and powerful in its way. And I thought to myself, now the burden is even higher on him and the Republicans did next to nothing in the hired questioner they had -- through the hired questioner they had to cast doubt on her testimony. And politically speaking, that might have been wise. So, it all is up to him, and I was wondering whether he could do it and whether the mild- mannered young man -- young compared to me that he is -- would be effective in this setting under these circumstances. I have to say I think he was extremely effective. I think his emotion, his - at times he was near tears, was -- made his testimony credible. If you're accused, Tucker, and you may know this of something that wrong and is false, it makes you emotional."

So, if you are -- so the audience here really comes down to a handful of Republican Senators who were undecided, at least nominally undecided. It is a little hard to imagine after today's testimony by him that they would turn against him. Remember, these allegations against him were uncorroborated when the day began and they were uncorroborated at the end of the day still. And the only corroborative evidence really that were produced where his old calendars and diaries that he produced. They're not dispositive, but they are something. And so, it comes down to his word against his, and he was, seems to me, at least as credible as she was. So, I think at this point, it's utterly regrettable that we got here. The process has been damaged for years now, it's ruined, and this is where we are. One hopes he may survive it."

But I don't even think this evidence would meet the mere preponderance of evidence standard. It's not even over the 50 percent mark. Maybe there's some more support there.

And this elucidation of the issue of whether or not Ms. Ford or Dr. Ford delayed in her own words coming forward with this information, she said that she knew about Brett Kavanaugh's position on the short list and that she was determined to prevent his nomination. And yet, somehow this PhD was unable to figure out how to call either of her two Senators, both of whom sit on the Judiciary Committee. So I thought Ms. Mitchell did a good job with that. But when it came to asking about the allegations, I was shocked when she told Dr. Ford that she would not be asking her about those allegations at all, and she didn't."

I mean, she established that Christine Ford has flown an awful lot. But I thought what she could have teased out a little bit is why she lied about it in this case. You can't come to Washington to testify, because she can't get on an airplane. This had a politically significant effect, delaying the confirmation of Kavanaugh. That's a lie. Why is nobody saying that?"

Prosecutors like to say, don't ask a question you don't know the answer to, so don't ask a why question. All trained prosecutors know that that's just garbage. You have to ask questions you don't know the answer to, and that's what happens in every trial."

      "utterance": "So, if you've been watching the coverage of the Kavanaugh nomination over the past ten days or so, especially in other channels, but not exclusively, you might have noticed something a little strange about the coverage repeatedly. Reporters and on-air analysts have interjected the question of race into this story. And that's odd because it's not a racial story. Everyone involved is the same color. And yet, again and again, you see people use this story as a pretext for denouncing an entire race of people. We're going to remind you something you probably already knew. That's the definition of racism and yet it's everywhere."

Hundreds of thousands of us died fighting to make sure that our skin color would not matter, that we rejected that notion. And now in the 21st century, the Democrats who have nothing to argue with, who have been rejected on the issues of principles, on the foundation of legislation, on ideas, they have failed. They've damaged this country. We're bringing it back and what they're trying to do is appeal to the worst part of us."

Maybe ultimately our age, certainly gender, and this is -- everything with Kavanaugh certainly, and maybe that's why the liberals have been inspired to go even further, has been about the worst in what they want from people, arguing for divisions, looking for these emotional buttons to have people certainly be upset to not trust their neighbor or even themselves, to really look at America again as being evil. This now is what the Democrats have become. We saw it on display today, we've seen it destroy -- I don't think it's destroyed Judge Kavanaugh yet. Obviously Dr. Ford's life has changed forever.

So, how do you break the tie? I think one way is to look for corroboration and he has much more corroboration on his side. Now, the best way to make sure that corroboration is accurate is for the committee to call the other witnesses and let the FBI continue its background check.

For example, the main issue now is whether or not she recognized Kavanaugh correctly. She was never asked whether how well she knew him, how many times she encountered him before this, how close was their relationship. There was nothing that could raise questions about whether even if she believes she's telling the truth, she may have misidentified.

And the hurdles that you have to overcome in a defamation claim as a plaintiff are incredibly high. And Dean Eramo, to her credit, she was brave, she brought those claims and she hired us.
