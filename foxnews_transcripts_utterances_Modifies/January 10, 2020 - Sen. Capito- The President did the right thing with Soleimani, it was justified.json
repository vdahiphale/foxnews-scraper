And he did talk at length this morning, an event in the Roosevelt Room. But, at the moment, a heated debate going on, on the House floor over this war powers resolution that Democrats have introduced to try to clip the president's wings when it comes to taking future military action against Iran, if the president deems that necessary.

Nobody should mourn the loss or the death of someone with the blood of U.S. soldiers on his hands. He was a terrorist. In the immediate aftermath of that killing, though, I, along with many members of Congress, came out and said, it matters what happens tomorrow. In the event of an inevitable Iranian retaliation -- and at that point -- we didn't know what it would look like, we were not interested, no one should be interested in war, unless you have to go with war. And I was encouraged, encouraged by the fact that the president de- escalated the situation. And so now here we find ourselves -- and I do not believe that what this calls for is a political messaging document. Instead, what we have to do, in a bipartisan fashion, is talk about separation of powers, talk about revising these authorizations for the use of military force, which are more than 20 years old or nearly 20 years old. We have serious questions to consider. This is not the way to do it.",

And, also, may I -- may I say that, when we're looking at men and women in uniform, you can't one day talk about assaults on our institutions, trusting people, trusting people, and then the next day not trust people. But, with that being said, that is a matter of assaulting, killing a terrorist. Now we have real questions of war and peace. But those questions have to be dealt with through looking at the authorization for the use of military force, looking at congressional appropriations for long-term and protracted wars. Shouldn't be dealt with messaging documents and straight-up politics. Congress is not a rapid-response P.R. agency. It is a serious body, and we have got to treat it as such.",

And now here we are not too long after. I will never play politics with a decision like this. So people can say what they want. I do not care.

The Ukrainian civilian airliner with 176 people on board crashed two minutes after takeoff while still in its ascent. On radar, it easily could have been mistaken for an incoming missile. The SA-15 and air defense systems like it have a manual and automatic mode. If in automatic mode, it could have fired without a human being ordering the strike. The Iranians would likely turn on their missile defense systems expecting a U.S. response. Protecting its airport in strategic locations in Tehran would be expected. The Iranian authorities have been unwilling to hand over the black box recovered from the wreckage of the relatively new Boeing 737 passenger jet. And there were no radio calls from the cockpit before the plane suddenly fell out of the sky, suggesting an explosion. Iran's head of civil aviation, meantime, dismissed these reports, calling them illogical rumors.

It looks to be the starboard or right side is on fire. But what's interesting, it's not just an engine fire. We see actual debris and flames trailing from the airplane before the impact. The elevation of the Tehran Airport is a little over 3,000 feet. They lost radar contact with the airplane and about 7,900 feet. So we know the plane gained about 5,000 feet in altitude over the two to three minutes that it was airborne. But if we were to believe what the Iranian officials have wanted to, to sell us, that this was an engine fire, it would be beyond rare that that would actually take down an airplane. These engines are built -- this engine was only three-and-a-half years old -- to keep a fire contained. Even if we had an uncontained engine catastrophe, the chances of it bringing down the whole aircraft is so rare. Another thing I want to point out is that Iranian officials keep making a lot about the supposed to turn that the aircraft made, that the aircraft was turning back to the airplane (sic), meaning that the pilots knew they had an engine failure, they were following standard protocol, which is in most scenarios, if you have an engine fire -- failure after takeoff, you would turn back to the airport. But if you look at it, the airplane really only turned 15 or 20 degrees, and that doesn't mean it was at all intentional by the pilots. It could have just been due to an explosion, which, in this case, we're getting more and more evidence looks like it was a surface-to-air missile.",

Talk to workers at Lordstown and other places around the state, we have had large layoffs. Steel is struggling. And a lot of this is just self-inflicted wounds by the president. This crazy trade war that changes by tweet every few weeks is really hurting people in Ohio. And so, yes, we were part of a broad recovery that began in 2010. But the president has come in and his -- between the tax scam that incentivized jobs going elsewhere and this wild trade war, where he's taken away the buyers of Ohio soybeans and driven up prices, a lot of Ohio economy suffers. If you want to really do damage to the Ohio economy, you go after manufacturing, you go after farmers. And that's exactly what the president's policies have done. So, again, we're about to see our first year of loss of jobs since 2009, and for no reason whatsoever, except the self-inflicted wounds from Washington.",

And he did talk at length this morning, an event in the Roosevelt Room. But, at the moment, a heated debate going on, on the House floor over this war powers resolution that Democrats have introduced to try to clip the president's wings when it comes to taking future military action against Iran, if the president deems that necessary.

Nobody should mourn the loss or the death of someone with the blood of U.S. soldiers on his hands. He was a terrorist. In the immediate aftermath of that killing, though, I, along with many members of Congress, came out and said, it matters what happens tomorrow. In the event of an inevitable Iranian retaliation -- and at that point -- we didn't know what it would look like, we were not interested, no one should be interested in war, unless you have to go with war. And I was encouraged, encouraged by the fact that the president de- escalated the situation. And so now here we find ourselves -- and I do not believe that what this calls for is a political messaging document. Instead, what we have to do, in a bipartisan fashion, is talk about separation of powers, talk about revising these authorizations for the use of military force, which are more than 20 years old or nearly 20 years old. We have serious questions to consider. This is not the way to do it."

Qasem Soleimani has killed so many soldiers, injured so many others. I think about people I served with in Afghanistan who this man nearly killed. So, yes, I understand that. And, also, may I -- may I say that, when we're looking at men and women in uniform, you can't one day talk about assaults on our institutions, trusting people, trusting people, and then the next day not trust people. But, with that being said, that is a matter of assaulting, killing a terrorist. Now we have real questions of war and peace. But those questions have to be dealt with through looking at the authorization for the use of military force, looking at congressional appropriations for long-term and protracted wars. Shouldn't be dealt with messaging documents and straight-up politics. Congress is not a rapid-response P.R. agency. It is a serious body, and we have got to treat it as such."

I'm in a patriotic district, voted for Donald Trump in 2016, and then voted for Max Rose in 2018. When the impeachment inquiry and impeachment decision was being made, I said one thing over and over and over again. And that was, this is the second most consequential decision I could ever, ever have to deal with as a member of Congress, the first being the decisions of war and peace. And now here we are not too long after. I will never play politics with a decision like this. So people can say what they want. I do not care. What I do care about, though, is keeping America safe, and treating our men and women in uniform with both the respect that they deserve, as well as treating them as the most potent natural resource that we have, not to be unnecessarily sent into war, but also not to be unnecessarily constrained."

We had the secretary of state, secretary of defense, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the head of the CIA, that I believe gave me enough adequate information, more than adequate information, to know that there was an impending issue that Soleimani was working on.

I mean, there are plenty of things on our plate that we should be and could be doing. But we're in a waiting game now with some kind of weird strategy that the speaker's employed.

He hasn't been given the right to make a defense for himself over on the House side. We need to hear that. And then we're going to have questions that we're going to offer, just like was done in the Clinton trial -- or impeachment trial. And so, when we get to that point, then we will vote on witnesses. But you know what? We're going to have plenty of votes on how many, what testimony, what other kinds of information we need to have.

      "utterance": "The missile that brought down the plane was fired from an SA-15 Gauntlet mobile missile defense launcher. That missile defense system would have likely been put on alert to defend against a possible U.S. response to the Iranian missile strike targeting Americans in Iraq. The SA-15 and other Russian-made missile systems are programmed to lock onto anything metal that looks like a missile. The Ukrainian civilian airliner with 176 people on board crashed two minutes after takeoff while still in its ascent. On radar, it easily could have been mistaken for an incoming missile. The SA-15 and air defense systems like it have a manual and automatic mode. If in automatic mode, it could have fired without a human being ordering the strike. The Iranians would likely turn on their missile defense systems expecting a U.S. response. Protecting its airport in strategic locations in Tehran would be expected. The Iranian authorities have been unwilling to hand over the black box recovered from the wreckage of the relatively new Boeing 737 passenger jet. And there were no radio calls from the cockpit before the plane suddenly fell out of the sky, suggesting an explosion. Iran's head of civil aviation, meantime, dismissed these reports, calling them illogical rumors. But U.S. officials who are seeing an intelligence picture emerge based on satellite and infrared imagery and intercepts now suggest otherwise, Neil."

      "utterance": "We do know that, for the first two minutes of the flight, it wasn't uneventful, the standard takeoff, then some sort of catastrophic event.   So it does point to an explosion of some sort. We do know people saw flames as it was crashing back to earth, fell into many, many pieces. What are we to glean from all of that? What do you glean from that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BANGS",
      "utterance": "Well, we're really fortunate that we have that video, which many people have seen, I'm sure you have seen it, that shows in the early pre- dawn hours, so it's still dark, it shows that jet coming out of the sky. It looks to be the starboard or right side is on fire. But what's interesting, it's not just an engine fire. We see actual debris and flames trailing from the airplane before the impact. The elevation of the Tehran Airport is a little over 3,000 feet. They lost radar contact with the airplane and about 7,900 feet. So we know the plane gained about 5,000 feet in altitude over the two to three minutes that it was airborne. But if we were to believe what the Iranian officials have wanted to, to sell us, that this was an engine fire, it would be beyond rare that that would actually take down an airplane. These engines are built -- this engine was only three-and-a-half years old -- to keep a fire contained. Even if we had an uncontained engine catastrophe, the chances of it bringing down the whole aircraft is so rare. Another thing I want to point out is that Iranian officials keep making a lot about the supposed to turn that the aircraft made, that the aircraft was turning back to the airplane (sic), meaning that the pilots knew they had an engine failure, they were following standard protocol, which is in most scenarios, if you have an engine fire -- failure after takeoff, you would turn back to the airport. But if you look at it, the airplane really only turned 15 or 20 degrees, and that doesn't mean it was at all intentional by the pilots. It could have just been due to an explosion, which, in this case, we're getting more and more evidence looks like it was a surface-to-air missile."

What's going to happen is, it's going to go to the agencies that would investigate this, like the NTSB. And they have made quite a bit about saying that the Iranians aren't cooperating with the Americans. But Iran put out a statement through ICAO today, which is an international airline organization, saying that they are willing to work with the NTSB, they have said they're interested in possibly working with the European countries such as Sweden, and that they are going to work with Canada."

Here in Toledo, Ohio, we are in Lucas County, which Hillary Clinton actually won in 2016. But we're just south of the Michigan border and Detroit. So the president's campaign is likely hoping to have an impact on voters here in Ohio and then those who might have decided to make the short drive from the -- Detroit or state of Michigan. And as far as the economy goes here in Northwestern Ohio, this is a region of blue-collar workers, hardworking Americans.

I think unemployment, which was a little over 5 percent when he took office, has been sliced more than a point, and manufacturing activity, even with some of the volatile shifts, is up from what it was when he took office. In other words, things are better in the Buckeye State than when he came into office. You don't agree?"

This -- 2019 will be the first year that Ohio has lost jobs since the Great Recession in 2009. Talk to our soybean farmers. Talk to manufacturers. Talk to workers at Lordstown and other places around the state, we have had large layoffs. Steel is struggling. And a lot of this is just self-inflicted wounds by the president. This crazy trade war that changes by tweet every few weeks is really hurting people in Ohio. And so, yes, we were part of a broad recovery that began in 2010. But the president has come in and his -- between the tax scam that incentivized jobs going elsewhere and this wild trade war, where he's taken away the buyers of Ohio soybeans and driven up prices, a lot of Ohio economy suffers. If you want to really do damage to the Ohio economy, you go after manufacturing, you go after farmers. And that's exactly what the president's policies have done. So, again, we're about to see our first year of loss of jobs since 2009, and for no reason whatsoever, except the self-inflicted wounds from Washington."

So I guess what I'm going to ask you is, do Ohioans, especially farmers, look at the deal that will be signed next week with China and the deal we have with the Mexicans and the Canadians as changing that, and the president will be responsible for that?"

      "speaker": "PEPPER",

But I can -- all I can tell you is, we were -- I was at a town hall meeting with fourth- and fifth-generation soybean farmers and dairy farmers a few months ago before our debate. And they basically said, they believe their customers are gone, that China is now buying soybeans from Russia and South America. And it's not as if they're just going to shift back and come back to all the Ohio farmers. Obviously, I hope that's not the case. But what they said to us is, they worry their customers have basically gone somewhere else because of this trade war, and won't come back. And when you're living year to year as a farmer, that's a terrible thing to think about. Hopefully, there is good news. Every week, we hear about a new trade deal with China, but it never seems to happen. But, no, these farmers are concerned they have lost their customers for good."

But, clearly, she's getting ready and she's feeling pressure from fellow Democrats in the House and in the Senate. And I think she's -- I think she's ready to -- getting ready to send them over."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, among them, Blumenthal of Connecticut, Feinstein of -- certainly of California, Joe Manchin saying that in West Virginia. So she is feeling the pressure. I'm just wondering, though, her strategy is what? Is it just to show, all right, this process in the Senate is very, very spotty? But I'm wondering if she's helping her cause, when Republicans can come back and say, well, you're withholding your constitutional duty to get this into the Senate, hurts her?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I have really never understood the strategy from the beginning of what the benefit to Democrats would be. And, really, we haven't really seen this. I mean, theoretically, she had leverage over the Senate, but that didn't really work out. And so the only thing that has really happened over the last couple weeks is that it's sort of -- it's undermined the House Democrats' case that impeachment was such an urgent nature, they needed to get it done, they needed to move quickly because it was protecting our democracy. And then they sort of hit the pause button on it. So I'm not sure what Democrats have gained, and it seems that they have lost or least undermined that argument to a certain degree."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "When it gets to the Senate or whenever soon is, to your point, I'm wondering how far they pursue this potential witness thing, where John Bolton, of course, is that, if subpoenaed, he would testify. There are other names that are mentioned. All you need is about four Republicans to go along with that, assuming all 47 Democrats push the issue, and then you will have witnesses. Now, there are three that we know of. Do you think the votes are there to kind of force the issue for Mitch McConnell?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a great question. I mean, it is pretty tight. But we have a couple Republicans who may vote in favor of that. But, other than that, I haven't seen anybody. It doesn't seem like there's a huge push to have a bunch of witnesses. We may have a couple. But we will have to wait and see who those are and how that plays out. By and large, I think Republicans and Democrats, quite frankly, especially folks like Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, are going to want to get this thing over, and Amy Klobuchar as well. Get this over in sort of a pretty quick pace, so they can get back out on the campaign trail. And, obviously, Republicans can get back to doing -- doing their business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's what they mean by soon, like real soon. All right, Tom, thank you very, very much. With all of this, and questioning the president's war powers and what he can do and what he can't do, and the timing of impeachment and all of that, and then this plane crash and who was responsible for it and whether the Iranians screwed up, you would think the markets would be at least tense. What if I told you wrong times three? Three major records -- after this."

But every time someone has done that, there have been many, many more who regretted it. And I'm wondering whether there's any stopping that. I mean, I know the backdrop is favorable, the earnings and all of that, that you remind me about, but this is, like, incredible."

Everybody's getting on the bullish side that used to be bearish. I just think there's going to be more to go. And, by the way, the 30000 number is only 3.5 percent away now. I suspect we're going to get through that over time, if not more this year, in an election year, because easy money combined with a good economy, combined with -- I do believe earnings are accelerating. I think there's more to go."

Expensive can become more expensive, and bull markets can last a lot longer than anybody can believe they will last. And all I can tell you, I walk in every day looking for selling by the big money crowd. And they're just not selling and they just continue to bid things up.

There are new reports that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle did talk to the queen after they got back from their Canadian vacation, but she had no idea that they were going to basically pull the trigger, launch this Web site that details how they plan to live their life and announce that they're going to step back from their royal duties. So that apparently came as a big surprise to her. And she has now issued royal aides to figure out a plan of action and a workable solution, because there are still so many unanswered questions about how this whole thing is going to work, like where they're going to live, how they're going to fund their lifestyle, and if they're going to be able to keep their titles."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, it is interesting, because, in their statement, they said North America, so that obviously does include Canada. And all signs right now are pointing to that. But I thought that was pretty surprising, because her mom lives in California, and that's where she grew up. So it could be one or the other. But I think that the way that they're going to fund their lifestyle is pretty interesting, too, because right now, they receive 5 percent of their income through the Sovereign Fund, which is basically U.K. taxpayer money; 95 percent of their money comes from Prince Charles. Basically, dad is giving them money to live. They say that they're going to give up the 5 percent, but keep the 95 percent, also live at Frogmore Cottage, and taxpayer money to fund their security. So that doesn't really sound like financial independence to me,"
