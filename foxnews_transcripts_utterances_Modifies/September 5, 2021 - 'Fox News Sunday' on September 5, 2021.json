And Mr. Putin himself, you know, stared down our president at the summit and said you cannot build ISR intelligence capabilities in the region. The problem is, Chris, we are -- we've gone dark. When Bagram went down, when we turned it over to the Afghan partners , now in Taliban hands, with all the cash and weaponry, when our embassy went down, we went dark. We have no eyes and ears in country and we can't see Russia, China, and Iran.  This is a major national security threat. I warned the administration for months to get the Americans out, but also establish this ISR capability, which we have none now. Now we're left in this very desperate situation, a very bad foreign policy of having to negotiate with the Taliban, which I always -- I was always skeptical of having to do.

So there's no doubt in my mind that people who are in nursing homes, people who are frail elders, people with chronic diseases, people with immunocompromised states, they need to be getting that third shot probably about six month after their second child.

Jonah, there is quite a debate going on inside conservative circles about the developments this week with the Supreme Court. I think it's fair to say that pro-life groups are thrilled at the idea that a law banning abortions at about six weeks is in the books, but there are other conservatives concerned about the general precedents beyond abortion, this idea of laws that would deputize private citizens to police various kinds of behavior. JONAH GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE DISPATCH\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's exactly right. I mean what a lot of people don't understand is this SBA was essentially designed almost in a lab like a special key to unlock the defenses against lawsuits that affect abortion vis-a-vis Roe v. Wade. And it could cut out -- set up all sorts of troubling precedents if this tactic of sort of going around normal injunctive relief and deputizing citizens becomes more widespread. The other issue that is causing a dispute among conservatives and pro- lifers is that there are a lot of people who think that the Dobbs decision coming -- the Dobbs case coming out of Mississippi, which is already on the docket, which is a traditional frontal assault on Roe, has pretty good chances and this may muddy the waters in all sorts of ways and allows a lot of abortion supporters to essentially work the refs for a very long time against the Supreme Court.",

But now you have the Texas law, which is on the books, which bans abortions around six weeks.

It essentially created the pro-life movement. It became the galvanizing principle of the Republican Party in many respects and there are a lot of Republican voters who probably are in favor of some sort of compromise on abortion but feel comfortable voting for Republicans because they think Roe v. Wade is there to stay. If it goes away, that could -- that could upset everything. It's worth pointing out, though, look at the Democrats in Texas. We heard so much about the voting rights bill coming out of Texas. They -- you know, they fled to Washington. They headed (ph) all this press. This bill was passed in May. Democrats in Texas said nothing about it. And that also points to the fact that black and Hispanic voters, they're all unified on the issue of voting rights. They're not all unified on the issue of abortion. Getting rid of Roe wouldn't end abortion in America but it would completely overturn our political assumptions about American politics.",

      "speaker": "CRISWELL",
      "utterance": "The focus that I really want to help FEMA move towards is focusing on reducing the impacts that we're seeing from these. We will continue to respond to these threats and these events as they happen, but we have to start investing in reducing the impacts that we're seeing from these.

      "speaker": "CRISWELL",
      "utterance": "No, you're right, Chris, but this is a start. We have to start somewhere and so this money is more than FEMA has ever been able to put out before and we're going to continue to work on trying to find additional funding. The Building Resilient Infrastructure in Communities Grant Program that was authorized by the Disaster Recovery Resilience Act is going to continue to give us larger amounts of money than we've ever had before. This is a start. We do have a long way to go and a lot of investment that needs to be made."
    },

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

I have to say, I studied a lot of stuff what's in it but I didn't particularly study things that would help in terms of climate change. Are there elements in that bipartisan infrastructure plan that would protect parts of the country from extreme weather?"
    },

      "speaker": "CRISWELL",
      "utterance": "To my understanding, there are parts of that plan that are going to also contribute and add additional funding to the mitigation efforts, but the other part of that plan is helping to strengthen our infrastructure in general. We have a very old infrastructure across this country and we need to work on rebuilding that, building it back stronger so it can be more resilient to these future threats."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

Now it's being held up in the House with a debate over another $3 trillion plan. If climate change and if weather extremes are such a clear and present danger, would you like to see -- even if you pass the bill today, it's going to take a while to get shovels in the ground -- would you like to see this infrastructure plan pass sooner rather than later so that you can get going on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRISWELL",
      "utterance": "Now, the mitigation projects that need to be done, they are going to take time. We do need to start, though, right now, planning for what those projects are going to be and learning where we're going to invest our money to make sure that we are creating a more resilient infrastructure, more resilient communities. We've already started at FEMA with the $5 billion. This is just going to add additional capacity for us to really focus on the areas that need to be strengthened, because these threats aren't going to go away and we need to start to reduce those impacts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I want to ask your final question, less as the FEMA administrator and more as somebody who's dealt with a lot of these issues a long time. You've had quite a career. You spent 21 years as a firefighter in Colorado. You spent two years as the emergency management administrator in New York City. You've been the FEMA administrator since April. Is this country prepared for the worsening effects of climate change? Could -- you know, you hear about coastal areas that may be swamped. Could this country be transformed if we don't get a handle on climate change over the next decade?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRISWELL",
      "utterance": "You know, what I would say is it's an emergency management system. It takes everybody from the local, state, and federal level to make sure that we are working collectively to ensure we're ready for the disasters that come. So it's a combination of making sure that we're ready and we rely on each other to respond to these events, but also working together to invest in reducing the impacts. The only way that we're going to be able to continue to respond to this large number of weather events that we're seeing is to start to reduce the impacts that we're seeing from them."

And that was a promise that the president made. I've said all along, this resident has blood on his hands. And, this week, this last week, we had 13 service men and women come home, flag draped coffins at Dover Airbase. This problem's going to get worse, not better, and it's -- we have left them behind.

We know the reason why is because the Taliban want something in exchange. This is really, Chris, turning into a hostage situation where they're not going to allow American citizens to leave until they get full recognition from the United States of America. My concern is that Zalmay Khalilzad or special envoy who's met with the Taliban, they're in talks right now and I think -- I -- I worry his recommendation to the administration will be to recognize the Taliban as the official government of the United States, a Taliban organization that is a terrorist organization."

Remember, they had a perimeter around the airport itself. The interpreters couldn't get through that perimeter. Most Americans did. Some got blocked by our own U.S. government at the airport. The State Department wholly failed in this evacuation and we had to rely on groups like Operation Task Forces like Pineapple and Dunkirk, who I implore the State Department to work with to help get these Americans and interpreters left behind out. But the retaliation has been severe, Chris. You have stories of interpreters being taken home to their families and watching, you know, their wives and families being beheaded, executed before they execute the interpreter. This is not a new and improved Taliban. This is the same old Taliban. They're reverting back to the same brutal practices. And, you know, there was reports also -- I was on the phone last weekend with top officials at DOD and State trying to get 250 orphaned girls, Afghan orphaned girls, from the university --from the music -- you know, they're musicians, out of the country, had visas and our own U.S. government would not open the gate to let them in. Now they've returned and now they're under -- in Taliban's enslavement. And we know that they marry off young women as young as 12, many times 14 years old. It's a very sick culture and they treat women like property. I worry about the women left behind as well."

And Mr. Putin himself, you know, stared down our president at the summit and said you cannot build ISR intelligence capabilities in the region. The problem is, Chris, we are -- we've gone dark. When Bagram went down, when we turned it over to the Afghan partners , now in Taliban hands, with all the cash and weaponry, when our embassy went down, we went dark. We have no eyes and ears in country and we can't see Russia, China, and Iran. This is a major national security threat. I warned the administration for months to get the Americans out, but also establish this ISR capability, which we have none now. Now we're left in this very desperate situation, a very bad foreign policy of having to negotiate with the Taliban, which I always -- I was always skeptical of having to do. And, yes, we do have frozen assets. That's the only leverage we have left because we have no military on the ground and we have no intelligence capability on the ground."

How do you assess the terror threat from Afghanistan now that the Taliban is completely in control, and how do you assess our ability to deal with that terror threat from over the horizon?"

It's a landlocked country surrounded by our enemies, Russia, China, Iran, who have now been emboldened by this foreign policy, you know, blunder. So, you know, how do we -- how do we go forward? I think we have to establish that ISR. You know, somewhere over the horizon capability means flying from a gulf, probably countries like Qatar, which would be, you know, anywhere from six to eight hours, having to fly, you know, around Iran, over Pakistan, get refueling. This is not -- when I talk to anybody in the military, they tell me this is not adequate for us to have ISR capability. What we need to see, eyes and ears on the ground to see the threat so that we can respond to the threat and eliminate it. We don't have that capability anymore.

But, Doctor, the -- the upward curve, the sharp upward curve has flattened out a little bit of new cases, new infections, deaths. Has -- the curve has flattened a little bit.

That said, I do think we are peaking, particularly across the American south where I see cases in Florida and Louisiana, Arkansas, starting to turn down.

We have after every major holiday over the last year and a half, so I would not be surprised. But we have so many more tools now then we've ever had before. Certainly vaccines are one of them. More testing, mask wearing in key places. There's a lot we can do to prevent that kind of horrible surge that would have happened maybe last year given that when we didn't have all these tools."

Doctor, the FDA and the CDC still haven't approved a full booster program. It's become clear that even if they do, that we're not going to start seeing Moderna boosters on September 20th. And, this week, two top vaccine regulators at the FDA resigned. And according to some sources, part of it was because they felt that we're getting ahead of ourselves. President Biden promised that he wasn't going to let politics, he wasn't going to get -- let the White House get ahead of the science. Is he doing that right now with these boosters?"

We can also look at Israel and their experience. And where the data and the science is, I think pretty clear on a couple of things. One is, it is clear to me that this is probably going to end up being a three shot vaccine package and so the idea of a third shot as part of how you get fully vaccinated is something we're learning and it's probably right particularly for vulnerable people. So there's no doubt in my mind that people who are in nursing homes, people who are frail elders, people with chronic diseases, people with immunocompromised states, they need to be getting that third shot probably about six month after their second child. That's where the science and data is. No doubt we want the FDA to fully approve that. We want the CDC to approve it. We don't want to get ahead of the process. But the evidence for vulnerable people needing a third shot I think is coming into focus at this point."

I think -- what I suspect is happening is the White House is looking at the data from Israel. They've got their experts like Dr. Fauci. And basically saying this is where we need to head and beginning to communicate that. I agree with your point though that it's absolutely essential that the FDA and CDC also approve any such thing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JHA",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is unnecessarily political and I don't really understand why it has become so. What I say about kids and masking is that the evidence clearly leans towards the masking being helpful in preventing infections, precenting spread. It's not bomb (ph) proof. The evidence is -- is strong but not, I would say, overwhelming. But the bottom line is that it should be part of a broader package. If you just do masking, probably not enough. But if we have testing in schools, if we improve ventilation, we get adults vaccinated, it is absolutely possible to get every child back to school full time safely this fall. We shouldn't be turning these things into political battles. We should be looking at the data and then driving policy based on that."

And when large outbreaks are happening around the world, we're going to see more variants. And, of course, the best way to suppress it is to get the world vaccinated. I am not particularly worried about Mu or Lambda, any of these yet. We've got to follow the data. The data so far doesn't say they're going to escape our vaccines. Obviously something we are concerned about. I think our vaccines are going to hold up but we're going to have to pay attention to the data."

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg of \"The Dispatch,\" Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford. Jonah, there is quite a debate going on inside conservative circles about the developments this week with the Supreme Court. I think it's fair to say that pro-life groups are thrilled at the idea that a law banning abortions at about six weeks is in the books, but there are other conservatives concerned about the general precedents beyond abortion, this idea of laws that would deputize private citizens to police various kinds of behavior. JONAH GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE DISPATCH\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's exactly right. I mean what a lot of people don't understand is this SBA was essentially designed almost in a lab like a special key to unlock the defenses against lawsuits that affect abortion vis-a-vis Roe v. Wade. And it could cut out -- set up all sorts of troubling precedents if this tactic of sort of going around normal injunctive relief and deputizing citizens becomes more widespread. The other issue that is causing a dispute among conservatives and pro- lifers is that there are a lot of people who think that the Dobbs decision coming -- the Dobbs case coming out of Mississippi, which is already on the docket, which is a traditional frontal assault on Roe, has pretty good chances and this may muddy the waters in all sorts of ways and allows a lot of abortion supporters to essentially work the refs for a very long time against the Supreme Court."

Court precedents right now prohibits states from banning abortions prior to fetal viability, that's roughly 22-24 weeks into pregnancy. But now you have the Texas law, which is on the books, which bans abortions around six weeks. And, as you mentioned, Jonah, the court will hear a Mississippi case this term to ban abortions after 15 weeks. Harold, how much trouble is the precedent of Roe v. Wade, which basically protects women's' rights to have an abortion -- stated women's rights to have an abortion, at least up until viability, how much trouble is Roe v. Wade in right now?"

I do think Chief Justice Roberts, whose respect for precedent is not only long-admired by some, but is certainly established. I think politics of this, unfortunately is just so bad on one side for Democrats and perhaps good on the other. Bad in that there are Democrats fuming still over the way some of the Supreme Court justices were rushed through the system. But the other side, as you have a Virginia governor's race and you have a speaker of the House where this issue -- this issue is going to play prominently. And as you look at some of the opponents of the Texas law, I would agree with Jonah's assessment of muddying the waters, even -- even those who oppose Roe -- which I don't -- but those who oppose Roe have issues with this Texas law. And, again, you've already seen it playing out in the Virginia governor's race with Terry McAuliffe making it clear his support for reproductive rights and trying to highlight his opponent's maybe desire to do what Governor Abbott has done in Texas if he's elected."

Normally you would enjoin an attorney general or a local prosecutor from enforcing the law. Much harder to do one private citizens have been deputized and none of them have enforced the law yet.

CATHERINE LUCEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\" : Well, you saw, Chris, certainly strong words there from the president, you know, saying this is un-American. You know, they're -- they're looking at this in a couple of ways. In terms of the policy, the White House has said they are conducting a sort of government-wide review on anything they can do in this moment and that involves the Department of Justice, Health and Human Services. They've been meeting with, you know, abortion advocates and they are trying to figure out if there's any next steps they can take from the -- from the administration. We'll have to see what that unfolds. You know, that, obviously, is a complicated process. In terms of the politics, you know, I've heard from the White House and from Democrats, you know, they do see this as a really major issue now going into the midterms next year. They really think this could galvanize women, particularly women in suburban areas, some of those key congressional districts Democrats would need to hold the House. And you've seen that, as Harold mentioned, you know, already playing out in races around the country like in Virginia where, you know, Democrat Terry McAuliffe is talking about how, you know, if a Republican is elected, you know, this -- this too could happen in Virginia. So they really see this as a strong issue. And I think you're going to hear a lot more from them on that."

But if the right to an abortion is lost or if it's severely restricted, I wonder if the politics of this issue doesn't change dramatically and it animates -- if they fear that they're losing it or they've lost it, animates the pro- choice side a lot more."

      "utterance": "I think it's a very good question. I don't think anybody can really appreciate how distorting and influential Roe v. Wade has been for the last 50 years of American politics. It essentially created the pro-life movement. It became the galvanizing principle of the Republican Party in many respects and there are a lot of Republican voters who probably are in favor of some sort of compromise on abortion but feel comfortable voting for Republicans because they think Roe v. Wade is there to stay. If it goes away, that could -- that could upset everything. It's worth pointing out, though, look at the Democrats in Texas. We heard so much about the voting rights bill coming out of Texas. They -- you know, they fled to Washington. They headed (ph) all this press. This bill was passed in May. Democrats in Texas said nothing about it. And that also points to the fact that black and Hispanic voters, they're all unified on the issue of voting rights. They're not all unified on the issue of abortion. Getting rid of Roe wouldn't end abortion in America but it would completely overturn our political assumptions about American politics."

But in a practical sense, how much can the Biden administration or the very slim Democratic majorities in Congress do? I mean it seems to me the obvious things are either you, one, codify Roe v. Wade, you make it a law of the land, or, two, you expand the court so you have a different set of judges. But unless you kill the filibuster, you can't do either of those things."

And then, of course, could catalyze a bunch of -- and provoke a lot of discussion politically. Do you try to expand the court? And to your point, do you codify? What seems like the codifying -- the codifying effort or path is going to be pursued but it probably fails in the Senate because President Biden is not -- is not -- has said he is not going to end the filibuster. So, I think politics has created the problem. Politics will likely give us some solution because if you see a number of Democratic governors elected, re-elected, if you see a number -- if you see the House Democratic majority swell and if you see Democrats take control of the Senate with even greater -- with a bigger majority, I think that people will have spoken.

He was a Navy SEAL for 37 years, then took command of the U.S. Special Forces that rescued Captain Phillips, capturing Saddam Hussein, and took down Osama bin Laden. In his new book, \"The Hero Code,\" McRaven offers a blueprint for finding the hero in each of us."

And he went on to make this very compassionate and this passionate plea to General Abizaid (ph) to get some C-130s in order to bring the school supplies to the children. And you could see the entire tenor of the room change when you see this compassion come forward. This great, again, noble quality, it really changes everything about, you know, your -- your own internal belief in the humanity of man."

And she looks me in the eye and she says, sir, I have a job to do. You are not on the list of approved people to enter. Well, about 10 minutes later, you know, we get the word and we passed through. Well, on the way back, we come back through the same gate. I stopped. I get out of the car and I said, airman, do you know that I was 10 minutes late briefing the president of the United States? Yes, sir. And I said, you can come work for me anytime. And then she said something to me. She said, sir, I was just doing my duty. Doing your duty in life and doing it to the best of your ability is important. It is a noble virtue. It is a noble quality and I think it's what makes our heroes out there."

And with all the criticism of how we got out of Afghanistan, it's worth remembering that getting bin Laden and degrading al Qaeda was the original objective.
