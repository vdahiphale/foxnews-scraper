And, in fact, I think it's even more important now, because we know, for our communities and our states to recover, a stronger economy and have local businesses and families keep more of what they earn, making sure our companies can compete, creating a simpler tax code, that is all hugely helpful as you're looking for ways to recover and rebuild.",

I'm confident we can do that. And I think we can do that probably in two different steps, one, the more immediate one. This is the discussions we're having right now. But I will tell also you, just like the rest of the year, we have run a parallel track on tax reform.  We have worked through August, even though we have not been there. Our tax teams are working and our principals are talking. And we're meeting with the president Tuesday on this issue as soon as we get back.

Make sure they're tailored to what the community needs, not what Washington or Congress needs. I think we stay within those guardrails, we will be able to deliver first on the timely package that can help with the immediate needs relief, but then, longer term, as these waters recede, as we really get a clear picture of what the rebuilding and recovery will need as we move forward, I'm confident we can do this."
