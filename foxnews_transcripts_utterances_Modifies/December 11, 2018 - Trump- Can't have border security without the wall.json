While Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer pleaded with the president not to have this conversation in front of the cameras.  He said it was better to be transparent.

So, again, the focus here is to ensure that we're making progress. What we do know is that the wall works. We know that where you have wall that's been built, you've seen a dramatic decrease in terms of illegal crossings. In addition to that, we need to make sure that our border agents have the resources they need to deal with the constant influx of illegal immigrants coming into the country.  And this is something that because of the fact that the Democrats never wanted to really fix this problem, and close the legal loopholes like ending catch-and-release, and giving our border agents the authority to detain and move this individuals, it becomes a problem.

Republican Kevin McCarthy of California helped to arrange a Sundar Pichai's appearance on the Hill today and made an opening statement. He joins us now. Congressman McCarthy, good to see you as always. Thanks for being here tonight. What was the biggest takeaway for you today? What's your biggest concern about Google and bias and China? REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-Calif., HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Well, the first thing you have to understand is how powerful Google is. The Wall Street Journal says 90 percent of all searches on the Internet go through Google. Think about that power. And if you end up the amount of information you're gathered, the power of what they have you see, two-thirds of all adults get their information from the internet, and Google also owns YouTube. So there's a -- the thing that concerned me the most, of course, it was privacy, of course, it was political bias, but what really concerned me was the dealings with China, this Dragonfly. Remember in 2010, I give Google a lot of credit. They pulled out of China because they said they did not want a censure the individuals in there, see what they are doing on the Internet. But now they talk about doing Dragonfly. He said they weren't working with the Chinese government but they had 100 engineers working on a long-term project. To have 100 engineers working on a project such as that concerns me about which going forward. And Sundar did not rule out of one day in re-entering China. And remember, when Google was created their motto was do no harm. They took that away a year or so ago, I wonder why.",

And the victim learned about the plea deal by an e-mail from the assistant D.A. who wrote, quote, \"I realize this is not the outcome we had hoped for or that I had originally offered but I tried a similar case last March and lost.\" In accepting the plea, this marks the third time Judge Strother has sentenced a man accused of sexual assault to probation, the judge is aware of the outrage caused by his decision but says comments on social media were, quote, \"not fully informed, misinformed, or totally uninformed.\" The victim's defense attorney says the judge's sentence shows that rape is no longer a crime in Texas.

In August he imposed sanctions on Russian companies that were violating sanctions and helping North Korea evade those sanctions closing off a loophole in the sanctions that were allowing them to pull in hard currency. In November he restarted the small-scale military exercises with South Korea which is taking back something that he had given Kim during the Singapore summit. So what he is doing is, he is willing to talk, he's willing to sit down at the table but he's putting the squeeze on them economically, diplomatically, and he's making clear he's not going to play the game that all of his predecessors did, which is we'll give you, you make some symbolic meaningless concession by blowing up a water tower and we'll give you billions of dollars.

We're going to target retaliatory tariffs against Trump voters, the rural farmers, we are going to go after soybean producers who are Trump voters.

The president has talked about the importance of ensuring that we build the wall, that ICE, and our -- and our custom Border Patrol agents have the resources they need to deal with the crisis on the border. As we've seen, Martha, we've seen illegal crossings up by 90 percent in the past two months."

And Nancy Pelosi sat right there. You know she's the -- obviously, she's going to be most likely the leader in the House. She said, \"You do not have the votes for that Mr. President.” And there is a discussion that a lot of moderate Republicans do not want to take a wall vote."

We need the $5 billion for border security. I mean, again, I think that this is a very critical issue. It's a moment in time that the Democrats have continued to push open borders."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Understood. But I'm just asking about the practicality of getting -- of allowing that to happen or helping to facilitate that in the short time that is left while the White House, and the Senate, and the House, are under Republican control. Is it the White House's view that there are the votes to pass a $5 Billion Bill on the House side, at least, if they push that forward. Do you believe that those votes are indeed there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "I think that the -- again, the White House is working and speaking with the House of Representatives to ensure that we can get the votes there. I know that there's one thing about the president, we've seen the House vote through this before with these types of votes where they have provided the funding for border security. The Senate is also -- Senate Republicans are also pushing for the same thing for $5.02 billion for border security and the wall. And I think Martha, this is -- this is the moment. This is a time where we really have to talk about this critical issue and ensure that we get the necessary funding to deal with the crisis on the border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I would imagine the president is frustrated that he's had -- you know all three arms of power for all of this time and hasn't gotten what he wanted on the Hill on this issue."

      "utterance": "Understood, understood. And he talked about that today. Our reporter at the Pentagon, Jennifer Griffin is saying that the Department of -- that the Defense Department says that they have no plans to build the wall as part of a military project. Your reaction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, again, I think that the key here is that we're first going to focus in on ensuring that we can get the funding out of Congress to be able to build the wall. We know for example that the Department of Homeland Security has already provided funds to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help with the building of the wall. So, again, the focus here is to ensure that we're making progress. What we do know is that the wall works. We know that where you have wall that's been built, you've seen a dramatic decrease in terms of illegal crossings. In addition to that, we need to make sure that our border agents have the resources they need to deal with the constant influx of illegal immigrants coming into the country. And this is something that because of the fact that the Democrats never wanted to really fix this problem, and close the legal loopholes like ending catch-and-release, and giving our border agents the authority to detain and move this individuals, it becomes a problem. And so, we are stuck with what we're seeing on the crisis of border, we need the funding necessary."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me -- let me ask you at this comment Nancy Pelosi made. And we know that in the past, a lot of these individuals have been supportive in 2006 of the Secure Border Act. But -- you know, she came out of the meeting apparently and said this sort of, you know, sassy comment. She said, \"For the president, it's a manhood thing with him. As if manhood can be associated with him.\" She said, \"This wall thing.\" What's your reaction to that, Mercedes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Look, I'm disappointed with the comment. There's no need to belittle this president like she did. It was a personal attack on the president. At the end of the day, our focus is to find a solution to the border crisis. And this president has been committed day one to ensuring that we're able to ensure that we push for legal immigration. That we push for merit-based immigration. Instead of having to deal with the over 700,000 cases out there in terms of illegal immigrants coming in, and in cases that we need to deal with. And so, we have created this overwhelmed immigration system that needs to be fixed."

Put DACA on the table and make them say no to the wall and DACA. #Digin. Senator Lindsey Graham joins me now. Senator, good to have you with us this evening. What did the president say after this rambunctious meeting that we all witnessed in the Oval Office? What did he -- how did he feel about it?"

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.",
      "utterance": "Well, the first thing he asked me, how did I do? I said I thought you did great. I thought you made a very compelling case that you need more wall funding to secure the country. Secure borders is not a manhood thing, it's a national security thing. And here's what's so hypocritical. In February of this year, 44 Democrats including Schumer voted for a bill that had $25 billion for a wall. In 2013, Schumer helped create a bill that I was part of that had $8 billion for a wall, $42 billion for securing the border in other ways. So, they're just -- they want Trump to lose more than they want the country to win. They voted for vast -- large amounts of money to secure the border before, they just don't want to do it for Trump."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, she's got a political problem, the country has a border security problem. Here's what I would tell the president. If they voted for $25 billion in February of this year, insist on $5 billion now. The caravans have created more uncertainty on the border not less. What signal are we sending to the world if we reduce funding for border security and light of increased threats with inviting more caravans? So the president is right. This liberal arrogance has to come to an end. Nancy Pelosi, said, \"I will never put DACA associated with the wall. Well, we did that in February. So, this idea that the president needs to back down doesn't make sense to me.

I've done everything that I can to find a bipartisan solution. This, you'll never convince me that the president's demand for $5 billion to secure our border including a wall is unreasonable. Again, in 2013, Democrats had an $8 billion wall plan. And February 20, of this year, 2018, they all voted for $25 billion for wall and border security. This is all about politics. The president needs to dig in and make them pay a price, they're overpaying -- they're over playing their hand. If I were the president, I would put DACA on the table, and see if they say no to that.

Republican Kevin McCarthy of California helped to arrange a Sundar Pichai's appearance on the Hill today and made an opening statement. He joins us now.

Think about that power. And if you end up the amount of information you're gathered, the power of what they have you see, two-thirds of all adults get their information from the internet, and Google also owns YouTube. So there's a -- the thing that concerned me the most, of course, it was privacy, of course, it was political bias, but what really concerned me was the dealings with China, this Dragonfly. Remember in 2010, I give Google a lot of credit. They pulled out of China because they said they did not want a censure the individuals in there, see what they are doing on the Internet. But now they talk about doing Dragonfly. He said they weren't working with the Chinese government but they had 100 engineers working on a long-term project. To have 100 engineers working on a project such as that concerns me about which going forward. And Sundar did not rule out of one day in re-entering China.

So those technology companies are real concerning to me. My true belief is a free world needs a free and open Internet. So what does Google want to be? Do they want to be part of the free world? The things that China do about re-educating people that they disagree with their religions, monitoring individuals, and remember what China recently came out that they're going to score individuals inside the actions of their own government about whether they can even get on the bus or not.

Kristi Noem, Congresswoman Kristi Noem is now going to become the first woman governor of South Dakota.

Elise Stefanik was the youngest woman ever elected, one of the individuals that I helped from the very beginning in young guns and we want to be able to spread that across the country recruiting more women. We had more than a hundred women run last time. The biggest challenge for a Republican woman is not winning in the general election, it's winning in the primaries and I think that's a place you're going to see an improvement going forward in the next election cycle.

What do you mean by that?"

Adam Schiff is the same individual who before the investigation started two years ago said he had proof of collusion which he never brought forward, which no one has ever found in this process. So Adam is a little different individual when it comes there. Adam, if he believes a campaign finance is an impeachable offense, that is not something that happens. Now, most members don't have a campaign finance problem, but when they do what you have is a fine, much like with you have us -- if you speed and get a ticket, you get a fine in that process. What we're talking about here today is the president actually hired an attorney to solve a problem. When you hire an attorney to solve a problem, you expect them to do it legally.

She claims Phi Delta Theta president Jacob Anderson led her out to a secluded part of the property, forced her to the ground and repeatedly and violently raped her, both orally and vaginally. She says at some point she lost consciousness and woke up face down in her own vomit. She was able to find a friend who took her to a hospital where police say the rape was verified. Jacob Anderson was indicted for sexual assault and the family of the victim says she was told, quote, \"there was enormous amounts of evidence and the conviction was almost sure.\" And now two and a half years after living through hell, the D.A. has decided not to bother even trying to get justice. In fact, after a deal was cut, Jacob Anderson agreed to plead no contest to a charge of unlawful restraint and was sentenced by Judge Ralph Strother to three years of deferred probation, meaning, he won't spend a day in jail, he won't have to register as a sex offender and if he completes probation won't have a criminal record. And the victim learned about the plea deal by an e-mail from the assistant D.A. who wrote, quote, \"I realize this is not the outcome we had hoped for or that I had originally offered but I tried a similar case last March and lost.\" In accepting the plea, this marks the third time Judge Strother has sentenced a man accused of sexual assault to probation, the judge is aware of the outrage caused by his decision but says comments on social media were, quote, \"not fully informed, misinformed, or totally uninformed.\" The victim's defense attorney says the judge's sentence shows that rape is no longer a crime in Texas.

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Well, it's reflective of a broader strategy which is to be tough but willing to talk. I mean, it doesn't get a lot of attention but as you pointed out he just imposed the sanctions on basically three people in Kim Jong-un's inner circle which is obviously not going to make them happy. In August he imposed sanctions on Russian companies that were violating sanctions and helping North Korea evade those sanctions closing off a loophole in the sanctions that were allowing them to pull in hard currency. In November he restarted the small-scale military exercises with South Korea which is taking back something that he had given Kim during the Singapore summit. So what he is doing is, he is willing to talk, he's willing to sit down at the table but he's putting the squeeze on them economically, diplomatically, and he's making clear he's not going to play the game that all of his predecessors did, which is we'll give you, you make some symbolic meaningless concession by blowing up a water tower and we'll give you billions of dollars. Those sanctions are not coming off until North Korea completes says, this is their word, completes the irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of its nuclear weapons, its chemical weapons program, its biological weapons program and its ballistic missiles.

Look, China is an economic predator, they steal our intellectual property, they enforce American companies doing business in China to handover technology. They put both tariff and nontariff barriers that prevent American companies from doing business fairly, competing fairly in dozens of sectors of their economy. And so, what past presidents used to do is they'd file a complaint with the WTO. And what Donald Trump did is he came in and said no, we are not playing that game anymore just like he did with North Korea, and he said we are going to put 10 percent sanctions on $200 billion worth of Chinese product. And by the way, if you don't capitulate, we're going to raise it to 25 percent next year. And the Chinese what they did was thought they were very clever. They went and they decided you know what we're going to do? We're going to target retaliatory tariffs against Trump voters, the rural farmers, we are going to go after soybean producers who are Trump voters. And so, they targeted states like Indiana and Missouri and North Dakota thinking they could help Democrats take back the Senate and give Trump a blow. And instead the rural voters stuck with Trump and they threw the Democratic senators out. So now he's going into the negotiations where China took its kill shot at him, its political kill shot and they failed. And so, he's in a position of strength, and he's telling them he's giving them a message whereas, the markets don't like but what China understands, which is I'm perfectly happy with tariffs. I'll have a deal if you want a deal, we'll do a deal. If you want to do tariffs, I'm a tariff man.

His skepticism even getting the attention of NASA, which you can understand why who responded to the two-time NBA MVP saying this. \"We would love for Mr. Curry to tour the lunar lab at our Johnson Space Center in Houston. We have hundreds of pounds of moon rocks stored there, and the Apollo mission control. During his visit he can see firsthand what we did 50 years ago. In fact, there were six visits by men to the moon between 1969 and 1972.\" Here now Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer at the Franklin Institute. Thank you very much, sir for being here. You know, what goes through your mind when you listen to this sort of chitchat suggesting that the hard work and the failures and the lives lost in the effort to make it to the moon seems to have been lost on someone like this?"

      "speaker": "DERRICK PITTS, CHIEF ASTRONOMER AND PLANETARIUM DIRECTOR, FRANKLIN INSTITUTE",
      "utterance": "Well, the first thing I'll say about it, Martha, is that it's an inflammatory question to begin with, you know. Of course, it's a fact that six crews went to the moon and all the rocks were brought back and it was a huge national effort to make this happen. And we see the outcome of this every day in the various technologies that we use. But what really brings to mind is that this is an area in which we're really not so much talking about Steph Curry himself but we are really talking about what nonbelievers actually do believe. What do they believe? Why do they believe it? And where did they get their information from? Now I can understand what NASA wants to do by inviting Curry to come to the lab and look at the rocks and look at the equipment and all, that sort of stuff. But you know, that's very much like an English-speaking person going to a different country and expecting the non-English speakers better understand English if I speak louder and slower. It's very much like that. It's not that I have to convince Curry that this is what actually happened, I have to find out what it is that the person, those nonbelievers believe, why they believe that and find out, you know, other things along these lines about where they got their information there."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That somehow these conspiracy theories have more gravity with them, so to speak, then reality does. And why they are inclined to believe it. And I just wonder, you know, we live in a moment where there is, you know, A.I. and virtual reality and everything is a green screen, and people are often, you know, have backdrops. I'm actually sitting in New York City right now but I could have a backdrop that looks like New York City and not be here. Is that part of what we are seeing with younger people today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PITTS",
      "utterance": "Yes. A lot of -- a lot of what we are seeing is that we have great capability to create images, you know, digitally without any difficulty at all and we can make things look extraordinarily real. But the real issue is that some time ago we had many fewer really trusted sources of information and we can look along our lifelines and to see all kinds of different sources of trusted information, but nowadays there are innumerable sources of information available to people at the push of a button, at the drop of a hat. You can get to any one of innumerable sources of news. However, you know, those agencies that put out news do not have any obligation to be objective or truthful. They can even drive their own agenda looking for people to support their positions. So, since we know longer have a short number, a very small number of trusted sources, we can believe anything we want. And we very often can choose to believe in someone who says what we want to hear rather than an objective point of view. So, it's really much more about the idea that we need to be able to identify what these trusted sources are and people need to have trusted sources that can be objective."

So, I would be remiss -- before I let you go, why are you, what convinces you that we went to the moon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PITTS",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple things convince me that we went to the moon. First of all, I work for a particular system that has an innumerable number of checks and balances to make sure that what's being presented is actually correct. In fact, the scientific method itself is based on the idea that you crowdsource for people to pull apart your work to check to make sure that it's right, not because they want to prove you wrong but because they want to make sure that your work is correct so that their work that they build on can also be correct. Also, I happened to be around at the time when that, when those missions took place, and I could see what was actually happening at the time as real. The folks that were presented through that particular program weren't around at the time and they also can pick and choose whatever resources they want. Now we could go down the line saying the schools aren't really doing their job but that's just another situation in which you have to have a trusted authority that presents information that you want to accept from that authority if you trust that authority. If you decide you don't want to trust that authority, then you're not going to believe what they say."

It's a problem that could partially traced back to the pope, who has required to formally sign off on all priests being ousted from the priesthood. A process that can take decades. Joining me now, Father Jonathan Morris a Fox News religion analyst who we talk to a lot about these stories, as difficult as they are, it's extremely important. So, explain to everybody why it would be that these priests would still be paid and supported by the diocese and by the contributions that churchgoers put into the basket every week."
