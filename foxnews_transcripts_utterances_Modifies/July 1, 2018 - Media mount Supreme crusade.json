So the attempts to somehow tie this to President Trump or national politics are shameful. But, four of these people were practicing local journalism. They don't have big salaries or TV contracts. But all editors and reporters take risks because they publish things that upset people.  This tragedy reminds us of those very risks. I want to pay tribute to the men and women of Capital Gazette which published the next with this blank editorial page saying \"we are speechless.\"  Also, the media on a war footing over Anthony Kennedy Supreme Court retirement, but many pundits demanding that the Democrats refused to vote this year on a Trump nominee, any Trump nominee as political payback.",

Things got testy during a debate with Democratic strategist Joel Payne who is an African-American. When Bossie said, you're out of your cotton-picking mind, Payne responded that he has some relatives who picked cotton. Fox News called the comments deeply offensive and holy inappropriate. Bossie apologized on Twitter. \"During a heated segment of 'Fox & Friends' today, I should have chosen my words more carefully and never used the offensive phrase that I did. I apologize to Joel Payne, Fox News and its viewers.\" Payne tells me he accepted the apology. Now, I happened to see Bossie just as he was coming out of the studio. And when Payne came over from a separate studio down the hall, Bossie told him in that moment he never heard of him and didn't know he was black. The monitor in Bossie's studio was not tuned to \"Fox & Friends.\" Still, it doesn't let him off the hook and the network has made clear that such language is unacceptable. Fox hasn't commented on the outcome but sources told The Daily Beast that Bossie was suspended for two weeks. Bill Shine, the former co-president of the Fox News is President Trump's pick to oversee communications as deputy chief of staff. Shine spent 20 years at Fox. He was a one-time producer for Sean Hannity who is close to the president. Let's be clear about one thing. Shine who resigned under pressure last year was never accused of sexually harassing anyone. He was accused in some lawsuits involving the late chairman Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly, enabling or failing to act on complaints about alleged misconduct which has strenuously denied. Some critics are already saying this just strengthens the ties between Fox and Trump. But in fairness, Shine has been a private citizen for more than a year. He knows the television business. The White House has lacked a communications director since Hope Hicks resigned.  Ahead, The New York Times and the national media totally missed the rise of a 28-year-old socialist who knocked off a powerful House Democrat.

      "utterance": "Less than 72 hours ago, five people were killed in the newsroom of the Annapolis' Capital Gazette, victims of a crazed gunman who held a grudge against the paper since losing a defamation suit. So the attempts to somehow tie this to President Trump or national politics are shameful. But, four of these people were practicing local journalism. They don't have big salaries or TV contracts. But all editors and reporters take risks because they publish things that upset people. This tragedy reminds us of those very risks. I want to pay tribute to the men and women of Capital Gazette which published the next with this blank editorial page saying \"we are speechless.\" Also, the media on a war footing over Anthony Kennedy Supreme Court retirement, but many pundits demanding that the Democrats refused to vote this year on a Trump nominee, any Trump nominee as political payback."

I mean, as soon as the rumors started, I assumed that there are already plans, you know, circulating among liberals in the media as to how they are going to discuss those because it became a real possibility. I mean, there is a difference between acknowledging the drama of the moment and the gravity of the moment and treating it as the apocalypse. And I think we really saw it portrayed as the apocalypse from Chris Matthews to Jeffrey Toobin, I mean, across the board. A lot of Hollywood liberals again rehashing on the entire idea that we are living in a handmaid's tale and so there is a lot of, you know, it won't be on (ph) drama."

Let me ask you, liberal commentators are casting this as pure payback from Eric Garland, what Mitch McConnell did in 2016, and I understand that.

Also that is going to bring out everyone on both sides of the debate to fight like hell. But it comes on the heels of what he pulled -- McConnell did with Garland. And they are just two years of pent-up, just absolutely crazy frustration about that."

And I don't think I ever said this before but I agree with Chris Matthews that everyone should do what they can. Unfortunately, there is not a whole lot procedurally that the Senate can do. But, hey, if someone, you know, find himself pulling a fire alarm, I mean, that is what it is basically coming to."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

But if you look at the mainstream coverage, the Republican argument was that this was happening in 2016, the last year of a lame duck president's term, therefore, we can't allow vote, we should wait for a new election. So the Democrat argument now is we are in another election, but it's a midterm year and it's the last year of president's term, and yet in some ways that seems to be getting an equally sympathetic hearing."

By at the end of the day here and we were just talking about this, I mean, you have no idea whether or not whoever it is you put into this seat is going to vote the way you think they are going to vote. So the whole thing could turn out to be completely different thing --"

So, somewhere now to do something and call for short act and it be called obstruction, it's not like that came out of a vacuum. To deny a vote that it never happen in history, it was a ridiculous argument."

Some news outlets -- I mean, The Huffington Post had a headline that said the end of Roe -- and there was a picture of a coat hanger -- of a coat hanger. Do you see much recognition in the coverage that there are millions of people in America who have pro-life use and are taking what they believe is a principal moral stand?"

That's an understatement what we saw coming from the left this week. It's a reflection of their take on abortion and reflection on their acknowledgement of the reality that we live in right now in the Roe v. Wade world that that is, you know, the correct ruling and the possibility of the threat of that being overturned is apocalyptic to so much of the pro-choice left. And I don't think there is an acknowledgement that public opinion really is split on abortion -- well, in urban centers. It may not be the rest of the country. This is not the apocalypse. This not dramatic for a lot in the country. It's probably very good."

You have no idea. And you can take somebody that you want to put them in and have them vote in certain way. But let's also look at some of the picks that the president is putting in.

And I think what's particularly scaring people is there are two Donald -- and I never buy into this, but there are two Donald Trumps. One, is everything he does that liberals go crazy about. But there is the judicial appointment part where he is being incredibly effective where he's putting so many -- he's getting nominations up to the Hill in terms of federal bench and SCOTUS. And I think it really scares people. He's going to go down probably as the best Republican president on nominations. And what scares people I think also is that there shouldn't be just an absolute wall. There will be no profiles in courage on their votes."

Just to wrap up this point about people who don't know the history about Supreme Court appointees and don't always agree with the president who appoints them. I doubt George W. Bush when he named John Roberts that John Roberts would be signing a decision in legalizing same-sex marriage in this country. Kennedy is only on the bench or was because Democrats in the 80s blocked Robert Bork after a very emotional campaign. So there is no guarantees here about what happens over the years."

Now, was he influenced in any way by the hostile attitude surrounding and acrimonious atmosphere surrounding the press on the national level? I don't know. I can't get inside his head.

      "utterance": "There was an unfortunate incident last Sunday on \"Fox and Friends\" involving Fox News contributor David Bossie, the president's former deputy campaign manager. Things got testy during a debate with Democratic strategist Joel Payne who is an African-American. When Bossie said, you're out of your cotton-picking mind, Payne responded that he has some relatives who picked cotton. Fox News called the comments deeply offensive and holy inappropriate. Bossie apologized on Twitter. \"During a heated segment of 'Fox & Friends' today, I should have chosen my words more carefully and never used the offensive phrase that I did. I apologize to Joel Payne, Fox News and its viewers.\" Payne tells me he accepted the apology. Now, I happened to see Bossie just as he was coming out of the studio. And when Payne came over from a separate studio down the hall, Bossie told him in that moment he never heard of him and didn't know he was black. The monitor in Bossie's studio was not tuned to \"Fox & Friends.\" Still, it doesn't let him off the hook and the network has made clear that such language is unacceptable. Fox hasn't commented on the outcome but sources told The Daily Beast that Bossie was suspended for two weeks. Bill Shine, the former co-president of the Fox News is President Trump's pick to oversee communications as deputy chief of staff. Shine spent 20 years at Fox. He was a one-time producer for Sean Hannity who is close to the president. Let's be clear about one thing. Shine who resigned under pressure last year was never accused of sexually harassing anyone. He was accused in some lawsuits involving the late chairman Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly, enabling or failing to act on complaints about alleged misconduct which has strenuously denied. Some critics are already saying this just strengthens the ties between Fox and Trump. But in fairness, Shine has been a private citizen for more than a year. He knows the television business. The White House has lacked a communications director since Hope Hicks resigned. Ahead, The New York Times and the national media totally missed the rise of a 28-year-old socialist who knocked off a powerful House Democrat. But first, journalists saying that Donald Trump has blood on his hands with the Annapolis newsroom shootings before the police even had a suspect."

Joining us now, Fox News Contributor, Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor of the Federalist, and her husband Mark Hemingway, Senior Writer at the Weekly Standard. Mark, you have worked in newspaper news rooms. You know that being a journalist means writing things that sometimes make people upset. It's not without risk, but you don't expect gun fire to erupt in (Inaudible) where you work."

      "utterance": "No. In fact, nine years ago, they have a -- policeman was shot outside the holocaust museum. In Washington D.C., and shortly afterward, they found the address of my publication, the Weekly Standard, in the shooter's glove compartment."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Because right away, before we learned much of anything. Before we knew who the suspect was, (Inaudible) about his motivation. Some journalists and commentators started tweeting and tying President Trump to this. And you wrote about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's very difficult when something like this happens. You are desperate for information and speculation runs rampant. I think it's important for journalists to make sure that they are not just speculating without evidence. And it wasn't just bad that people started trying to tie up President Trump to the shooting. It was that after the news came out showing the shooter had a long standing grudge against the publication, dating back to 2011. Many journalists kept saying that they thought this was somehow the responsibility of President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, let's put up some of the tweets that you covered in your piece. Rob Cox is the Global Editor of Reuters, and he tweeted this is what happens when Donald Trump calls journalists the enemy of the people. Blood is on your hands, Mr. President. He later apologized and Reuters said would take some of appropriate sanction. Radio host, (Inaudible) also -- is it surprising someone shoots up a newspaper office? Donald Trump has blood on his hands. There is that phrase again. (Inaudible) the shooting can't be recently separated from the President's mission to villainize the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, the President really has had strong rhetoric against the media, and there are many people who are rightfully concerned about that. And that we don't just have freedom of the press in our laws. We want to have a strong culture of freedom of the press as well. That doesn't mean though that the press is beyond criticism. And criticizing the press is something that's also important. And as mentioned in that very same first amendment, we have freedom of speech, which enables everybody up to and including the President to have the right to criticize the press. And there actually are a lot of reasons to criticize the press in this environment. So it would be nice for the media to take some of that criticism to heart."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Have a little restraint in this volatile situation. Now Sean Hannity also drew some flack for talking about the environment created by incendiary rhetoric, an example the protesters who confronted Sarah Sanders and Kirstjen Nielsen. But he said look. He said this on his radio show. It's not connected in anyway. I am not equating or comparing. So again, you have this sort of political crossfire over what was an unquestionable tragedy, journalists gunned down in their workplace."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I think that part of the problem here is this is the way for sort of journalists to deflect a bit, which is to say that Donald Trump is capitalizing here on a preexisting phenomenon. And we have decades of public polling showing significant animus against the press and the fact that people don't like the job they're doing. So while some of the specific criticism against the press you know might be out of bounds. You know broadly speaking, it's very hard to that the say the media you know haven't earned a lot of distaste from the American people."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And you know after every mass shooting, whether it's Gabby Giffords, whether it's (Inaudible) at the baseball practice last year. I see to many journalists on all sides who are commentators trying to score partisan points by somehow suggesting the shooters motivation was influenced by you know you created the climate that allowed this to happen. And I hate that kind of guilt by association."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It's very frustrating because the actions of the shooter are his actions. It's also true though that you can have climates that are created through incivility and rhetoric. And so I think it's OK to have people encourage others to have good ways of speaking, about their disagreement with other. I also you know when you look back to last June. It is true the man who shot up the Republican baseball field was motivated by his political views, which were actually not (Inaudible) indication that he had mental health problems."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, actually that story moved out of the news extremely quickly. And I think that you want to see much more uniformity in how the media approaches these things. If they think rhetoric is always to blame, show that in a uniformed fashion rather than only doing it with one way and not the other."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

I think that says a lot about where we are right now as a country, that even some people were willing to go and make this argument, and the argument that emerged from some on the left and some never Trump people was that you can justify these personal attacks based on a political belief that you think goes beyond the pale. And I think that's a really dangerous place to be in. I think if you, you know sat down with people at tables rather kicking them out, we would be able to have a more productive conversation."

I don't think (Inaudible) to say that if these tactics were used against Barack Obama's aides, justifying it by people who hated that administration, that you would see a flip that some of the people who are now criticizing it would justify it, and some of the people who are saying this is not so bad would be outraged."

      "utterance": "Right. It's an argument actually that a lot of the feminists make toward conservative women. The rules are suspended because this person is particularly awful. Asking about the double standard is great because you need no look further than the tea party when the left was suddenly very concerned about civility. We saw that all the time that the poisonous instability of the tea party movement. There is a lot of concern on the left, and in the mainstream media from reporters and journalists about instability when the tea party was doing it."

But it seems to me that then he almost baits people to use the same tactics and that leads to something that I just think is corrosive for society."

But if the reality is Democrats fighting with one hand behind their back or fighting fire with fire, I think it is naive to say that we are better than that. Yeah, I do think we are better than that. But I think it's more important to beat them and then be better in how we govern than just some pie in the sky singing we are the world. I mean look at Maxine Waters. The President didn't call her low IQ for the first time after that clip. He has been calling her low IQ for months and months and months."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

I demand that you know it. And I'm telling you, Howie, the shooting of congressmen, the shooting and killing of these journalists. It's getting worse. It's going to get worse unless someone stands up and says enough is enough. And I'm going to give you a solution. I'm going to name names here. You have a couple of Democrats that are beyond this and have said I am not going to play that game. Now Mitch Landrieu of Louisiana, Governor John Hickenlooper, Senator Michael Bennett of Colorado, these are Democrats who said I am not playing that. I'm not going to do that anymore.
