What I do know is lack of preparation tends to lead to few choices, and those choices that are there typically aren't the best. I think that was the major problem here. We in the Freedom Caucus, we called for staying throughout August and putting together a debt ceiling plan. But that wasn't done. We took -- Neil, we took the longest break in over a decade, the longest break in a non-election year we have ever taken, when we got all these important and pressing issues. That is not what the American people elected us to do.  And so I think that was the bigger concern. We will see how it shakes out. What I will say this. We got a three-month increase in the debt ceiling, and we did not do anything to address the underlying problem, which is namely a $20 trillion debt. So, some the options we put forward, we will raise the debt ceiling. We understand that needs to happen.  But we will do it if we actually address the underlying problem, cap spending in the future, do some other things, things that need to happen to deal with this huge debt burden that we currently have.",
