She's a white woman of vast European ancestry who went to the buffet of identity politics and took seconds then thirds. Warren is Native American because she said so. She wins the 2018 Rachel Dalziel award. So, if we all do the same test as hers and find similar percentages, aren't we also eligible to claim the experiences of an oppressed group and their past grievances too? Her results now become the standard for anyone choosing a past that offers an edge, who can now skip ahead in admissions or jobs in places where diversity trumps experience.  And so, DNA tests become the new affirmative action, but at whose expense? Maybe no one because if we're all a little oppressed, we're all good. Goodbye, identity politics.

The key thing here for me is that when the papers then ask the folks at Harvard, did you, in fact, consider this when you hired her, they said no. And look at the University of Pennsylvania, in fact, I think they said at the University of Pennsylvania they filled out a form explaining why they hired a white woman over minority candidates.

I'm more interested in Raif Badawi, do you remember him? He was the blogger who had a religious freedom website and he was imprisoned for that by the Saudis.

I was there for a fact-finding mission through the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Here's the separation wall with the West Bank and -- and Judea Samaria. This is obviously the Western Wall and the Al Aqsa mosque. This is a view into Lebanon. Those hills you can see in where Hezbollah has lots of rockets pointed at Israel. This is a sign next to the Syrian border. And also, we have some photos of a fence. We went to a kibbutz, which is a little neighborhood right next to Gaza. And as you've seen with the reporting from Trey Yingst there in Israel, there has been lots of rioting. And they think things are going to start heating up even more than they already have. So we were there getting some interesting information and briefings from officials as things get heated up, as we like to say.

She's a white woman of vast European ancestry who went to the buffet of identity politics and took seconds then thirds. Warren is Native American because she said so. She wins the 2018 Rachel Dalziel award. So, if we all do the same test as hers and find similar percentages, aren't we also eligible to claim the experiences of an oppressed group and their past grievances too? Her results now become the standard for anyone choosing a past that offers an edge, who can now skip ahead in admissions or jobs in places where diversity trumps experience. And so, DNA tests become the new affirmative action, but at whose expense? Maybe no one because if we're all a little oppressed, we're all good. Goodbye, identity politics.

Only listed it when she applied to the higher tier schools, and then did not list it after she had tenure.

The key thing here for me is that when the papers then ask the folks at Harvard, did you, in fact, consider this when you hired her, they said no. And look at the University of Pennsylvania, in fact, I think they said at the University of Pennsylvania they filled out a form explaining why they hired a white woman over minority candidates.

The funny thing about this today though for me was looking at the way the media reacted to this, before really looking at the study and going through the numbers, it was Warren verifies that she's Native American. And the Boston Globe goes through a series of corrections because first they were saying it was 1/30 second, then they go all the way to correcting it due to a math error and it turns out to be 1/1,024.

And on the right people are saying, look, you're a liar. You exploited this to get ahead just by you claiming that you didn't. There's all this evidence and a number of law reviews saying that you were chosen essentially, or at least stated on the fact that your name was listed as a minority as professor before you got to Harvard law.

And if the Saudis did this, I know there's some reporting coming out from another network and the Wall Street Journal saying that the Saudis are now preparing a report saying that he came into the building, to the consulate, they wanted to interrogate him and accidentally end up killing him and never made it out of the consulate. Now, we still have to verify that here at Fox. But the point is that this could have been ratcheted up to an even higher level than what we've already seen. The stakes here are high both economically and in terms of national security and that's why Pompeo was sent on the plane this morning as soon as President Trump talk to King Salman from Saudi Arabia who denied it.

Thank you, Trump. It's a joke. The way they treat Jews, Christians, they myriad human rights abuses, these have been conveniently ignored. But then they get outraged because it's a journalist. It's one journalist. But what Stelter did was he revealed why. He could leak it to Trump. Like, if he could not link it to Trump, would he have actually brought this up? I don't think so. I'm more interested in Raif Badawi, do you remember him? He was the blogger who had a religious freedom website and he was imprisoned for that by the Saudis. And he's been sentenced to ten years and a thousand lashes. Again, in Saudi Arabia, they still do the lash, OK? So while the journalists are really upset about this one guy, they've been doing this for a long time. And Raif is still in prison. He doesn't get enough attention.

And I think there's lots of concerned that the Saudis who now say that if there are threats against them, they will retaliate even more severe terms, Dana.

President Trump's numbers are up in terms of his approval. And it's very clear that based on his schedule, when the White House announced a couple of months ago he would be on the road three, four times a week doing these rallies, it was like, OK, it's a lot but it's paying off and people are paying attention.

I don't think this -- the economic results are in and they're good for this president. This election is not about the economy in my opinion. It's still a cultural battle that's being fought. People feel like they're losing their country. They saw what happened to Kavanaugh, they're galvanized by it, 2018 feels a lot like 2016 because the elites are telling us that the polls are for the Democrats, but the pulse on the ground is that their still a belief that this president can deliver. It will be interesting to see in certain houses and senate races watching candidates who kind of technically support Trump versus candidates who have embraced him in suburban districts in which way it actually goes. I'm of the belief that embracing the president means you ingratiate yourself to your base which you need. And independents are more with Trump than we think.

It's like for every one thing that happened in the Obama White House every day, there are seven things that happen every day in a Trump White House.

Remember, of course, how they tried to discredit not just Lewinsky. They called her a looney tunes. Not to mention Juanita Broaddrick and the other accusers. I also feel like she undercut the abuse of power position that has been used in sexual harassment cases in the workplace that was the entire basis of the #MeToo movement. And I think she's been on record saying how important that movement has been, but she undercut the entire thing. Look, her road-show with Bill Clinton is going to be fascinating.

The president of the United States with an intern, even if she's an adult, of course is a perfect example of that situation. But as we've seen on the left, the power structure only really matters depending on the political outcome. The reason why feminists defended Clinton in the '90s was because he believed in abortion, so they defended him.

She made a bargain a long time ago. \"I stay with my husband. I get to run for president. I get to lose twice.

However, I'm tired of him saying that, if he ran, he would win, because he's a real wuss, if he believes that to be true. That's my heightened rhetoric. He is a wuss for saying that he could win and then not running. Because if you believe you can win, throw your hat in the ring, Alec. In fact, I think that would be a really good thing for him. It would be exciting and interesting, and he's kind of outside of the box. He's their Trump. He says a lot of incendiary things. He's had TV shows, talk shows. He foments controversy."

Fans of \"The Five\" a major presence. Thank you so much. Here I am signing books, talking to some folks. In addition to enjoying the book talk, though, lots of people had questions about the Newseum and the state of American journalism today, covering President Trump. It's difficult.

This is obviously the Western Wall and the Al Aqsa mosque. This is a view into Lebanon. Those hills you can see in where Hezbollah has lots of rockets pointed at Israel. This is a sign next to the Syrian border. And also, we have some photos of a fence. We went to a kibbutz, which is a little neighborhood right next to Gaza. And as you've seen with the reporting from Trey Yingst there in Israel, there has been lots of rioting. And they think things are going to start heating up even more than they already have. So we were there getting some interesting information and briefings from officials as things get heated up, as we like to say. So thank you to FDD for taking us on that trip and giving us some information."
