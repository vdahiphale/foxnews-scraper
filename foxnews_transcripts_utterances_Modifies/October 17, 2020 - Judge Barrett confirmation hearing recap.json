So the left pretends that ACB is anti-female, but they ended up trashing this independent female way worse than any old white man could. So are we sure they aren't evil white men in disguise? So under the guise of equality, they asked ghoulish questions with your kids present, and we see the liberal lie of diversity.  Oh, they will say, you go, girl, until you're not their girl. Then all of those feminists light the torches, but in this era of the moveable witch hunt, wherever the woke go, intolerance follows, including social media platforms whose motto should be drown the witch, protect the mob. Take Yelp. If any restaurant is accused of racism, Yelp will now put out a public attention alert. Yes, Yelp just amplified smears in an effort to appear woke.  So if some loser is mad you don't serve artisanal ice cubes, it can cite bigotry minus any proof and Yelp will flag your cafe, which makes employees and customers a target for abuse. Yelp should change its name to Help because they're going to need it.  So should Hunter Biden, and he is getting it from social media platforms. \"The New York Post\" breaks a story allegedly showing the spoiled hard partying brat exploiting dad's connections. Of course, the story should be about verifying these e-mails from this laptop. But instead the story is about Twitter and Facebook smothering the story with a pillow.  Twitter actually blocked \"The New York Post\" account. If you tried to tweet the article, it wouldn't show up. It disappeared like a racist restaurant. And Facebook also said it would reduce the story's distribution. How noble of them considering all those countless BS stories they and their media pals pushed down our throats for four years: the Steele dossier, the collusion scam, the fine people like Covington, Smollett, Kavanaugh, leaked tax returns, phony smears about Trump offspring.   You can tweet Russian collusion, but not Hunter Biden.  Now I don't like that e-mail story at all. I hate reading people's private moments. It's gross. But that doesn't matter anymore. Here's why. If you said the Steele dossier mattered because it compromised Trump and foreign policy, then you've got to say the same thing here. And the story about Trump calling dead troops suckers and losers, that was lifted from a poorly verified private conversation. If that's okay, why not this? Facebook and Twitter weren't sticklers on that story. Fact is, the media would cite a non-sourced rumor about Trump eating orphans before you could sing \"Oliver.\" And now they're careful.   You know, I used to think this anti-speech ideology would die once it left the campus. I mean, how could these brain dead grads find jobs? But I was wrong. They found work everywhere: Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, Google, ESPN, Newsweek, Merriam Webster -- all zombies. Remember when the press told us that Trump was a threat to the press? No, it's the press that's a threat to the Free Press. Social media giants can erase stories they don't like while boosting the ones they love. All of those wet bombshells: why were they out there to begin with? They were always the stories that trended, the ones that took the top spaces at Google searches or the ones repeated five times on Google's news page.   They've been controlling all of this to control what you think or believe.  So after years of smoking guns turning out to be smoldering nothing, here comes Hunter. I mean, this isn't a smoking gun. It's a smoking -- it is a smoking something and no one in the media wants to take a puff. Are they finally trying to quit? No. It's just not their brand.",

It has been controversial, the idea that Republicans would put forth judicial nominees who believe that the Constitution is what it says it is and it means what it says it means. And here you have Donald Trump putting forth a nominee like this. And Democrats in the committee are lying down like little lambs. They are completely rolling over and they're going to confirm this woman.  Donald Trump has broken these people, and the fact that it's not the biggest news today, the fact that we've all sort of just sort of begun to kind of take it for granted that yes, she's going to get confirmed is absolutely astonishing, especially when you consider what the stakes are at this particular moment.

But you know, going back to real quick the Supreme Court situation. I think she's a great candidate. I think she is going to be more of a friend to liberals than they realized.  She seems to be clear-headed. She doesn't seem to take sides. She takes no nonsense. I disagree with she throws grenades back. I literally believe she lets him hit her go and shrapnel. Like she is literally bulletproof. But going to and I hate to disagree with Mr. Hurt because I think he's an extremely intelligent man. This is going to be the fuse that leads to even more chaos, even more disruption, even more drama going into however this election plays out. We saw what happened when they lost the pick last time. They basically said, you took our pick, we're taking your President. President Trump had basically three and a half years of investigations whether true, false or whatever, indifferent. Now, we took a second pick from them. They're not going to lay down like lambs.

If that is unconscionable, if that is an outrage, in an era, in a day and age when there's DVR and recording and playback and upload and streaming and pirating on your phone and your watch and your computer and your television -- the elevators in this building even, like if that's unconscionable.

So under the guise of equality, they asked ghoulish questions with your kids present, and we see the liberal lie of diversity. Oh, they will say, you go, girl, until you're not their girl. Then all of those feminists light the torches, but in this era of the moveable witch hunt, wherever the woke go, intolerance follows, including social media platforms whose motto should be drown the witch, protect the mob. Take Yelp. If any restaurant is accused of racism, Yelp will now put out a public attention alert. Yes, Yelp just amplified smears in an effort to appear woke. So if some loser is mad you don't serve artisanal ice cubes, it can cite bigotry minus any proof and Yelp will flag your cafe, which makes employees and customers a target for abuse. Yelp should change its name to Help because they're going to need it. So should Hunter Biden, and he is getting it from social media platforms. \"The New York Post\" breaks a story allegedly showing the spoiled hard partying brat exploiting dad's connections. Of course, the story should be about verifying these e-mails from this laptop. But instead the story is about Twitter and Facebook smothering the story with a pillow. Twitter actually blocked \"The New York Post\" account. If you tried to tweet the article, it wouldn't show up. It disappeared like a racist restaurant."

If you said the Steele dossier mattered because it compromised Trump and foreign policy, then you've got to say the same thing here. And the story about Trump calling dead troops suckers and losers, that was lifted from a poorly verified private conversation. If that's okay, why not this? Facebook and Twitter weren't sticklers on that story. Fact is, the media would cite a non-sourced rumor about Trump eating orphans before you could sing \"Oliver.\" And now they're careful. You know, I used to think this anti-speech ideology would die once it left the campus. I mean, how could these brain dead grads find jobs? But I was wrong. They found work everywhere: Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, Google, ESPN, Newsweek, Merriam Webster -- all zombies. Remember when the press told us that Trump was a threat to the press?

It has been controversial, the idea that Republicans would put forth judicial nominees who believe that the Constitution is what it says it is and it means what it says it means. And here you have Donald Trump putting forth a nominee like this. And Democrats in the committee are lying down like little lambs. They are completely rolling over and they're going to confirm this woman. Donald Trump has broken these people, and the fact that it's not the biggest news today, the fact that we've all sort of just sort of begun to kind of take it for granted that yes, she's going to get confirmed is absolutely astonishing, especially when you consider what the stakes are at this particular moment.

That's exactly -- if -- you know, I always think families should be off limits and campaigns and stuff regardless, but we clearly know that's not how the world plays now. But you know, going back to real quick the Supreme Court situation. I think she's a great candidate. I think she is going to be more of a friend to liberals than they realized. She seems to be clear-headed. She doesn't seem to take sides. She takes no nonsense. I disagree with she throws grenades back. I literally believe she lets him hit her go and shrapnel. Like she is literally bulletproof. But going to and I hate to disagree with Mr. Hurt because I think he's an extremely intelligent man. This is going to be the fuse that leads to even more chaos, even more disruption, even more drama going into however this election plays out. We saw what happened when they lost the pick last time. They basically said, you took our pick, we're taking your President. President Trump had basically three and a half years of investigations whether true, false or whatever, indifferent.

The one thing we don't do is over answer, and I was flipping back and forth, both candidates over answered. The difference was is that Trump became annoyed and combative and it became very personal. And then once it became personal, and he gets an argument, the reporter wins. And as savvy and as intelligent as our President is, he allowed himself to get in a one on one battle with a reporter. And I'm telling you right now, I don't care who you are, or how slick you are, you're never going to win, because they're just going to keep baiting you. And he took the bait, which was very disappointing, honestly. At this point in the game, you know, the white supremacy question, straight up, you say it and you move on.

And like the ground is made of My Pillows. I will never forget, when he gave that speech about his, you know, economic plan, and the reporter goes to ask a question and says, how are you so calm? And how do you handle it so well when Trump is so mean to you? That's your question, and it's really upsetting, because I don't care if you're vetting someone to be in a huge position of power or that person is in a position of power. They should be getting tough questions. I don't care if you're a Republican, a Democrat, or even the greatest politician who has ever lived and my celebrity crush, Ron Paul, same thing.

I tried to watch the Biden thing and it literally put me to sleep. It was so boring.

It was the strangest thing. And then of course, if you listened to what he said, you know, he was -- he kept talking about programs and stuff that he and Barack had done. And also -- and to me, it was just such a turnoff. And tedious and it reminds me that -- you know, when Donald Trump is gone, I'm going to quit covering politics.

Three are students at James Madison University. That blast was so powerful that it rattled the windows of nearby homes. No official word yet on what caused the explosion. I'm Ashley Strohmier. Now back to THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW."

The networks are required to give equal time to candidates. In the case of Town Halls, they kind of did that. But it's Trump reverse syndrome. The media is fine with everything unless they find out Trump is doing it. Then it is evil, when it's just Trump doing what he does best, which is called counter programming. But of course, it's not about defending democracy or promoting fairness. It never is. Which is why the only talking head I listened to is this guy."

Kat, you know, I find it hilarious that CNN is complaining that this was a ratings ploy when in 2016, they took Trump every single moment and opportunity they could to counter program against FOX and probably MSNBC, and then meanwhile, \"Morning Joe,\" on MSNBC gave Trump carte blanche to be on that show any moment he wanted, because they knew he would be great for ratings. So they actually helped get Trump elected. They lost the right to complain about counterprogramming."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, I have not lost my right to complain, so I'm going to just be perfectly honest here. I'm not mad that they are on at the same time necessarily. I am mad that they were on at the same time on Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. because that's when I watch \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\" I know everybody hates them like oh, they're not rocket scientists, blah, blah, blah. Of course they're not rocket scientists. Thank God, they're not. Who would want to watch a bunch of people sitting there doing math? I mean, last week, Kylie allegedly put a stiletto in Kendall's throat over a ride home dispute. I had to wait not one, not two, but three hours before figuring out being able to learn how that all panned out. I don't have much going on in my life because of this pandemic. That's not fair to me. But still the calls to boycott NBC over this are ridiculous. You put up -- I don't feel that way. You put up a tweet from Debra Messing saying that, like they gave you 11 seasons of \"Will and Grace,\" which is slightly more than they've ever given me and I don't feel that way. Baffling."

      "utterance": "We knew that went to all white man set up shop across each other, bigger than the gridiron, it is bigger than the NBA Finals, who is going to have more crafty, old white man tricks? What we did learn is that nobody on the left media thought that Joe Biden could last a ground with President Trump in a ratings battle. They were furious. They're like, great, America is going to see 25 million for Trump, 1,100 for Joe Biden. That's what they thought. That's what all the outrage was about. But they didn't listen, and even though two million people listened to it when we talked about it on -- and I put it on social media for people to watch, the only thing craftier than an old white man is an older white man. Come on, man. You didn't think Joe could go? So that's why you were crying foul and everyone -- the world is over because they didn't want to know and lo and behold, lo and behold, the only one who knew that if you put two old white men together, the oldest one is going to get more ratings, it was yours truly."

Unless, of course, it's just by the fact that Joe Biden never answers any questions and people thought maybe something would happen. But I have no problem with this. I just wish they had somehow like maybe tricked both of them and sort of cut the Debate Commission out of it, and just secretly put them on the same stage and then had two reporters go at both of them. I didn't have a problem with Savannah Guthrie. I thought that she asked tough mean nasty questions. I like tough met nasty and mean questions."

I mean, Don Lemon said, this was the story of the day, what everyone is talking about. And then you know, like you mentioned, Hollywood piled on, right? This was called an outrage and unconscionable. And this was a Q&A with the President at the same time as a Q&A with the nomination -- candidate for the vice presidency. And my point is, there's no gas left in the tank, you guys. If that is unconscionable, if that is an outrage, in an era, in a day and age when there's DVR and recording and playback and upload and streaming and pirating on your phone and your watch and your computer and your television -- the elevators in this building even, like if that's unconscionable. What is next? That's why no one listens to these people because they are screaming from their gated communities. Their hangnail is like our equivalent of an amputation or being burned at the stake.

By next June, there should be enough vaccines for every American that shortens the pandemic timeline by years and saves countless lives. In the report, \"The Times\" forgot to say it so I will. Thanks, Mr. President. Finally, Walmart has got a plan for containing crowds on Black Friday -- three Black Fridays. They are splitting up the usual sales into three separate events starting the day after the election. I plan to shop how I always do on Black Friday. Here's me last year."

Hey, hey, Tyrus, not listening to Vince McMahon when he's talking to you directly and rolling your eyes at him. That's going to get you fired. Yes, thanks. Four years later. Thank you, sir.

      "utterance": "Exactly. I mean, that's what happens when you're an armchair quarterback only. I will say that what I learned in prepping for this is how Operation Warp Speed, not only is the speed obviously awesome, but that it was akin to a war time weapons procurement that the President did so by investing in all of that, by buying all of the vaccines outright and upfront, it allowed all of those companies to stay afloat and the benefit is us, because we'll have multiple options with these awesome production lines setup. And of course, he is not getting any credit for that, and I feel like this whole -- the whole lens everyone is looking at this, it's always like a soccer game where you blame -- you like string up the goalie, if he let one ball go by, but you never acknowledge the like thousand saves that he or she made throughout the course of the game."

      "speaker": "HURT",

And we've had -- we've seen Democrats try to score political points off this from the beginning. And of course, we've seen the World Health Organization, and lots of other scientific organizations that are supposed to be helping, you know, stop the spread of this and fix this problem. All of them trying to score political points off of this. And that is a terrible, terrible idea, and I think Emily is exactly right. A long time from now, we're going to look back at this and we're going to look at the things that worked and look at the things that didn't work. But the things that worked, they worked because people were trying to solve a problem, a problem that we had never encountered before January of this year."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, and the lockdown, right? That was so controversial a few months ago to say something like that, like, hey, maybe this is not good. You know, you just killed my grandma. I'm all for saving lives, but I think that if there is a potentially life- saving mechanism that also makes everyone who is still living wish they were dead, that that is something that needs to be considered, right? Because it's not just -- it's even worse than that, it is not just poverty. That is obviously a very real thing. But all health experts say that prolonging loneliness can lead to a whole host of physical problems and ultimately, early mortality. That's kind of a big deal and should not be controversial and shouldn't have taken that long to realize that and to acknowledge that."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

A Texas woman -- aren't they all -- is suing Brad Pitt for $100,000,00 alleging he failed to appear at Charity Events after she had already paid him 40 grand to be there. The woman claims Pitt approached her online to help fundraise for his Make it Right Foundation, which builds houses for victims of Hurricane Katrina. But she says they developed a close relationship and even talked about marriage. But Pitt's lawyers say she got cat-fished by a Pitt impersonator adding that she has even admitted she knows she was a victim of a scam. Sounds crazy, but I get it. I was once cat fished by Clive Owen. It turns out, it was this fella."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "No, Jesse Watters doesn't contact me either. But look, this is why I always believe in yourself is terrible advice, and I will not tell it to my future children. I will not sit there and watch the Olympics with them and say that'll be one day because I not a liar. Okay? This lady did not need to be Colombo to figure out she probably wasn't talking to Brad Pitt. She sees that healthy little bit of self-doubt. You should believe in yourself. But not always. Because you're not perfect. We're not all Adam Sandler."

So just -- I'm just -- you know, I think anytime anyone makes an accusation, I have to believe to a certain extent and then you should be allowed to prove that it's not and then afterwards, they should be held accountable. Having said that, so Brad Pitt's average annual salary. This means lowest ever, like he had a bad year is $25 million. He averages that a year. On a good year, it can be up to $150 million, even more. The cheapest you can get him in your movie for is $7 million. So you're going to set it with a straight face and say that you as Brad Pitt to make an appearance at like six charity events for $40,000.00. The defense rests, Your Honor."
