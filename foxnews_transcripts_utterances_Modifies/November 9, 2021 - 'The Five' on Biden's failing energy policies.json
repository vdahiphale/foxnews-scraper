It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" President Biden is proving he's totally clueless and Americans aren't having it anymore. Joe Biden turning a blind eye to the problems plaguing the country including rising gas prices, massive inflation and energy crisis all being made worse by his policies.  The White House now playing cleanup after getting called out over a plan to shut down the pipeline in Michigan. It now says it's only reviewing, building a new one. And when it comes to the pain at the pump, the White House basically telling Americans, too bad, just deal with it.",

They're probably just getting their coffee and so they have no idea. So what Joe is saying is he doesn't want you to pay attention to what's going on. He's always passing the buck, right? He's not taking responsibility but we had a saying back in third grade, you know what that was? Whoever smelled it dealt it.  It may be silent, but it's deadly. He's the guy that always lets one fly in an elevator and then assumes if nobody else -- if he doesn't react, no one else will react either, even though the stench of his White House is overpowering. He releases more gas than OPEC. Maybe that's why he doesn't think we need more energy.  But the big thing is you see MSNBC saying inflation is a good thing, CNN saying, oh, Joe can't do much about this. It's out of his hands. It's unusual and weird to see the media say, what can you do about stuff, when they spend so much time saying you must do something. Whether it's climate, you must do something. Whether it's gun control, you must do something. But here it is. People have to pay more for food, gas and oil. It's like, not so fast. It's really not on him. And I think that goes back to what I said, that they want a society that's more dependent on government and that's why this is not that big of a deal.  I wish Joe was doing nothing but like you said in the opening, he's actively destroying our energy sector. As gasoline prices soar cutting off pipelines, that's like basically removing, you know, your children's playground set as the kid gains weight. This is not helpful.",

This scary ass worldview that imposes -- they are imposing their will on the country whether it's forcing people through higher prices to use alternative energy. They are going to spend $4 trillion more to create this giant new century welfare monstrosity.  It's all about not just bigger government but more centralized government. Europe on steroids and certainly more power to those in power already. A scorched earth approach to getting their way. And I'll just point to last month, and it's not just necessarily at the federal level. Gretchen Whitmer tried to, last year, shut down this -- it's a 4 1/2-mile stretch of this line 5 pipeline. It is a -- she was trying to terminate this easement. And Canada last month had to invoke a treaty to stop it.

And there is -- today they are pushing this $500 billion for climate change issues while people are actually talking about the high price of gas and groceries. And then they have this grab bag of policies, and it's like if your mom gave you $20 and said go to the store and get some groceries for the family and you go and you get two six packs of beer and some magazines, you come home and say, no, the family is still hungry.  And what the deputy press secretary said today was that we have no specifics on that. And they won't. And this is a story that's not going to go away like in Afghanistan. It's not on the front pages, but it's still on people's minds. Winter is just beginning. And so you got a long way ahead. Granholm just said, 54 percent increase for your heating oil costs. You think that's not going to reverberate through the whole country?

I understand what you're saying, like more trees in a place is a good thing. And if you look at a place like, I believe its Greenville, South Carolina. Twenty-five years ago there was a big push to put trees down the main street and there was a big controversy. It was going to cost too much money. Now, it's lovely because the trees are built -- the trees have grown up. It's shady. It's a beautiful street to shop along. It benefits everyone. And I think what the voters were saying last Tuesday is that we can support things that support everybody but we don't want to be put in these different categories. We might need to right some wrongs in the past, but then again, the remedy, as they say here, is going to actually benefit everyone because we don't have that society like we used to have.",

Poor white and black neighborhoods were carved up by this highway system because it's much easier to seize a poor neighborhood through eminent domain. You put the artery into the downtown shopping district and the artery out to the suburbs for the commuters and that's how it's done. They went into German, Italian, Jewish neighborhoods, all white people, and they just carved them out.  How many times have you heard the phrase \"this poor white neighborhood\" on the wrong side of the tracks? It's always a wrong side of the tracks. It is not black, it's not white. It's about rich and poor. And that's how they did this. So, just because we have to fix a part of the system doesn't mean the system was racist. It just means some of it was designed by idiots. Most of the problems we have in this country is because of idiots, not because of racists. And what the idiots are doing in the Biden administration is they're saying we're going to start destroying highways and we're going to replace these highways with mass transit. We don't want mass transit. Mass transit has been on the decline for the last 15 years. We just came out of a pandemic where people are leaving cities. People are working remotely. The last thing we need are more trains and subways and buses. So they are just going to jam this down our throat. And what's going to happen, the Big Dig. Remember Boston? They tried to rip up their whole highway system and it took 25 years and the cost was five times as bad, and it just created more drama and more, I don't know, congestion, which creates more emissions. So you're going to now see a boondoggle ala the Big Dig in every single city and in every single place where this Build Back Better money is going to go and you're just going to look back and say, Jesse Watters was right.",

Joe Biden turning a blind eye to the problems plaguing the country including rising gas prices, massive inflation and energy crisis all being made worse by his policies. The White House now playing cleanup after getting called out over a plan to shut down the pipeline in Michigan. It now says it's only reviewing, building a new one.

They're probably just getting their coffee and so they have no idea. So what Joe is saying is he doesn't want you to pay attention to what's going on. He's always passing the buck, right? He's not taking responsibility but we had a saying back in third grade, you know what that was? Whoever smelled it dealt it. It may be silent, but it's deadly. He's the guy that always lets one fly in an elevator and then assumes if nobody else -- if he doesn't react, no one else will react either, even though the stench of his White House is overpowering. He releases more gas than OPEC. Maybe that's why he doesn't think we need more energy. But the big thing is you see MSNBC saying inflation is a good thing, CNN saying, oh, Joe can't do much about this. It's out of his hands. It's unusual and weird to see the media say, what can you do about stuff, when they spend so much time saying you must do something. Whether it's climate, you must do something. Whether it's gun control, you must do something. But here it is. People have to pay more for food, gas and oil. It's like, not so fast. It's really not on him. And I think that goes back to what I said, that they want a society that's more dependent on government and that's why this is not that big of a deal. I wish Joe was doing nothing but like you said in the opening, he's actively destroying our energy sector. As gasoline prices soar cutting off pipelines, that's like basically removing, you know, your children's playground set as the kid gains weight. This is not helpful."

So, what they see is they are going to ignore the polls and they see this -- even ignore the election, the losses in Virginia, because they see this window closing now. They've got one year to push through this incredibly divisive but left wing agenda. This scary ass worldview that imposes -- they are imposing their will on the country whether it's forcing people through higher prices to use alternative energy. They are going to spend $4 trillion more to create this giant new century welfare monstrosity. It's all about not just bigger government but more centralized government. Europe on steroids and certainly more power to those in power already. A scorched earth approach to getting their way.

It is a -- she was trying to terminate this easement. And Canada last month had to invoke a treaty to stop it. This sends fuel not just into the United States, but fuel to heat and gas up the cars in Ontario and Quebec. They hate Canada."

And there is -- today they are pushing this $500 billion for climate change issues while people are actually talking about the high price of gas and groceries. And then they have this grab bag of policies, and it's like if your mom gave you $20 and said go to the store and get some groceries for the family and you go and you get two six packs of beer and some magazines, you come home and say, no, the family is still hungry. And what the deputy press secretary said today was that we have no specifics on that. And they won't. And this is a story that's not going to go away like in Afghanistan. It's not on the front pages, but it's still on people's minds. Winter is just beginning. And so you got a long way ahead. Granholm just said, 54 percent increase for your heating oil costs.

Rich people, poor people, black people, white people, Asian people, Hispanic people. Everybody benefited. If we start with Pete Buttigieg leading the way to point at these projects like to change the bridge over the Cross Bronx Expressway which works fine now, people have adjusted, instead of building new bridges or repairing the bridges that exist and tunnels and roadways and making Wi-Fi available for everybody. And it's going to be in the hands of the same racially oriented politicians that we used to call poverty pimps when I was the lawyer for the Young Lords. Poverty pimps. They work. They jockey these programs. They find out what's happening. If you make this a social program, a social welfare program, which is what \"Build Back Better\" is supposed to be, but if you make infrastructure, social welfare, what you're going to get is nothing.

And to Dana, I wonder -- to Geraldo's point, it's because they want power and control over that money and they don't want anybody to ask any questions.

Twenty-five years ago there was a big push to put trees down the main street and there was a big controversy. It was going to cost too much money. Now, it's lovely because the trees are built -- the trees have grown up. It's shady. It's a beautiful street to shop along. It benefits everyone. And I think what the voters were saying last Tuesday is that we can support things that support everybody but we don't want to be put in these different categories.

Poor white and black neighborhoods were carved up by this highway system because it's much easier to seize a poor neighborhood through eminent domain. You put the artery into the downtown shopping district and the artery out to the suburbs for the commuters and that's how it's done. They went into German, Italian, Jewish neighborhoods, all white people, and they just carved them out. How many times have you heard the phrase \"this poor white neighborhood\" on the wrong side of the tracks? It's always a wrong side of the tracks. It is not black, it's not white. It's about rich and poor. And that's how they did this. So, just because we have to fix a part of the system doesn't mean the system was racist. It just means some of it was designed by idiots. Most of the problems we have in this country is because of idiots, not because of racists. And what the idiots are doing in the Biden administration is they're saying we're going to start destroying highways and we're going to replace these highways with mass transit. We don't want mass transit. Mass transit has been on the decline for the last 15 years. We just came out of a pandemic where people are leaving cities. People are working remotely. The last thing we need are more trains and subways and buses. So they are just going to jam this down our throat. And what's going to happen, the Big Dig. Remember Boston? They tried to rip up their whole highway system and it took 25 years and the cost was five times as bad, and it just created more drama and more, I don't know, congestion, which creates more emissions. So you're going to now see a boondoggle ala the Big Dig in every single city and in every single place where this Build Back Better money is going to go and you're just going to look back and say, Jesse Watters was right."

It's derived from say, the ideas in Albemarle County, from Ibram Kendi, author of \"How to Be an Anti- Racist,\" children being taught words like cisgender, white privilege, non- Christian folks with an X.

People like Chris Rufo and this show -- remember, this show, when we first started doing this topic, we had the examples in the -- in our copy that said this is where CRT is taught and this is what CRT is. The irony and the best part about this is when you hear proponents of CRT try to define it, and you hear critics try to define it, the definition is entirely the same. That's what kills me. They're not disagreeing. Identify children by their race within a country riven with systemic racism with the conclusion that White is the oppressor, right, and Black is the victim. If you say that, the proponents will go, that's pretty good. You got it. And the critics will go, you're absolutely right. That's exactly what they're saying. So, they're in agreement here. That's the funniest part about this. And it is dead because the parents finally woke up to this and found out that this was dangerous. Children are not equipped at that age to discuss this topic especially when adults can't talk about it either."

I was honored to speak at the annual dinner of one of Cleveland's most venerated charities for the last 60 years. The Bluecoats have provided assistance to the families of cops, firefighters, and other safety officers who have fallen or become permanently disabled in the line of duty. Our outgoing Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams spoke about how Bluecoats have come to the aid of these families. Erica and I met Chief Sheila Mason, the first black and first woman to serve as police chief of Woodmere, one of our exclusive local communities. My message was simple. We need to embrace cops because they need us as much as we need them. The Bluecoats seemed to like my remarks. A good time was had by all."

It's all part of their -- they're giving away 25 vehicles to promote the plan. So, you get $150.00.
