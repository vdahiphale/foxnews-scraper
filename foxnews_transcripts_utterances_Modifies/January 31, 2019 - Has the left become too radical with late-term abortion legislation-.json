      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. How are you? And a great show as always. Welcome to “Hannity.”  Big breaking news night. We begin tonight, “Hannity Watch” on the extreme radical left. It's really important as we begin, you ask yourself some questions.  Do you want the government to have more control over your daily life or less? Do you want the government to take more of your hard-earned money or less? Do you want the government to be more involved in your business or less involved? Do you want the government to have more control or total control of your health care or less? And do you believe the government has a duty to protect your borders from, let's see, heroin, fentanyl traffickers, human traffickers, cartels, gangs, and the criminal elements, not the good people that want a better life cover that come to our borders, and access our country illegally?  Because now, it is perfectly clear that the lines have been drawn. Nearly every single elected Democrat, almost all of those to run to challenge President Trump in 2020, they want more and more total control of your life. They don't trust you, the American people. Remember, they think we are irredeemable deplorable, that we cling to our god, our guns, our bibles, and religion, and we are the smelly Walmart people. Now, they want control of everything. It's actually beyond radical and extreme, it's scary. It's a failed ideology that's been tried over and over. It creates dependency.  They made promises that never come true. Never comes close to what they promise. And even worse, the people that are promising this great stuff, keep your doctor, save money, they really only want power for themselves. Now, socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and far left Senator Ed Markey are now set to unveil what they call their so-called green new deal legislation. Now, this bill will dictate how you heat your home, cook your meals, and even how you commute to work.  In fact, according to previous proposals, Ocasio-Cortez wants this country -- by the way, we just became the number one producer of oil on the planet, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. All fuel and gas, fossil fuels, we will not have them in ten years. That is not just socialism. That is authoritarianism.   She literally wants to nationalize enormous, profitable, private industry, kill it off completely. That means all the millions of high-paying career jobs in the oil and gas and energy sector, guess what? Gone. It will force every American to pay drastically more expensive for all forms of energy, the lifeblood of our economy. But according to Ocasio-Cortez, if the federal government doesn't take dramatic, authoritarian action, the world is going to end in 12 years. Well, that only gives us two years of our plan. Why bother? Anyway, she actually thinks the future of humanity is at risk because of energy independence. We have more energy. We can help our allies, our friends, create millions of high-paying jobs for Americans, and we've tried your way before. It doesn't work.   Take a look.",

Communist China, how is that working out?  Look at what life is like and literally any country that nationalizes private industry and imposes a strict government controls over private businesses.

      "sentences": "Excuse me. A lot of people risk a lot of money to start businesses. No help necessarily. They create goods and services that people want, need, and desire, and they even buy it or they don't play. That has created a standard of living that is the envy of the world, while the unimaginable in most places on this earth.   Now, Warren is proposing, let's talk about stealing, a brand-new wealth tax. That's after you pay your federal income taxes, your state income taxes, your Social Security tax, your Medicare tax, sales tax, property taxes, in some case like New York city income tax, well, then Senator Warren come after you pay all of that, and you saved a little bit, she wants to come back again and take more. That would be a government license to steal, Senator. And, by the way, after you die, the federal government wants half of what you say -- you pay to die in America. Isn't that great? And states like New York take 10 percent of what you have left. Why are all these people leaving New York, New Jersey, Illinois, California? Hundreds of thousands. It's a mass exodus in these high tax states.  But you look at states with low or no income taxes -- take Florida and Texas, no state income tax, nearly 400,000 new residents last year alone. These people are leaving. Just keep your bad politics wherever you came from.  Now, of course, the federal government, with a vast amount of money, look at Kamala Harris' Medicare-for-all proposal. Study, George Mason University, OK, that is $3.2 trillion a year. For ten years. Let me give you perspective. The federal budget in 2018 was $4.1 trillion, basically the entire budget. Open your wallets, watch out, socialists like Kamala are coming. Now, keep in mind, that proposal would literally kick 177 million Americans off their private health care plans and also completely kill off another private industry. If you work for an insurance industry, bye-bye. Kamala Harris wants you gone. Jobless. Out of work. He doesn't care.   By the way, what happens when Medicare for all feels like Obamacare? Uh- oh, what then? Now, Democrats are trying to sell these big government programs. They own compassion. They are the most compassionate. But don't be fooled. A government power grab, plain and simple, this is what it's about.  I don't trust -- they don't trust you. They therefore want the government to control every aspect of your life. They want to use your money, wondering what it's really about, to buy votes, bribe people to vote for them with your money, and get power.  So, let's recap the modern-day Democratic Party. The authoritarian control of your health care, your businesses, you money, and your personal decisions. President Trump put out a great tweet today. Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime. And speaking of which, we have an update on the disturbing story at Virginia from last night. Democratic legislator there named Kathy Tran proposed that bill that would make infanticide legal. Remember, she testified. Her law would allow a healthy baby's life to be terminated for any reason, even in the ninth month of pregnancy, even when the birth process started.   And the Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, supported the bill, then he took it a step further, saying a baby's life would only be saved -- it would be comfortable -- it would be there, outside the womb, but only saved, resuscitated if the family wanted. He said the infant would be resuscitated only under those conditions, while the baby's alive, viable, living, comfortably? Seriously?  After facing serious backlash, well, guess what the great governor of the commonwealth of Virginia did? He doubled down on stupid, and even played the victim card. We'll show you those disgusting comments coming up. Now, thankfully, President Trump is working hard. He doesn't get the credit from the media, to preserve core constitutional rights and principles for all Americans, including newly born children, the most innocent among us. Top Democrats are now seething with anger over the president's nomination of originalist justices.  Many doubters, remember, 2016, you were worried. I told you. I know this man for two decades and he would govern as a conservative. I think I've been proven right. And I told you so.  As I warned you, Obama was a rigid, radical ideologue whose policies would fail. They did. And now, President Trump is fulfilling those promises. We see the economic numbers. We see more peace around the world. We see him checking off the list of what he said he would do. And now he's also appointing strong, qualified justices.  So, let not your heart be troubled. President Trump will keep his commitment. For those of you that doubt, I say it's 99.9 percent to 0.1 percent. He's going to get the money for the wall one way or the other. And he announced today that he's sending more troops down to the border was thousands and thousands of new migrants and multiple caravans are marching through Mexico right to our southern border yet again. One contains upward of 12,000 people.   Now what if they go to a point in our border where there is no secure wall or entry point? What does a border patrol going to do to stop 12,000 people? They decided to rush across at once? No wall to stop them?  I said that while will protect people, rightly so, on both sides. And have a nice door in it. You know, unfortunately, take a little more time, we vet people, make sure they can provide for themselves, because the costs are out of control. It's not just the risks associated with migrant caravans. So many instances of life and death. Let's take a look at the most recent week we had. Two previously deported sex offenders from Mexico apprehended trying to illegally enter the U.S. at the Del Rio sector in Texas. They were caught. On Monday, border patrol agents apprehended a violent MS-13 gang member. Thankfully, that person was caught. Also on Monday, agents arrested a man who was convicted of child molestation in the U.S., along with the ducting and kidnapping. Guess what? They got him, too.   And just today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced the single largest fentanyl bust in history. Our guys at the border, the ones that Kamala Harris said -- isn't there a perception that ICE is like the KKK? Well, they captured over 250 pounds of this deadly opioid inside a load of Mexican produce heading to Arizona. Now, just a stark reminder of just how many deadly drugs come across that southern border, destroying American lives, especially fentanyl, often used by drug dealers to put into heroin, other addictive substances, look at the numbers. 2016, fentanyl responsible for 46 percent of all opioid-related deaths. It's a key reason that more than 42,000 people die from overdoses, involving opioids in 2016. That was an increase of nearly 10,000 over the previous year. In fact, annual fentanyl related deaths have dramatically increased since 2010. Much of this coming from China, and then smuggled by the cartels through the southern border. By the way, enough to kill all the residents of Florida, Pennsylvania, Utah, and pick another state, 54 million people. That is how much they got today of fentanyl our border.   Millions of people could be killed. It's why the president is pressing the president of China and he's getting results. Let's take a look.",

That's what they cared about DACA, Dreamers, and when Obama was president, they wanted to buy a wall, pay for a wall. Why do they insist now on stopping the rank and file members for coming to real solutions and negotiating in good faith? Only because they are consumed by anti-Trump hatred, every second, every minute, every hour of every day. They'll stop at nothing, just destroy him. Years, they supported everything President Trump is offering. They didn't mean it or they hate him more? They hate him more.

We turn to another brand-new update from our \"Hannity watch\" on my deep state tonight. It looks like be hate Trump media caught another collusion hoax yet again today. Now, remember when nearly every media outlet widely speculating, Donald Trump Jr. called his father with a blocked phone number ahead of his 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the Russians? When they talked about immigration and adoption? Now according to reports, fake news, never happened. I have one question for anyone who works at fake news CNN. Do you ever get tired of just being wrong and embarrassing yourself so often? All right. Here with reaction, a lot of news tonight, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino. FOX News national security analyst Sebastian Gorka. FOX News correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera.  All right. Enough fentanyl they got today to kill 54 million Americans, Geraldo. We are losing 300 people a week to this opioid crisis -- cartels, gangs, drugs, human trafficking. Don't you think that is enough to build the wall? Go have your door, Geraldo.",

Let me take you just for a little walk and show you.  Now, we are outside of the stadium where they let the migrants come for the night. They are setting up, trying to figure out where they will go next, Sean. This is a very important stop. It's the pork in the road for the traditional 2,000-mile trek from Mexico's southern border to the U.S. and southern border because if they go north, they will go into Texas, in Eagle Pass, Laredo or McAllen, Texas, where the president was. If they go west, like the previous caravan, they'll head towards Tijuana. That's significant. You mentioned numbers, Sean. We got to talk numbers, because this one is roughly 3,000 people. But that's in addition to the 12,600 migrants given a fast-track temporary asylum and work visa for up to one year. They are down at the southern border getting their papers, even though Mexico stop that program, they will make their way north towards the U.S. border. And then you have two more caravans, they are advertising on social media. One is on February 7th. The other on February 16th. Meeting in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the exact location that these migrants met on the 15th of January when we joined them so many weeks ago. And then you add to that number, the 2,000 to 3,000 that are in Tijuana from that caravan last October that we followed. You are talking about a very significant number, Sean. You are talking upwards of 15,000 to 20,000 total people of caravans and we have to talk about one last thing, and that is why this is happening. The biggest full factor, as the Border Patrol will tell you, the magnet is the new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the new president of Mexico, inaugurated last December, is absolutely pro-immigrant. He is helping these people, he obviously let them walk through gates, I walked with them. He's giving them this visa program, but they've now stopped. But it hasn't been totally done away with. The spokesman for the secretary of foreign affairs writing in \"The Washington Post\" today that Mexico's position will, quote, no longer be migration deterrence and blockage. So, they've opened their arms wide to help the migrants. If you talk to the local immigration officials in Tijuana or here in Queretaro and you talk about--",

The Brownsville area has about 35 miles of pretty secure fencing. It's border security the way that we would like to see it. It is a good mix of technology and secure fencing. In the McAllen are, you have exactly the opposite. Okay. You have wide open areas. Now, so what do we see? We see about 6 percent of illegal apprehensions happen in Brownsville and 94 percent occur in McAllen. So, do walls work? The answer is very clearly yes; that's exactly what we are seeing. And as we are driving over here, you can see Mexico right behind me.

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker. How are you? And a great show as always. Welcome to “Hannity.” Big breaking news night. We begin tonight, “Hannity Watch” on the extreme radical left. It's really important as we begin, you ask yourself some questions. Do you want the government to have more control over your daily life or less? Do you want the government to take more of your hard-earned money or less? Do you want the government to be more involved in your business or less involved? Do you want the government to have more control or total control of your health care or less? And do you believe the government has a duty to protect your borders from, let's see, heroin, fentanyl traffickers, human traffickers, cartels, gangs, and the criminal elements, not the good people that want a better life cover that come to our borders, and access our country illegally? Because now, it is perfectly clear that the lines have been drawn. Nearly every single elected Democrat, almost all of those to run to challenge President Trump in 2020, they want more and more total control of your life. They don't trust you, the American people. Remember, they think we are irredeemable deplorable, that we cling to our god, our guns, our bibles, and religion, and we are the smelly Walmart people. Now, they want control of everything. It's actually beyond radical and extreme, it's scary. It's a failed ideology that's been tried over and over. It creates dependency. They made promises that never come true. Never comes close to what they promise. And even worse, the people that are promising this great stuff, keep your doctor, save money, they really only want power for themselves. Now, socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and far left Senator Ed Markey are now set to unveil what they call their so-called green new deal legislation. Now, this bill will dictate how you heat your home, cook your meals, and even how you commute to work. In fact, according to previous proposals, Ocasio-Cortez wants this country -- by the way, we just became the number one producer of oil on the planet, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. All fuel and gas, fossil fuels, we will not have them in ten years. That is not just socialism. That is authoritarianism. She literally wants to nationalize enormous, profitable, private industry, kill it off completely. That means all the millions of high-paying career jobs in the oil and gas and energy sector, guess what? Gone. It will force every American to pay drastically more expensive for all forms of energy, the lifeblood of our economy. But according to Ocasio-Cortez, if the federal government doesn't take dramatic, authoritarian action, the world is going to end in 12 years. Well, that only gives us two years of our plan. Why bother? Anyway, she actually thinks the future of humanity is at risk because of energy independence. We have more energy. We can help our allies, our friends, create millions of high-paying jobs for Americans, and we've tried your way before. It doesn't work. Take a look."

Communist China, how is that working out? Look at what life is like and literally any country that nationalizes private industry and imposes a strict government controls over private businesses.

They create goods and services that people want, need, and desire, and they even buy it or they don't play. That has created a standard of living that is the envy of the world, while the unimaginable in most places on this earth. Now, Warren is proposing, let's talk about stealing, a brand-new wealth tax. That's after you pay your federal income taxes, your state income taxes, your Social Security tax, your Medicare tax, sales tax, property taxes, in some case like New York city income tax, well, then Senator Warren come after you pay all of that, and you saved a little bit, she wants to come back again and take more. That would be a government license to steal, Senator. And, by the way, after you die, the federal government wants half of what you say -- you pay to die in America. Isn't that great? And states like New York take 10 percent of what you have left. Why are all these people leaving New York, New Jersey, Illinois, California? Hundreds of thousands. It's a mass exodus in these high tax states. But you look at states with low or no income taxes -- take Florida and Texas, no state income tax, nearly 400,000 new residents last year alone. These people are leaving. Just keep your bad politics wherever you came from. Now, of course, the federal government, with a vast amount of money, look at Kamala Harris' Medicare-for-all proposal. Study, George Mason University, OK, that is $3.2 trillion a year. For ten years. Let me give you perspective. The federal budget in 2018 was $4.1 trillion, basically the entire budget. Open your wallets, watch out, socialists like Kamala are coming. Now, keep in mind, that proposal would literally kick 177 million Americans off their private health care plans and also completely kill off another private industry. If you work for an insurance industry, bye-bye. Kamala Harris wants you gone. Jobless. Out of work. He doesn't care. By the way, what happens when Medicare for all feels like Obamacare? Uh- oh, what then? Now, Democrats are trying to sell these big government programs. They own compassion. They are the most compassionate. But don't be fooled. A government power grab, plain and simple, this is what it's about. I don't trust -- they don't trust you. They therefore want the government to control every aspect of your life. They want to use your money, wondering what it's really about, to buy votes, bribe people to vote for them with your money, and get power. So, let's recap the modern-day Democratic Party. The authoritarian control of your health care, your businesses, you money, and your personal decisions. President Trump put out a great tweet today. Democrats are becoming the party of late-term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime. And speaking of which, we have an update on the disturbing story at Virginia from last night. Democratic legislator there named Kathy Tran proposed that bill that would make infanticide legal. Remember, she testified. Her law would allow a healthy baby's life to be terminated for any reason, even in the ninth month of pregnancy, even when the birth process started. And the Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, supported the bill, then he took it a step further, saying a baby's life would only be saved -- it would be comfortable -- it would be there, outside the womb, but only saved, resuscitated if the family wanted. He said the infant would be resuscitated only under those conditions, while the baby's alive, viable, living, comfortably? Seriously? After facing serious backlash, well, guess what the great governor of the commonwealth of Virginia did? He doubled down on stupid, and even played the victim card. We'll show you those disgusting comments coming up. Now, thankfully, President Trump is working hard. He doesn't get the credit from the media, to preserve core constitutional rights and principles for all Americans, including newly born children, the most innocent among us. Top Democrats are now seething with anger over the president's nomination of originalist justices. Many doubters, remember, 2016, you were worried. I told you. I know this man for two decades and he would govern as a conservative. I think I've been proven right. And I told you so. As I warned you, Obama was a rigid, radical ideologue whose policies would fail. They did. And now, President Trump is fulfilling those promises. We see the economic numbers. We see more peace around the world. We see him checking off the list of what he said he would do. And now he's also appointing strong, qualified justices. So, let not your heart be troubled. President Trump will keep his commitment. For those of you that doubt, I say it's 99.9 percent to 0.1 percent. He's going to get the money for the wall one way or the other. And he announced today that he's sending more troops down to the border was thousands and thousands of new migrants and multiple caravans are marching through Mexico right to our southern border yet again. One contains upward of 12,000 people. Now what if they go to a point in our border where there is no secure wall or entry point? What does a border patrol going to do to stop 12,000 people? They decided to rush across at once? No wall to stop them? I said that while will protect people, rightly so, on both sides. And have a nice door in it. You know, unfortunately, take a little more time, we vet people, make sure they can provide for themselves, because the costs are out of control. It's not just the risks associated with migrant caravans. So many instances of life and death. Let's take a look at the most recent week we had. Two previously deported sex offenders from Mexico apprehended trying to illegally enter the U.S. at the Del Rio sector in Texas. They were caught. On Monday, border patrol agents apprehended a violent MS-13 gang member. Thankfully, that person was caught. Also on Monday, agents arrested a man who was convicted of child molestation in the U.S., along with the ducting and kidnapping. Guess what? They got him, too. And just today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced the single largest fentanyl bust in history. Our guys at the border, the ones that Kamala Harris said -- isn't there a perception that ICE is like the KKK? Well, they captured over 250 pounds of this deadly opioid inside a load of Mexican produce heading to Arizona. Now, just a stark reminder of just how many deadly drugs come across that southern border, destroying American lives, especially fentanyl, often used by drug dealers to put into heroin, other addictive substances, look at the numbers. 2016, fentanyl responsible for 46 percent of all opioid-related deaths. It's a key reason that more than 42,000 people die from overdoses, involving opioids in 2016. That was an increase of nearly 10,000 over the previous year. In fact, annual fentanyl related deaths have dramatically increased since 2010. Much of this coming from China, and then smuggled by the cartels through the southern border. By the way, enough to kill all the residents of Florida, Pennsylvania, Utah, and pick another state, 54 million people. That is how much they got today of fentanyl our border. Millions of people could be killed. It's why the president is pressing the president of China and he's getting results. Let's take a look."

Why do they insist now on stopping the rank and file members for coming to real solutions and negotiating in good faith? Only because they are consumed by anti-Trump hatred, every second, every minute, every hour of every day. They'll stop at nothing, just destroy him. Years, they supported everything President Trump is offering. They didn't mean it or they hate him more? They hate him more. That put your community at risk, your friends at risk, your family at risk, selling out Dreamers, DACA, that's all they claim to care about. All right. We turn to another brand-new update from our \"Hannity watch\" on my deep state tonight. It looks like be hate Trump media caught another collusion hoax yet again today. Now, remember when nearly every media outlet widely speculating, Donald Trump Jr. called his father with a blocked phone number ahead of his 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the Russians? When they talked about immigration and adoption? Now according to reports, fake news, never happened. I have one question for anyone who works at fake news CNN. Do you ever get tired of just being wrong and embarrassing yourself so often? All right. Here with reaction, a lot of news tonight, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino. FOX News national security analyst Sebastian Gorka. FOX News correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera. All right. Enough fentanyl they got today to kill 54 million Americans, Geraldo. We are losing 300 people a week to this opioid crisis -- cartels, gangs, drugs, human trafficking. Don't you think that is enough to build the wall? Go have your door, Geraldo."

This is just politics. This is about votes, this has nothing to do with securing the nation. We need to remind Nancy Pelosi, there is only one person in America who is responsible for the national security of America, and it's not Nancy Pelosi. It's not Chuck Schumer. Nancy is one of hundreds of representatives who just happens to be speaker of the House, an internal decision of the Congress, of the party. There is one person responsible for our safety, Sean, and it's the president.

What if they all decide, we are going to brush an open section of the border? All at once?

Who have clearly stated, were they constructed walls, San Ysidro, Yuma, they've seen dramatic reductions in illegal immigration drug trafficking. She is just making that up because they have a literal vitriol hatred for Donald Trump and refused to give in any political victory even though, Sean, they know it's the right thing to do.

Let me take you just for a little walk and show you. Now, we are outside of the stadium where they let the migrants come for the night. They are setting up, trying to figure out where they will go next, Sean. This is a very important stop. It's the pork in the road for the traditional 2,000-mile trek from Mexico's southern border to the U.S. and southern border because if they go north, they will go into Texas, in Eagle Pass, Laredo or McAllen, Texas, where the president was. If they go west, like the previous caravan, they'll head towards Tijuana. That's significant. You mentioned numbers, Sean. We got to talk numbers, because this one is roughly 3,000 people. But that's in addition to the 12,600 migrants given a fast-track temporary asylum and work visa for up to one year. They are down at the southern border getting their papers, even though Mexico stop that program, they will make their way north towards the U.S. border. And then you have two more caravans, they are advertising on social media. One is on February 7th. The other on February 16th. Meeting in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the exact location that these migrants met on the 15th of January when we joined them so many weeks ago. And then you add to that number, the 2,000 to 3,000 that are in Tijuana from that caravan last October that we followed. You are talking about a very significant number, Sean. You are talking upwards of 15,000 to 20,000 total people of caravans and we have to talk about one last thing, and that is why this is happening. The biggest full factor, as the Border Patrol will tell you, the magnet is the new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the new president of Mexico, inaugurated last December, is absolutely pro-immigrant. He is helping these people, he obviously let them walk through gates, I walked with them. He's giving them this visa program, but they've now stopped. But it hasn't been totally done away with. The spokesman for the secretary of foreign affairs writing in \"The Washington Post\" today that Mexico's position will, quote, no longer be migration deterrence and blockage. So, they've opened their arms wide to help the migrants. If you talk to the local immigration officials in Tijuana or here in Queretaro and you talk about--"

Literally, you could walk in one minute from the Rio Grande, from Mexico to the United States, no barrier. What if all of those people went to that part? Is that a possibility or a plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, you know, I talked to as many of these migrants as I can and their plan is to get into the United States. Most of them tell me openly that they are going to do it illegally either at an open point or through a coyote that is going to take them through a traditional crossing because they know their chances are very, very slim. 95 percent of these immigrants know they are going to qualify for credible fear for asylum in America. There are a few Nicaraguans who are fleeing the oppression of Daniel Ortega; they may have a case. They haven't been to America but many of these have been to America or deported, and say they are going to cross illegally anyway they can. The rivers in McAllen is an easy place, and then of course in Tijuana, we have seen the people go under the fences hundreds at a time."

He was in Brownsville, Texas to see first-hand the situation on the border. Congressman Crenshaw joins us. He's in the border. And McAllen, Texas where we were, and also Former DEA Special Agent Derek Maltz is with us. Congressman, let's - just tell everybody. I've been down there 14 times. I know what I've seen. Tell everybody what you see."

      "speaker": "REP. DAN CRENSHAW, R-TX",
      "utterance": "Here's the big takeaway here. So, the Rio Grande Valley is actually responsible for about 40 percent of total illegal immigration in the entire country. So, it's a huge spot for this. Now, it's divided into the two spots, where there is the Brownsville are and then there is the McAllen area. The Brownsville area has about 35 miles of pretty secure fencing. It's border security the way that we would like to see it. It is a good mix of technology and secure fencing. In the McAllen are, you have exactly the opposite. Okay. You have wide open areas. Now, so what do we see? We see about 6 percent of illegal apprehensions happen in Brownsville and 94 percent occur in McAllen. So, do walls work? The answer is very clearly yes; that's exactly what we are seeing. And as we are driving over here, you can see Mexico right behind me. So driving over here, we are seeing groups of migrants being caught as they are crossing the border and a lot of these have kids with them which means they will simply be let go into U.S. population."

So, the American public has to realize one kilogram could kill 500,000 people. Plus, if you look like in New York, they seized another 70 pounds of this poison. That could have killed 15-20 million people.

New York passed this barbaric law, an equally disturbing proposal from the State Democratic Delegate Kathy Tran that we've showed you last night defeated thankfully. In Virginia, Democrats voting for it, the governor is supporting it. Tran actually submitted a bill to save, get this, at the same time she had her abortion bill, she submitted a bill to save the cankerworms. I had to look it up today; never heard of a cankerworm; turns out to be some type of caterpillar.

Maybe because the Democrats are all for illegal alien sanctuaries, what Republicans should do is start declaring all maternity wards and anywhere a woman could have a child be a sanctuary. The idea that you have these spreading laws and unfortunately, I live in Colorado, where we have a similar law to New York and Oregon and California, as you mentioned, Sean - and now, late-term abortions make up 3 percent of all abortions in Colorado.

      "utterance": "A very disturbing development in the halls of Congress and it deals with you and your money. The all-talk no-action House Democrats say have shot down a Republican proposal to, get this, forbid federal workers disciplined for sexual misconduct from getting a pay raise. So, the Democrats want decades old uncorroborated claims against Brett Kavanaugh, they believed everything against him, that disqualified him, but yet federal workers disciplined for real sexual harassment get a raise. Remember, Congress has paid out over $17 million in sexual misconduct and discrimination settlements on Capitol Hill over the last 20 years. If they want to use our money for this, okay, tell us who it is. Former White House Press Secretary and Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer, and RNC National Spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany. Ari, really, they want to pay this money. Okay, it's our money, we get to know what you did."

      "utterance": "Yes, this is a classic example where common sense has no room in Washington. And the reason these things don't pass, Sean, is because if the idea comes from minority party, Washington is so broke that the minority party can't possibly have a good idea, so the majority squashes it, and that's what you have here. I'm sure if this was an idea the Democrats had, they would have run with it, they would have loved it. Republicans couldn't have voted against this. Only Democrats could and they did."

      "utterance": "It's very simple, Sean, don't listen to their words, watch their actions. They pay lip service to the \"Me Too\" movement, but look at how every single Democrat voted which is against this bill. And their rank hypocrisy goes very deep, you look at Kamala Harris propping up a top staffer with a $400,000 sexual harassment payout. And when the media found out, that's only when she fired him. And you look at Keith Ellis over at the DNC with the domestic abuse charges propped up and elevated at the DNC as the number two, and now the AG of Minnesota. The hypocrisy is rank, especially when you consider Kavanaugh and the way they treated Clarence Thomas and so many other Republicans."

And if he's going to win reelections, it's because one of the reasons is that Democrats are going off the cliff so far to the Left. This used to be a Democratic party that had some centrists left in it, some blue dogs left in it. They are all gone. And the Democratic Primary is likely to be the worst thing to ever happen to the Democrats who want to win the White House in 2020. You can't win America if your ideas are that extreme."

Consider the fact, Obama - when he defended his President vote to give infants care on the other side, if they exited the womb, he defended that. He said, I didn't vote that way. He was ashamed that he voted President and was accused of that. Now, you have governors openly pontificating about infanticide, policies that only 10 percent of the nation or less supports. (inaudible) 10 percent or less of the nation supports. You can't win with 10 percent of the vote.

I think Nancy Pelosi has already stopped it. She put it firm (ph) on it and won't go forward. Democrats don't want to compromise. Pelosi can't compromise, even though she has a wall on the border between California and Mexico, she doesn't want it to spread beyond that. And so, if they can't compromise, the President's got to act. And I think he will, Sean, and it's going to be a real test, because there will be people who say you can't use your emergency powers to do this."

Multiple times on this show, now he is accused of some very rude in-flight antics. According to a passenger on Alaska Airlines, on a flight, former Ohio Governor Kasich, she says stole his First Class seat, after refusing to be downgraded to Premium Economy when he was bumped out of First Class to make room for a pilot. Now, this passenger Tweeted out that picture. She's telling the truth, we haven't really gotten a good response from Kasich, and she had to take another flight. It's kind of mean. I expect more out of you, John, like maybe you could have answered my questions before the last election. All right, only he knows what that means. To our viewer male, which Far Left Democrat policy scares you the most? One of you replied, the Green New Deal. Another answered, the better question is, which one doesn't scare you? We are going to put - just go to hannity.com, you can send us even videotapes, maybe wire, emails, we are going to put them up every night for @seanhannity on Twitter. We'll do it tomorrow night.
