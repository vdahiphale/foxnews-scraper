They didn't think that he really lied, so much has misremembered. That's a big deal that something happened here. But in general, we have a story that we are supposed to believe that there was treasonous collusion with Russia to steal an election and what we actually get is learning that there was diplomatic ground work being laid by an incoming administration.

We have an FBI that let go their chief investigator on this Russia probe because he was proven to be biased. He was tweeting out insults or tweeting out hatred towards Trump. He was also the chief investigator on the Hillary Clinton email probe. We know that she broke the law. We know she obstructed justice, and she got away with it. Everyone around her was granted immunity. So the FBI's credibility really is in play here.

      "utterance": "A little bit yes. I mean, they are saying that you know, it depends on what they ask because when you hear that somebody is reporting around a star like Matt Lauer you might say to him, hey, what's going on here? Is there something we should know about? And if he dismisses it maybe you give your $20 million a year star the benefit of the doubt. But I think the difference that they are saying is that they were presented on Monday with hard evidence from an actual accuser not buzz in media circles."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERRER",
      "utterance": "But it wouldn't have been just buzz in media circles if somebody had set up an atmosphere where these women could have come forward sooner. I really think that's part of what we're dealing with here. You need to be proactive in these cases. The pain that these women have gone through. And you know, by the way, Howie, I worked for a guy, Ed Joyce at Channel 2 News WCBS TV in New York who had one of those buttons that shut the door. It didn't lock it. It shut it. It's the creepiest thing in the world. And this is about power and privilege. The bar you're (INAUDIBLE) works here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, and especially with a $25 million a year anchor as opposed to maybe some mid-level staffer, but Lynn, this business of open secrets, so Mika Brzezinski said on the air she had heard all these rumors about Matt Lauer. She was sort of scolding herself for not doing more, but Joe Scarborough said, well, that was just about philandering not something far worse, you know, you've been in positions -- ABC Marc Halperin, where you hear things or you things after the fact?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERRER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And there is a difference. The point here is not to say there will never be romance and sex in the workplace I mean unless like the vice president that you're going to or a married man always has his wife with him, of course things are going to happen. It's ridiculous to pretend it won't. The difference is what's appropriate, what's inappropriate and what's repeated and what is not reciprocated. Reciprocal is a very big word here and you know, Howie, the law hasn't changed much. Sexual harassment has been against the law since the 1970s. The only thing that's changed is our willingness to tolerate this behavior."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. I guess that's why you wrote a piece that was titled \"All Men Are Not Pigs\" and all men are not guilty of sexual assault but certainly we've seen a lot of high profile cases now. And Matt Belloni, last point here. We now have had two of the three network morning shows fire their star anchors for sexual misconduct. Jonah Goldberg had an interesting piece in the National Review saying when this all happened at Fox, the reaction of much in the mainstream media was it's all about the Fox culture, Fox is terrible. And now that it's happened at ABC, CBS, NBC and elsewhere, it's being described as a societal problem or male problem. Do you think there is some validity on it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELLONI",
      "utterance": "Perhaps, but I think the culture itself has changed over the past few months in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and so many other scandals and so many different industries. I mean, this is a complete re- alignment of the morning news programs. But it's coming at a time when there is upheaval everywhere. Fox News was out on its own, and let's be honest, there was a culture that Roger Ailes created that permeated a lot and no one is saying that Andy Lack at NBC is perpetuating some kind of a culture there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Wait a second, let me just get Lynn on this last point. I mean, couldn't it be said that NBC did have a culture of looking the other way or tolerance given what went on over two decades."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERRER",
      "utterance": "And Howie, not just NBC. As you know, I worked at ABC News for a lon time. I worked at the Associated Press. I've worked at a few places. The number of e-mails I have gotten over the past few weeks from women saying, oh, imagine the sigh of relief that some of the guys we worked with are having now that they are retired."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Fascinating point. Let me just quickly mention that other media icons falling, Minnesota Public Radio firing Garrison Keillor, a radio legend over what he says was just touching a woman's back and ended up touching her bare skin. He apologized for that. And entertainment mogul Russell Simmons after a piece, Matt Belloni, in the \"Hollywood Reporter\" by screen writer Jenny Lumet saying he raped her in 1991, stepping down from his companies. Thanks a lot. Great to see you both. Appreciate it."

So, how did the \"Washington Post\" in your view handle these explosive and fake allegations from an undercover conservative activist who is trying to trap the \"Post\" reporters into saying incriminating things about Roy Moore that could be captured on videotape?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NOAH ROTHMAN, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, COMMENTARY",
      "utterance": "They handled it very well. They have been transparent about the process that they used to uncover this individual. It's kind of a sloppy operation to begin with but they demonstrated how they uncovered her identity and how they pursued this story and had a bunch of other reporters on and not just the interviewer but a variety of other print reporters. And then when Mr. O'Keefe is exposed, he put out these videos of other Post reporters in candid settings describing being very professional, not getting ahead of the Russia investigation for example and being a little critical of their editorials side for being overly critical of the president. If this was an attempt to show bias on the part of the \"Washington Post,\" it backfired spectacularly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Let me just mention that because he thought it was a great got you. National Security reporter Dan Lamothe said the news side is trying to critically call bull when there is some bull of only Donald Trump and also give him credit when there is credit, which sounds like a good approach to me. You say that James O'Keefe, controversial guy, he's got one criminal conviction for this sort of thing, based this whole undercover sting on an assumption -- you call it an ignorant assumption of how the mainstream media work and whether a paper like \"The Post\" would rush into print with this half-baked allegation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROTHMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes. I can only imagine that the assumption of ignorance and malice on the part of Mr. O'Keefe and his colleagues drove them to send this compromised actress to play a role for which they advertised online to a bunch of professional back-checkers and assumed that it would get through. You can only assume that that would work based on your notion that these people are acting in very bad faith. Similarly, these face saving efforts, these videos of \"The Post\" reporters undercover were only on the assumption of ignorance in the part of the audience because an audience might not know that reporters and editorial side of a newspaper have a kind of a conflicting relationship at times. And it's sort of your job to explain to an audience that there's a distinction between a reporters and an editorial side of a newspaper."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. I know a lot of people is skeptical about that but I can tell you that that is true. Now, this was an effort obviously to use lies and deception. Jamie Phillips had a phony name, phony job, trying to really help the Moore campaign if it had been successful. And it was originally off the record but executive editor of the Post, Marty Baron said, you know, if you lie to us, if you deceive, then the off-the-record agreement goes out the window. You wrote something in\"Commentary that really caught my eye. You said that tragically, conservative media activists are becoming the debased partisan creatures they once resolve to combat. What did you mean?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROTHMAN",
      "utterance": "It was the assumption on the part of many who got into this business including myself, that your effort is to make -- create a more literate media consuming audience, an audience of media consumers who cannot be fooled by omissions and bias on the part of mainstream outlets. When activists operate like Mr. O'Keefe did in a way to exploit ignorance, not educating the audience about what the difference is between editorial side or reporting side. When you are actively trying to court that ignorance in order to advance an agenda, you become the partisan creature you once resolved to combat and that's corrupt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And you're saying this obviously as a conservative. And look, I'm not saying that it made it through media arm bias or that the coverage is always fair or perfect or not sensationalized, but in this case the \"Post\" did the right thing, looked into it and found out that it just wasn't true. Noah Rothman, thanks very much for joining us from New York this morning. Great to see you."

So, a 51-49 vote, passed at 2:00 in the morning, which is one of the reasons it's been kind of overshadowed, but \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post,\" I mean a whole bunch of news stories say this tax cut is tilted towards the wealthy and corporations. Some middle class families will pay more. Do you see that as reporting based on experts and CBO or is there an underlying feeling of opposition to the contours of this bill?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOLLIDAY",
      "utterance": "And this happened too before there was a final bill before this mad dash to pass it. And now the bills have to be reconciled. So it is a little too early to say how exactly this stands out."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "With conference committes…, but talk about the news coverage because here has been -- I've read every one of these stories, a pretty steady drum beat that this either doesn't help the middle class or increase taxes on some middle class people, which is at odds with the administration's argument that --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The problem is nobody has the bill. 500-page bill until a few hours before the Senate voted, but is the reporting on, you know, legitimate reporting of raising questions about who benefits and who doesn't, which always happens with this big messy tax bills, as if imbalanced by a look at what the positive economic impact might be of cutting taxes for individuals and for big companies?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLLIDAY",
      "utterance": "There is not much positive news coverage, but that tends to be the case with huge bills. We saw this with health care as well. There was a lot of negative coverage, a lot of discussing how things would be changed negatively. I mean of course people reading news want to know how these bills impact to them. I would say Wall Street Journal has covered it fairly. People should read mu colleague's article but back to the editorial board page, this did cause a lot of uproar because -- and I'll also give both sides. It's up to the viewer to decide if it was appropriate. But when the \"New York Times\" started tweeting out the phone numbers of senators, a lot of people said hey, that you're moving into the realm of activism and to the realm of lobbying. As the president noted, they're effectively lobbying people to oppose the bill, and that's different from what most of editorial boards do. The editorial board did say the job of the editorial board is to advocate for policies we agree with and against proposals we don't."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I do think it's fair to raise questions about how this adds a $1 trillion to the debt. It wasn't as much focused on that during the Obama administration which doubled the nation's debt. And too much focus on whether this helps Donald Trump. He's a rich businessman. If he cut taxes, he's going to benefit. I don't think that's the main point. Shelby Holliday, great to see you. Thanks for coming down --"
