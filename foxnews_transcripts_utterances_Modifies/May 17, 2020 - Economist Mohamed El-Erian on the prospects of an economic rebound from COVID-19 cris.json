There were other things that are going to be harder to do without -- without a lot of safety measures. So, we're going to see not shaking hands for a while. We're going to see using hand sanitizer a lot. We're going to see face masks where it's spreading widely, where you're within six feet to someone, especially if you're indoors. There are things that we can do so that we can start this safer. It doesn't mean you have to stay home forever. It does mean we have to be careful, because if you get the virus, it's not just about you getting sick. You could, without feeling sick, spread it to your neighbor's kid who has leukemia, and they could get deathly ill. We're all in this together. We're fighting a virus that is a really difficult enemy to fight, and it's still out there. It's going to be there.  The more we're safe from this virus, actually, the more we'll be safe from flu as well. Those things we do to physically distance, those are going to cut down our flu level as well. And if everybody gets the flu vaccine this fall, that will be helpful, too. Just keep in mind -- this is a lot worse than the flu. This is ten times deadlier. It spreads much more readily.

But it is important to recognize that there are things we can do to go out more safely, and I have friends in Georgia still and they described to me physical distancing in shops, people being very careful, that's important. Also, keep in mind, the virus mutates. It changes. It evolves. But fundamentally, when it begins the spread again, you won't see that for a few weeks because it takes about a week to get sick and another week to get very sick, and then you make other people sick.

Just keep in mind, vaccine is complicated. You have to prove it safe, you have to prove it's effective, you have to make huge quantities. You have to figure out the doses, of one dose or two, how much of it. You have to figure out who gets it first.  Health care workers would be first in line. And you got have to get it out there and explain to people what it is, monitor to see if there are adverse reactions. So, absolutely, a vaccine is the single most important weapon we could develop against this virus, but we don't have one yet. We hope we will. We hope it will be soon, but we cannot count on it.

But one thing that is highly likely is that we will be coming to a new normal. Things will be different. We won't be shaking hands for a while. We'll be using lots of hand sanitizer. We'll be safe whenever we can be. Our health care system needs to get a lot safer, not just for COVID, but for other infections as well. We'll be traveling less. We're going to see challenges with different countries not letting people in or having quarantines.

If people aren't feeling safe going out, they are not going to go to dine, to eat, to shop and do other things. That's why it's so important that to get our economy back soon, we start safe."

It's good for your health. And there are some businesses that are essential and there's some business that can start with minimal risk. There were other things that are going to be harder to do without -- without a lot of safety measures. So, we're going to see not shaking hands for a while. We're going to see using hand sanitizer a lot. We're going to see face masks where it's spreading widely, where you're within six feet to someone, especially if you're indoors. There are things that we can do so that we can start this safer. It doesn't mean you have to stay home forever. It does mean we have to be careful, because if you get the virus, it's not just about you getting sick. You could, without feeling sick, spread it to your neighbor's kid who has leukemia, and they could get deathly ill. We're all in this together. We're fighting a virus that is a really difficult enemy to fight, and it's still out there. It's going to be there. The more we're safe from this virus, actually, the more we'll be safe from flu as well. Those things we do to physically distance, those are going to cut down our flu level as well. And if everybody gets the flu vaccine this fall, that will be helpful, too. Just keep in mind -- this is a lot worse than the flu. This is ten times deadlier. It spreads much more readily. It's more likely to kill you, and we don't have any immunity naturally, and we don't yet have a vaccine."

Even got criticism from President Trump that it was moving too fast. But we have not seen the kind of spike that was widely feared with that reopening in Georgia, which raises the question -- are some public health experts, I'll include you in that, are you being too alarmist about this?"

It's really been catastrophic. But it is important to recognize that there are things we can do to go out more safely, and I have friends in Georgia still and they described to me physical distancing in shops, people being very careful, that's important. Also, keep in mind, the virus mutates. It changes. It evolves. But fundamentally, when it begins the spread again, you won't see that for a few weeks because it takes about a week to get sick and another week to get very sick, and then you make other people sick. So once there is the resumption of spread, you might not see that for a month or two. There's a lag here."

How realistic is that? Two hundred million doses of a proved, safe vaccine by the end of the year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDEN",
      "utterance": "Well, it is absolutely the right thing to do to pull out all the stops to try to make a safe and effective vaccine. And we all hope it will be available as soon as possible. Just keep in mind, vaccine is complicated. You have to prove it safe, you have to prove it's effective, you have to make huge quantities. You have to figure out the doses, of one dose or two, how much of it. You have to figure out who gets it first. Health care workers would be first in line. And you got have to get it out there and explain to people what it is, monitor to see if there are adverse reactions. So, absolutely, a vaccine is the single most important weapon we could develop against this virus, but we don't have one yet. We hope we will. We hope it will be soon, but we cannot count on it. That's why we need to get used to the fact that the virus is here for a while. We're going to change what we do so that we can restart our economy and our society as soon and safely as possible."

But we don't know how it will behave over the summer. We don't know how long it will persist and what will happen with it. No one can predict with certainty. But one thing that is highly likely is that we will be coming to a new normal. Things will be different. We won't be shaking hands for a while. We'll be using lots of hand sanitizer. We'll be safe whenever we can be. Our health care system needs to get a lot safer, not just for COVID, but for other infections as well. We'll be traveling less. We're going to see challenges with different countries not letting people in or having quarantines. And we're likely to continue to have outbreaks in places like nursing homes which are, as I said, more than two months ago, ground zero for this. We are going to see, unfortunately, thousands of deaths. But we can save a lot of lives if we focus on being in this together. There is only one enemy here, Chris, it's the virus. We're all in it together. And the more we're safe, the more we work together. It's not about economy versus health. If people are poor, they're less likely to be healthy.

I remember when you were there and there were various pandemics, Ebola, things like that, I would be talking to you as the lead person for the CDC and the lead person for the administration. This time, it seems like the CDC has been sidelined to some degree. They have not had a public briefing and more than two months. One, do you agree that the CDC, that its role has been diminished?

We were operating in a normal world, as you and I define it, we then swung all the way on the other side to a lockdown, and now, we're going to swing back and forth trying to find where the new equilibrium is. So, it's going to be a neat V, it's going to be more like a series of Ws, if you like. But think of a pendulum swinging, and we don't know the magnitude of the swings, and we don't know the duration of the swing or the settling point. So it really is an uncertain outlook."

And it's going to be a long time until you and I trust each other. It's what Eric Schmidt calls the information failure. It's very difficult for me to convince you I'm healthy and for you to convince me I'm healthy, until we get a vaccine. So the health issue doesn't get resolved overnight. Secondly, you have shaken consumer confidence. You have shaken behaviors. Our economy isn't wired for social distancing. So we're going to have to discover how to do that. And third, businesses. It's not clear how you restart a business when different states are doing different things and when different countries are going to do different things. So, we have these three massive uncertainties all in play at the same time, and it is very hard to say, oh, everything is going to be resolved overnight. We hope so.

And it's a good thing we have it and it's a good thing that Washington reacted, $5 trillion worth of reaction, because despite that, this week also gave us not just horrible unemployment number but the worst industrial output collapse in a century and the worst retail sale collapse on record. So, we are hurting and thank God that Washington has reacted on relief measures. What's important now is not to lose sight of the second phase. This is not just about winning the war against the global depression and a U.S. depression. This is about securing the peace, about making sure that we emerge from this also strong. So, the next stage has to also focus on key issues like infrastructure, labor retailing and a retooling, safety nets, things that are going to be critical if we are to bounce back in a sustainable manner, otherwise, we're going to get stuck in a new normal of really mediocre growth and greater social tensions."

We feel very big disruptions of our everyday life. The markets are saying, look, that's fine but that's all short-term. We look to the long term. And when they look to the long term, they see a win- win hypothesis. I think they are too optimistic but let me explain what they see. First, they bet that we're going to come back quickly, the V. And if we come back quickly, then looking through, which is the phrase you hear the most, this awful period is the right thing to do. But they have a second win, Chris. If we get that wrong, it doesn't matter because the Federal Reserve is buying assets and is buying assets that we never imagined it would buy. So, there is this sense of comfort that you get to win whatever the outlook. I think, Chris, that it's too optimistic, but markets do what they do."

And we had several warnings from really respected investors. But I also understand those who say that's fine, but you are dinosaurs, we are betting on something different. We are betting on the Federal Reserve. And if you have a printing press in the basement, then you're going to have a massive influence on the markets.

It's also likely, Chris -- and this isn't a bad thing; it's a fine thing -- you know, maybe 10 percent, 20 percent of parents aren't going to want their kids to return to school in the fall. They're going to want to continue online. That actually is fine, as long as those parents are there with those kids; they don't -- they don't have to leave to go to work.

Now, you need that social side, right, and it's a little bit harder to get that social side in an online setting. But academically, there are no excuses for every kid not to be ready to accomplish their grade-level work, and we can do that online; we can do that in schools; and we can do it through a hybrid, which is what's likely to occur this year, as while generally schools are open, there might need to be periodic, regional, or site-based closures."

      "speaker": "POLIS",

You know, not everybody has the luxury of having a two-parent household where one parent can stay home. There's many single parents and there's many parent -- families where both parents work. And so you need -- that's why we've had day care going throughout this entire piece. We've actually learned a lot from that day care experience that will translate into a safer school experience. You know, schools are reasonably safe places to be, Chris, and -- and we always have issues, and there's always challenges. We had a school district in western Colorado that had to close for a week because of norovirus about six months ago. That was what created vomiting and intense stomach disease, and they had to close for about a week to clean that out of their schools. So schools are no stranger to this sort of thing. It's just going to be a bit more prevalent this year. And schools are really working hard on making sure their teachers are set up for success in the online environment."

This is, no question, from an epidemiological perspective, a less severe, significantly, almost infinitesimal, fatality rate for kids. But the thing is, kids live with parents; kids live with grandparents; kids are around teachers. So that's where it gets a little bit more complicated, Chris. You know, it's -- is it a risk for kids? Nothing is risk-free. But kids encounter all sorts of germs in school. This one has a more minor manifestation for 12-year-olds, 14-year- olds and eight-year-olds, although, you know, it's not without any risk.

What the people of Colorado and the people of the country want to know is how many people died of COVID-19. In our state about 900 have died from COVID-19, on their death certificate, or from the attending physician. About 1,100 have died with it. Those 200 in the middle, it might have been a contributing factor, but it wasn't deemed the sole factor or the only factor in their death. I also want to point out, Chris, that of course there's likely cases that should be counted as COVID deaths that people have missed, doctors have missed. There's probably some of those as well. But the numbers are all fairly close, whether it's 900 or 1,100 in our state, you know, a few 100,000 across the world. We know that this can kill people of all ages; it's particularly dangerous for people in their 70s and 80s and those with pre-existing conditions. But it's a bad bug."

      "utterance": "President Trump calls Obama -- \"Obamagate,\" rather, pushing that issue, and former vice president Joe Biden pushing back on one aspect of the alleged scandal, that he was part of an effort to target former Trump national security adviser General Michael Flynn. Time now for our Sunday group, GOP strategist Karl Rove, pollster and Fox News contributor Kristin Soltis Anderson, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams. Karl, is Obamagate an effective campaign issue this year, do you think, the argument that -- that Barack Obama and Joe Biden broke the law to try to hurt his presidency, including going after former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't know who broke the law, but somebody did. It is routine and legal for government officials to ask for a name and a confidential classified briefing to be, quote, \"unmasked.\" What is illegal is that somebody then leak that name. And unfortunately for Joe Biden, the fact is the name of Michael Flynn as a subject of an investigation was leaked on January 12th, the day that he had requested the unmasking of Flynn's name in a classified report. Now, is this going to be what the election's settled on? No, I don't think so. But it does stink. We had the leak -- the leaking of Michael Flynn's name. And we now know in the filing that the Department of Justice made with the judge, the investigation of Flynn was closed in December; the documents to close it were written up but they were not filed properly.  And in early January, Peter Strzok tells his lover Lisa Page, \"The incompetence of our department has saved us; I've gotten position from the seventh floor\" -- meaning James Comey, the director of the FBI -- \"to interview Flynn, because the paperwork wasn't properly filed.\" Comey meets with President Obama, tells him that they're going to be interviewing Flynn but doesn't give a heads-up to his boss, secretary -- A.G. Yates, and doesn't give the defensive briefing to the Trump campaign that normally happens when there's a counterintelligence. And it just goes on and on. And it stinks. Now, is it going to settle the election? No, I don't think so, but it does ask some very serious questions that need to be answered."

Do you see from your polling any sign that swing voters, not the Trump base, who we know is fascinated and outraged by this, but the swing voters want to relitigate the Russia investigation, including the targeting of General Flynn?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "It is unlikely that this is what swing voters are interested in relitigating. Recall, however, that when President Trump was facing impeachment, during a moment where there was clear airtime, where there really wasn't much else going on, save perhaps the Democratic primary, you didn't actually see numbers for President Trump moving that much one way or the other. If anything, he had a slight increase. But now you have 88,000 deaths; you have 36 million unemployed; you have this crisis hanging over everything, that is absolutely the number one thing that swing voters are looking for. How are you handling this crisis? Everything else is just noise."

And I also want you to weigh in on another attack line that the president, President Trump is using against Joe Biden, that at age 77, he is not up to the job of becoming president. I want to play a clip from one of those events from the studio basement in Delaware, from Joe Biden's home there, in which he frankly mixed up the number of lives and jobs lost from this pandemic.  Take a look."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, first thing that -- let me just say, Chris, that with regard to the so-called Obamagate, there is no Obamagate. President Trump himself can't even say what President Trump -- I'm sorry -- what President Obama did that was wrong or criminal. And if any of us right here on this show lied to the FBI, twice plead guilty, we'd be in jail right now -- right now. So, I mean, I don't -- I just think this is a total effort, if you're thinking of it in strategic terms, to distract from the Trump administration's failed handling of the coronavirus crisis. With regard to age, I think that President Trump turns 74 next month. Joe Biden's 77. The only one of them that seems to prefer conspiracy theories and talking about putting disinfectant in your body is President Trump, not Joe Biden. And with regard to the campaign trail, we live in a moment when telework, Zoom conferences, have become the new normal. And so far, in terms of campaigning, fund-raising, giving interviews..."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Right. I want to move on to another subject, and that was the Friday night announcement that President Trump is firing the State Department inspector general, a fellow named Steve Linick. He's the fourth independent watchdog the president has dismissed this year.  Linick was reportedly investigating Secretary of State Pompeo and his wife and the way they were using a government employee for personal chores or business. Karl, one, how did Bush 43 handle the inspectors general in his administration? And are you troubled that President Trump seems to be trying to clear the house of the I.G.s?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, I thought it was interesting in this case that we immediately had two members of the Democratic House leadership jump in and say they knew why he had been replaced and accused Secretary Pompeo of using a government employee for personal chores. Now, we haven't heard that from the inspector general. And if the inspector general had opened such an investigation, the new inspector general will be bound by law to continue that investigation. So it -- the president of the United States has the right to remove inspectors general, period. And if President Trump decided that he had no longer had confidence in the inspector general at State, he had a right to remove him. So I want to see this thing play out. But I thought it was a quick drive- by slander by the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee and others in the Democratic leadership, and as a result..."

However, I do think that you've had these instances of Democrats, sort of, not making the number one issue the number one issue, trying to turn -- not let a crisis go to waste.
