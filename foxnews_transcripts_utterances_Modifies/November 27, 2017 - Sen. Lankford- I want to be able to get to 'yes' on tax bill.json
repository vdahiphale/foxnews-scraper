Tonight, Mick Mulvaney is in charge just about a block from where I'm standing here at the White House, insisting, at least for now, he has won the power struggle, issuing a 30-day freeze on new hiring of bureaucrats at that agency and the issuing of new regulations that conservatives believe have been stifling economic growth. This was a strange day that started early, about 7:56 a.m. when aides to Mulvaney started tweeting these photos of him hard at work at the desk of the chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and meeting with staffers at the agency to show he was in charge. Literally, one minute after that first tweet, Leandra English tried to show she was boss sending an agency-wide e-mail at 7:57 to all staff that was signed \"acting director.\" English was the choice of Obama appointee Richard Cordray who abruptly resigned right after Thanksgiving. Mulvaney was not to be deterred; armed not just with legal memos showing that President Trump, not a leftover Obama appointee, has the executive power to install an acting voice, boss. Mulvaney was also armed with doughnuts. Yes, that shopping bag that said, Dunkin, does catering. He marched back into the agency about 10:00 a.m. and issued a memo telling all staff to do two things, ignore all instructions from English and come get some doughnuts. Here's what all these matters to our viewers: this agency created by then President Obama, who initially installed Elizabeth Warren as the chief before she became a Senator and the office quickly became a flashpoint.  Created by the Dodd-Frank Act after the financial crisis, Democrats insisted they were putting in new safety valves for consumers while Republicans charge regulations on auto lending, for example, actually made it harder for average Americans to get auto loans.

We have two conflicting statutes: President Trump relies on a 1998 statute, which says when there's a vacancy at the head of an administrative agency, the president appoints an acting director until he nominates and the Senate confirms a full-time director. But the CFPB, which is this particular agency, which is enacted by Congress in 2010 says when there's a vacancy in the position of director the deputy director becomes a director.  So, you have to statutes that are clashing, which is why the court will decide which one prevails. Normally, when two statutes disagree -- and they're written by the same body, the Congress -- the court decides that the more recent one is the one that would follow. That's the one that backs up Mrs. English, not the one that backs the president because Congress was aware of the old one and decided to leapfrog over it.   S0, the English argument, the Obama argument is this agency was intended to be immune from politics, it was intended to regulate the economy and not even be answerable to Congress because it's not even paid by Congress, its paid by the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump's argument is, wait a minute, in a representative democracy, how can there be some entity in the government that nobody can control? Congress can't control the money that's going to --",

This was done by a bunch of academics like Elizabeth Warren who lied about her ancestry in order to give him a job and keep a job -- that's cultural appropriation, a whole another issue. But here's what happens in the real world: the real world that people in Congress often don't know, if you try to get a consumer loan today because of Dodd-Frank and the extraordinary regulations, it may cost more to process the loan than the bank could ever make in giving the loan and charging interest.   So, one banker told me, he said, we don't make consumer loans anymore, we just stopped them. Now, what kind of loan is that? That the $25,000 loan that helps a family to add a room in the house when their fourth child comes. It's a small business guy who needs it to put inventory on his shelves so he can stay in business. It's the kind of loan that is the bread and butter of America, the bread and butter of real consumers. But the cost of it has made it impossible, and that's why this agency is out of control.",

This was a strange day that started early, about 7:56 a.m. when aides to Mulvaney started tweeting these photos of him hard at work at the desk of the chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and meeting with staffers at the agency to show he was in charge. Literally, one minute after that first tweet, Leandra English tried to show she was boss sending an agency-wide e-mail at 7:57 to all staff that was signed \"acting director.\" English was the choice of Obama appointee Richard Cordray who abruptly resigned right after Thanksgiving. Mulvaney was not to be deterred; armed not just with legal memos showing that President Trump, not a leftover Obama appointee, has the executive power to install an acting voice, boss. Mulvaney was also armed with doughnuts. Yes, that shopping bag that said, Dunkin, does catering. He marched back into the agency about 10:00 a.m. and issued a memo telling all staff to do two things, ignore all instructions from English and come get some doughnuts. Here's what all these matters to our viewers: this agency created by then President Obama, who initially installed Elizabeth Warren as the chief before she became a Senator and the office quickly became a flashpoint. Created by the Dodd-Frank Act after the financial crisis, Democrats insisted they were putting in new safety valves for consumers while Republicans charge regulations on auto lending, for example, actually made it harder for average Americans to get auto loans.

We have two conflicting statutes: President Trump relies on a 1998 statute, which says when there's a vacancy at the head of an administrative agency, the president appoints an acting director until he nominates and the Senate confirms a full-time director. But the CFPB, which is this particular agency, which is enacted by Congress in 2010 says when there's a vacancy in the position of director the deputy director becomes a director. So, you have to statutes that are clashing, which is why the court will decide which one prevails. Normally, when two statutes disagree -- and they're written by the same body, the Congress -- the court decides that the more recent one is the one that would follow. That's the one that backs up Mrs. English, not the one that backs the president because Congress was aware of the old one and decided to leapfrog over it. S0, the English argument, the Obama argument is this agency was intended to be immune from politics, it was intended to regulate the economy and not even be answerable to Congress because it's not even paid by Congress, its paid by the Federal Reserve. Donald Trump's argument is, wait a minute, in a representative democracy, how can there be some entity in the government that nobody can control? Congress can't control the money that's going to --"

So, one banker told me, he said, we don't make consumer loans anymore, we just stopped them. Now, what kind of loan is that? That the $25,000 loan that helps a family to add a room in the house when their fourth child comes. It's a small business guy who needs it to put inventory on his shelves so he can stay in business. It's the kind of loan that is the bread and butter of America, the bread and butter of real consumers. But the cost of it has made it impossible, and that's why this agency is out of control."

They are not protecting, they're not a protective entity where they're stopping things from happening that are bad for consumers.

The big picture here is that the purpose of anything in government is to make sure there are checks and balances. This has no checks and balances. It's an administrative and regulatory body that's run amok, and I just can't believe that the people in that agency didn't understand that.

Everyone's looking at a very complicated bill, and saying, OK, what's it going to take to be able to get to \"yes\"? I don't hear anyone at our conference saying they don't want to do it.

In Oklahoma, 81 percent of the people that pay the individual mandate fine, make $50,000 or less. These are individuals that can't afford the insurance anymore, and they certainly can't afford a new fine from the IRS. So, we're trying to be able to help those folks in the middle class not have that additional fine. This doesn't take away the subsidies. I've had folks say those individuals will lose their subsidies, that's not true. Those subsidies still remain exactly as they are, but we take away the fine punishing those in the middle class that can't afford the extra insurance made exactly the Washington, D.C., way, and they want to be able to buy insurance they can afford rather than what Washington D.C. is compelling them to buy."

Those come not in just one big bill, but in a lot of small bills. We identified wasteful programs, wasteful grants. We defined areas where the federal government is not doing its job. We call it \"100 ways the federal government has dropped the ball.\" So, this federal fumble guide that we put out on our Web site, anyone can look at it for free. It's at Lankford.senate.gov, and you get a chance to take a look at it. It's what we talked about over Thanksgiving, quite frankly, at our table, to be able to walk through what is out there and what it really seems and how can we actually fix this.

You pointed it out and Senator Lankford pointed it out. Steve Daines of Montana, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, their concern about the treatment of small business versus corporations. You have the deficit hawks, Lankford, Flake and Corker who are concerned about what's going to happen to our growing deficit? Are we going to match this with some spending restraint? You have others that are concerned about whether or not the mandate -- Susan Collins' concerned about whether or not to repeal of the individual mandate is included in there. But, look, I sensed that this is a process that is coming together where there are people narrowing their differences, or nobody is saying it's got to be my way or the highway.

Those are their two main goals that they want to achieve. So, you know, is there a possibility that there are sticklers who refused to get to \"yes\" that causes thing to --"

That means, I've got something I need, I want to try and get it and I'm willing to settle for some, maybe not all. And look, in this big complex piece of legislation, it's so complex, if you change the dial here, you can compensate for it someplace else. Unlike, you know, we're going to get rid of Obamacare or we're not. You know, your state's going to be better off or it's going to be worse here. You can do some of those dials.

Now, that's really not completely accurate because of a thing called current policy. This, in essence, means that hidden in that deficit number are $400 billion of offsets if we just simply let some things expire as they're supposed to expire. That will reduce their deficit to roughly about a trillion dollars over the next ten years. The federal government is supposed to take in $43 trillion in revenue over the course of that time. So, the question is: can we find, you know, two cents -- two-and-a-quarter-cents in savings out of every dollar of revenue that we're bringing in? And that's the concern that Lankford and others have, do we have a commitment to long-term restraint of spending so that the deficit doesn't really grow by a trillion dollars, or even more."

In 2003, the Bush administration led an effort to cut the capital gains taxes. The estimate was that it would generate $215 billion in revenue over the next four years. The actual amount was $377 billion because of economic growth, so they were only off by 75 percent and we're likely to see that on this as well.

      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, this has become a huge issue for Democrats, and we talked about this a couple weeks ago that there were suddenly op-eds coming out saying he should have resigned. And a lot, actually, being pushed forward by my generation, by millennials, who in the '90s weren't really paying close attention. They wouldn't have fallen as in love with bubba as people who wore around voting for him saying how did this slide? You know, how does this go on? And I think that bringing it up now is important. But to Charlie's point, yeah, it does seem like the magic word is I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican, because right now Donald Trump is certainly not saying Roy Moore seems like a guy you want hanging out with their kids, but he saying we don't need another Democrat in the senate, we're going to lose everything. We're barely have control with our majority. I don't know if they're going to be a tax reform across. So that's how he's making the case and for the future of the court. I wish people would stop playing partisan politics, but I would say that Nancy Pelosi did make a good point that what Al Franken is accused of and admitted to is very, very different from what Roy Moore did, which is different from what John Conyers did."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, I thought what Nancy Pelosi said about due process is very interesting. I mean, that is the other part of this equation. If she wasn't talking about due process for Roy Moore, but the fact of the matter is that there is no process in this situation. It's sort of like groupthink, you know, and you either get fried or you get to live in the end, Charlie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And that is a very important part of all of this. But in the case of Roy Moore, you know, I read that first account and I believed every word of it, and I think he ought to get out of the race, but I'm not an Alabama voter and I don't make that decision. And the good people of Alabama get to make that decision and they'll make that decision on whether they believe the accusations or whether they don't believe the accusations, and that is not a bad way to make that determination. But, you know, going back to the thing about bill Clinton what I think is one of the most interesting aspects of all of this is that because people -- so many of his defenders defended his behavior back then -- and I'm going to what Jessica said about the millennials and the first time that they heard so many of these accusations, to what degree all of that prevented the first woman from being elected president this year or even eight years ago, it's a pretty amazing thing to think about."

So coming up next, terrorists targeting trains, the new tool that police are using to keep you safe on more than 140,000 miles of rail lines across this country, but can it work?

William Douglas Campbell is said to have intimate knowledge of Hillary Clinton's role in that controversial deal with Russia. But a new report by Yahoo News says, quote, federal officials have serious questions about the credibility of a key witness in congressional investigation of Hillary Clinton's role in the sale of uranium mining company to Russian interest. So the person who knows her story and what he knows probably better than anyone joins me know. Victoria Toensing is the FBI informant attorney. Victoria, good to have you with us tonight. Welcome."

And that is -- as early as 2009-10, the U.S. government was well aware that the Russian uranium industry, the nuclear industry for Russia was corrupt, and how did they know that? Because my client was working undercover and providing them all the information about the bribes and the kickbacks and all the trips. Also, during that time, 2009, 2010, the U.S. government was well aware that Putin wanted to dominate the uranium worldwide, globally, and part of that plan was to buy Uranium One. And how did they know that? Because my client was providing them all the documents..."

But I just want to get to this credibility issue and let you address that because the accusation is that in a prior unrelated case, prosecutors dropped William Campbell as a witness because they considered him to be unreliable. Did that happen or not?"

      "speaker": "TOENSING",
      "utterance": "No. That reporting from Michael Isikoff is pathetic and na<ve, and what few facts he uses in the story he has wrong. I'm going to give you an example. You just repeated the allegation that he said, oh, the prosecution of the man involved in the Russian bribery, Mikeron was his name, was unrelated to the sale in 2009. No, that's why the sale shouldn't have gone through, because in 2009, Mikeron was taking -- making bribes and making threats. They're intimately related. Not only that, any sophisticated reporter knows full well that the Russian nuclear industry is monolithic, all the companies, even if they have different names, all report to Putin. Michael Isikoff has not read one document..."

      "utterance": "Let me ask you something else, because when I'm interested in is, so while your client was undercover working on trying to figure out whether or not there was undue influence from Russia, and whether or not they were actually winning anybody over in the Obama administration, namely Hillary Clinton, what was the awareness level of the Obama administration, and why weren't they told all of this supposedly explosive information, and why didn't they derail this purchase if all of that was true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOENSING",
      "utterance": "It's the question that I'm asking, and reporters like John Solomon and Sarah Carter are asking. My client was told by the FBI that high officials at the FBI were being told about it. I don't know what that means Bob Mueller, but if it did, Bob Mueller, I assume, would have reported that to Eric Holder, who was the attorney general and who sat on the body that made the decision to sell the Uranium One. My client was told that President Obama was being briefed on it, and that we can find that out because congress can get the presidential daily briefings. But I want to add one more thing, the FBI gave my client a check for over $50,000 in 2016. That's two years after he was so-called unreliable. And Michael Isikoff, he should have known that before he did the reporting period. He's regurgitating conclusions that are put out there by Clinton supporters."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Before I go, I mean, do you think it was because the Obama administration decided that Russia was so yesterday and there really wasn't anything to worry about, so any concerns that were raised were just not that important, and that they weren't really a force to be reckoned with?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOENSING",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So a story that dominated the 2016 race and raised serious questions about the Democratic nominee and national security secrets, now the lid is being blown off the Hillary Clinton email scandal. You have not heard everything there is to know about this because one of the men who was at the heart of that investigation has now broken his silence to Fox News. What did Inspector General Charles McCullough find out, and why was he on the list of people who was first to be fired if Hillary Clinton won the presidency? Tony Shaffer on that next."

So what was really in those handful of highly classified emails that we heard so much about? Did she put our national security at risk, and was the intelligence community then ordered to cover that up? Those are the questions. Former Inspector General Charles McCullough worked directly under James Clapper, and he is now breaking his silence."

Some emails that were beyond top secret, even congress couldn't see. And Martha, for his work, for his 26 years working with the Department of Justice, the FBI, all this work, he was trying to be the fair arbiter of telling the truth. And what happened, Martha, was simply this. He told the truth during a time of political upheaval for the opposition, that being Jim Clapper, John Brennan, and all them, were coordinating with members of congress like Dianne Feinstein and the Hillary Clinton campaign. So what he found himself doing is trying to be an honest man, confronted with collusion behind -- of all the Democrats who would come to the conclusion there is no classified information when, Martha, he found detailed residual hard-core classified information on Hillary Clinton server."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You know, so she brings this information, he's asked to do this investigation, he find these, you know, more than classified documents, he brings them to James Clapper and says here's what we've got. What was James Clapper reason for shutting him up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, my opinion of Jim Clapper has been well-documented on this network. I will just say that apparently by his unwillingness to accept on face value his conclusions, which, by the way, were to recommend Hillary Clinton for criminal charges and do a damage assessment, Jim Clapper did two things the opposite. He did not protect Mr. McCullough. That was his job. That's your job as the leader. You protect the men who bring to the information. Secondly, to this day there's never been a damage assessment. Now keep in mind, Martha, it's required by law any time you have a compromise with classified information to do a full-blown damage assessment. I and others are calling for hearings on this to find out why on earth we haven't done what was required by law based on what Mr. McCullough found in Hillary Clinton's email."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "SHAFFER",
      "utterance": "No, not at all. Completely separate. That was a criminal investigation which I and others argue was not completely honest. This has to be done by intelligence professionals examining every email based on the likely compromise of that information. What would be the damage? Comey did none of that. And so, this is clearly what I think needs to be done. It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican, we need to know what information was lost, period."

There's actually evidence of Podesta, John Podesta, the campaign manager of Hillary Clinton campaign coordinating with Diane Feinstein, talking about Mr. McCullough, and what was to become of him. And look, it's inappropriate to even think about using the government for purposes of retaliation, but that's exactly what Hillary Clinton and her ilk were planning to do."

Harry designed the ring which apparently has two smaller diamonds that belonged to his mother Princess Diana. Markle will be the first American to marry a British royal since 1936, when Wallis Simpson married Prince Edward the 7th to then advocate because she was a twice divorced American. But everybody apparently on board from the queen on down. The couple met through a mutual friend in the summer of 2016. Harry and Meghan, a spring Royal wedding is planned. That's nice, right? A nice note to end the evening on. That's \"The Story\" from here. We'll be back tomorrow night at 7:00 here in New York. Tucker Carlson is up next. Have a great night, everybody.
