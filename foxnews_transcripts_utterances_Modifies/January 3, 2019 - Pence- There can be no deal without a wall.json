That's just ahead. But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill, one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress?  We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us. Pelosi has signaled her total opposition to securing America's border with Mexico, for example. Watch.",

Here's a quote from a Democrat to Politico. \"Now companies are focused like a laser on identifying top African-American talent with Congressional Black Caucus relationships to help them understand and mitigate the striking lack of diversity within their corporations.\" So, what Democrats are saying is you need to hire our friends or else we're going to punish you. Why is that not corruption?",

It's not even illegal immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent talking about it. The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream. And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class American families are declining. So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it last night.",

In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in marriage rates over the past 35 years. Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or in prison. So, it's not a small thing. And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of fact. We wish it weren't. In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually matters.

So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates those rules must be punished. This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being made. This is why comedy is dying. It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all terrified. We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in charge of the country. These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this moment with shame and horror. But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then? What could they do about it? They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that.

Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country. If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with that? Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks. That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis. So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense Council. Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined, these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion. Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find out. None of them even responded. And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping. Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical environment and did virtuous work. But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money doing. And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least, they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment. So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh. Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would have the added benefit of punishing you. Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist.

That's just ahead. But first, Democrats have returned to power on one half of Capitol Hill, one Chamber. After eight years out, Nancy Pelosi is once again the Speaker of the House. What can we expect from this brand new Congress? We don't have to speculate too much because they're already telling us.

And it probably was a result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration.

No, it's not higher GDP growth despite what some think-tank people will tell you. It's not, definitely not, some obscure Middle-Eastern hellhole our leaders claim we should be policing forever. It's not even illegal immigration as big a problem as that is, and as much time as we have spent talking about it. The real problem is families. America used to be the best country in the world for families. Americans could get married and afford to raise their own children. If your kids worked hard, you could expect they'd be a little more successful maybe than you were. That was called the American Dream. And for a small group of affluent people, it still exists. They're still living like it's 1965, and good for them. But for everyone else, that Dream is dying. America's middle-class is in decline because middle-class American families are declining. So, the question is why is that happening? Well there are a lot of reasons it's happening. But a major driver of family collapse, the one that nobody ever talks about for some reason is simple economics, and we explained it last night."

More drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed to the next generation."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Now, let's be clear about that statement. First of all, it is factually true, and that's the essential test of anything. That's the test that we go by. In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-Conservative Brookings Institution found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in marriage rates over the past 35 years. Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage rates go down, and single parenthood becomes more common. And that, as you could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or in prison. So, it's not a small thing. And, by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over long periods of time. This is real. So, what we said is a statement of fact. We wish it weren't. In an ideal world, none of this would matter. The marriage rate never would have declined when manufacturing died and everything in Middle America would be fine. But it's not. And we're not in charge of that. All we can do is tell the truth about what happened, which we did because it actually matters. And that turned out to be too much for the people who believe it's their job to prevent you from knowing why your country is going down the tubes. Those people got very angry. Here's a selection."

So, it's true but it's not on the list of approved talking points, so it can't ever be said out loud. Those are the rules. And anyone who violates those rules must be punished. This is very common. And if you're wondering how we wound up in the Dark Age we're currently living through, this is how we did. This is why important science is no longer being conducted. This is why art isn't being made. This is why comedy is dying. It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end of creativity. It's why the rest of us stand by like cowards as the innocent are punished for crimes they didn't commit because we're all terrified. We're terrified of being denounced by some mindless ideologue on TV, or shamed and ostracized on social media for stepping out of line, or silenced completely by some big tech firm. A mob of angry children is suddenly in charge of the country. These aren't people seeking a revolution. They're fighting for the status quo to protect their own status. They are drunk on power. And they're looking for new people to hurt. Someday, we're going to look back on this moment with shame and horror. But, in the meantime, we should remember that terror only works if we play along with it. So, what if we decided not to? What if all of us decided to tell the truth about something every day in public? What would happen then? What could they do about it? They can't punish everybody. We're the majority. Let's try that."

And it seems to me that when it happens to two different groups, the very same thing that would be the wake-up call for our policymakers to say, wait a second. Maybe we should get involved in thinking about how to fix this considering in our neighborhoods, where rich people live in -- my neighborhood, for example, there are no single mothers.

Yellowstone, Big Sur, Yosemite, the vast forests of Maine, places like that are what make this a great country. If being an environmentalist means anything, it means protecting those places and countless others across this continental nation, keeping them clean and protected. So, how are professional environmentalists doing with that? Well, we know, this week, the federal government is shut down and that means the National Park Service is not cleaning up in our national parks. That means that trash is piling up. That is an environmental crisis. So, we wanted to know how our environmental watchdogs were responding to it, so we contacted this country's four biggest environmental groups to see what they were doing about it, The Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the National -- Natural Resources Defense Council. Go to their websites. They'll tell you how they're protecting the soil and water. By the way, they raise a lot of money on those claims. Combined, these four groups have an annual revenue of well over $1 billion. Over The Nature Conservancy, their endowment is over $6 billion. So, they could easily help. Picking up trash is not expensive. They're certainly rich enough to do that. Are they doing it? We called it in (ph) to find out. None of them even responded. And that, of course, means no. They're not doing it. They're not helping. Now, that may be sad to those of you who grow up -- grew up sending money to The Sierra Club, which used to concern itself with our physical environment and did virtuous work. But if you've been paying attention for the past 10 years, you shouldn't be surprised. Actual garbage that's ruining nature? Well that seems small in importance compared to, I don't know, promoting carbon taxes or unlimited immigration or gender theory or the various other priorities of the Democratic Party, which is what these groups spend their time and money doing. And, by the way, that's fine. Lots of groups in Washington do those exact things. They're political consultants. That's their job. But, at least, they're honorable enough to pretend they're not protecting the environment. So, these groups may not care anymore about picking up garbage but they do like the idea of controlling your behavior. Across America, scolds (ph) are stamping out plastic straws, already banned here in Washington, but it won't stop with straws. Think it will? Huh. Some groups are promoting taxes on meat. They're doing this in the name of promoting health and fighting climate change. Of course, these taxes would have the added benefit of punishing you. Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist.

Contrary to many people's expectations, technology companies have turned out to be the single biggest threat to your freedom of speech, to many of your rights and, in fact, your well-being, certainly to your privacy, as an American. So, we're always looking to know more. Trace Gallagher joins us tonight with what he's found. Trace?"

But the professional networking site, LinkedIn, blocked his profile page in China, because of \"Specific content,\" though the company did not say what specific content ran afoul of Chinese policy. Instead, they wrote this, quoting, \"While we strongly support freedom of expression, we recognized that when we launched that we would need to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in China.\" But Human Rights groups say this has nothing to do with violating Chinese laws and everything to do with trying to silence Chinese dissidents. Turns out, Zhou was a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. But breaking tonight, LinkedIn has now restored Mr. Zhou's page saying it made a mistake. And separately, we thought you should know that documents filed by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce show that in 2017, Google shifted $23 billion to a tax shelter in Bermuda. The move is legal, but it does allow the company to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes and European withholding taxes. Google says it pays all its taxes and complies with all laws. Tucker?"

Well, back in this country, as major tech platforms continue to suppress free speech, people who seek to think for themselves will have to look for alternatives. And if those alternatives don't exist, they may need to be created. Dave Rubin has reached that conclusion after years of thinking about it. He, of course, hosts The Rubin Report on YouTube. And, until recently, he raised money for his show on the crowd-funding site, Patreon. But now, after Patreon purged several dissenting voices from its service, Rubin and Professor Jordan Peterson have announced they will be leaving. Dave Rubin joins us tonight to explain what he's doing. Dave, thanks a lot for coming on tonight. One of the reasons this was such an ex--"

You can't make a living, etcetera, etcetera,\" and it's like, you know what, at some point, if -- if a couple of us that have some influence don't stand up, then nobody will. And then this whole -- this whole game, this whole -- this whole beautiful game about freedom on the internet, it'll all be over before we know it. And that's why Jordan and I are doing this.
