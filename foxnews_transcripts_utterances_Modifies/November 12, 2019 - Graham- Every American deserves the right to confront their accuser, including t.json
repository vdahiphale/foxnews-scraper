      "sentences": "Just honest, we tell the truth here. All right. Welcome to “Hannity.”  Breaking tonight, it is impeachment eve. The circus is coming to town, and we are just now hours away from the corrupt, compromised, coward, and congenital liar Adam Schiff show on Capitol Hill, brought to you by him and his fellow, raging, psychotic Democrats and their top allies in the media mob.  First, though, this. This is important. Everything you're going to see in the next two weeks is rigged. This is a phony show trial. There is zero due process, none.  It is yet another fraudulent hoax, conspiracy theory. It is another witch hunt. It is wrought with rampant -- I mean rampant, putrid hypocrisy, a repulsive double standard. By the way, it's all bad for the country, but this is what your Democratic socialist party has become. This is who they are. This is what defines them, frankly, perfectly.  Now, remember, tomorrow, there is not one single thing the Democrats have done -- not one -- the past three years. Not a single thing. They have done, except for try to hurt Donald Trump, and we, the people, that support him, that shop at Walmart proudly and believe in God. They have not lifted one finger for a better economy, to create any jobs, or improve the lives of you, we, the American people. They have done absolutely nothing to make this country safe and secure. Instead, they have spent the last 34 months slander, smears, besmirchment of the president, with one coordinated, political hit job after another.  You know, the routine -- Russia, Russia, Russia, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, S- hole, S-hole, impeach, impeach, now, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. Same people, same liars, same conspiracy theorists.   The left, frankly, they never accepted the results of the 2016 election. They thought Trump was going down in flames. We have shown you the tape. They were laughing. They were mocking. They were ridiculing. They never saw this coming. They were blindsided because, in all reality, Democrats and their willing accomplices in the mob and the media, they live in this one bubble. They have one agenda, one set of opinions. You've got the Democrats, the mob, joined together in what is a sick, ugly, degenerate left wing socialist, unholy alliance. And remember this, they think they are smarter than you are, and then we are, we come of the come of the American people. They think they know better than us. They have utter contempt -- and they show it, it comes out and a lot of ways, for us, that are smelly Walmart shoppers.   This is not just about president Trump. Understands this, this is a serious part. They hate everything and everyone he is representing. They hate the crowds that show up in massive numbers to support him. They referred to us not only as smelly Walmart people, irredeemable deplorables, angry, bitter Americans that cling to God, our Second Amendment, our bibles, and religion. Guilty as charged. And, by the way, for years, they just believe the Mueller report was their Holy Grail. They thought his findings would undo the results of the election they never thought they'd lose. They believe Mueller had him, they were wrong. No collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction. So, now, they are onto plan B, C, D, and they are out for blood. Make no mistake about it: the next 357 days, it is perfectly obvious -- now, you've got to understand, to be a Democrat, or part of the media mob, you actually have to be willing to engage in what is only a shocking level of raw hypocrisy that defies all interference of logic, intellect, reason, and common sense. In other words, to be a Democrat or in the media mob, you have to believe that Russia collusion is such a national crisis that you're going to spend two and half years investigating a hoax about Trump and Russia.  But at the same time, you have to completely ignore Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. That's how bitterly, sick, twisted, and partisan, and hypocritical you need to be.   Now, you have to obsess about phantom obstruction of justice charges in the Mueller report, but then totally ignore subpoenaed emails that were destroyed, deleted with Bleach Bit and smashed with hammers, with devices. You have to spend years obsessing about the horrors of foreign election interference, but then just look the other way, like it doesn't happen. When a DNC operative, we now know actually colluded with the government of Ukraine in order to smear Trump, and Manafort, all while bolstering the campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of this happened. To be a Democrat, to be a member of the media mob, you have to demand fairness and elections, but then ignore how Democratic primary was actually rigged against Bernie Sanders.  You have to drag Justice Kavanaugh, his wife and young kids, through the mud, with nothing but baseless accusations pushed by a bunch of \"I believers\" that don't believe in due process, that don't believe in the presumption of innocence, but then, on the other hand, you have to ignore what are serious rape, sexual assault allegation against lieutenant governor of Virginia. In that case, there were no \"I believers.\" Now, to be one of these members of the mob and the Democratic Party, you have to call everyone who runs for office racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobic, blah, blah, blah, but you're going to let Ralph \"KKK\" Northam off the hook. And, by the way, I guess now, if you're a Democrat, you also have to accept, first, deliver the baby, we'll make the baby comfortable, then let the mother decide if the baby lives or dies.  And you have to believe in open borders. And you have to believe it is a manufactured crisis, 90 percent of the heroin coming across our southern border. You have to be willing to organize a women's march, a so-called equal rights, and then appoint an anti-Semitic bigot who supports Sharia law to lead that movement, and then say with a straight face you care about women's rights.  To believe in this repulsive -- what is really an elitist, holier-than-thou mob, you have to proclaim that the identity of the brave, fake, phony, non- whistle-blower whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower, that person must be hidden. That's a hearsay complain about the Ukraine call, that person needs to be respected, but then you have to be totally OK when CBS fires a news producer for helping blow the whistle on a story that ABC News spiked in 2015 about a convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Right, Humpty Dumpty? Right, Jeff Zucker? And tonight, we're witnessing perhaps the most shameless hypocrisy of all, and the examples of it, because you got this corrupt, compromised coward, for three years, nothing but a congenital liar -- and he's, by the way, lied in this case already. Adam Schiff is going to kick off this public which trial into whether or not President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo - - oh, wait a minute, willing to change that. X that out. Oh, now, we'll call it extortion, with the country of Ukraine.  And, of course, he is alleging the president traded U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine's cooperation in election interference and investigation. The interesting thing is, not one time -- do you know, not call, not once, in that phone call him, not a single time, did they ever bring up the issue of aid. Not once.   And then they ignore completely -- again, only a Democrat can do this, only the mob can do this -- a corrupt investigation into Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Democrats want you to forget three things. One, the United States has a cooperation agreement with Ukraine to investigate crimes. Election interference is a crime. Using taxpayer dollars, quid pro quo Joe, you get the billion, you fire the prosecutor investigating my son. That's probably illegal, too. And the president, you're also for forgetting this -- number two, he has a sworn duty to uphold the laws of the land. Number three, there is clear evidence of potential crimes. Now, when it comes to interference, we know \"Politico\" detailed how the country of Ukraine was actively working to elect Hillary Clinton, coordinating with the DNC operative who met with them at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington. And when -- by the way, also a Ukraine court confirmed all of this. But when it comes to creepy, crazy Joe 30330, we actually have video evidence of a real quid pro quo, and him bragging about it. It just so happens to be with the country of Ukraine.  Joe, yes, threatened to withhold $1 billion if the Ukrainian prosecutor wasn't fired within six hours. Now, ask yourself this question tonight: why would a sitting vice president of the United States care about some dopey prosecutor in Ukraine? Well, I think we know the answer, it probably had something to do with the fact that Vice President Biden, remember, he was told by \"The New York Times\" and others that this prosecutor was investigating his son Hunter. He's not a kid. He's like 49 years old.  Now, zero experience, Hunter Biden. He was getting paid millions and millions of dollars from Ukrainian and gas energy giant, Burisma Holdings. At the same time his father was in charge of U.S.-Ukrainian relations for the Obama administration. Now, Hunter must have offered great experience in Ukraine. No. Energy? No. Oil? None. Gas? None.   A quid pro quo Joe wants you to believe there is zero evidence of any potential wrongdoing. What you're about to see is a lie. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "What Joe Biden said right there is a lie. He is the only corrupt player that we know with Ukraine. So he would prefer you don't believe his own bragging video evidence, and don't believe that zero experience Hunter Biden's multimillion dollar payday with Ukraine actually happened. Now, we've detailed, thanks to Gregg Jarrett, that the Bidens, especially Joe, probably is in real legal trouble, if we had equal application of our laws in this country, and equal justice under the law, because we have a law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it is illegal, Joe, for a U.S. person to coerce or influence foreign nation into taking action -- fire the prosecutor -- that might financially benefit that person, his family -- Hunter -- or business.   And then we have bribery laws where it is illegal to offer or promise anything of value -- a billion dollars -- for a public official to influence an official act -- fire the prosecutor. And by the way, giving, offering, promising anything of value to a public official in exchange for an official act is a violation of the gratuity statute. That's also a felony.  And we have the Hobbs Act. A threat to a foreign official in order to obtain an official benefit, affecting interstate, foreign commerce would constitute something called extortion. Democrats tonight are hoping you, we, the American people, smelly Walmart Trump supporters ignore what our inescapable truths about Biden corruption. Instead, what they want you to believe is that Donald Trump is guilty of the quid pro quo simply because of the opinions of people that shared their hatred of Donald Trump, the deep state bureaucrats, about a phone call and their biased interpretation of a call for which a transcript has now totally public for all to see.  Their interpretation is dead wrong. There is never any mention of any financial anything in that phone call.  And get this: we have a \"New York Post\" article written by Jonathan Tobin. He brings up a really good point. Quote: How can the House examine this manner without probing Trump's motivation for requesting Ukraine investigate the Bidens. But don't expect to see Hunter or Joe Biden testified. The cowardly, corrupt, compromised, congenital liar Schiff, he won't allow it.  This is not a real investigation. This is a political circus. There is no due process. This is a show trial. They have preselected, pre- interviewed, if you will, the people that they want to trot out first, that they think will most make their case, because they have a predetermined outcome. And we know that Schiff has already pre-interviewed his favorite witnesses behind closed doors and will now only allow his favorites to testify, and cherry-pick the witnesses. In fact, this compromised congenital liar won't even allow the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower to take the stand when he first said that he would take the stand.   Now, maybe that's because he is a deep state, Trump-hating operative who's been coordinating with Schiff's office from the very beginning. Oh, the congenital liar lied about that, too. He doesn't even have first-hand information. It's a hearsay whistle-blower.  Both Jarrett, U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy, they have detailed with pinpoint precision why this person is not an actual whistle-blower under the official whistle-blower statute. And according to a brand-new foxnews.com report, look at this, an inspector general complaint has been filed against a fake whistle-blower for soliciting illegal donations. See, a real whistle-blower submitted that complaint after the fake whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower, accumulated over $227,000 in a GoFundMe account. By the way, here with more on the real whistle-blower, the lawyer representing the real whistle-blower, Anthony Gallo. Anthony, how are you?",

By the way, you, the American people, ultimately, will decide all of this. And, by the way, everything from this point forward, you've got to view through this prism: it's about the election. Democrats know the Senate will not convict President Trump. Senator Graham, who will join us tonight, called impeachment dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate. Democrats clearly are out for blood. They are desperate to ruin this president's 2020 campaign.  Congressman Al Green actually hit the truth. If we don't impeach him, we're not going to defeat him. They want to drag the president down into the mud because, frankly, their candidates they even know are terrible. They are running on a $94 trillion Green New Deal, Medicare-for-All, no private insurance, open borders, you get to choose after you make the baby's comfortable, if the mother wants the baby or not. Over $140 trillion in new taxes, and everything is free, no oil or gas, no combustion engine and eventually no planes or cows, they want to radically transform the world's greatest economy into what is nothing short of a socialist hellhole. And these candidates are so bad, so extreme, so radical, Hillary Clinton is now claiming many people -- many of them -- are just begging her to run again. Maybe that's Bill Clinton hitting, click \"resend\" over and over again. I don't know. Anyway, I would like to know who the people are, but that's how bad the Democratic Party has become. It's vaguely scary.   Now, before we get to our guest, we have good news tonight. According to a report just released, the Department of Justice inspector general has now reached a critical final step in his FISA abuse report. Today, Senator Grassley expressed concern that the report, which we were promised next week, would be delayed yet again. Carter Page, at the center of the FISA abuse scandal, tweeted, quote: Good news, Chuck Grassley, I finally got constructive feedback from a senior official at the OIG today regarding the FISA abuse report. I remain cautiously optimistic that they will do the right thing, and do it as soon as possible. Here with reaction, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, and Michael Best Law president, former White House chief of staff for President Trump, Reince Priebus. Let's start with the show, the circus, the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar, Matt Gaetz. And what they -- tell everybody how corrupt tomorrow is, especially compared to how Republicans treated Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton's lawyers, and the minority party in 1998.",

And so, you see Democrats doing everything they can to limit our ability to call witnesses, limit our ability to yield time to members who've been in the depositions. But all of the dirty tricks from Adam Schiff's bag of tricks will not change a few fundamental facts. First, that we can see the transcript, and there is no conditionality on any aid. Second, that President Trump and President Zelensky, the actual people on the call, said there was no pressure. Third, at the time of the call, the Ukrainians were not aware of any delay on their aid, whatsoever. And, fourth and finally, the aid that Barack Obama withheld was delivered by the Trump administration without any beginning of any investigations into Burisma or Hunter Biden.  Now, I think the Democrats will try to do all they can to have conjecture around those facts. But nothing changes them, and that means there shouldn't be an impeachment.",

The Foreign Relations Committee has jurisdiction over the State Department. But let me get back to the point you just made. What's happening in the House is basically un-American.

The circus is coming to town, and we are just now hours away from the corrupt, compromised, coward, and congenital liar Adam Schiff show on Capitol Hill, brought to you by him and his fellow, raging, psychotic Democrats and their top allies in the media mob. First, though, this. This is important. Everything you're going to see in the next two weeks is rigged. This is a phony show trial. There is zero due process, none. It is yet another fraudulent hoax, conspiracy theory. It is another witch hunt. It is wrought with rampant -- I mean rampant, putrid hypocrisy, a repulsive double standard. By the way, it's all bad for the country, but this is what your Democratic socialist party has become. This is who they are. This is what defines them, frankly, perfectly. Now, remember, tomorrow, there is not one single thing the Democrats have done -- not one -- the past three years. Not a single thing. They have done, except for try to hurt Donald Trump, and we, the people, that support him, that shop at Walmart proudly and believe in God. They have not lifted one finger for a better economy, to create any jobs, or improve the lives of you, we, the American people. They have done absolutely nothing to make this country safe and secure. Instead, they have spent the last 34 months slander, smears, besmirchment of the president, with one coordinated, political hit job after another. You know, the routine -- Russia, Russia, Russia, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, S- hole, S-hole, impeach, impeach, now, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. Same people, same liars, same conspiracy theorists. The left, frankly, they never accepted the results of the 2016 election. They thought Trump was going down in flames. We have shown you the tape. They were laughing. They were mocking. They were ridiculing. They never saw this coming. They were blindsided because, in all reality, Democrats and their willing accomplices in the mob and the media, they live in this one bubble. They have one agenda, one set of opinions. You've got the Democrats, the mob, joined together in what is a sick, ugly, degenerate left wing socialist, unholy alliance. And remember this, they think they are smarter than you are, and then we are, we come of the come of the American people. They think they know better than us. They have utter contempt -- and they show it, it comes out and a lot of ways, for us, that are smelly Walmart shoppers. This is not just about president Trump. Understands this, this is a serious part. They hate everything and everyone he is representing. They hate the crowds that show up in massive numbers to support him. They referred to us not only as smelly Walmart people, irredeemable deplorables, angry, bitter Americans that cling to God, our Second Amendment, our bibles, and religion. Guilty as charged. And, by the way, for years, they just believe the Mueller report was their Holy Grail. They thought his findings would undo the results of the election they never thought they'd lose. They believe Mueller had him, they were wrong. No collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction."

      "speaker": "So, now, they are onto plan B, C, D, and they are out for blood. Make no mistake about it",
      "utterance": "the next 357 days, it is perfectly obvious -- now, you've got to understand, to be a Democrat, or part of the media mob, you actually have to be willing to engage in what is only a shocking level of raw hypocrisy that defies all interference of logic, intellect, reason, and common sense. In other words, to be a Democrat or in the media mob, you have to believe that Russia collusion is such a national crisis that you're going to spend two and half years investigating a hoax about Trump and Russia. But at the same time, you have to completely ignore Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. That's how bitterly, sick, twisted, and partisan, and hypocritical you need to be. Now, you have to obsess about phantom obstruction of justice charges in the Mueller report, but then totally ignore subpoenaed emails that were destroyed, deleted with Bleach Bit and smashed with hammers, with devices. You have to spend years obsessing about the horrors of foreign election interference, but then just look the other way, like it doesn't happen. When a DNC operative, we now know actually colluded with the government of Ukraine in order to smear Trump, and Manafort, all while bolstering the campaign of Hillary Clinton in 2016. All of this happened. To be a Democrat, to be a member of the media mob, you have to demand fairness and elections, but then ignore how Democratic primary was actually rigged against Bernie Sanders. You have to drag Justice Kavanaugh, his wife and young kids, through the mud, with nothing but baseless accusations pushed by a bunch of \"I believers\" that don't believe in due process, that don't believe in the presumption of innocence, but then, on the other hand, you have to ignore what are serious rape, sexual assault allegation against lieutenant governor of Virginia. In that case, there were no \"I believers.\" Now, to be one of these members of the mob and the Democratic Party, you have to call everyone who runs for office racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobic, blah, blah, blah, but you're going to let Ralph \"KKK\" Northam off the hook. And, by the way, I guess now, if you're a Democrat, you also have to accept, first, deliver the baby, we'll make the baby comfortable, then let the mother decide if the baby lives or dies. And you have to believe in open borders. And you have to believe it is a manufactured crisis, 90 percent of the heroin coming across our southern border. You have to be willing to organize a women's march, a so-called equal rights, and then appoint an anti-Semitic bigot who supports Sharia law to lead that movement, and then say with a straight face you care about women's rights. To believe in this repulsive -- what is really an elitist, holier-than-thou mob, you have to proclaim that the identity of the brave, fake, phony, non- whistle-blower whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower, that person must be hidden. That's a hearsay complain about the Ukraine call, that person needs to be respected, but then you have to be totally OK when CBS fires a news producer for helping blow the whistle on a story that ABC News spiked in 2015 about a convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Right, Humpty Dumpty? Right, Jeff Zucker? And tonight, we're witnessing perhaps the most shameless hypocrisy of all, and the examples of it, because you got this corrupt, compromised coward, for three years, nothing but a congenital liar -- and he's, by the way, lied in this case already. Adam Schiff is going to kick off this public which trial into whether or not President Trump engaged in a quid pro quo - - oh, wait a minute, willing to change that. X that out. Oh, now, we'll call it extortion, with the country of Ukraine. And, of course, he is alleging the president traded U.S. aid in exchange for Ukraine's cooperation in election interference and investigation. The interesting thing is, not one time -- do you know, not call, not once, in that phone call him, not a single time, did they ever bring up the issue of aid. Not once. And then they ignore completely -- again, only a Democrat can do this, only the mob can do this -- a corrupt investigation into Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Democrats want you to forget three things. One, the United States has a cooperation agreement with Ukraine to investigate crimes. Election interference is a crime. Using taxpayer dollars, quid pro quo Joe, you get the billion, you fire the prosecutor investigating my son. That's probably illegal, too. And the president, you're also for forgetting this -- number two, he has a sworn duty to uphold the laws of the land. Number three, there is clear evidence of potential crimes. Now, when it comes to interference, we know \"Politico\" detailed how the country of Ukraine was actively working to elect Hillary Clinton, coordinating with the DNC operative who met with them at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington. And when -- by the way, also a Ukraine court confirmed all of this. But when it comes to creepy, crazy Joe 30330, we actually have video evidence of a real quid pro quo, and him bragging about it. It just so happens to be with the country of Ukraine. Joe, yes, threatened to withhold $1 billion if the Ukrainian prosecutor wasn't fired within six hours. Now, ask yourself this question tonight: why would a sitting vice president of the United States care about some dopey prosecutor in Ukraine? Well, I think we know the answer, it probably had something to do with the fact that Vice President Biden, remember, he was told by \"The New York Times\" and others that this prosecutor was investigating his son Hunter. He's not a kid. He's like 49 years old. Now, zero experience, Hunter Biden. He was getting paid millions and millions of dollars from Ukrainian and gas energy giant, Burisma Holdings. At the same time his father was in charge of U.S.-Ukrainian relations for the Obama administration. Now, Hunter must have offered great experience in Ukraine. No. Energy? No. Oil? None. Gas? None. A quid pro quo Joe wants you to believe there is zero evidence of any potential wrongdoing. What you're about to see is a lie. Take a look."

So he would prefer you don't believe his own bragging video evidence, and don't believe that zero experience Hunter Biden's multimillion dollar payday with Ukraine actually happened. Now, we've detailed, thanks to Gregg Jarrett, that the Bidens, especially Joe, probably is in real legal trouble, if we had equal application of our laws in this country, and equal justice under the law, because we have a law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it is illegal, Joe, for a U.S. person to coerce or influence foreign nation into taking action -- fire the prosecutor -- that might financially benefit that person, his family -- Hunter -- or business. And then we have bribery laws where it is illegal to offer or promise anything of value -- a billion dollars -- for a public official to influence an official act -- fire the prosecutor. And by the way, giving, offering, promising anything of value to a public official in exchange for an official act is a violation of the gratuity statute. That's also a felony. And we have the Hobbs Act. A threat to a foreign official in order to obtain an official benefit, affecting interstate, foreign commerce would constitute something called extortion. Democrats tonight are hoping you, we, the American people, smelly Walmart Trump supporters ignore what our inescapable truths about Biden corruption. Instead, what they want you to believe is that Donald Trump is guilty of the quid pro quo simply because of the opinions of people that shared their hatred of Donald Trump, the deep state bureaucrats, about a phone call and their biased interpretation of a call for which a transcript has now totally public for all to see. Their interpretation is dead wrong. There is never any mention of any financial anything in that phone call."

Quote: How can the House examine this manner without probing Trump's motivation for requesting Ukraine investigate the Bidens. But don't expect to see Hunter or Joe Biden testified. The cowardly, corrupt, compromised, congenital liar Schiff, he won't allow it. This is not a real investigation. This is a political circus. There is no due process. This is a show trial. They have preselected, pre- interviewed, if you will, the people that they want to trot out first, that they think will most make their case, because they have a predetermined outcome. And we know that Schiff has already pre-interviewed his favorite witnesses behind closed doors and will now only allow his favorites to testify, and cherry-pick the witnesses. In fact, this compromised congenital liar won't even allow the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower to take the stand when he first said that he would take the stand. Now, maybe that's because he is a deep state, Trump-hating operative who's been coordinating with Schiff's office from the very beginning. Oh, the congenital liar lied about that, too. He doesn't even have first-hand information. It's a hearsay whistle-blower. Both Jarrett, U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy, they have detailed with pinpoint precision why this person is not an actual whistle-blower under the official whistle-blower statute. And according to a brand-new foxnews.com report, look at this, an inspector general complaint has been filed against a fake whistle-blower for soliciting illegal donations. See, a real whistle-blower submitted that complaint after the fake whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower, accumulated over $227,000 in a GoFundMe account.

By the way, you, the American people, ultimately, will decide all of this. And, by the way, everything from this point forward, you've got to view through this prism: it's about the election. Democrats know the Senate will not convict President Trump. Senator Graham, who will join us tonight, called impeachment dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate. Democrats clearly are out for blood. They are desperate to ruin this president's 2020 campaign. Congressman Al Green actually hit the truth. If we don't impeach him, we're not going to defeat him. They want to drag the president down into the mud because, frankly, their candidates they even know are terrible. They are running on a $94 trillion Green New Deal, Medicare-for-All, no private insurance, open borders, you get to choose after you make the baby's comfortable, if the mother wants the baby or not. Over $140 trillion in new taxes, and everything is free, no oil or gas, no combustion engine and eventually no planes or cows, they want to radically transform the world's greatest economy into what is nothing short of a socialist hellhole. And these candidates are so bad, so extreme, so radical, Hillary Clinton is now claiming many people -- many of them -- are just begging her to run again. Maybe that's Bill Clinton hitting, click \"resend\" over and over again. I don't know. Anyway, I would like to know who the people are, but that's how bad the Democratic Party has become. It's vaguely scary. Now, before we get to our guest, we have good news tonight. According to a report just released, the Department of Justice inspector general has now reached a critical final step in his FISA abuse report.

And so, you see Democrats doing everything they can to limit our ability to call witnesses, limit our ability to yield time to members who've been in the depositions. But all of the dirty tricks from Adam Schiff's bag of tricks will not change a few fundamental facts. First, that we can see the transcript, and there is no conditionality on any aid. Second, that President Trump and President Zelensky, the actual people on the call, said there was no pressure. Third, at the time of the call, the Ukrainians were not aware of any delay on their aid, whatsoever. And, fourth and finally, the aid that Barack Obama withheld was delivered by the Trump administration without any beginning of any investigations into Burisma or Hunter Biden. Now, I think the Democrats will try to do all they can to have conjecture around those facts. But nothing changes them, and that means there shouldn't be an impeachment."

Now, Matt Gaetz nailed it. And, by the way, he did a great job by blowing up the Star Chamber a couple of weeks ago and exposing all of this. But I think it's really important to do what Congressman Gaetz did just did, and narrow this down to exactly what it is. On its worst day for the president, you have a non-consummated wrongdoing. I mean, at worst. So, what do you have? You have -- the money was released, which it was. So, number -- so, finally, what do we have that's on trial?

And every American deserves the right to confront their accuser. That's not being done in this case. So, I don't want to legitimize this because it's a threat to the presidency. Then there's the allegation. The allegation is that Donald J. Trump withheld aid to the Ukraine unless the Ukrainian government investigated Joe Biden and Hunter Biden for corruption. The problem with that allegation is it's not true. The aid was delivered to the Ukrainian government, and there was no investigation of Hunter Biden or Joe Biden.

It goes, yes, at the discretion of the Chairman, he said he wanted the whistleblower Republicans gave a list. They said no to every Republican witness and now they're cherry picking the two witnesses that they think will be most favorable to them and ignoring all the ones that destroyed their narrative.

Their State Department activity talking about the conflict of interest. And there is a reasonable investigation to be done here. The Foreign Relations Committee has jurisdiction over the State Department. But let me get back to the point you just made. What's happening in the House is basically un-American. No American including Donald Trump should be accused of misdeeds without confronting their accuser which is the whistleblower and no American should be denied the ability to tell their side of the story by calling witnesses to explain their defense. That's being denied to the President of the United States. To every American who is going to watch tomorrow. This could not happen in your case. This couldn't happen in a parking ticket case. This couldn't happen in any civil matter in America because due process requires the ability of every American to call witnesses on their behalf except for President Trump. So, why am I not going to watch this hearing tomorrow, because I think it is a threat to the presidency. I don't want to legitimize it. It's un-American, it denies the basics of due process."

You don't fire the prosecutor that's investigating my zero- experience son who is being paid millions. I'm taking the money back with me. Now that to me looks like a crime.

The State Department, we're talking about Joe Biden said you're not going to get a penny unless you fire the prosecutor. Here's the question. After John Solomon's Florida request, is there reasonable belief that Joe Biden intervened not because the prosecutor was corrupt, because he's getting close to the son. The paper trail suggests there is a reasonable belief or at least something to look at here. So, I'm hoping that Chairman Risch will look into whether or not there was a conflict of interests identified by the State Department regarding Hunter Biden being on this gas board and whether or not Joe Biden intervened after the raid."

But when 96 percent of the coverage about the impeachment is negative toward Donald Trump and the talking points from the Democrats are identical to the very words that are being used by the media, it's very clear, there is a collusion going on, but it's not Donald Trump and the Russians, it's the Democrats and the media.

Sound and fury signifying nothing. At the end of the day, I think we all know the way this movie is going to end. The President will probably be impeached in the house. It will go to the Senate. He won't be removed. The difference from this today and 20 years ago with Bill Clinton where he had a 73 percent approval rating day one after impeachment is that study you just cited. 96 percent negative coverage. It was a much different story 20 years ago with Bill Clinton where the shoe was on the other foot. You had a President being impeached, but the media was largely on that President's side.

We are losing more people than we lost in Vietnam over 10 years in every single year, 70,000 overdose deaths last year alone. How do I feel about the sanctuaries where people can shoot up with clean needles? I'm not sure. I wouldn't want in my neighborhood. I'm sure that many of the people in many of the neighborhoods in Philadelphia don't want it in their neighborhoods either. However, the city fathers such as they are, and mothers have decided that they want to give this a try.

Trace Gallagher has that report coming up next."

      "utterance": "Sean, the student newspaper at Northwestern University issued a nine-paragraph apology for allowing journalism students to practice journalism. When former Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke at Northwestern students protested. So, the student paper covered the protest, pictures, interviews, you name it. But that was apparently traumatizing and invasive to the students. So, the paper apologized. DePaul University professor Jeffrey McCall called the apology unnecessary \"disrupting the flow of news and having journalists apologizing for displaying reality surely will lead our culture further into information chaos.\" Meantime at Harvard University when student protesters called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE to be abolished, the Harvard Crimson newspaper naturally tried to get a comment from ICE and then the paper was roundly condemned for \"inflicting harm\" on the undocumented community. More than 900 people signed an online petition demanding the Harvard Crimson apologized. The president of the paper said, we're simply doing our jobs. Sean."
