Lawyers for Dr. Ford laying out demands last night that include having Brett Kavanaugh testify first. But Republicans are pushing back on that request during negotiations. President Trump also weighing in by accusing Democrats of trying to, quote, destroy and delay. The president also saying it's time to move forward with the nomination.",

And the Dems in a political battle they do not accommodate, but Republicans do, and the reason why because Democrats always attack you morally. They attack your character. They say that, you know, if you do not, you know, if you do not believe this person, you're an evil, sexist creature. They would agree with me on this too, by the way. The fact is -- and the Republicans they get scared and they go, oh, oh, back off, back off, so they're accommodating and they're accommodating. Now they're being taken advantage of.

We've reached a point where Republicans have bent over backwards to accommodate her. And they want to hear from her. And they're doing everything possible to make it easy for her to come and testify.  But, you get the point that they're getting strung along from the driving, to the footsie, to the not returning the phone calls. It's all about delay.

People like Feinstein who actually thought during those four days, actually conducted herself well compared to Spartacus and others on the committee. And there're other people on that committee that I've traveled with on congressional delegation that I have a high opinion of. And to see their statements which I think have gotten to be so blatantly political.  If you really think that this woman is a victim of sexual assault, if you truly believe that, I don't think that she's being handled properly by the Democrats at all. And Axios is reporting -- has just reported that the Democrats are seeing this as another wedge moment to drive out even more female votes for the midterms. So it's gotten political and the Democrats know that they see that this is an issue to get more women out. And you know what? I think it's disgusting because sexual assault is the most underreported crime that there is. I think all of us probably know someone who's been a victim.

So I actually think that Democrats do themselves a disservice for the midterms whenever they run on this. First of all, it's incredibly easy for the president to rev up his base. Whenever he say, look, they're not even to impeach me. They're going to try to impeach Kavanaugh. To me it's like a ready-made campaign ad right there.",

According to the New York Times and the Washington Post, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggested secretly recording President Trump, and also discussed invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office, those allegations reportedly coming from memos written by former FBI director -- Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Rosenstein is calling the New York Times story inaccurate and factually incorrect. And senior DOJ official is telling Fox News that Rosenstein was only joking about wearing a wire during a heated exchange with McCabe.  So, Dana, what was interesting to me, when I started really digging into this New York Times piece is, again, we have memos coming out of the FBI. So, what they're saying is that McCabe left these meetings with Rosenstein and potentially briefed other people or wrote memos himself that detailed the discussions of what Rosenstein said, which made me think does Rosenstein even know about these memos? And it's interesting to me the bureaucratic pattern of writing a memo the minute that you get out of a meeting that seems to undermine whoever is in office.",

So we've been through this before. And we know that McCabe is a leaker. I mean, that's on the record. He's already known to be a leaker. So, if it's true that he was conspiring Rod Rosenstein in any way against the president, and if you look at the article, it says he was paranoid. He was frazzled after Comey was fired. He didn't know what was going on. That was the mental state that he was in when he appointed Mueller to be special counsel. So that adds a little intrigue about that and it raises a lot of doubts about his mental state during that too. Remember, he also signed off on every single FISA application. He also has been foot-dragging on all the document requests from the DOJ. And when he went out there and testified on Capitol Hill, he did not come across well. He came across as squirrely like Strzok did and people didn't really like the way he presented himself.

She started a charity 18 years ago for kids that have cancer. And so what she does is she goes into hospitals around the country; and she does queen for a day or she does king for a day with the little boys. And they -- she dresses them. She started by giving away giving away her pageant tiaras, whenever she was a beauty queen in the South. And she would give them away to little girls. And what she found out was that all of these cancer treatments are, of course, hard on them physically but also really hard mentally and emotionally for them. So I'm so proud to be helping Jenna with the \"For a Day\" charity tomorrow. If you're in New York City, you can come join us for brunch, and we're going to be helping children with cancer.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A lot of breaking news to get to including reports that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to secretly record the president and invoking the 25th amendment, new information and our reaction to that developing story, but, first, the battle over confirming Brett Kavanaugh, senate judiciary committee Republicans hoping to have an answer by the end of the day on if Christine Blasey Ford will appear next week at a possible Wednesday hearing. Lawyers for Dr. Ford laying out demands last night that include having Brett Kavanaugh testify first. But Republicans are pushing back on that request during negotiations. President Trump also weighing in by accusing Democrats of trying to, quote, destroy and delay. The president also saying it's time to move forward with the nomination."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "A new information out today, one of the things her lawyers have said now, Greg, is that she does not want to fly. So she doesn't want to testify on Monday because, perhaps, she might have to drive to Washington."

      "utterance": "You kind of get the sense that now the Democrats are just playing with us, you know. The people that want to get this thing done and do the right thing. They're just saying let's just try this avenue. They offered -- didn't the Republicans offer to come and see her. So here's a tell that this is all political, when everyone on the other side assumes the worst of your opinion. So if you believe that this is political and they say, well, you're defending sexual abuse. No, I'm just admitting this is more complicated and more nuanced to problem than you wish it was. And the Dems in a political battle they do not accommodate, but Republicans do, and the reason why because Democrats always attack you morally. They attack your character. They say that, you know, if you do not, you know, if you do not believe this person, you're an evil, sexist creature. They would agree with me on this too, by the way. The fact is -- and the Republicans they get scared and they go, oh, oh, back off, back off, so they're accommodating and they're accommodating. Now they're being taken advantage of. And I think it might be time to say enough. We would fly out there first class to see you or fly you out here first class. We'll get a motorcade. We'll do whatever you want. And the fact that that's not enough is telling you something."

How this plays out is interesting, I think. And they will be hammering out those details over the days before this happens. But a bigger question politically, Dana, is President Trump changing his tune this morning. A lot of Republicans in the senate, I think, were very happy. And in the house were very happy that he had been measured, that he had said he was going to hear from her and wasn't attacking her personally. This morning he changed tunes. He went after her on twitter really aggressively. And I think there's some Republicans on the hill that I'm hearing from that are like this is already complicated enough as it is. President Trump is not a perfect vehicle to push back on these kinds of allegations."

      "utterance": "But more patient on anything that I've ever seen him do, and people on the hill, as you said, were very happy with that. He was not happy withholding back and he unloaded. I thought that was about a 3 out of 10. He could have gone much harder after her. And I'm sure he's chomping at the bit, too. And he kind of feels the way Greg's been feeling about this. We've reached a point where Republicans have bent over backwards to accommodate her. And they want to hear from her. And they're doing everything possible to make it easy for her to come and testify. But, you get the point that they're getting strung along from the driving, to the footsie, to the not returning the phone calls. It's all about delay. And it makes you think do they really care about getting the truth out or do they care about delaying? So she testifies on Wednesday, right, after the drive across country. I hope it's very scenic and she hits no traffic. Tuesday comes around and, oh, you know, maybe she's sick. Maybe there's another witness that's come forward. You don't know what's going to happen. At this point, I've lost total trust in Dianne Feinstein and the rest of the Democrats on the committee. They've abused the process throughout the last month. What's to think they're not going to pull some more high jinx at the end, and we have to preface it by saying if this true I feel for this woman. I believe she believes something happened. But the more and more we get into the gamesmanship the more skeptical people get."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And, Morgan, today, Mitch McConnell, the senator -- the senate majority leader was at the value voter's conference, and he said don't get rattled. Just stay calm. He will be a Supreme Court justice and he just said soon. What do you think he was trying to signal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "So, I agree that I think what we've seen the past week is something that looked like, OK, we want to seriously hear this woman and it's gotten more and more, more political this week. If you'll notice -- and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed in the Democrat members on this justice committee. People like Feinstein who actually thought during those four days, actually conducted herself well compared to Spartacus and others on the committee. And there're other people on that committee that I've traveled with on congressional delegation that I have a high opinion of. And to see their statements which I think have gotten to be so blatantly political. If you really think that this woman is a victim of sexual assault, if you truly believe that, I don't think that she's being handled properly by the Democrats at all. And Axios is reporting -- has just reported that the Democrats are seeing this as another wedge moment to drive out even more female votes for the midterms. So it's gotten political and the Democrats know that they see that this is an issue to get more women out. And you know what? I think it's disgusting because sexual assault is the most underreported crime that there is. I think all of us probably know someone who's been a victim. And the way that this has turned into such -- I know we can all be cynical, the way this has been turned into a nasty partisan exercise to drive out voters for a midterm election by the Democrats, I find unseemly."

And then she's got another team, an outside group helping her, and she's got the senate Democrats. So she's being advised by people that -- to some it looks like may not have her best interest at heart. They may think more about derailing the nomination than actually helping an alleged victim of a sexual assault."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Republicans -- look, I don't want that to be the case. I want this to be about getting to the truth. Republicans are also playing politics with this as well. And they think that if this gets delay it will also drive out their base. You have Lindsey Graham out there saying, you know, Kavanaugh has been the victim of a drive by shooting, and say listen to the lady but we've got to move on. Everyone needs to handle this very carefully in the next week. And my point about Donald Trump was this is very delicate. The Republicans on the hill who are up for re-election this year do not want to play this wrong. They saw what happened in '92 after the Anita Hill hearing. The first year of the woman when women came out to vote in droves, in large part, because of this, they don't want Donald Trump, given his history and his baggage, to screw up the dance they're trying to do right now to take this seriously and get to the truth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But, you know, I do want to bring this up because, Greg, in Minnesota, we've talked about Keith Ellison and the accusations against him, right? So a new poll was conducted, the Minnesota Star Tribune and Minnesota public radio news find that only 5 percent of Democrats in Minnesota believe the allegations of emotional and physical abuse leveled against Representative Ellison who is the DNC's deputy chair. Feels a little bit like double standard."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Sadly, team sport politics infects everything. It infects the clothes you wear now. It infects politics. It infects sports. Infects entertainment. And now it's polluting and poisoning relationships between genders. I mean, the fact is, we do -- I think men and women both want to get to the truth. But, if you point out the possibility that this is a murky uncorroborated story and that the male might be innocent, then you will see people in the media say things like, um, what is that person hiding? So that -- what that does is keeps people from actually speaking out. You can be legitimately scared of being falsely accused and not have due process. You should be scared of that. But what people will say to you, no, you're not scared of that, you're scared of what you did that summer. What did you do when you were in high school? And that has everybody going like -- but I'm just saying, imagine if all men and all women said enough. You can't operate on the politics of a personal destruction, OK? We want to get to the truth. But we're seeing how this goes. And we see that we're all vulnerable. So, you know, sensible Americans believe in justice and due process, and we're not seeing it."

You can't ignore a crime victim's claim that something happened, refuse to investigate, throw her up into the stand without the least bit of support for her, without the least bit of effort to corroborate what she says, and then walk away from that as if you've behaved at all properly."

And now they're complaining? And they say they want to investigate? Well, you had your chance. You're obviously not an honest broker in this process. They're also doing it to rally the base, obviously. And, who knows? You know, if they do win the house or the senate, anything can happen. It's all on the table, impeachment not only of Kavanaugh but of President Trump. And I just think -- he was speaking the truth there.

So, you don't actually get to what the voters say they want. It might be what the Democratic base wants. It might be something that they want, you know, they want to fight. But it's interesting is how the Democrats seem to be flailing because they know that for three decades the conservatives worked together to figure out a way to find really good nominees like Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, and John Roberts, and Justice Alito, and Amy Coney Barrett. I mean, there are -- there is a pipeline of excellent conservative judges and the Democrats have blown this issue off. They didn't care. So instead of actually winning elections so that they could put somebody on the court, they just want to impeach and investigate, which is pretty unsatisfying, especially if you want to go to Washington and do some good stuff."

      "utterance": "So, interestingly, I was talking to someone at one of the Republican committees about the polling, and typically what you see whenever you have a party that's controlling the White House and congress, voters tend to want to vote another party in power so that there's a check and balance, right? This is natural in the process. What the pollster told me is that while that there is an element of that that's happening with independents, what happened is because the Democrats are running people that are so far extreme to the left, wanting to abolish ICE, socialism for all."

      "utterance": "But the point being is that that natural tendency of the independent to go towards the Democrat is now tempered by the fact that they know that voters don't actually want impeachment when you poll them. They don't want all of these ongoing investigations. They certainly don't want impeachment of Trump, much less a Supreme Court justice. So I actually think that Democrats do themselves a disservice for the midterms whenever they run on this. First of all, it's incredibly easy for the president to rev up his base. Whenever he say, look, they're not even to impeach me. They're going to try to impeach Kavanaugh. To me it's like a ready-made campaign ad right there."

In the meantime, bombshell reports rocking Washington this afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein reportedly suggested secretly taping President Trump. The breaking details just in to Fox next. Stay tuned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "New report is sending shock waves across Washington. According to the New York Times and the Washington Post, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggested secretly recording President Trump, and also discussed invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office, those allegations reportedly coming from memos written by former FBI director -- Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Rosenstein is calling the New York Times story inaccurate and factually incorrect. And senior DOJ official is telling Fox News that Rosenstein was only joking about wearing a wire during a heated exchange with McCabe. So, Dana, what was interesting to me, when I started really digging into this New York Times piece is, again, we have memos coming out of the FBI. So, what they're saying is that McCabe left these meetings with Rosenstein and potentially briefed other people or wrote memos himself that detailed the discussions of what Rosenstein said, which made me think does Rosenstein even know about these memos? And it's interesting to me the bureaucratic pattern of writing a memo the minute that you get out of a meeting that seems to undermine whoever is in office."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. We know that Andy McCabe and Lisa Page both wrote notes afterwards. They were both in that said meeting. But I thought it was very interesting is that all these signs point to that McCabe is the source. And Matthew Miller, who worked at the Justice Department, spokesperson under Obama, the tweet that came out as soon as this story broke and he read it said Andrew McCabe is playing a very dangerous game here. He is under threat of indictment for lying to federal investigators. And so, you know, if he wants to see if he can try this in a court of public opinion, I think he's probably going to lose. As I understand it, and we've read from our Justice Department senior officials -- I'm sorry, our producers that talked to justice department senior officials that they were in a heated argument. This is right after Comey is going to get fired. Rosenstein had written the draft letter."

      "speaker": "HARF",

When I first read the story, I thought someone leaked this because they want Rosenstein to get fired by President Trump. But I think they want Trump to fire Rosenstein to prompt what some people say could be some sort of constitutional crisis. And this is like a weird."

I thought Rosenstein is going to get fired because of this, whether or not he did it. And that will set in motion something I think is going to be very nasty with very uncertain ending. Look, if it's true that he was serious, I think that says something about President Trump, but we have no clue. I don't go around making jokes about the 25th amendment. I don't think it's particularly funny. Like we have people pushing back saying that's what he did. Do you think Rosenstein will get fired?"

And I think what you're seeing here is a political leadership across various intel agencies and across the FBI that, I think, quite literally have it out for the president and they're going to do it in their bureaucratic way, right? Like, if it's writing a memo and preserving it and giving it to the special counsel they're flaming mad at him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. These hornets were stinging him in the campaign, so he punched the whole nests. And now that's why we have such a mess. I guess there's two ways to look at it. You can look at it this was a leak from McCabe, and he's got an ax to grind and he's trying save his skin because he's getting pressure from the feds and he's facing time, or you can look at it like, hey, maybe there's some truth to this because, remember, the last time Rod Rosenstein was accused of threatening senate staffers to investigate them and turn them inside out, it came out, oh, yeah, he was misinterpreted, that's not exactly what he said. So we've been through this before. And we know that McCabe is a leaker. I mean, that's on the record. He's already known to be a leaker. So, if it's true that he was conspiring Rod Rosenstein in any way against the president, and if you look at the article, it says he was paranoid. He was frazzled after Comey was fired. He didn't know what was going on. That was the mental state that he was in when he appointed Mueller to be special counsel. So that adds a little intrigue about that and it raises a lot of doubts about his mental state during that too. Remember, he also signed off on every single FISA application. He also has been foot-dragging on all the document requests from the DOJ. And when he went out there and testified on Capitol Hill, he did not come across well. He came across as squirrely like Strzok did and people didn't really like the way he presented himself. So he's a villain in Trump world, and Trump world is going to look at this and say this guy needs to get axed fast."

She started a charity 18 years ago for kids that have cancer. And so what she does is she goes into hospitals around the country; and she does queen for a day or she does king for a day with the little boys. And they -- she dresses them. She started by giving away giving away her pageant tiaras, whenever she was a beauty queen in the South. And she would give them away to little girls. And what she found out was that all of these cancer treatments are, of course, hard on them physically but also really hard mentally and emotionally for them. So I'm so proud to be helping Jenna with the \"For a Day\" charity tomorrow. If you're in New York City, you can come join us for brunch, and we're going to be helping children with cancer."
