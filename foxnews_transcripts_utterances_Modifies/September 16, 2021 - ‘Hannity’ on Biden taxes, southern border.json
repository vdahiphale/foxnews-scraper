      "sentences": "Day 33, our fellow Americans hostage trapped by enemy lines, abandoned by Joe Biden. And tonight, the level of incompetence inside the Biden State Department -- wait until you hear the latest updates -- they're beyond shocking, their coordination with the very professional and business-like murdering terrorists in the Taliban is not going as planned to say the least. Now, by the way, children as young as nine and ten are getting executed. Lara Logan has a full report. Later also, we'll bring you an important update. The young woman named Gabby Petito who has been missing now for weeks after her fiance returned home from a cross-country trip that they were taking together without her, and he's clamming up. Gabby's mother, father, stepfather will all be here. Why won't he try and help them? But, first, Joe Biden is desperate to move on from the crisis that he created his own making in Afghanistan. And frankly, everywhere else. He hasn't even mentioned it since last week. Now, his poll numbers have never been lower, and he is desperate for a political win. Well, first, he tried to shift the focus to COVID-19, announcing his brand new, clearly unconstitutional vaccine mandate during a nasty speech, where he was scolding and vilifying half the country. But with infections spiking nationwide Biden's poll numbers surrounding the pandemic, they're also in the tank tonight. So, today, he tried to shift the focus once again, this time, he targeted corporations and millions of Americans who, according to Biden, just aren't paying their fair share. Okay, top 10 percent pay 90 percent of the bill. Anyway, I wonder if this includes zehuro experience Hunter who's reportedly being investigated but not paying taxes. Is Hunter included Joe? Now, regardless, Biden's remedy, a massive tax hike or tax hikes in order to raise funds for something Democrats are now calling human infrastructure. In other words, big government socialism from welfare to childcare to Medicare to more Obamacare to pre-K to daycare to free college to college tuition forgiveness, all in the name of climate change. You see climate change as defined in the swamp as swamp jargon, that equals socialism. Now, of course, any tax hike on corporations, you will pay that. That will be passed on to the consumers, and the inflation from any massive spending bill, that will hurt lower income Americans the most. In fact, after this year's reckless federal spending of Biden, \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting, quote, for the lowest paid Americans, real wages adjusted for rising prices fell 0.5 percent in August. That is a dramatic decline. People are paying more for energy to fill their tanks with gasoline, to heat and cool their homes and they're paying more for every product they buy in every store because it costs more to ship it there. That means the spending power for lower income Americans went down. Their salaries were essentially slashed because of Biden's policies. But today, as per usual, you didn't get the truth from Joe Biden. Instead, we get a whole lot hacking and coughing, I don't know Biden's been battling this mysterious illness for weeks.

I think we can see you know why Vice President Harris frequently conducts all these meetings with foreign leaders instead of Biden. And, of course, she does have plenty of time. Biden's borders are Kamala has done absolutely nothing to fix the crisis at the southern border. Now, this is the scene at the border -- look at your screen. Over the past 24 hours, 4,000 migrants crossed into Texas were apprehended by border patrol, including many unaccompanied children. On Tuesday night, two babies rescued by border patrol after they were abandoned right in the middle of the Rio Grande. And as you can see, the situation is so dire that Texas Governor Greg Abbott attempted to shut down six points of entry with Mexico and then the bight administration blocked his efforts. So far this year, in the middle of a pandemic, more than a million and a half illegal immigrants have been apprehended and then processed and allowed into the country from the southern border, including over two hundred thousand alone in the month of August, and a lot of them are put in those overcrowded Biden cages in the middle of a pandemic with a high rate of COVID positivity, oh, and by the way, they're not tested and there's no vaccine mandate and then they are dispersed to the rest of the country, many with COVID. This is a essentially officially now the biggest super spreader event in human history and the financial and human toll is extreme. Joe Biden doesn't seem to care. In fact, Joe Biden hasn't said one word about the border crisis in over a month. And breaking tonight, according to our own Bill Melugin, we showed you, this is drone footage from FOX News, the FAA, they just implemented a flight restriction over this international bridge right there, trying to prevent FOX's drone from showing you the American people the truth and capturing images just like this. In other words, the FAA is being used to cover up for Biden's failures. We're going to let that stand. I don't think so. Here now at the Del Rio international bridge in Texas where thousands of illegal immigrants wait to be processed, the Senator Ted Cruz. And, Senator, first of all, the FAA -- we know the DOJ has been weaponized. Now, the FAA is going to be weaponized?",

As you know, they did the same thing in the Donna tent facility in the Rio Grande Valley where they wouldn't allow FOX News to come in when I brought 19 senators to the Rio Grande Valley. I had to go in with my cell phone and photograph and take videos. I'll tell you.

They don't have the capacity to do that. And let me tell you something stunning that I learned tonight about why this happened, because this is a man-made crisis. Eight days ago, on September 8th, under that same bridge, there were between 700 and a thousand people. That was what was coming a day about a thousand, sometimes eleven hundred, but it would range between seven hundred and eleven hundred. Then eight days ago on September 8th, the Biden administration made a political decision. They announced that they were no longer going to fly deportation flights back to Haiti. Eighty-five percent of the people under there are from Haiti, they're fleeing from Haiti. They announced they weren't going back. There were about 900 Haitians who were getting ready to board the flights when the political operatives in Washington canceled the flights. Well, what happened? Those 900 people, they all pulled out their cell phones and they emailed their friends, and they emailed their families and they texted their friends and their families. That was eight days ago on September 8th. Today, it's September 16th, eight days later, and 700 people has grown to 10,500 because the word has gone out, if you're from Haiti, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have said we have open borders, come to Del Rio and they will let you in. Everyone under that bridge is turning themselves in and it's a political decision that Joe Biden could end tonight by simply following the law and saying, we are going to send people back to Haiti which is what federal immigration law requires until Biden and Harris got into office.",

Senator, I guess now you're unofficially and not paid reporter reporting live on the ground in Texas -- Texas Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for sharing the videos with us, on a serious note. It's an important story. Thank you, Senator. Now, the crisis at the border, that's just one of many self-inflicted catastrophes of the Biden administration. As we speak, the situation in Afghanistan also remains dire. We have, according to Darrell Issa, and many other contacts we have, up to 500 Americans still trapped. Even Blinken admits thousands of our friends, Americans with green cards, Afghan allies, tens of thousands have been left behind. And the terrorists, the Taliban, they're growing more violent by the day. According to a report, \"The New York Post\", a former U.S. Army officer working to rescue at-risk individuals inside Afghanistan is claiming two children, one age 9, one age 10, recently beheaded by the ever business- like and professional Taliban as Joe Biden calls them. As Biden's State Department is allegedly encouraging those trapped inside Afghanistan, they're actually telling them, you might want to visit. You're trapped as a hostage to the Taliban behind enemy lines, the State Department, Blinken is advising that you visit an embassy in a neighboring country if you need a visa. Mr. Blinken, how on earth is someone held hostage by the whims of the Taliban behind enemy lines that your -- that you and Joe Biden abandoned, how are they going to get to that neighboring country? Your stupidity is beyond shocking. Here with more, FOX Nation host, Lara Logan. Lara, welcome back. You've been following this closely. There are rescue efforts that we will hear many stories of heroism. But what's happening is real.

None of this is true, and it's hard to really describe the depth of evil that is really implicit in these false statements, because every single one of these people knows when they say those words how far it is from the truth. And more than that, when they have yet to explain why when you have Afghans who you know are at risk, who you know are vulnerable, the most vulnerable in the entire country right, because they've worked for your intelligence agencies, they have capabilities like biometric capabilities right, and they have sources and methods and all kinds of top secret even above that you know capabilities, why would you not protect these people why would you instead take their lists of them their contact numbers, their addresses their family members, their biometrics and hand that to the very people who want to kill them, in fact who are killing them, who are going to their homes every night at around local time and taking them from their homes. If you're an Afghan and they see a light on that's from a phone that's filming, you go with them. These people have not been seen again. The Taliban is executing and torturing and doing extrajudicial killings of people all across the country. And you know what, Sean? It's not just the Taliban. I wish we could just stop lying about this. It's ridiculous. The intelligence agencies know they're tracking in real time that al Qaeda is leading the assault, the military assault in the Panjshir Valley, and their higher ups, they don't want to know about it, don't talk about al Qaeda. That has been the political narrative since the Obama administration. It has been the political narrative of all of these Democrats and Republicans and staffers who have lied to this about this to the American people and to see them on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to see them stand up and say never forget. What are you talking about? You just gave al Qaeda their caliphate, and you're taking American tax dollars to pay for it. You're financing it with the blood money of Americans they have murdered.

One of the things I discovered as I pored through thousands of pages of documents as I was writing my book \"Witch Hunt\", I kept asking myself, who invented the lie the Russia hoax? What was the genesis? I discovered it was Hillary Clinton. It was drawn from the insidious depths of her fictive imagination that was magnificently devious and classic Hillary Clinton, meant to distract from her own email scandal and to frame her opponent in the presidential campaign with crimes he didn't commit. Guess who caught on to it? The CIA. In the summer of 2016, before the election, they discovered that Hillary Clinton had invented this lie, financed the lie, and threw her minions like Sussman disseminating the lie. So alarmed with CIA Director Brennan he rushed to the White House to tell Obama about it who buried it. In order to cover his butt, Brennan then sent a criminal referral against Hillary to James Comey. What did he do with it? He buried it, and instead he proceeded to use the lie as a pretext to spy on the Trump campaign and to pursue an investigation of Donald Trump to ruin his forthcoming presidency and to some extent he succeeded.

The second leg of the stool, we saw fully exposed today, a lawyer named Michael Sussman going in and creating a computer piece of garbage, basically suggesting that there was secret communications going on and then giving it to the FBI after he was warned, after he and his team was warned that this was a red hearing, meaning it wasn't real. He gives it to the FBI and then he lies to the FBI saying, I'm giving to this to you because I'm a good citizen, I don't have any client. He was being paid by Hillary Clinton for every moment he worked on that including the day he met with the FBI. That's the second leg of the stole. The third leg of the stool are the deep staters, the Bruce Ohrs, and the people at the State Department and others that joined in Hillary Clinton in flooding the FBI with all this Russian disinformation, this collusion allegation to make it look real on the final days of the election.",

For example, he teamed up with Hunter back in 2006 to start a hedge fund reportedly telling one financial executive, quote, don't worry about investors, we've got people all around the world that want to invest in Joe Biden. And that's not all, because the book which is called \"The Bidens\" explores Biden's very troubling history on race relations and more.

      "utterance": "Day 33, our fellow Americans hostage trapped by enemy lines, abandoned by Joe Biden. And tonight, the level of incompetence inside the Biden State Department -- wait until you hear the latest updates -- they're beyond shocking, their coordination with the very professional and business-like murdering terrorists in the Taliban is not going as planned to say the least. Now, by the way, children as young as nine and ten are getting executed. Lara Logan has a full report. Later also, we'll bring you an important update. The young woman named Gabby Petito who has been missing now for weeks after her fiance returned home from a cross-country trip that they were taking together without her, and he's clamming up. Gabby's mother, father, stepfather will all be here. Why won't he try and help them? But, first, Joe Biden is desperate to move on from the crisis that he created his own making in Afghanistan. And frankly, everywhere else. He hasn't even mentioned it since last week. Now, his poll numbers have never been lower, and he is desperate for a political win. Well, first, he tried to shift the focus to COVID-19, announcing his brand new, clearly unconstitutional vaccine mandate during a nasty speech, where he was scolding and vilifying half the country. But with infections spiking nationwide Biden's poll numbers surrounding the pandemic, they're also in the tank tonight. So, today, he tried to shift the focus once again, this time, he targeted corporations and millions of Americans who, according to Biden, just aren't paying their fair share. Okay, top 10 percent pay 90 percent of the bill. Anyway, I wonder if this includes zehuro experience Hunter who's reportedly being investigated but not paying taxes. Is Hunter included Joe? Now, regardless, Biden's remedy, a massive tax hike or tax hikes in order to raise funds for something Democrats are now calling human infrastructure. In other words, big government socialism from welfare to childcare to Medicare to more Obamacare to pre-K to daycare to free college to college tuition forgiveness, all in the name of climate change. You see climate change as defined in the swamp as swamp jargon, that equals socialism. Now, of course, any tax hike on corporations, you will pay that. That will be passed on to the consumers, and the inflation from any massive spending bill, that will hurt lower income Americans the most. In fact, after this year's reckless federal spending of Biden, \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting, quote, for the lowest paid Americans, real wages adjusted for rising prices fell 0.5 percent in August. That is a dramatic decline. People are paying more for energy to fill their tanks with gasoline, to heat and cool their homes and they're paying more for every product they buy in every store because it costs more to ship it there. That means the spending power for lower income Americans went down. Their salaries were essentially slashed because of Biden's policies. But today, as per usual, you didn't get the truth from Joe Biden. Instead, we get a whole lot hacking and coughing, I don't know Biden's been battling this mysterious illness for weeks. Take a look."

And we can continue to do it and COVID -- the data shows the overwhelming majority of Americans agree with my proposal, that there's no surprise.

I think we can see you know why Vice President Harris frequently conducts all these meetings with foreign leaders instead of Biden. And, of course, she does have plenty of time. Biden's borders are Kamala has done absolutely nothing to fix the crisis at the southern border. Now, this is the scene at the border -- look at your screen. Over the past 24 hours, 4,000 migrants crossed into Texas were apprehended by border patrol, including many unaccompanied children. On Tuesday night, two babies rescued by border patrol after they were abandoned right in the middle of the Rio Grande. And as you can see, the situation is so dire that Texas Governor Greg Abbott attempted to shut down six points of entry with Mexico and then the bight administration blocked his efforts. So far this year, in the middle of a pandemic, more than a million and a half illegal immigrants have been apprehended and then processed and allowed into the country from the southern border, including over two hundred thousand alone in the month of August, and a lot of them are put in those overcrowded Biden cages in the middle of a pandemic with a high rate of COVID positivity, oh, and by the way, they're not tested and there's no vaccine mandate and then they are dispersed to the rest of the country, many with COVID. This is a essentially officially now the biggest super spreader event in human history and the financial and human toll is extreme. Joe Biden doesn't seem to care. In fact, Joe Biden hasn't said one word about the border crisis in over a month. And breaking tonight, according to our own Bill Melugin, we showed you, this is drone footage from FOX News, the FAA, they just implemented a flight restriction over this international bridge right there, trying to prevent FOX's drone from showing you the American people the truth and capturing images just like this. In other words, the FAA is being used to cover up for Biden's failures. We're going to let that stand. I don't think so. Here now at the Del Rio international bridge in Texas where thousands of illegal immigrants wait to be processed, the Senator Ted Cruz. And, Senator, first of all, the FAA -- we know the DOJ has been weaponized. Now, the FAA is going to be weaponized?"

So, now, the FAA is saying, please, no journalists allowed. As you know, they did the same thing in the Donna tent facility in the Rio Grande Valley where they wouldn't allow FOX News to come in when I brought 19 senators to the Rio Grande Valley. I had to go in with my cell phone and photograph and take videos. I'll tell you. I'm right there -- that bridge is behind me, and I just finished going again with my cell phone taking videos of what's happening there. It is the most horrific thing I've ever seen."

Can you explain to me with the vaccine mandates that Joe Biden is placing on the American people how is it possible that Democrats rejected the plan to mandate vaccines for illegal immigrants? They're not even testing them. You showed us, the overcrowded cages in the middle of a pandemic. We know the high rate of COVID positivity. Then they're dispersed throughout the country. How many Americans get sick and die that we will never know about because of what these open borders?"

They don't have the capacity to do that. And let me tell you something stunning that I learned tonight about why this happened, because this is a man-made crisis. Eight days ago, on September 8th, under that same bridge, there were between 700 and a thousand people. That was what was coming a day about a thousand, sometimes eleven hundred, but it would range between seven hundred and eleven hundred. Then eight days ago on September 8th, the Biden administration made a political decision. They announced that they were no longer going to fly deportation flights back to Haiti. Eighty-five percent of the people under there are from Haiti, they're fleeing from Haiti. They announced they weren't going back. There were about 900 Haitians who were getting ready to board the flights when the political operatives in Washington canceled the flights. Well, what happened? Those 900 people, they all pulled out their cell phones and they emailed their friends, and they emailed their families and they texted their friends and their families. That was eight days ago on September 8th. Today, it's September 16th, eight days later, and 700 people has grown to 10,500 because the word has gone out, if you're from Haiti, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have said we have open borders, come to Del Rio and they will let you in. Everyone under that bridge is turning themselves in and it's a political decision that Joe Biden could end tonight by simply following the law and saying, we are going to send people back to Haiti which is what federal immigration law requires until Biden and Harris got into office."

Senator, I guess now you're unofficially and not paid reporter reporting live on the ground in Texas -- Texas Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for sharing the videos with us, on a serious note. It's an important story. Thank you, Senator. Now, the crisis at the border, that's just one of many self-inflicted catastrophes of the Biden administration. As we speak, the situation in Afghanistan also remains dire. We have, according to Darrell Issa, and many other contacts we have, up to 500 Americans still trapped. Even Blinken admits thousands of our friends, Americans with green cards, Afghan allies, tens of thousands have been left behind. And the terrorists, the Taliban, they're growing more violent by the day. According to a report, \"The New York Post\", a former U.S. Army officer working to rescue at-risk individuals inside Afghanistan is claiming two children, one age 9, one age 10, recently beheaded by the ever business- like and professional Taliban as Joe Biden calls them. As Biden's State Department is allegedly encouraging those trapped inside Afghanistan, they're actually telling them, you might want to visit. You're trapped as a hostage to the Taliban behind enemy lines, the State Department, Blinken is advising that you visit an embassy in a neighboring country if you need a visa. Mr. Blinken, how on earth is someone held hostage by the whims of the Taliban behind enemy lines that your -- that you and Joe Biden abandoned, how are they going to get to that neighboring country? Your stupidity is beyond shocking. Here with more, FOX Nation host, Lara Logan. Lara, welcome back. You've been following this closely. There are rescue efforts that we will hear many stories of heroism. But what's happening is real.

Those lies as dishonest as saying that all the Afghans gave up and all the political leaders fled the country and Afghans loved the Taliban. That's why they didn't fight them, right? None of this is true, and it's hard to really describe the depth of evil that is really implicit in these false statements, because every single one of these people knows when they say those words how far it is from the truth. And more than that, when they have yet to explain why when you have Afghans who you know are at risk, who you know are vulnerable, the most vulnerable in the entire country right, because they've worked for your intelligence agencies, they have capabilities like biometric capabilities right, and they have sources and methods and all kinds of top secret even above that you know capabilities, why would you not protect these people why would you instead take their lists of them their contact numbers, their addresses their family members, their biometrics and hand that to the very people who want to kill them, in fact who are killing them, who are going to their homes every night at around local time and taking them from their homes. If you're an Afghan and they see a light on that's from a phone that's filming, you go with them. These people have not been seen again. The Taliban is executing and torturing and doing extrajudicial killings of people all across the country. And you know what, Sean? It's not just the Taliban. I wish we could just stop lying about this. It's ridiculous. The intelligence agencies know they're tracking in real time that al Qaeda is leading the assault, the military assault in the Panjshir Valley, and their higher ups, they don't want to know about it, don't talk about al Qaeda. That has been the political narrative since the Obama administration. It has been the political narrative of all of these Democrats and Republicans and staffers who have lied to this about this to the American people and to see them on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to see them stand up and say never forget.

Sussman, the defendant in this indictment, is one of the minions that was spreading the lie at the behest of Hillary Clinton and now he's been caught allegedly lying about his lie. The person who should really be indicted is Hillary Clinton. One of the things I discovered as I pored through thousands of pages of documents as I was writing my book \"Witch Hunt\", I kept asking myself, who invented the lie the Russia hoax? What was the genesis? I discovered it was Hillary Clinton. It was drawn from the insidious depths of her fictive imagination that was magnificently devious and classic Hillary Clinton, meant to distract from her own email scandal and to frame her opponent in the presidential campaign with crimes he didn't commit. Guess who caught on to it? The CIA. In the summer of 2016, before the election, they discovered that Hillary Clinton had invented this lie, financed the lie, and threw her minions like Sussman disseminating the lie. So alarmed with CIA Director Brennan he rushed to the White House to tell Obama about it who buried it. In order to cover his butt, Brennan then sent a criminal referral against Hillary to James Comey. What did he do with it? He buried it, and instead he proceeded to use the lie as a pretext to spy on the Trump campaign and to pursue an investigation of Donald Trump to ruin his forthcoming presidency and to some extent he succeeded.

In the book that I wrote a year ago, we talked about this poll that Hillary Clinton did in the summer that showed her and Bill Clinton's dealings in Russia, the money that was changing hands and the closeness to the Putin regime was the single greatest liability to her being elected president, and they set out to neutralize that by making the eventual Republican nominee Donald Trump look like he was in bed in Russia, not her. And they created a three-legged stool. The first leg of the stool was Christopher Steele and his bogus dossier. The second leg of the stool, we saw fully exposed today, a lawyer named Michael Sussman going in and creating a computer piece of garbage, basically suggesting that there was secret communications going on and then giving it to the FBI after he was warned, after he and his team was warned that this was a red hearing, meaning it wasn't real. He gives it to the FBI and then he lies to the FBI saying, I'm giving to this to you because I'm a good citizen, I don't have any client. He was being paid by Hillary Clinton for every moment he worked on that including the day he met with the FBI. That's the second leg of the stole. The third leg of the stool are the deep staters, the Bruce Ohrs, and the people at the State Department and others that joined in Hillary Clinton in flooding the FBI with all this Russian disinformation, this collusion allegation to make it look real on the final days of the election."

And they did -- you know, they would -- they affirm and attest that it's true to the best of their knowledge. They found out it wasn't. They used it anyway. Are they going to be held accountable, John? Last question."

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. There's more grand jury activity, more criminal investigation going on. It's a year too late, but it is going on. And the focus on that are the FBI people who worked on the FISA court and submitted those knowingly false documents. I think you might see some more indictments there and then finally a report where the whole story is told from beginning to end."

      "utterance": "All right: Greg Jarrett, John Solomon, we'll follow the story. You're right, a year late. Now, also tonight, an upcoming book is blockbuster revealing more of the nefarious behavior of the Biden family syndicate and also revealing how they use their political status to profit and enrich themselves. And remember, it's not just zero experience Hunter Biden because Joe's brother Jim Biden is also a key player as well. For example, he teamed up with Hunter back in 2006 to start a hedge fund reportedly telling one financial executive, quote, don't worry about investors, we've got people all around the world that want to invest in Joe Biden. And that's not all, because the book which is called \"The Bidens\" explores Biden's very troubling history on race relations and more. We did reach out to the Biden White House for comment, and Jen Psaki has yet to circle back, and we have yet to hear anything. Here to explain this and much more is the author the new book \"The Bidens: Inside the First Family's 50-Year Rise to Power\", political reporter Ben Schreckinger is with us. Ben, welcome to the program. BEN SCHRECKINGER, AUTHOR, \"THE BIDENS\": Thanks for having me. Let's start on the issue of race. I talked a lot about Biden and race and the things that he said about oh we can't go to a 7/Eleven - Dunkin Donuts, for the first time ever, clean, bright, articulate that storybook. Then I talked about his relationship with Robert \"KKK\" Byrd standing against integration of schools and busing. You chronicle that and more what is your take on the issue of Joe Biden in the issue of race and why does he going to pass when Republicans wouldn't?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRECKINGER",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, Joe Biden has a long history -- a long public record positions that he held in the 1970s are not ones that he ran on in 2020 when he won. One of the big ones that you referred to is his position on bussing. We go into that in depth in the book. He was a leading opponent of busing in the Senate in the 1970s, and, obviously, that's not a position he is trumpeting today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Okay. Also, his family apparently lived in a house and over a decade apparently, he moved into the house that his parents had vacated in Delaware, and it was a house that had a restrictive covenant. What was that restrictive covenant about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRECKINGER",
      "utterance": "There had been a restrictive covenant on that house. It was owned by his father. Biden lived in it for a few years in the 1970s, barring ownership by any black person. By the time Biden lived in that house, the Supreme Court had rendered that clause completely unenforceable. But this is something that came out actually during the Robert Bork hearings in the 1980s when there was questions about covenants on a house that Bork had lived in. It emerged that Biden had also lived in a house with one of these covenants as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Okay. What is your conclusion then? You did all the research. You discover all this information on Biden and race. What do you conclude?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRECKINGER",
      "utterance": "You know, I conclude that he held a number of positions over the course of his career that he's not sticking to today and are not the positions that he was running on in 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Okay, it sounds like you're ducking. Does this sound like somebody that is has evolved on racial issues or somebody that's being politically expedient on racial issues? Because I can't see you know uh when Robert Byrd died, why anybody would praise the former Klansmen that filibustered the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and Joe Biden worked hand in hand in to stop the integration of public schools and busing, because they didn't want public schools to be racial jungles, those are Joe's words. So what do you conclude?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRECKINGER",
      "utterance": "You know, I can't -- I can't say what is going on in Joe Biden's heart. I do know that those are not things that he's eager to highlight today. And things that are sort of uncomfortable for him to revisit when you --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Okay, let me ask the question another way. Why does the media give him a pass? Why did they give him a pass on that issue? Do you think they would give Donald Trump that pass?"

      "speaker": "SCHRECKINGER",
      "utterance": "You know, I -- and again I can't speculate on --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Ben, Ben, apply common sense here. Donald Trump, if he was involved in stopping the integration of public schools because he didn't want schools to be racial jungles, if he said it, it would be all over the place, wouldn't it? Joe Biden got a pass because he's a Democrat, isn't that really what happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRECKINGER",
      "utterance": "What I can say, Sean, is that I do not give Joe Biden a pass in this book. There's a lot of very, very tough scrutiny both of his record on race a lot of it deals with his family's business dealings over the years and it's something that I've also been covering at \"Politico\" for the last two years, and it's told in the most complete form in this book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So our friend Peter Schweizer, \"Secret Empires\", broke the story. He discussed a lot about the money he was making abroad. Let me ask you this -- well actually we're just out of time. I will bring you back for more, but the book is interesting. I learned things that I hadn't learned before. I appreciate you being with us. But here to get reaction to it is \"New York Post\" columnist, FOX News contributor Miranda Devine. Miranda, he didn't want to go there but yet it's in there. The answer was pretty obvious, that there's a double standard and if Donald Trump did it, we know what the reaction of the media would be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIRANDA DEVINE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, and I mean you don't really need a degree in Bidenology to see that. We saw that during the campaign. Joe Biden's sort of innate racism just leaked out. He -- you know, his cognitive issues mean that I guess his inner feelings are less easy to cover up, but we saw him in a -- with a black talk show host saying if you don't vote for me, then you ain't black. You know, we've seen a lot of examples such as that and we know that during his career when he was compos mentis, when he was a high flyer in the Senate, he presided over an absolutely appalling judiciary confirmation hearing in which he treated Clarence Thomas in the most appalling way, that Clarence Thomas felt that that he was being racially discriminated against. And we've just seen this history of Joe Biden. Remember when he talked about crime and his sons not wanting them to grow up in a jungle? When he presided over the most draconian crime laws in the country that targeted specifically black men. So, you know, he now has done a complete and unfortunately, you know, he's serving penance for himself -- that's between himself and his maker. But he's making the rest of the country be complicit in his -- you know, previous racism and it's not a systemically racist country, but Joe Biden is projecting his own problems onto the entire country. We're all suffering for it."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I'm waiting. All right. We look forward to it and you'll tell the truth of what's in the laptop that the media we know covered up. All right. Now, when we come back you're not going to want to miss a shocking new information, the disappearance of 22-year-old Gabby Petito. This story, the twist that turns, why won't this boyfriend help this family? It is unbelievable. Trace Gallagher with the latest and Gabby's family pleading, begging for information from the boyfriend about their missing daughter. We'll speak to her parents, coming up, straight ahead."

And tonight, even more developments after Utah police earlier today releasing an August 12th bodycam footage after a 9/11 call about a possible domestic violence incident. Here with the very latest is our own Trace Gallagher. Trace, what's inexplicable to me, why is this boyfriend not telling this family that's missing their daughter where he last saw her and left her?"

They visited national parks, documented the entire trip on Instagram and drove in a camper van owned by Gabby. Then on September 1st, Landrie shows up at his home in Florida with Gabby's van but without Gabby. It wasn't until days later that Gabby's family reported her missing. That's 10 missing days. Police and Gabby's family say time is running out and they are begging Brian Landrie to cooperate, but he refuses and his lawyer says it's because whatever Landrie says can be used against him, but police counter with, if he's not involved, why would he not help find his fiancee? And we now have as you mentioned that police body cam video of Gabby in Utah. This was taken after she was in a physical altercation with her fiance. She was upset. Watch."

I'm looking -- I'm just trying to stand back and as a parent myself, I have a son and a daughter, trying to put myself in your shoes. It's impossible. Believe me, I understand that and I'm very sorry to all of you for living through this. I'm trying to understand why this boyfriend, ex-fiance ends up back at his home in Florida and will not tell you where he last saw your daughter? Why won't he -- why -- any human being with a soul would be doing everything possible to help you get the answers to find your daughter.

We think she might be in danger and we just -- we just want him to talk. Just tell us, where was she? Where did you leave her? You know, I wanted to just know what happened and I'm getting angry now at this point as you can tell. I'm -- I'm beyond frustrated. You know, as a mother to another mother, I beg his mother to make him speak or at least for the parents to say something."

Where did you last see her? Now, you suspect that this August 30th text was not actually sent from Gabby. Why do you suspect that, and what has been the outreach to this young man and his family in terms of will you please help us find the -- our daughter that you were with and you took her van home?"

So, in all honesty, it's -- we're all trying to find the answer, and the only person who knows it is -- you know, is sitting over in their house over there and you can't have a more frustrating situation. I mean, I mean, think about it. Look where we are, you know? Everyone's sitting here trying to -- trying to bring Gabby home, and the only one who doesn't care is the one who's supposed to care about it the most."

And now, and we we're asking everybody you know to continue looking because obviously, the three people or that live in that house just don't care. They can put whatever statement they want out, at the end of the day, they do not care. It's as cold and is as cruel as you could possibly be, and they're over there. And so, the rest of us and the rest of the country are doing everything they can. I get emails from strangers I've never met, dying to help."

We know as little as you at that -- at this point, but -- I know my daughter and if you do the math, we know that she didn't send it because he was home September 1st, and they never went to Yosemite. They never had planned to go to Yosemite. So it's obvious."

I mean, if someone texted me that they're calling the police because they can't find my -- you know, my son, you know, I'm going to drop whatever I'm doing to call me back.

I last talked to her on the 21st. So anytime after that, and when Nikki spoke to her, anytime after that, is where we are concentrating on. So that video is -- whatever you want to call it, as it can be, distracts from everything we are trying to do. We are trying to find Gabby. The video, we got contacted after that. So, to me, at this moment, that video doesn't mean as much as her location."
