      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News Alert. In is a massive win tonight for President Trump, the Supreme Court has reinstated very key parts of his extreme vetting travel ban and announced that it will hear arguments in this ongoing legal battle straight ahead. Also, president Trump on Twitter writing, quote, \"Very grateful for the 9-0 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. We must keep America safe.\" Jay Sekulow will be here tonight with reaction, also Newt Gingrich, \"The Great One,\" Mark Levin, a rare appearance, will also join us.  But first, everything Democrats, the destroy Trump media have been telling you about Russia election interference, collusion, conspiracy theories, obstruction of justice, and all the other criminal activity has been flipped on its head. Tonight, we'll explain about how everything boomerangs right back on the Democrats. And that is tonight's \"Opening Monologue\" you won't hear anywhere else.  All right, so for months, the destroy Trump media has been floating the conspiracy theories and pushing all kinds of unfounded accusations against President Trump and members of his administration. But guess what? It's actually now boomeranging back. The left -- they are the ones guilty of committing the very things they have been accusing the president and people close to the president of.  In other words, the real colluders are the ones who have been claiming collusion by trying to score cheap political points and by making these absurd and wild claims about the president. Democrats are actually now exposing themselves, leaving themselves wide open. Now, the real fault for Russia's election interference now falls -- guess what? At the feet of former President Obama. The real crimes were committed, in fact, by Hillary Clinton. The real obstructer of justice is the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch. The real Russia conspiracy is the Uranium One deal and another one I'll explain tonight. And the real corrupt collusion is the relationship between the former FBI Director James Comey, and his BFF hiring every liberal Democrat he can, the special counsel, Robert Mueller.  Let's start with Russia election meddling. Now, according to a brand-new report, President Obama knew exactly what he was going through and what was going on during the election. He chose, starting in August of 2016, to do nothing. Now, President Trump spoke this morning about the stunning hypocrisy during an interview with \"Fox & Friends.\" Take a look.",

Now, remember, Democrats have been claiming the Russia interference, which, for the record, didn't change actual vote tallies according to every top government official who's testified, but they're saying it was so egregious that it threatened the very foundation of this country.Well, if that's the case, why did Obama stay silent?  The answer we now know is simple. According to a report, the president didn't do any investigation because he actually thought Hillary was going to win. In other words, let me translate here. The only reason Russia interference in the story is a big deal is because Donald Trump won. Now, that's what the special counsel needs to be investigating tonight, real collusion, Obama this time defending Hillary, colluding so she'd win and not rocking the boat. And by the way, that's why everyone should be freaking out about right now, and they are. Now, we need to know what did President Obama know, when did he know it, and maybe he could come and clear up some serious questions. After all, it was Obama who promised to be more flexible with Vladimir. Remember this with Medvedev? \"I'll have more flexibility after the election.\"",

      "sentences": "Then tonight, there's actual crimes and actual felonies being committed. Well, we know Hillary Clinton -- the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible as it relates to her e-mail server. Democrats, the destroy Trump media for months -- well, they've accused President Trump of breaking the law without any evidence, without any proof. Now, meanwhile, we have evidence of real crimes, and it's right in front of their faces and has been for a long time. Hillary Clinton broke the law by mishandling top secret, classified, special access program information on her email server that she put in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. James Comey said Clinton was, quote, \"extremely careless,\" which is -- essentially, that's the same thing as what the law calls for, gross negligence. And then, of course, we have obstruction of justice. Democrats, they've been claiming, well, President Trump tried to interfere in the Russia investigation, which once again, no proof, none. And as we now found out, the real obstructor of justice appears to be the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Her actions have become such a problem that now a group of bipartisan senators announced late last week they are now going to do their job and investigate the former Obama attorney general for potentially influencing the investigation into Hillary's email server.  And by the way, here's why. We know last summer, Lynch met on a tarmac, remember how inappropriate that meeting for 40 minutes with Bill Clinton was just days before former FBI Director James Comey announced that he was giving Hillary a free pass after basically 13 minutes of a stinging indictment.  And while testifying before Congress, Comey also revealed that Lynch told him to call the investigation a \"matter,\" which, by the way, is how Clinton's own campaign wanted it referred to. And finally, remember Circa News, they broke the massive story a couple of weeks ago about how it was James Comey who confronted Lynch over potentially putting the entire kibosh on any Clinton indictment! In other words, the fix was in. This Lynch scandal, by the way, is now getting so bad that even Democrats are admitting this is now a problem, which we've been telling you about for a long time.   Lynch now needs to be put under oath to testify. Why? Because you, the American people, deserve to know the truth. And as for the real Russia conspiracy, it doesn't have anything to do President Trump. It now deals with this important information that we know, the Uranium One deal. In other words, secretary of state, then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Remember? She signed off on giving 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons, to Vladimir Putin and the Russians.  By the way, a lot of people involved in that deal, they were kicking back huge millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And her husband was doubling his speaking fees in Moscow.  Now, Democrats, the destroy Trump media want to talk about collusion, let's have the conversation, let's do it. Because the real collusion going on is between the disgruntled former FBI Director James Comey, also the special counsel Robert Mueller. Comey admitted that the reason he had a friend leak the memo to The New York Times is he wanted a special counsel. And guess what? Mueller, his BFF, was appointed. And Comey and Mueller's relationship is a massive conflict of interest! Now, on top of that, members of Mueller's investigative team -- let's see. They've donated huge bucks to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton. By the way, Mueller is even so corrupt, he went as far as to actually hire one of the lawyers that had done legal work for the Clinton Foundation to prevent you, the public, from getting Freedom of Information Act requests, and by the way, help defend in this particular case.   All of these reasons are exactly why Mueller needs to step down, resign the special counsel witch hunt, end it, and by the way, and also the politically motivated so- called investigation once and for all.  Also tonight, we have an explosive report from The New York Post. Here's the headline. Quote, \"Sketchy firm behind Trump dossier is stalling investigators.\" And The Post explains that the firm behind the dossier, which is called Fusion GPS, they're refusing to respond to requests from the Senate Judiciary Committee about that fake document which has helped fuel and even begin the phony Russia conspiracy theories. And the congressional sources tell The Post that a firm has a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda. Oh, interesting. Remember, that's the dossier that talked about Trump at Ritz-Carlton in Moscow with two prostitutes urinating on his bed? There's also this fact, that according to reports, the FBI, James Comey at the time, offered to pay the person who created the fake dossier $50,000! Now, the FBI's previously told Fox News that it denied making any payments.  Now, the Trump-Russia collusion investigation has been turned now completely on its head. We shouldn't be surprised if Democrats -- if they start now -- well, maybe we ought to let this all come to an end because now they've opened the door for their own investigations and real trouble. We call it the boomerang effect.  Joining us now, author of the number one New York Times best-selling book \"Understanding Trump,\" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich. Let's start with Comey wanting to pay the guy that came up with the phony dossier! Let's start there -- 50 grand.",

Before we get into specifics, Mark, I want to stay on this issue for just a second. Eleven months, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. Turns out there's no evidence of any collusion.

A special counsel gets appointed because of James Comey's leaking of information, and intelligence information, by the way, that was already out on the situation. This is outrageous. An absolute outrage, inexcusable. The president deserves an apology.",

Time after time the professional Trump haters over Clinton News Network, they have been proving my point, including over the weekend, for Clinton News Network once again published a demonstrably false Russia collusion story that they now have been once again forced to completely retract. There's a major credibility crisis at CNN, and it starts at the top with the fake news chief, Jeff Zucker. That's tonight's mini monologue. Last Thursday, CNN published a story alleging that longtime Trump ally, personal friend of mine, by the way, Anthony Scaramucci, was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. But 24 hours later, the story was completely debunked. CNN was forced to issue this embarrassing retraction, quote, \"That story did not meet CNN's editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.\" Jeff Zucker must be so proud. But the problem is this is only the latest example of very fake news coming from CNN. On June the 16th, CNN again forced to delete a tweet, issue a correction after implying only Democrats prayed at the Congressional baseball game prior to the opening pitch. And on June 15th, CNN senior White House correspondent, somebody who is becoming unhinged like liberal Joe, Jim Acosta tweeted and deleted a fake claim that President Trump didn't visit Congressman Scalise in the hospital following the Congressional baseball shooting, which was tragic and a lie. And that's not all. Earlier this month, CNN actually had to rewrite a story that incorrectly predicted James Comey would refute certain statements from President Trump during his testimony. It didn't happen. Now all of these are just recent examples from this month alone. Take a look at some of the many conspiracy theories that are being pushed on a regular basis on CNN, and the downright vicious, nasty coverage of the administration that takes place at night after night, day after day on air. Watch this. JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST. MAY 9: It's a grotesque abuse of power by the president of the United States. This is the kind of thing that goes on and non-democracies. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT, MAY 11: At the dessert course he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie instead of the single scoop for everyone else.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News Alert. In is a massive win tonight for President Trump, the Supreme Court has reinstated very key parts of his extreme vetting travel ban and announced that it will hear arguments in this ongoing legal battle straight ahead. Also, president Trump on Twitter writing, quote, \"Very grateful for the 9-0 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. We must keep America safe.\" Jay Sekulow will be here tonight with reaction, also Newt Gingrich, \"The Great One,\" Mark Levin, a rare appearance, will also join us. But first, everything Democrats, the destroy Trump media have been telling you about Russia election interference, collusion, conspiracy theories, obstruction of justice, and all the other criminal activity has been flipped on its head. Tonight, we'll explain about how everything boomerangs right back on the Democrats. And that is tonight's \"Opening Monologue\" you won't hear anywhere else. All right, so for months, the destroy Trump media has been floating the conspiracy theories and pushing all kinds of unfounded accusations against President Trump and members of his administration. But guess what? It's actually now boomeranging back. The left -- they are the ones guilty of committing the very things they have been accusing the president and people close to the president of. In other words, the real colluders are the ones who have been claiming collusion by trying to score cheap political points and by making these absurd and wild claims about the president. Democrats are actually now exposing themselves, leaving themselves wide open. Now, the real fault for Russia's election interference now falls -- guess what? At the feet of former President Obama. The real crimes were committed, in fact, by Hillary Clinton. The real obstructer of justice is the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch. The real Russia conspiracy is the Uranium One deal and another one I'll explain tonight. And the real corrupt collusion is the relationship between the former FBI Director James Comey, and his BFF hiring every liberal Democrat he can, the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Let's start with Russia election meddling. Now, according to a brand-new report, President Obama knew exactly what he was going through and what was going on during the election. He chose, starting in August of 2016, to do nothing. Now, President Trump spoke this morning about the stunning hypocrisy during an interview with \"Fox & Friends.\" Take a look."

    {
      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it. But nobody wants to talk about that. The CIA gave him information on Russia a long time before they even -- you know, before the election. And I hardly see it. It's an amazing thing. To me, you know, in other words, the question is, if he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it. But you don't read that. It's quite sad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Why did Obama not do anything about this? Now, the president is making an excellent point. And by the way, he's not the only official who's calling out Barack Obama for failing to act. Remember, he had this information in August of 2016. Now the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff, he's also slamming the former president. Hard to believe, but watch this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "The American people needed to know, and I didn't think it was enough to tell them after the election.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "That's correct, we the people needed to know. So the real question tonight is, if President Obama knew what Russia was doing back in August of 2016, why didn't he act? Now, remember, Democrats have been claiming the Russia interference, which, for the record, didn't change actual vote tallies according to every top government official who's testified, but they're saying it was so egregious that it threatened the very foundation of this country.Well, if that's the case, why did Obama stay silent? The answer we now know is simple. According to a report, the president didn't do any investigation because he actually thought Hillary was going to win. In other words, let me translate here. The only reason Russia interference in the story is a big deal is because Donald Trump won. Now, that's what the special counsel needs to be investigating tonight, real collusion, Obama this time defending Hillary, colluding so she'd win and not rocking the boat. And by the way, that's why everyone should be freaking out about right now, and they are. Now, we need to know what did President Obama know, when did he know it, and maybe he could come and clear up some serious questions. After all, it was Obama who promised to be more flexible with Vladimir. Remember this with Medvedev? \"I'll have more flexibility after the election.\""

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Then tonight, there's actual crimes and actual felonies being committed. Well, we know Hillary Clinton -- the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible as it relates to her e-mail server. Democrats, the destroy Trump media for months -- well, they've accused President Trump of breaking the law without any evidence, without any proof. Now, meanwhile, we have evidence of real crimes, and it's right in front of their faces and has been for a long time. Hillary Clinton broke the law by mishandling top secret, classified, special access program information on her email server that she put in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. James Comey said Clinton was, quote, \"extremely careless,\" which is -- essentially, that's the same thing as what the law calls for, gross negligence. And then, of course, we have obstruction of justice. Democrats, they've been claiming, well, President Trump tried to interfere in the Russia investigation, which once again, no proof, none. And as we now found out, the real obstructor of justice appears to be the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Her actions have become such a problem that now a group of bipartisan senators announced late last week they are now going to do their job and investigate the former Obama attorney general for potentially influencing the investigation into Hillary's email server. And by the way, here's why. We know last summer, Lynch met on a tarmac, remember how inappropriate that meeting for 40 minutes with Bill Clinton was just days before former FBI Director James Comey announced that he was giving Hillary a free pass after basically 13 minutes of a stinging indictment. And while testifying before Congress, Comey also revealed that Lynch told him to call the investigation a \"matter,\" which, by the way, is how Clinton's own campaign wanted it referred to. And finally, remember Circa News, they broke the massive story a couple of weeks ago about how it was James Comey who confronted Lynch over potentially putting the entire kibosh on any Clinton indictment! In other words, the fix was in. This Lynch scandal, by the way, is now getting so bad that even Democrats are admitting this is now a problem, which we've been telling you about for a long time. Lynch now needs to be put under oath to testify. Why? Because you, the American people, deserve to know the truth. And as for the real Russia conspiracy, it doesn't have anything to do President Trump. It now deals with this important information that we know, the Uranium One deal. In other words, secretary of state, then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Remember? She signed off on giving 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons, to Vladimir Putin and the Russians. By the way, a lot of people involved in that deal, they were kicking back huge millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And her husband was doubling his speaking fees in Moscow. Now, Democrats, the destroy Trump media want to talk about collusion, let's have the conversation, let's do it. Because the real collusion going on is between the disgruntled former FBI Director James Comey, also the special counsel Robert Mueller. Comey admitted that the reason he had a friend leak the memo to The New York Times is he wanted a special counsel. And guess what? Mueller, his BFF, was appointed. And Comey and Mueller's relationship is a massive conflict of interest! Now, on top of that, members of Mueller's investigative team -- let's see. They've donated huge bucks to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton. By the way, Mueller is even so corrupt, he went as far as to actually hire one of the lawyers that had done legal work for the Clinton Foundation to prevent you, the public, from getting Freedom of Information Act requests, and by the way, help defend in this particular case. All of these reasons are exactly why Mueller needs to step down, resign the special counsel witch hunt, end it, and by the way, and also the politically motivated so- called investigation once and for all. Also tonight, we have an explosive report from The New York Post. Here's the headline. Quote, \"Sketchy firm behind Trump dossier is stalling investigators.\" And The Post explains that the firm behind the dossier, which is called Fusion GPS, they're refusing to respond to requests from the Senate Judiciary Committee about that fake document which has helped fuel and even begin the phony Russia conspiracy theories. And the congressional sources tell The Post that a firm has a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda. Oh, interesting. Remember, that's the dossier that talked about Trump at Ritz-Carlton in Moscow with two prostitutes urinating on his bed? There's also this fact, that according to reports, the FBI, James Comey at the time, offered to pay the person who created the fake dossier $50,000! Now, the FBI's previously told Fox News that it denied making any payments. Now, the Trump-Russia collusion investigation has been turned now completely on its head. We shouldn't be surprised if Democrats -- if they start now -- well, maybe we ought to let this all come to an end because now they've opened the door for their own investigations and real trouble. We call it the boomerang effect. Joining us now, author of the number one New York Times best-selling book \"Understanding Trump,\" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich. Let's start with Comey wanting to pay the guy that came up with the phony dossier! Let's start there -- 50 grand."

Obama was notified in August of 2016. He didn't want to rock the boat because he thought Hillary had it in the bag. Now, with this knowledge, what should we take from that?"

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I think now we do have proof of collusion within the Obama administration. Various departments and agencies involved in intelligence and law enforcement colluded to cover this up and keep it from the American people and obstruct our knowledge during the course of the election. If they really thought that Donald Trump colluded, don't you think they would have put of this information way back in August? The president is exactly correct. They figured Hillary would win. They sat on this information. Then they put it out near the end of the election in order to try and help her. And Hillary Clinton goes on and on with collusion. The Democrats pick it up. And for now some God reason we have a special counsel. I think that special counsel, Mr. Mueller, ought to consider expanding his investigation to include the prior administration, to include their activities with the Russians, to include their activities to cover up for Vladimir Putin. And while he's at it, he may want to include domestic surveillance, which I believe took place and the unmasking of American citizens, perhaps some of the Trump transition team members. So by my count..."

I've talked a lot and at length about unmasking, surveillance and leaking of raw intel. Then we have Hillary. You know, it's incontrovertible, the evidence she committed crimes here. And if you want a real Russian collusion story, it's the Uranium One deal where he she gave 20 percent of America's uranium to Putin and she got kickbacks..."

They kept that information from the American people in the course of a presidential election because they thought it would help Hillary. They certainly weren't trying to help Donald Trump. Now, it seems to me we honestly need to get to get the bottom of the real collusion. Now we have collusion! The Democrats should be excited. Collusion's been found. It's among them! And I think we need to get to the bottom of it. We have obstruction, potentially, real potential obstruction with the former attorney general of the United States, Loretta Lynch! So by my count -- Loretta Lynch, right? By my count, we have potential collusion, right. By my count, the Democrats have a problem on their hands. Hillary Clinton was criminally investigated, too. So my attitude about this is, you want a special counsel? Now, Mr. Special Counsel, when you're done hiring every liberal Democrat in Washington, D.C., you might want to reconsider what you're doing and take a look at the prior administration."

You have your own way of saying it, Mark. And we've got these real problems. We also both agree that America's at a tipping point. We better get it right now. And what they're doing to destroy this man is unprecedented in history. And this goes to the heart of your book, is that one of the things I love about your books is, number one, your passion for the Constitution, our country, for our framers, founders. But not only that, those that inspired them come shining through. They all warned about deep state. They all warned about the size and scope of government. Explain how that fits into the narrative you're advancing in this book."

    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, the problem is when you look at the media and Hollywood and education in our public schools and colleges and universities, when you listen to Democrats speaking a lot of Republican speak, you reach the conclusion, if you understand history and you dig into it, that the progressives have won, that we're in a post-constitutional period. We don't even talk about the principles that made this country great. So what I try to do it in my own little way is take them on, take on the progressive masterminds, take on the attitude in our government, take on the attitude in our media for people who are interested. You know, the fact is that if you ignore the academics and intellectuals, you know, people -- their eyes roll over and they say, Oh, forget about it. You ignore them, you lose your country because they're the ones that drive the politics. They're the ones that determine whether you're free or not in every society. So I take them on. There's a difference between being an elite -- we like elites, sports players, elite chefs -- and elitist, who is a putdown person or tries to control you or something of the sort. And Sean, from my book, I put down a short list of the difference between those of us -- Americanism and the others, progressivism. These are the two forces, one liberty, one tyrannical."

The White House releasing a statement a short while ago saying that the United States has identified potential operations for another chemical weapons attack by Syria's Bashar Assad regime. According to the White House, the activities are similar to those made before a chemical attack was carried out on April 4th of this year. That attack killed more than 80 people and sickened hundreds more. Many of those victims were children. Once again the White House says it has seen evidence that Assad's regime is preparing to carry out another chemical attack in Syria. And in a statement, the White House says if his regime carries out another chemical attack, there will be a heavy price to pay. Three days following the last chemical attack, President Trump reacted swiftly, authorizing a cruise missile strike in Syria with a warning of another strike if the regime continued.

You know, I look at President Trump, and here is a guy that, you know, frankly, practical, commonsense, instinctive knowledge that big government is oppressive and wrong, regulations are burdensome, it's hurting the American people, millions more in poverty and food stamps and out of the labor force. Doubling our debt is dumb. Top down health care is stupid. And he has all of that instinctively. And look at how those forces that support the opposite of what you're explaining in this book react to him trying to drain that swamp and get back to those founding principles, perhaps without the intellectual foundation that maybe you have, but, frankly you're one of the few people that really do. MARK LEVIN, AUTHOR, \"REDISCOVERING AMERICANISM\": They are definitely out to destroy him, and I think they are out to destroy him for three fundamental reasons. Number one, he's not one of them, and they really thought they would get Hillary Clinton and four more years of this crazy leftist type government. That's number one.

President Reagan was in there eight years, started the process. Then the other Republican presidents come in and they unravel it. It's like with Obamacare right now. The Republicans are basically giving imprimatur to a massive progressive government program. The way you do it is this. You shrink the size of government. If you're going to go into every department and agency, it's like hand-to-hand warfare in the jungle. That doesn't work. Slash them across the board except for defense and federal law enforcement and intel. Slash them across the board, 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent. Call in McConnell, call in Ryan, and read them the riot act if you can. If they won't do what the president says, then replace them. He is the leader of the Republican Party. Replace them. So far I would replace them, but what do I know? So you need to do that. There's another issue, too."

And that would allow us through our state legislatures to change the nature of this government, which has been stolen from us.

And I'm going to say something else that's not even related to this. I want to thank the president for something. He gets attacked for this. Thank you for taking on the media. It's damn about time somebody did. Don't stop tweeting.

So we now know that the Obama administration had the intelligence and the information regarding Russia's engagement in hacking and other activities in the previous election. They knew it over a year ago. So they had the information. They took no action of significance on the information because of the election, convinced that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Instead Donald Trump becomes the president of the United States. Then we end up with a -- after they knew all of this information, they had the information, we now have a special counsel investigating Russia collusion and Russia activities based on information the government already had. So why isn't there a special counsel, instead of wasting their time with this, why isn't there a special counsel looking at why did the Obama administration take no action on this issue of Russian engagement? Why is it that that wasn't the issue that was being looked at by the special counsel? So in my view now when you look at the entire case as the evidence comes out, again, no evidence of Russian collusion, how many witnesses have already lined up to say that? None."

Time after time the professional Trump haters over Clinton News Network, they have been proving my point, including over the weekend, for Clinton News Network once again published a demonstrably false Russia collusion story that they now have been once again forced to completely retract. There's a major credibility crisis at CNN, and it starts at the top with the fake news chief, Jeff Zucker. That's tonight's mini monologue. Last Thursday, CNN published a story alleging that longtime Trump ally, personal friend of mine, by the way, Anthony Scaramucci, was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. But 24 hours later, the story was completely debunked. CNN was forced to issue this embarrassing retraction, quote, \"That story did not meet CNN's editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.\" Jeff Zucker must be so proud. But the problem is this is only the latest example of very fake news coming from CNN. On June the 16th, CNN again forced to delete a tweet, issue a correction after implying only Democrats prayed at the Congressional baseball game prior to the opening pitch. And on June 15th, CNN senior White House correspondent, somebody who is becoming unhinged like liberal Joe, Jim Acosta tweeted and deleted a fake claim that President Trump didn't visit Congressman Scalise in the hospital following the Congressional baseball shooting, which was tragic and a lie. And that's not all. Earlier this month, CNN actually had to rewrite a story that incorrectly predicted James Comey would refute certain statements from President Trump during his testimony. It didn't happen. Now all of these are just recent examples from this month alone. Take a look at some of the many conspiracy theories that are being pushed on a regular basis on CNN, and the downright vicious, nasty coverage of the administration that takes place at night after night, day after day on air. Watch this. JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST. MAY 9: It's a grotesque abuse of power by the president of the United States. This is the kind of thing that goes on and non-democracies. JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT, MAY 11: At the dessert course he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie instead of the single scoop for everyone else. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR, MAY 30: He gains weight according to these sources. He doesn't trust people around him, he's withdrawing, not a good picture."
