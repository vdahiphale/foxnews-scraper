In just 30 minutes President Trump will sit across from Chinese President Xi as a potential trade deal hangs in the balance. You'll see all of the drama unfold right here. So stay with us.  Before we get to that, though, we're going to break down last night's wild Democratic debate - the big moments, the clashes, the gaffes, and yes the gifts for President Trump and Republican ad makers.  Dennis Kucinich is here to tell us why Kamala Harris was wrong to come after Joe Biden in that forum and Raymond Arroyo has a special follies about how age, radical positions and religion are all shaping this this race.  But first. Could last night really signal the end of the road for Democrat front runner Joe Biden, as some have claimed? To say the former VP missed expectations last night's debate is an understatement. He's seem a bit unprepared for the main stage and he seemed weak.",

This is part of the problem that vice presidents have. Let me tell you what he should have done last night. He should have had a Sister Souljah moment, where he turned to Kamala Harris and explained to her that it was 2019 and the complaints that she was raising about bussing isn't even popular within the black community, let alone within America, broadly. That's what he should have done.  But, those who live by the sword die by the sword\".

But what happens today with President Xi really will tell the tale as to whether trade talks between the United States and China on a new, more balanced trade relationship get back on track, or if things continue the way they are and that we see the tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs. We have heard a bit of a scene set, or setting the table from the Chinese side. They want to try to control the narrative here. They've told us in the last 48 hours that there's a few things they want. First of all, before China allows any concessions on trade, they want all of the tariffs that are currently against China to be lifted. They also want Huawei, the big Chinese telecom giant, to be taken off the entities blacklist sometime within the next three months or so. And they have also said that President Trump has promised that he will not impose any new sanctions against China. Remember, he has been threatening 10 percent now on some $300 billion in Chinese goods if they can't get a trade deal going. But China is saying that President Trump has promised he will not impose any new tariffs for six months. In a meeting yesterday with Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, the president was asked directly about that, and he said no, I have made no such promise. I've heard from other senior administration officials that it's unlikely that they would take Huawei off the entities blacklist. So China really here is trying to control the narrative. The United States at the same time is saying, look, we're not doing anything different than we're doing right now. But I think both countries would like to see those trade talks back on track because this idea of increasing sanctions on both sides really isn't helping anybody.",

And 10 years ago we weren't getting three percent annualized GDP, we weren't the largest oil exporter in the world as we're going to be. We were relatively a lot weaker.

We have a lot more oil and natural gas than they do. They're dependent on 50 percent of the Middle East exporting.

With President Macron he's got a very warm relationship. He's like that, big hand shack, touches you on the shoulder, pats you on the back, whatever. But when he does that with Vladimir Putin, of course, it is seen in a different light. Just want to add something to your discussion here about Kim Jong-un if I could. Our spider sense has been tingling for the last couple of weeks thinking that President Trump after learning that he was going to go to South Korea on the tail end of this was going to try to make a trip to the DMZ because the last time he was in South Korea when he addressed the South Korean parliament, he tried to helicopter up there the last time. Moon Jae-in was already up there, he drove up. President Trump was going to take the helicopter up, but he couldn't get down on the ground because fog had moved in. So he has always wanted to go. So when we heard he was going to South Korea we figured that he was probably going to the DMZ. Today's tweet about Kim Jong-un really came as a surprise. He did let on earlier this week that he may try to contact him some other way other than having a one-on-one meeting. So this morning's tweet was a bit of a surprise. But I'm told, though, that typically with most presidents you wouldn't put something like that out unless you had the whole thing pre-cooked and it was all arranged. Then you put out the tweet to say hey, why don't you come down, we'll meet, and it's already done. Apparently, it's not. So this really is just an open invitation. The president might have said something about it when he responded to the birthday greeting that President Kim gave him a couple of weeks ago. But I'm told there was nothing pre-cooked in this. It's just the president reaching out to say, hey, if we can put this together let's do it.",

And remember April 27th of last year, that shot where Kim Jong-un walked across the DMZ, the line of demarcation there, and shook hands with Moon Jae-in. We were wondering the very first time that the president met in Singapore, were they going to meet there at Panmunjom and have a same sort of thing? We could see that tomorrow. If Kim gets the message and says, you know what, it's a couple hour drive from Pyongyang, why not do it? What a scene that would be.

In just 30 minutes President Trump will sit across from Chinese President Xi as a potential trade deal hangs in the balance. You'll see all of the drama unfold right here. So stay with us. Before we get to that, though, we're going to break down last night's wild Democratic debate - the big moments, the clashes, the gaffes, and yes the gifts for President Trump and Republican ad makers. Dennis Kucinich is here to tell us why Kamala Harris was wrong to come after Joe Biden in that forum and Raymond Arroyo has a special follies about how age, radical positions and religion are all shaping this this race. But first. Could last night really signal the end of the road for Democrat front runner Joe Biden, as some have claimed? To say the former VP missed expectations last night's debate is an understatement. He's seem a bit unprepared for the main stage and he seemed weak."

Black turnout - voting turnout dropped 7 percent in 2016 from 66.6 percent to 59.6 percent. You want African-Americans to vote, have a plan. Address racial disparities in wealth, wages health. Well, talk about working poor families. Look at the crime and the murder rate in black communities and how people are treated by the police. I mean these are issues that will motivate people.

Race is in the water we drink, whether it's Flint Michigan, it's in who goes to jail, who gets shot, who gets killed by the police. You cannot avoid race. And she was just letting it known what he had already had said, like a week or so later. I mean, honestly, Joe Biden literally put his foot in his mouth a week or so ago when he brought up the whole section about segregationists. And all she did is shove his foot down his throat, that's all that happened."

I want to be absolutely clear about my record a position on racial justice, including busing. I never, never, never ever oppose voluntary busing and as a program that Senator Harris participated in and it made a difference in your life. I've always been in favor of using federal authority to overcome state initiated segregation."

I mean - I just - I find this to be just fascinating. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR OF PROJECT 21: Couple of quick takeaways. One, did you note how tired he sounded both during the debate, giving back his time. Who does that? And even during the cleanup period. It was some tracery that he had to go through. This is part of the problem that vice presidents have. Let me tell you what he should have done last night. He should have had a Sister Souljah moment, where he turned to Kamala Harris and explained to her that it was 2019 and the complaints that she was raising about bussing isn't even popular within the black community, let alone within America, broadly. That's what he should have done. But, those who live by the sword die by the sword\". He called out Republicans and his opponents as racist saying, \"They're going to hook you guys all back up in chains\". And now it's come back to haunt him. He should never have used the race foil and it's never a good idea to have that--"

Debbie, you raised the criminal justice issue. OK. Those are - seem to be - those are interesting today. To me that was a disconnect. And I understand it was a Kamala's moment - Kamala's moment. This is the echo chamber of Washington. I'm not sure long term that ends up playing. But the media reaction post-debate about some of the positions that were taken, panel, was quite revealing.

Somebody should be talking about that instead of just, \"Well, you did this so many years ago\". That's legitimate to raise it. But when you focus on that, you don't give any options for people. Voters get turned off and polarization in an election - some people will vote, others might not. You got to be very careful.

So this is not just a new 2019 thing, whether it was a deportations or whether it was not fighting hard enough for the public option. This is not just something that's being raised. And so what Joe Biden he's going to try to attach himself to the coattails of President Obama. He gets to take the good and the bad. And it seems like that's all he wants to do. But he has to run when his record and his past. He has to do that. He cannot stand on his mother's, father's or sister's or his brother or President Obama."

That was a sad moment for Biden. And I've always liked him like, I guess, I don't agree with him. But I've always kind of liked Biden as just a person.

      "speaker": "COOPER",

One of the reasons is that a Vice President is selected to balance the ticket, not to be in the mainstream of the ticket. But when he runs in the primary, he has to sit in the middle of where the party is and that means he has to forego his existing record. You saw that with Mondale. You saw that with Al Gore. You're seeing it now with him. Add to that the poison of, we can call anybody a racist for any reason today, and what you see is a man who's living on borrowed time."

In addition to that, when she looks down, she's also grasping at her emotions. When we look down what happens is, we try to get our thoughts together because we can break eye contact that way. So in that regard she's breaking eye contact to get her thoughts together and then kind of give out the same speech that she gave during the debate.

Really a lot of people are just uncomfortable holding eye contact or they can't really grasp their thoughts. So it's difficult to hold eye contact with someone and gather your thoughts and your emotions and then be able to deliver your message.

So what she's doing unconsciously is not only agreeing with herself but trying to engage you to agree with her in addition to that. So when she's talking there you saw a slight negative head movement, so there was some unconscious question ability on her part.

      "utterance": "Laura, good morning to you from Osaka. It is the biggest meeting of the G20. The meeting with Vladimir Putin yesterday was pretty big and produced a couple of interesting moments. But what happens today with President Xi really will tell the tale as to whether trade talks between the United States and China on a new, more balanced trade relationship get back on track, or if things continue the way they are and that we see the tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs. We have heard a bit of a scene set, or setting the table from the Chinese side. They want to try to control the narrative here. They've told us in the last 48 hours that there's a few things they want. First of all, before China allows any concessions on trade, they want all of the tariffs that are currently against China to be lifted. They also want Huawei, the big Chinese telecom giant, to be taken off the entities blacklist sometime within the next three months or so. And they have also said that President Trump has promised that he will not impose any new sanctions against China. Remember, he has been threatening 10 percent now on some $300 billion in Chinese goods if they can't get a trade deal going. But China is saying that President Trump has promised he will not impose any new tariffs for six months. In a meeting yesterday with Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, the president was asked directly about that, and he said no, I have made no such promise. I've heard from other senior administration officials that it's unlikely that they would take Huawei off the entities blacklist. So China really here is trying to control the narrative. The United States at the same time is saying, look, we're not doing anything different than we're doing right now. But I think both countries would like to see those trade talks back on track because this idea of increasing sanctions on both sides really isn't helping anybody."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

We don't want to do that, so we're going to go back to the drawing board on that, and that's when the new sanctions kicked in. But China would have to agree to all of that, because those really are the pillars. It's the unfair trade practices, the intellectual property theft, the forced technology transfer."

And the president is saying, look, this playing field has been tilted in China's favor for far too long, and the United States is not going to continue to be the economic powerhouse of the world if we continue letting China rebuild its country with American money. So the president wants to change all of that. We don't know if he's going to be able to do that, but he's certainly going to try."

Instead they interpreted our magnanimity as a weakness to be exploited. And 10 years ago we weren't getting three percent annualized GDP, we weren't the largest oil exporter in the world as we're going to be. We were relatively a lot weaker. But I think we're dealing from a position of strength. And then it is not an optional choice. What we're seeing now is abnormal. The technological appropriation, the cheating, the currency manipulation, the commercial distortion, and what Trump is trying to do to bring back a return to normalcy. You have got to remember that, again, one American worker produces twice the GDP of three Chinese workers. We have about 17 of the top 20 universities in the world. China has none. We have a lot more oil and natural gas than they do. They're dependent on 50 percent of the Middle East exporting.

We have a narrative here in Washington the world is ending because we've imposed tariffs and we're hurting worse than they are. In truth it's the opposite. I think Donald Trump knows that. But there's something else happening I think with the president.

And the losers of that asymmetry are so often people on the interior of the United States. And they're tired of it, and Trump is the first person that has changed the entire narrative. What is weird, or strange, Laura, is that there are all sorts of people across the political spectrum, even liberals now are coming out of the woodwork and saying China has reeducation camps, China is persecuting religious minorities.

Their tests have been hardly successful by any means. So there is no danger in that sense. I think what President Trump is considering is an end of war declaration, which is desperately needed on the peninsula, which is something that both the South and the North Koreans want.

Again, the left, though, it's very interesting to watch the box that he has put the left in on this issue of China and the issue of peace and his desiring peace above war with Korea. And Victor, you and I have talked about this before. June 25th, was that the anniversary of the Korean War anniversary, correct, I believe, June 25th, we just commemorated it. So where does this leave President Trump in the pantheon of diplomacy and diplomatic intrigue?"

And that's that Trump is doing, and that conflates the leftist agenda or the progressive narrative that he wants war. Really, people who insist on military strength, and he has increased the defense budget, and they don't talk always about international solutions, then that gives him the leeway psychologically, politically, culturally, economically with a strong economy as well, that allows you to have the margin of error that you can reach out and you can show that you don't want war. But when you say that you rule out force and your economy is stagnant and you have cut the defense budget and you talk about all these utopian pie in the sky international solutions, then you're not taken very seriously unfortunately given the nature of humankind. Human nature being what it is, they look at that and they say he wants a deal too bad or he is never going to stand up to us so we're going to take advantage of him. I wish it wasn't true, but that's the way it is. And Trump understands human nature. He has got a cunning that has been completely underestimated by both his foreign and domestic opponents."

      "utterance": "And John Roberts is back with us. John, I have to bring up this freak-out in the political class of President Trump and his walking with Vladimir Putin. We spoke about this earlier, oh, he touched his back, and that shows that he is sideling up to dictators and so forth. I mean, Trump does that with everybody. Obama did that with Medvedev, he touched his knee in 2012, and no one said anything about that. But suddenly, it's wow, he is inviting them to meddle in the next election. But you've spent a lot of time with the president, John. How does he do with the body language and arm around someone, especially in that situation? What are you sensing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "And of course, we remember the famous moment when President Obama whispered to Medvedev that I'll have more flexibility after I'm reelected. The president, he does have one of those demeanors where he is a very touchy sort of person. He kissed Angela Merkel on each cheek when he greeted her earlier today. With President Macron he's got a very warm relationship. He's like that, big hand shack, touches you on the shoulder, pats you on the back, whatever. But when he does that with Vladimir Putin, of course, it is seen in a different light. Just want to add something to your discussion here about Kim Jong-un if I could. Our spider sense has been tingling for the last couple of weeks thinking that President Trump after learning that he was going to go to South Korea on the tail end of this was going to try to make a trip to the DMZ because the last time he was in South Korea when he addressed the South Korean parliament, he tried to helicopter up there the last time. Moon Jae-in was already up there, he drove up. President Trump was going to take the helicopter up, but he couldn't get down on the ground because fog had moved in. So he has always wanted to go. So when we heard he was going to South Korea we figured that he was probably going to the DMZ. Today's tweet about Kim Jong-un really came as a surprise. He did let on earlier this week that he may try to contact him some other way other than having a one-on-one meeting. So this morning's tweet was a bit of a surprise. But I'm told, though, that typically with most presidents you wouldn't put something like that out unless you had the whole thing pre-cooked and it was all arranged. Then you put out the tweet to say hey, why don't you come down, we'll meet, and it's already done. Apparently, it's not. So this really is just an open invitation. The president might have said something about it when he responded to the birthday greeting that President Kim gave him a couple of weeks ago. But I'm told there was nothing pre-cooked in this. It's just the president reaching out to say, hey, if we can put this together let's do it."

He has a bunch of things to do in the morning, but he's got a lot of time in the afternoon, and it is supposed to be good weather. So he could always go up there. And remember April 27th of last year, that shot where Kim Jong-un walked across the DMZ, the line of demarcation there, and shook hands with Moon Jae-in. We were wondering the very first time that the president met in Singapore, were they going to meet there at Panmunjom and have a same sort of thing? We could see that tomorrow. If Kim gets the message and says, you know what, it's a couple hour drive from Pyongyang, why not do it? What a scene that would be. And the critics, of course, will say the president is going there and he's getting nothing for it. But it is relationship management, and if you can keep the relationship going, maybe you can keep the dialogue going, yes."

There he is just moments away is this meeting that he is going to have -- I think it's the biggest of his presidency, no doubt about it, with President Xi of China. Of course we have ongoing stalemate in these trade talks with fairly significant tariffs being put on about now $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. U.S. market affected mostly in soybeans. But still Wall Street, a lot of big businesses want to see an end to the tariffs. President Trump has stood fairly firm in the face of enormous amount of pressure brought to bear upon him. And he will be sitting down in just a moment. These always take a while to set up as John Roberts knows all that well. We have a lot of chairs there, and a lot of talks have already taken place between Bob Lighthizer and the Chinese trade minister. There you go. There's the photo. Let's listen in. The sound is going in and out. When it comes up, we'll bring it back to you. He's not touching his back. Looks a little chilly to me. The president standing firm, handshake. He put the firsthand shake out, and Xi has to take it. There goes the touch of the back, that's the domination move again. There he goes. Steve Mnuchin, of course Treasury Secretary, Bob Lighthizer, the chief of staff, Mike Pompeo, all lined up, John Bolton is at the end of the table. There we go. Let's listen in. We're noticing here at the studio that President Trump does not look all that happy. Maybe we're reading too much into it. We don't want to do that. Mike Pompeo is pretty stern faced. I think Colonel MacGregor agrees with me. Ivanka is smiling."

And that marked the beginning of what we now call ping-pong diplomacy. The small ball played a big role in moving world events. And then eight years later in 1979 our two countries established diplomatic relations 40 years ago. Forty years on, enormous change has taken place in international situation and China-U.S. relations, but one basic fact remains unchanged -- China and the United States both benefit from cooperation and lose in a confrontation. Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation. Recently Mr. President, you and I have stayed in close communication through phone calls and exchange of letters. Today I'm prepared to exchange views with you on the fundamental issues concerning the growth of China/U.S. relations so as to set the direction for our relationship in the period to come and to advance the China-U.S. relationship based on coordination, cooperation, and stability."

I have seen a culture that rarely would you see. Chinese culture is an incredible culture. I look forward to working with you. As you know, we've had an excellent relationship, but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade. I think it's something that's actually very easy to do. I actually think that we were very close and then we -- something happened where it slipped a little bit. And now we're getting a little bit closer. But it would be historic if we could do a fair trade deal. We're totally open to it, and I know you're totally open to it. I know all of your representatives have been working very hard with my representatives and the representatives of the United States. And I will say that I think this can be a very productive meeting and I think we can go on to do something that truly will be monumental and great for both countries, and that's what I look forward to doing.

He was Ronald Reagan's deputy trade representative, the youngest ever in the United States. And left retirement, semiretirement, to come back and work in the U.S. government.
