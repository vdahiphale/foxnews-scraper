      "sentences": "Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD, I'm Jesse Watters. The President is confused: That's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. The country is confused about COVID because the President is confused. He doesn't understand the science and he doesn't know what to do. People are uncertain about the delta variant. Why it's different? If it's deadlier? Where cases are going up and if cases even matter at this point? Do we need a booster shot? No clue. The teachers unions have been wishy-washy on school reopenings. No one understands why kids are wearing masks. Why would we do that? And are masks back in certain counties, but not other counties? Biden has been no help. He wears masks outside and no masks inside. Makes no sense. And no one trusts Fauci anymore. He has been all over the map on every issue and just looks partisan and deceitful, especially about the lab leak. So, are you returning to the office in the fall? Companies are switching up their return to work plans? Are people going to be wearing a mask inside? We don't know. And if COVID is such a threat, why is Biden bussing COVID positive migrants into Texas and Florida? None of this adds up, and Americans are alarmed. Nobody trusts the media to tell them the truth. Media confidence is shot. We've been lied to about everything. So, even when we're told the truth, we don't believe it. If we say what we really believe on social media, we get censored. So, we feel under attack from our own country. Joe Biden has a messaging problem. He campaigned on ending the pandemic and restarting the economy. The pandemic has ended and the economy has been restarted. But Biden acts like none of that happened. Seventy percent of the country is vaxxed and deaths are at the lowest level ever this summer, but Biden is hyping this delta variant, moving backwards on masks and mandates, and the liberal teachers unions are like, \"Oh, I don't know if we can open in the fall.\" And if the economy is back up and humming like Biden claims it is, why do we need to keep everybody -- giving everybody free rent? Why do we need to spend trillions in stimulus? And why don't Americans feel that? Because millions are still sitting on the sidelines and the rest of our wage gains are offset by high gas prices. The Biden administration's COVID and economic message, it is all messed up. And the President has a bigger problem in that -- management. He can't do it. The man can't manage anything. Wherever Biden and the Democrats are in charge, it is a disaster. The border was mismanaged into a full blown crisis. The cities have been mismanaged. Crime wave everywhere, quality of life gone, people fleeing to Florida or the burbs and buying guns. Record spending sent prices soaring. And the teachers unions and crazy school boards are destroying the classroom with racism, driving parents nuts. All of these problems didn't have to happen. But the left made them happen and Biden doesn't have a clue how to address any of them. He just utters a bunch of garbage his speech writers write for him and shuffles off stage. He doesn't inspire confidence. It's only going to get worse. So, will Republicans take advantage of it? Joining me now for reaction, FOX News contributor, Newt Gingrich. So, it's a mess. Speaker, do you think the Republican Party can come in and make any hay out of these problems?",

It worked last time and he gained seats when people thought he was going to lose seats. But he gained them by recruiting the right people, competing there with positive ideas -- and this is going to be a mess. You know, when you realize how many people are coming in basically, the Biden administration is importing a city every month of illegal immigrants. In the month of July, they imported the equivalent of the City of Birmingham, Alabama. That's how many people came in, and they're going all over the country. We have no idea where they're going. Well, this kind of thing can't go on very long. You have dramatically rising crime rates in our biggest cities, we really are rising at a rate that gets you back to the early 1970s when we thought crime was terrible. And I think you have a spending spree underway that is going to bring massive inflation. So, you take all those pieces and put them together and you have sort of Jimmy Carter times 20. And I think that by next summer, this will be a disaster and the Democrats will be seen as a party that is incapable of solving any of these problems.",

      "speaker": "The President is confused",
      "utterance": "That's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. The country is confused about COVID because the President is confused. He doesn't understand the science and he doesn't know what to do. People are uncertain about the delta variant. Why it's different? If it's deadlier? Where cases are going up and if cases even matter at this point? Do we need a booster shot? No clue. The teachers unions have been wishy-washy on school reopenings. No one understands why kids are wearing masks. Why would we do that? And are masks back in certain counties, but not other counties? Biden has been no help. He wears masks outside and no masks inside. Makes no sense. And no one trusts Fauci anymore. He has been all over the map on every issue and just looks partisan and deceitful, especially about the lab leak. So, are you returning to the office in the fall? Companies are switching up their return to work plans? Are people going to be wearing a mask inside? We don't know. And if COVID is such a threat, why is Biden bussing COVID positive migrants into Texas and Florida? None of this adds up, and Americans are alarmed. Nobody trusts the media to tell them the truth. Media confidence is shot. We've been lied to about everything. So, even when we're told the truth, we don't believe it. If we say what we really believe on social media, we get censored. So, we feel under attack from our own country. Joe Biden has a messaging problem. He campaigned on ending the pandemic and restarting the economy. The pandemic has ended and the economy has been restarted. But Biden acts like none of that happened. Seventy percent of the country is vaxxed and deaths are at the lowest level ever this summer, but Biden is hyping this delta variant, moving backwards on masks and mandates, and the liberal teachers unions are like, \"Oh, I don't know if we can open in the fall.\" And if the economy is back up and humming like Biden claims it is, why do we need to keep everybody -- giving everybody free rent? Why do we need to spend trillions in stimulus? And why don't Americans feel that? Because millions are still sitting on the sidelines and the rest of our wage gains are offset by high gas prices. The Biden administration's COVID and economic message, it is all messed up. And the President has a bigger problem in that -- management. He can't do it. The man can't manage anything. Wherever Biden and the Democrats are in charge, it is a disaster. The border was mismanaged into a full blown crisis. The cities have been mismanaged. Crime wave everywhere, quality of life gone, people fleeing to Florida or the burbs and buying guns. Record spending sent prices soaring. And the teachers unions and crazy school boards are destroying the classroom with racism, driving parents nuts. All of these problems didn't have to happen. But the left made them happen and Biden doesn't have a clue how to address any of them. He just utters a bunch of garbage his speech writers write for him and shuffles off stage. He doesn't inspire confidence. It's only going to get worse. So, will Republicans take advantage of it? Joining me now for reaction, FOX News contributor, Newt Gingrich. So, it's a mess. Speaker, do you think the Republican Party can come in and make any hay out of these problems?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the problem is going to be so big by the time of the election next year that the country will turn to the Republicans, and I think on the House side, Kevin McCarthy clearly has a strategy. It worked last time and he gained seats when people thought he was going to lose seats. But he gained them by recruiting the right people, competing there with positive ideas -- and this is going to be a mess. You know, when you realize how many people are coming in basically, the Biden administration is importing a city every month of illegal immigrants. In the month of July, they imported the equivalent of the City of Birmingham, Alabama. That's how many people came in, and they're going all over the country. We have no idea where they're going. Well, this kind of thing can't go on very long. You have dramatically rising crime rates in our biggest cities, we really are rising at a rate that gets you back to the early 1970s when we thought crime was terrible. And I think you have a spending spree underway that is going to bring massive inflation. So, you take all those pieces and put them together and you have sort of Jimmy Carter times 20. And I think that by next summer, this will be a disaster and the Democrats will be seen as a party that is incapable of solving any of these problems."

He doesn't talk about it anymore. You know, the border, the media doesn't talk about the border, because kids are now being hidden by Joe, so they don't have any pictures to exploit. So, it's not even on his radar. Do you think he is even cognizant of these rising issues that are just disturbing the American people?"

I said the other day, I waver between Fauci and Biden and whose cognitive ability I worry about the most, because I think both of them, frankly, are only partially in touch with the real world. And, you know, President Biden, I think, gets almost nothing anymore. And he didn't, frankly, even when he was a senator, he didn't get much."

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",

Look, even the French are having riots over the idea of this vaccine passport and America has, you know, a very deep tradition of actually being in favor of individual liberty. So, the idea that the government is going to come in and insist, you know that the last 15 or 20 percent get vaccinated, I think, is an example of tyranny and I think that it is outrageous. And I believe even -- I mean, I've been vaccinated twice. I'm not -- you know, and I think that it is a smart thing to get vaccinated."

But, you know, I will defend permanently the right of other Americans to say no. I mean, I am sick of watching these petty tyrants whether they are mayors or governors, or the President of the United States, who, by the way, issue orders, and then you see them violate their own rules. So, you're saying you're supposed to wear a mask inside, oh, but the Mayor of Washington doesn't, or the Mayor of Chicago doesn't, because after all, they are an aristocracy. They don't have to behave like the commoners. Well, that is absolutely unacceptable in America, and we ought to all rise as a country and say that and just say, no. A good friend of mine who is actually very reasonable, and I was shocked when she said to me, she was in Montgomery County, she said, if they come back with masks, I'm not wearing one and they can put me in jail."

I want the guy to celebrate his 60th, sounds like kind of a hot ticket. Nothing wrong with that. That didn't go against any guidelines.

I want her to get rid of this conservatorship. I want her to gain her freedom. But, Britney, she is getting naked all over social media. She is posing topless. She's dancing around like this, like the last four photos on her Instagram. She is totally naked. No shirt. Britney, keep your clothes on, just at least until the time you get through this litigation, then you can take your top off."

Not the way that I would curate my personal Instagram, but I'm also not a pop star. She does read comments though. She reads the criticism because she responded to it and she said, listen, if you don't like what I'm posting, if you don't like my dance videos, then unfollow me, which I thought was a pretty solid response. She is just out there doing her thing. I think she feels you know, restricted in other ways of life, and maybe her Instagram is her new artistic forum, Jesse."

Here we go again. He could not. Oh, you're going to do a slap some paint on this and cover Write up for Rocket Mortgage helped me find the home loan option that works for me so I could buy a place of my own. Now I don't have a landlord or leaky ceiling when you need to throw in the towel on renting Rate transcript quality"
