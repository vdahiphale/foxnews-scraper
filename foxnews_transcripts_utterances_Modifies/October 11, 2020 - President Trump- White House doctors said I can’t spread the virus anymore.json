      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" President Donald J.  Trump calling in live, following up on our interview from earlier in the week. The president will join me exclusively ahead of his big first rally since testing positive for COVID-19 now 11 days ago, this after the second presidential debate was canceled officially, with only 23 days left until the most important policy election of our lifetime.  The president will make his case for a second term right here. Also this morning, two weeks after I first reported on this program there will be no Durham report or indictments before the election, the president authorized the full declassification of all documents related to the fraud that was Russiagate and the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe, no redactions.  What has taken so long, and will there finally be justice? Former acting Director of Intelligence Ric Grenell is here. He was instrumental in exposing deep state corruption. He will investigate with us.  Also, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham here live after FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe pulled out of his witness testimony. What Graham subpoena do? And what he will do with Jim Comey's testimony about Hillary Clinton's plot and the FBI's role in the effort to take down her 2016 opponent, Donald Trump?  Senator Graham also set to begin Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearing. He will preview all of the agenda tomorrow and for the week,   Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also sits on Senate Judiciary. He is here with his expectations for the vetting process and which of his colleagues he believes he will be on the attack. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" But first this morning:  Senate hearings are scheduled to begin tomorrow for the president's Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett.   If confirmed, the 48-year-old mother of seven would become the 115th justice and only the fifth woman in U.S. history to serve on the high court. She'd also be the president's third Supreme Court appointee to the nine-member bench. As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham will preside over that process. He joins me now.  Senator, good morning to you. Thanks very much for joining us.",

We have learned that the warrant against Carter Page was illegally obtained by the FBI. They used a dossier that was unreliable, that was fraudulent, that Rosenstein, the acting attorney general, said, if he knew then what he knows now, he wouldn't have signed the warrant application, and McCabe.  Somebody had to know something. So, we're going to get McCabe in and see what he knew. But what did I tell you about three weeks ago? Something is coming out that is stunning. Well, that stunning event is now out. What do we now know that we didn't know a month ago? That, in July of 2016, the Russians had picked up information that Hillary Clinton approved a plan to smear Donald Trump being connected with the Russians as a political smear campaign.  We know that the past president, Barack Obama, was briefed about this effort by Hillary Clinton to smear Donald Trump, and condoned it. Now, is that a crime? I doubt it. Is it a crime to try to smear your opponent? Probably not.   But what Obama did is one of the most -- the saddest chapters in the history of the presidency. He knew that his party's nominee was out to try to link President Trump to Russia unfairly and without evidence, and he didn't do a damn thing about it.  That's what we now know.",

We now know that, in September 2016, the CIA intel community sent a lead over to the FBI, to Comey directly, to look at another effort by Clinton in September to link Trump to Russia, to avoid scrutiny over her e-mail problem. Comey said, that doesn't ring a bell. Well, when you look at the source documents, it went directly to him. So, if we can prove he actually knew about this request and did nothing, then he could be charged with perjury. He said he didn't know anything about all the problems with the dossier, that the subsource was a Russian agent. If we can find somebody to say, no, that's not true, I briefed him, he's in trouble.   If the Clinton Foundation used money from the foundation to pay for this smear campaign, they're in trouble. Anybody that hides evidence from the court, that alters evidence, they're in trouble. That's what Durham is looking at.  It's one thing for abuse of power, is generally not a crime. Political smears are generally not a crime. But the activity I just outlined is a crime.

It has money for illegal immigrants. It doesn't have a dime for the PPP program that saved small businesses. It requires ballot harvesting. It has got policy provisions that are just dangerous for the country. It's not about the money. It's about the policy. Trump's right to go big. Nancy Pelosi's package is a liberal dream.

They're going to abolish the Electoral College, which means New York and California pick our president. They're going to change America.

We must win this election, keep the Senate, because, if they win, they're not going to -- it's not going to be about a health care debate.

They were convinced that Hillary would win, and they didn't really want to challenge Goliath. They thought that their careers could be benefited if they just shut up. But here is the key to this whole argument that politicians in Washington need to focus on, I would also say the president's Cabinet members and the inspector generals all need to focus on.  Right now, we have Comey and Brennan and others saying that they didn't know that this was a Russian collusion hoax. Their people knew. And so what we need to figure out is, what level are these individuals going to go to jail? Somebody needs to go to jail, and be prosecuted first, obviously. And this is a slam dunk. They lied to the American people. They knew a truth, and they hid the truth. This can never happen again. We cannot allow our government to weaponize information, to hold it back. You know, now we have got Joe Biden literally saying that the American people don't deserve certain information. He got caught on a camera saying that. This is the ways of Washington.

You have got to get the kids back in school. And if you look at 99.9 percent with children, I mean, they're very -- their immune systems are very strong. And we have to get the schools open.

The president will make his case for a second term right here. Also this morning, two weeks after I first reported on this program there will be no Durham report or indictments before the election, the president authorized the full declassification of all documents related to the fraud that was Russiagate and the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe, no redactions. What has taken so long, and will there finally be justice? Former acting Director of Intelligence Ric Grenell is here. He was instrumental in exposing deep state corruption. He will investigate with us. Also, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham here live after FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe pulled out of his witness testimony. What Graham subpoena do? And what he will do with Jim Comey's testimony about Hillary Clinton's plot and the FBI's role in the effort to take down her 2016 opponent, Donald Trump? Senator Graham also set to begin Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearing. He will preview all of the agenda tomorrow and for the week, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also sits on Senate Judiciary.

      "utterance": "Well, I'm trying to get him to come in voluntarily. To be honest with you, the hearing interrupted the McCabe interview. What have we learned over the last year? We have learned that the warrant against Carter Page was illegally obtained by the FBI. They used a dossier that was unreliable, that was fraudulent, that Rosenstein, the acting attorney general, said, if he knew then what he knows now, he wouldn't have signed the warrant application, and McCabe. Somebody had to know something. So, we're going to get McCabe in and see what he knew. But what did I tell you about three weeks ago? Something is coming out that is stunning. Well, that stunning event is now out. What do we now know that we didn't know a month ago? That, in July of 2016, the Russians had picked up information that Hillary Clinton approved a plan to smear Donald Trump being connected with the Russians as a political smear campaign. We know that the past president, Barack Obama, was briefed about this effort by Hillary Clinton to smear Donald Trump, and condoned it. Now, is that a crime? I doubt it. Is it a crime to try to smear your opponent? Probably not. But what Obama did is one of the most -- the saddest chapters in the history of the presidency. He knew that his party's nominee was out to try to link President Trump to Russia unfairly and without evidence, and he didn't do a damn thing about it. That's what we now know."

We now know that, in September 2016, the CIA intel community sent a lead over to the FBI, to Comey directly, to look at another effort by Clinton in September to link Trump to Russia, to avoid scrutiny over her e-mail problem. Comey said, that doesn't ring a bell. Well, when you look at the source documents, it went directly to him. So, if we can prove he actually knew about this request and did nothing, then he could be charged with perjury. He said he didn't know anything about all the problems with the dossier, that the subsource was a Russian agent. If we can find somebody to say, no, that's not true, I briefed him, he's in trouble. If the Clinton Foundation used money from the foundation to pay for this smear campaign, they're in trouble. Anybody that hides evidence from the court, that alters evidence, they're in trouble. That's what Durham is looking at. It's one thing for abuse of power, is generally not a crime. Political smears are generally not a crime. But the activity I just outlined is a crime. And we will see where this goes."

It has money for illegal immigrants. It doesn't have a dime for the PPP program that saved small businesses. It requires ballot harvesting. It has got policy provisions that are just dangerous for the country. It's not about the money. It's about the policy. Trump's right to go big. Nancy Pelosi's package is a liberal dream.

A liberal Supreme Court is a nightmare for business, it's a nightmare for social policy. We can't let it happen. We must win this election, keep the Senate, because, if they win, they're not going to -- it's not going to be about a health care debate.

And that's a really big distinction. We now know that insiders in the government, at the CIA, at DOJ, at FBI, they knew that this was a Russian collusion hoax, and they allowed it to go forward, for a variety of reasons. They were convinced that Hillary would win, and they didn't really want to challenge Goliath. They thought that their careers could be benefited if they just shut up. But here is the key to this whole argument that politicians in Washington need to focus on, I would also say the president's Cabinet members and the inspector generals all need to focus on. Right now, we have Comey and Brennan and others saying that they didn't know that this was a Russian collusion hoax. Their people knew. And so what we need to figure out is, what level are these individuals going to go to jail? Somebody needs to go to jail, and be prosecuted first, obviously. And this is a slam dunk. They lied to the American people. They knew a truth, and they hid the truth. This can never happen again. We cannot allow our government to weaponize information, to hold it back. You know, now we have got Joe Biden literally saying that the American people don't deserve certain information. He got caught on a camera saying that. This is the ways of Washington. We need transparency, Maria. It's a very foreign concept in Washington, D.C., but the American people need to understand that those in Washington are hiding information from them. They think we're stupid."

And the career politicians, I will call them, like a Gina Haspel, does not want to declassify and disseminate this information, because it's going to embarrass the CIA? Is that what we're talking about? And then those career politicians said to themselves, well, we know this is not great info, we know that it's not true, but Hillary is pushing it, and she's going to be president, so we're going to go along with it?"

Barack Obama and Joe Biden are accused of seeing the warnings and the information that this was a Russian collusion hoax. They went forward with this anyway because it was going after their political opponents. They allowed misinformation, bad information, false information to go forward.

On the Twitter lockout, it's -- I happened to get the notice that I was locked out of Twitter, and I was talking to the president. And I told him. I told -- \"Mr. President, I just was locked out, and here's why.\" I showed ballots that had been sent to dead people. Two people that had been dead for 10 years got ballots. I showed the ballots. And Twitter has this community standards policing group that went after me. They didn't call the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters to say, hey, your rolls are bad and you're sending ballots to dead people. They locked me out of Twitter. I think, if we're going to have community standard policing from some of these tech companies, they need to go after the source.

What was discussed was Nancy Pelosi and others saying that, keep the country -- don't ban China, don't do that. In fact, she was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco. And the reason she was, because she wanted the business to come in. She didn't want to close up the country. And that was a long time after I had already closed it.

I got rid of it. That was a big thing. That changed Obamacare. That really didn't even make it Obamacare. But it's still no good. And we manage it much better than them. Remember with the $5 billion server? We manage it much -- the Web site. We manage it much better than them. But Obamacare's no good. We are going to have new health care. We are going to protect people with preexisting conditions, and they're going to pay a lot less money for the new health care. Now, we have already been doing that through different plans, through Department of Labor, et cetera, et cetera. We have already been doing it. We have some great plans. But what they want to do is get rid of 180 million people who have great private health care that they love. And they want to take it away and go socialized medicine. It's going to be a disaster. As far as taxes, we gave the largest tax cut in the history of our country, and a big beneficiary were middle-income people. We're giving a middle- income tax cut very soon. As soon as we win, we're giving a middle-income tax cut. It'll be a very substantial middle-income tax cut. And I have already done this. But you have to understand, we're increasing it. But, if you look, he wants to end the Trump tax cut, as we discussed. But, if you do that, you're talking about $2,000 child tax credit. But, very importantly, Maria, you're not mentioning one thing, energy. Energy will be $2,000 to $3,000 more a family, and probably much more than that, if they go with their crazy Green New Deal, because their Green New Deal is crazy.

I created 700,000 manufacturing jobs. All of that stuff will, as fast as it came in, it'll leave if you start raising taxes on them. And it's a very simple formula.

It's very unfair, what they do, very unfair. It's rigging an election in a different form than the ballots."

      "utterance": "It started before I won, and it started when they started seeing that I could win. And it's a disgrace, and we caught them. We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them doing things. Look, they were trying to destroy an administration. And they didn't do it, because this administration has done more than any administration in its first three-and-a-half years in the history of our country. We have done an incredible job, whether it's the military, or the tax cuts, or the regulation cuts, or the economy. Nobody's done a job like we have done, despite what they have done. We caught them, and we caught them cold, Maria. And it's a beautiful thing. Now we have to do something about it."

But I will tell you this. We now have created a military the likes of which we have never had before, in terms of equipment, the equipment that we have, the weapons that we have. And, hopefully, hope to God we never have to use them. But we have created a military the likes of which nobody has -- nobody has ever had. Russia, China, they're all envious of what we have had, all built in the USA. We have rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion. As far as the other question, I will check on it. I heard -- I heard about it two days ago, actually."
