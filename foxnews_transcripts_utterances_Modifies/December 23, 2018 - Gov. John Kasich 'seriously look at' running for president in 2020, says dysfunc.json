That doesn't mean a week (ph) before Thursday until we hear something back but I don't think things are going to move very quickly here the next couple of days."

Government shut down tomorrow anyway because it's the federal holiday and Tuesday is Christmas, again, another federal holiday. So, Wednesday is really the first day that this kicks in. The paychecks importantly will go out on the 28th. I want everybody to understand, no one is working without getting paid. Paychecks go out on the 28th. The next pay period that is impacted is January 11th. I think that is -- it's very possible that the shutdown will be on the 28th and into the new Congress."

The president tweeted out a picture yesterday the steel fence, the steel slated fence with a pointed top and so forth, that's what we want to build. And the Democrats' mind, that is not a wall. So they have offered this $1.3 billion to build the barrier that we want but then they go on TV and say there's no money for a wall. We've already told the Democrats we want to build what the president tweeted out. It doesn't have to be a 30-foot high concrete."

I think it's a really good question as to whether or not this deal can be cut before the new Congress comes in. I think there is an implication here for Nancy Pelosi's election for the speakership. I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker.

So too, by the way, are changing our policies on immigration. I think one of the biggest stories that didn't get reported this week was the agreement that we reached with Mexico to have Mexico agreed to keep people seeking asylum in the United States in Mexico. So, they come to the border right now or at least before this week, they were allowed to stay in this country pending their decision. Now Mexico will keep them in Mexico.

He is not going to be an ordinary president and that's not what people wanted when they elected him. As to the things you just mentioned, the fundamentals of the economy are still great. Yes, the stock market is down. We both know it goes up and down. Unemployment is still at historic lows. Capital investment still high. Business confidence is high. GDP is still solid.

I think the -- obviously, the staff to suddenly withdraw those troops from Syria has sent a terrible message to the world about where the United States stands. I think we're seeing the economy wracked by a crashing stock market, in the sense that the stock market is not quite sure what's going on.

We lost 3,000 people, over 3,000 people that day. We went to war as a result of that -- confronting Al Qaeda, Bin Laden, and now ISIS. We have made good progress in that fight. But it's not over. And so, to suddenly declare victory when we have no victory -- we've made good progress, no question about it. We've made tremendous gains. But this is not a time when you're dealing with terrorist groups who can reorganize and threaten the security of our country; this is not a time to back away from that responsibility -- and that I think is the message that concerns me. If we're sending a message to ISIS that somehow they can come back, they can be resilient, they can, at some point, come back and attack us and have us vulnerable to another 9/11 attack.

The border wall -- five billion dollars for the border wall; the Democrats are saying, well, they've give $1.6 billion for border security. President wants five billion for the border wall. I mean, a couple of questions here. How much of this is politics? How much of this is policy? And when I said \"politics\" -- I mean \"policy\" on both sides, and as someone who lives in California and knows about the difficulty of trying to control illegal immigration, what's wrong with a border wall?"

I do think it's important to develop in many ways the technology and the other steps necessary to create what there should be a virtual wall. But the idea of spending five billion dollars to build a wall when, as we know, any wall is vulnerable to the highest ladder that goes over that wall -- it's just politics. I realize he made a promise on this, but what's playing out now in Washington is a political confrontation between the president and the Democrats and the American people are paying the price for that. I mean, there are innocent people now, as a result of the shutdown, who are being hurt -- innocent men, women, children, families at Christmastime. Why take it out them? The challenge for the president and the leadership and the Congress, on both sides of the aisle, is to sit down and resolve these issues and to deal with it. And yes, you know, I understand the different positions. But what's missing in all of this is a comprehensive approach to immigration. That's what's needed. That's what's always been needed.

The president has made a number of very difficult decisions with serious risks and consequences potentially both on the government shutdown and in -- in Syria. But when it comes to blowing it out of proportion and saying that his -- this is going to the end. He's not going to be re-elected. The government shutdown is going to affect the next election I think is overblowing it quite significantly. There are serious questions for both ends of the aisle on his decision to pull out troops in Syria. Just ten days ago Brett McGurk was saying, look, this is not --"

And so you've seen Lindsey Graham come out, obviously, talk about the consequences of this, and there have been Republicans who are questioning whether we need to be leaving now. Eventually they do you want to leave and they understand that President Trump made this promise on the campaign trail, but they look at history and that shows that Barack Obama also made a campaign promise that he was going to take troops out of Iraq, which, of course, let us to this point now. And so --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let me switch to Mo. There have been a lot, as -- as Katie points out, a lot of disruptive weeks in his presidency. And you heard Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney just say, that's why people elected him to be a disruptor. So why -- or maybe you don't believe it is -- is this week different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AND PUBLIC SERVICE",
      "utterance": "Because we're actually seeing what -- what the Trump brand of disruption actually means. And I think for a lot of people it's -- it's disconcerting at best. I mean we're seen it both on the national security front with General Mattis, his departure, McGurk's departure, and a pretty -- a pretty difficult decision vis-a-vis Syria. We're seeing it on the economy with the stock market really taking a nosedive. And it's not just this week that that's been happening. There's been a negative trend there, which is conversed to what's happening in China, and that all began with his trade war. So we're beginning to see some of the impact of chaos and it's -- it's -- it's disconcerting. Look, I agree with Katie that we do have a tendency to take a look at a week, take a look at a snapshot in time and try to extrapolate what it means. And we should caution against that. The problem is, every week is chaotic and every week feels disconcerting. This one particularly bad. But -- but that cumulation is going to -- is having a real impact on both politics and policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "We have had other shutdowns and we've had other bad weeks or even bad months in the stock market, but what clearly set this week apart and sets a lot of people here in Washington's teeth to rattling was the sudden, abrupt shift on pulling troops out of Syria, drawing down in Afghanistan, and that led to the resignation of first Secretary Mattis and then now the special envoy, Brett McGurk. We asked you for questions for the panel, and on this issue of Mattis quitting we got this tweet from Troy Carline. No current military officers with Mattis' experience will be aligned with a nationalist America first president. So where does Trump go to find a replacement? Gillian, as a former staffer on the NSC for both Bush 43 and for Obama, and how do you answer Troy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, there is an option already on the table in place ready to go, and that's Patrick Shanahan, who is Mattis' current deputy. He's somebody who's been tightly aligned with President Trump on most military matters. He views -- he's a business guy like the president. He views his mission as filling the president's vision. He supported the space force, which most folks at the Pentagon, top military brass, did not support. So there will be a secretary of defense. There's not going to be a crisis of no leadership at the Pentagon. The question is, is he going to find a Republican that is going to get in line with his agenda? Because the drawdowns he's been talking about lately sound more like they're coming from Joe Biden. You know, drawing down from Afghanistan and Syria all in one go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's pick up on this issue of Republicans, because the other thing that set this week apart was this was the week when a lot of congressional Republicans sharply and publicly broke with the president, whether it was on precipitating the shutdown and especially over pulling troops out of war zones, here is Republican Senator Lindsey Graham."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Susan, how much trouble do you think the president is in right now with -- clearly he satisfied some Republicans with his decision to shut down, but that also ticked off a lot of Republicans who felt that they had gotten an assurance from Mike Pence that he was going to sign the clean CR just to kick it down till February. How much trouble do you think the president is in with congressional Republicans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN PAGE, USA TODAY",
      "utterance": "You know, he's pretty isolated and you can see by the members of Congress he invited to have lunch with him yesterday to talk about the shutdown, not only no Democrats, the congressional Republican leadership wasn't there. It was really the most conservative forces in the Republican Party and Congress who met with him. And I think that contributes to the sense of isolation. I think one of the things that concerns people watching the president, and not just people who wish him ill, is that he seems isolated both in who he's talking to, who he's listening to, and the policies that he's pursuing. And one big problem the president has, his two big safety nets for the past two years seem about to go away. One has been the good economy and the second has been Republican control of Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let me just pick up on that, Katie, we got about a minute left, because the president reportedly agreed to what was going to be a clean CR. We're just going to fund this until February 8th. And -- and Mike Pence, the vice president, told Republican senators that. And -- and you got John Cornyn, the number two Republicans senator, who said he's going to sign the CR. And then he took this huge deluge of criticism from Rush Limbaugh and other talk radio hosts and also from the House Freedom Caucus. That move, was that basically about, I'm going to shore up my core base here?"

President Trump, in March, was promised that this border wall funding would then be available at the end of the year, and here we are now and he can't even get $5 billion after he'd been promised that he would never have to sign something again without it. And the point is --"

And when it comes to leverage, he's obviously using the government shutdown as leverage at a last minute when he knows he's -- if he doesn't get the border wall funding now, it's certainly not going to happen when there's a Democratic House because they can't even negotiate with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer at this point in time to get $5 billion of fencing, which they voted for before."

      "speaker": "KASICH",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, it's so much dysfunction, you know. And I -- I was just saying to one of the people with me this morning, as governor, you know, what if my communications director, my -- half of my cabinet start -- or even significant numbers of my cabinet started to leave, it would create great chaos. We would have great difficulty getting anything done. And it would communicate chaos throughout the state and in the legislature, whatever. So it's -- it's -- it's very disturbing. And, you know, the -- the implications of what all this means long term for our foreign policy, for our domestic agendas, is really up in the air. It's -- it concerns me a great deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But President Trump campaigned on building a wall. He campaigned - - he promised the American people that he was not going to keep troops -- in fact, he was going to pull them out of endless wars, like Afghanistan. Isn't he doing what he told the American people he would do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KASICH",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, as you know, a president just can't get everything they want any more than a governor can get what he or she wants. And the fact of the matter is, I don't understand why he didn't make a deal. In other words, give me a couple billion for the wall, which was more than, you know, than they had previously been agreed to, and in exchange for that we -- we allow the DACA people to stay and the people who didn't come here any other way but on their own to be able to stay in America and not be given the threat of being deported. That's a deal that maybe they could get, that he would get. And I don't know why he hasn't done that. That makes an awful lot of sense to me. In terms of Syria and troops, I think what everybody is objecting to is the precipitous nature, not informing your allies, not talking to the people who critically we need in this world. And -- but let's also face in Syria the fact that that whole operation has been a mistake for many years. The Obama administration ignoring the redline was a disaster. We've lost influence in Syria, but the precipitous nature of that withdrawal, without finally defeating ISIS or making sure they can't reformulate, is a terrible mistake."

And I -- you know, we access it and at some point I will make a decision and I'll give folks full disclosure about how I arrived at a decision and what it is. But, at this point, again, all options are on the table. I want to finish my job as governor. I only have a few weeks left. And -- and then we'll see what develops, you know, in terms of the politics and our nation. Look, what I'm most considered about, Chris, is -- is having a voice. You know, when you look at Secretary Mattis' letter, I have been saying this now for almost two years, you can't ignore your allies. You can't just do things on your own, America first. I've been saying for two years that it doesn't make any sense to just engage in trade wars, particularly with our friends. I mean a lot of the things you're beginning to hear from other Republicans now are things that I've been saying for almost two years. And what I'm really concerned about is the division in this country. I don't like that. I know people have very serious problems. I grew up in a neighborhood where I understand the problems of people who have been left behind. But you can either tell them that they're the victim of somebody else or you can tell them, yes, you have a problem and we can fix it. Let's think about Ohio for a second. You know, the Republicans lost in Illinois. They lost in Wisconsin. They lost in Michigan and Pennsylvania and they won everything in Ohio, because we've had a program of hopefulness. Up jobs, including people who have traditionally been ignored, that's the road map. And so I'm positive about the fact that we can help people, including the people that live in Lordstown where GM announces a plant closure. I give them -- I try to give them the hope that we can see a better tomorrow."

Then they embark on what Worcester calls the world's longest veteran's parade, a 750 mile journey that at some points attracted more than 100 vehicles. And when they got to Arlington, so many people wanted to participate."

This month volunteers placed 1.8 million wreaths on veteran's graves at over 1,600 locations in all 50 states, including in the rain and cold at Arlington. And for the first time, they placed American- made wreaths at the American cemetery in Normandy, France. And now, another Christmas tradition. Here's a look from the last few years at the Wallace grandkids as they keep getting bigger and bigger. And here they are again, but something feels different this year. Let me check. Here's Sabine (ph), and Levy (ph), and Caroline (ph), and James (ph), and William (ph). What am I forgetting?"
