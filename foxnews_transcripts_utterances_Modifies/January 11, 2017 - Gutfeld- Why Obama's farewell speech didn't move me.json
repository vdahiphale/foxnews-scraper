So, if the Obama presidency were a film, this speech would be the climax. All that's missing is the horse, the sunset, the rousing closing music as the title card reads \"The End\" -- perhaps in cursive.

Part of the skepticism is due to the wide gap between how a person talks one-on-one and how they speak before a crowd. Compare the two and you realize how the latter relies on manipulation.  Soaring rhetoric lets you forget about the gaps in truth. But these days, I want words to matter more than emotions, which may be why Trump is either seen as refreshingly real or coarse and rough. He is the Obama opposite. When he speaks before crowds, it's pretty much how he talks. Blunt, raw, messy, but louder. Let's compare this:",
