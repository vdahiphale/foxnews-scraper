Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. And what a show tonight here in LA. I'll be talking with conservative firecracker Michelle Malkin, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, Congressman Darrell Issa and Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk. But first my \"Opening Statement.\"  All of you have a decision to make. It has never happened in the history of this country, an ex-president viciously attacking his successor, trashing our Commander-in-Chief, his party and all those Americans who put him in the Oval Office.  This on the heels of an anonymous op-ed piece allegedly written by a gutless senior administration official, or not, and published in collusion with the \"New York Times\" a Trump-hating newspaper. There was so much hatred and resentment over the success of this President that they simply cannot handle it. I've got news for you. It's not going to stop. The haters aren't going anywhere. But if you are a patriot and you like the course America is on, just ignore them. Get behind this President and vote.  Yesterday, with a full throttle savage attack on the President, Barack's message, obstruct and resist. He pontificates about the reality of racial discrimination, slavery and the quote, \"darker aspects of America's story,\" accusing President Trump as follows ...",

That's fascism.   And you have the unmitigated gall to say that you returned the economy to healthy growth and the longest streak of creation? You don't mention numbers here because there is nowhere to go but up from the bottom. And you say we took out Bin Laden and wound down the wars in Iraq and combat role Afghanistan. Who do you think you are, Douglas Macarthur? You couldn't make a military decision for your life. You're the same guy whose feckless foreign policy couldn't figure out what to do with that JV team ISIS whether to contain them, dismantle them or destroy them, none of which you did. And you got Iran to halt its nuclear program? Really? How would you know? You didn't know anything about Natanz and Fordow in Iran as they were secretly spinning centrifuges, lying to you and your gullible team. You didn't even require that we be allowed to monitor their nuclear development. You let out the worst of the terrorists from Gitmo for a deserter that your standby liar, Susan Rice, Bowe Bergdahl called him a hero. You ran the most corrupted administration, at least since Harry Truman and you can't stand it that every metric under the Trump administration is better off than when you were in office.  And Donald Trump is one of the biggest threats to our democracy? How dare you? This man is the President of the United States. Someone that we put in office, and he is to be respected. Your attack on him as a racist and a fascist is not about making things better for us, it's about you, your ego and your corrupt deep state power structure. You desperately tried to defeat Trump and it didn't work and you remain in Washington to support the resistance and the obstruction of a sitting American President while you stoke your racial cop-hating narrative.  Your version of America is not the America we want. To us, social justice is about justice for American citizens and not illegal criminals. To us, social justice is about taking care of veterans who come back to our shores with fewer limbs than when they left. To us, social justice is not about burning our flag, it's about raising it and lifting it. I am sorry to say this, but there is one thing that you're going to have to live with, the only reason that we have an outsider businessman President is because of you, your lies, your policies, and your divisiveness. You, Barack, you elected Donald Trump and there is nothing you can do about the fact that he is sitting in the Oval Office now. So I guess I should say, thank you, Barack.   And that's my open. Remember if you are a fan of my opens, you will be a huge fan of my latest book, the \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals: The Case Against Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" You can get your copy tonight while you are watching me.

For too long, President Obama had exactly the opposite. He and Eric Holder and Lynch, they were have much in the favor of giving us nothing, even when we were entitled to it; even when Obama appointed judges, ordered them to, they still held back.

Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. And what a show tonight here in LA. I'll be talking with conservative firecracker Michelle Malkin, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, Congressman Darrell Issa and Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk. But first my \"Opening Statement.\" All of you have a decision to make. It has never happened in the history of this country, an ex-president viciously attacking his successor, trashing our Commander-in-Chief, his party and all those Americans who put him in the Oval Office. This on the heels of an anonymous op-ed piece allegedly written by a gutless senior administration official, or not, and published in collusion with the \"New York Times\" a Trump-hating newspaper. There was so much hatred and resentment over the success of this President that they simply cannot handle it. I've got news for you. It's not going to stop. The haters aren't going anywhere. But if you are a patriot and you like the course America is on, just ignore them. Get behind this President and vote. Yesterday, with a full throttle savage attack on the President, Barack's message, obstruct and resist. He pontificates about the reality of racial discrimination, slavery and the quote, \"darker aspects of America's story,\" accusing President Trump as follows ..."

Whenever there is a death, even before there is any investigation. And in case you don't remember, Barack, no cops were found to have committed wrongdoing in Michael Brown and Freddie Gray's killings. You even stoke religious division. Are you serious? You are the one who shows up at A National Prayer Breakfast in 2015 after the beheading of Americans by ISIS having the gall to tell Christians to get off their high horse over atrocities committed the name of Islam. In fact, aren't you the same guy who in 2008 and 2015 criticized Christians and working class voters in old industrial towns decimated by job losses saying, we, Christians cling to guns and religion?

That's fascism. And you have the unmitigated gall to say that you returned the economy to healthy growth and the longest streak of creation? You don't mention numbers here because there is nowhere to go but up from the bottom. And you say we took out Bin Laden and wound down the wars in Iraq and combat role Afghanistan. Who do you think you are, Douglas Macarthur? You couldn't make a military decision for your life. You're the same guy whose feckless foreign policy couldn't figure out what to do with that JV team ISIS whether to contain them, dismantle them or destroy them, none of which you did. And you got Iran to halt its nuclear program? Really? How would you know? You didn't know anything about Natanz and Fordow in Iran as they were secretly spinning centrifuges, lying to you and your gullible team. You didn't even require that we be allowed to monitor their nuclear development. You let out the worst of the terrorists from Gitmo for a deserter that your standby liar, Susan Rice, Bowe Bergdahl called him a hero. You ran the most corrupted administration, at least since Harry Truman and you can't stand it that every metric under the Trump administration is better off than when you were in office. And Donald Trump is one of the biggest threats to our democracy? How dare you? This man is the President of the United States. Someone that we put in office, and he is to be respected. Your attack on him as a racist and a fascist is not about making things better for us, it's about you, your ego and your corrupt deep state power structure. You desperately tried to defeat Trump and it didn't work and you remain in Washington to support the resistance and the obstruction of a sitting American President while you stoke your racial cop-hating narrative. Your version of America is not the America we want. To us, social justice is about justice for American citizens and not illegal criminals. To us, social justice is about taking care of veterans who come back to our shores with fewer limbs than when they left. To us, social justice is not about burning our flag, it's about raising it and lifting it. I am sorry to say this, but there is one thing that you're going to have to live with, the only reason that we have an outsider businessman President is because of you, your lies, your policies, and your divisiveness. You, Barack, you elected Donald Trump and there is nothing you can do about the fact that he is sitting in the Oval Office now. So I guess I should say, thank you, Barack. And that's my open. Remember if you are a fan of my opens, you will be a huge fan of my latest book, the \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers & Liberals: The Case Against Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" You can get your copy tonight while you are watching me.

He's not fighting for the American people. He's not fighting for a prosperous economy. He's not fighting for a strong and safe America. He's fighting to protect his failure of a legacy. And you exactly nailed it when you specifically talked about two things - one, the identity politics, the racial grievance mongering, the demonization of people who stand on the side of law and order and two, the fact that this man deeply, deeply resents the economic success that has been ushered into this country that is lifting all boats."

It's the Democrats, it's where he grew up, that is his swamp and he brought Chicago to the Potomac. And in neither place, Chicago or DC, has the actual people that live there, particularly the African-American community benefitted at all from President Obama's policy."

I mean, the number of people who get shot in Chicago is what? Fifty to sixty a weekend. It is out of control. And yet, these are the cities that are run by Democrats and that is where the racial division is. Where if you are African-American, it doesn't matter if you are killed.

But how does Barack Obama get away from the fact that he was there for eight years. He had the House and his Senate. He never did anything about immigration. The economy was in the tank. General manufacturing was leaving, (inaudible) he said, we can never get this stuff back, and yet, he has the unmitigated gall to stand up in front of the country because he hates Donald Trump so much and lie or am I wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the reason he is able to get away with it is because you have seen we now know for the last eight years under Barack Obama, he had a complicit media. They never challenged him on difficult issues or tough questions. You see 93% negative coverage against Donald Trump, all of it was positive against Barack Obama and you saw that when he came out of the shadows to give that speech which was absolutely ridiculous. Democrats have been saying since Donald Trump got elected, this economy is bad. These good numbers keep coming out. Democrats say, but the economy is bad. It's so bad that Barack Obama comes out and says I want to take credit for how good it actually is. He has nothing to do with this economy, Donald Trump comes into office, changes all the policies. We are now open for business, almost four million jobs created in this short amount of time. For the first time, we have seen wage increases in this country. Thirty years of stagnant wages. This past report that came out, up 3%. That's the largest increase for a year in 10 years that has nothing to do with Barack Obama."

I mean, all of the metrics are in a better position than they were under him. I don't know where these people get off and can actually say what they say and make like they believe it. But let's talk about something that I think is important. I have been going around the country, and that's one of the reasons I'm in LA now, talking on my book tour. And everybody wants to know, why doesn't the President declassify the FISA documents so we can get to the bottom of the deep state and what they did and continue to do?"

      "speaker": "GIDLEY",

I want to have hands off,\" because the media attacks from every day, as I just they won't give him a pass. If he were to declassify these things, they are going to go after him even more than they already are. But he is looking at it. He said that publicly on many occasions because what he wants is transparency. He wants people to understand the level of the deep state in this country and we saw that with this anonymous letter coming out in the \"New York Times,\" some gutless coward as the President put it, who came out and said that he's against everything this President is for, but he's going to show up at work every day and be deceitful and dishonest and quite frankly, disgusting."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

In truth, I have got to tell you, it is time for us to understand what happened. I want to know who that FISA judge is. I want to know why they are not hitting the ceiling over the fact they were lied to. Are they too stupid to admit that they couldn't figure out what was in the warrant? Are they part of the corrupt deep state? It's time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, sure, and the President understands that. He's getting increasingly angry at the fact that the bias that existed out there at the highest levels of the FBI, not the rank and file, but the ones who are biased against this President and for Hillary Clinton - we now know that. He wants more and more of these documents to come out. He feels as though Congress is doing the right thing by pushing for them to be out there in the open and he's looking at potentially declassifying those documents."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, look, Hogan, I love you. Here is the bottom line though. Congress ain't getting the stuff. Tom Fitton is getting the stuff because he goes to a judge to get it. But I mean ,it's no criticism of Congress and we don't want to criticize the FBI, but you know what? It's time. This president is now coming out doing what has never been done in the history of this country - trashing a subsequent President, taking credit for what he did and blaming the guy before him for everything that was wrong. Anyway, they're telling me, I've got to go in my ear. You know, they talk to us in our ear. Hogan Gidley, thank you so much for being with us tonight."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, you know what? This is what occurred to me. In the letter itself, it says that we are not the deep state - we are not the so-called deep state, we are the steady state. You know what that tells me, they don't believe there is a deep state, so they are part of it. they are the steady, they are the status quo. Now, here is the problem, Barack Obama got rid of loads of people when he got there from the Bush administration and this President, and I have to tell you, I am not so sure the transition did what it should have done. But there are too many Obama holdovers. What I would do is I would have them all take a lie detector. Is that wrong or is that ridiculous?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Judge, as you know, Obama did exactly that - have people take lie detectors. I think there is a better way to do it, and I think it's as simple as each and every person who had the kind of information that this guy says he has should simply publicly sign a letter saying to the \"New York Times,\" go ahead and release any information you have from me. In other words, free them from the anonymity that this individual claims. I can guarantee you that every member of the President's Cabinet, these people who have worked so hard to change America into the right direction after Obama, they would all happily to sign on to that saying, \"Go ahead, and release any covert statement I ever made.\" Very quickly what you'd find is that there would be few people who wouldn't do it, and they should be gone. That simply - but it's not about a lie detector, it's about the \"New York Times\" claiming that this is a highly placed individual when I would bet, a great deal that the vast majority of people in and around the White House love what the president is doing, are on his agenda, and even if they disagree within the White House, they do it in a patriotic way."

I mean, that's the way you run anything but I think the significant part of it for me is there is all this fawning over John McCain. Okay, wonderful war hero all of that. Why is that so much a part of this letter? What does it tell you? But let's keep going. I want to talk about FISA. Do you think the president - look, you were the head of government oversight. Do you think the government should declassify now that Barack is out there? Isn't this the time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the President should continue to order his people, the Attorney General and others to do their job and to do it as transparently as possible. I think it's important and you said so earlier, that he not personally do it, that's usurping a system, but he certainly can and should demand that they use the maximum openness and the professionals make as much available as possible. For too long, President Obama had exactly the opposite. He and Eric Holder and Lynch, they were have much in the favor of giving us nothing, even when we were entitled to it; even when Obama appointed judges, ordered them to, they still held back. So the difference is leadership. I am glad the President is asking for it."

Let's talk about the disruption, something I have never seen before at the congressional -- at the Senate hearing on Kavanaugh. Cory Booker, his Spartacus moment says he's going to release confidential documents and he will suffer the consequences. Documents have already been released. Is he stupid? Chris?"

      "speaker": "HAHN",

I know when you were a judge, you would have given a short adjournment so that they can review the documents. I don't see what the rush is here. When people are trying to get you to read something, you read it twice."

Cory Booker can't even break the rules the right way. This was the lamest stunt ever. His office was notified that the classified document was not in fact classified anymore. He can't - one other thing, Judge, what's hysterical about this is he wants to expose this classified document about racial profiling. It shows that Kavanaugh supported race neutral policies not racial profiling. This was the lamest stunt in Senate history, Booker should be embarrassed."

She challenged - and the most humiliating part of the hearing, I think - well not most humiliating, Cory Booker was the most humiliating. This is the silver medal in humiliation. She challenges him on contacts with a law firm and won't name the actual person as if Brett Kavanaugh knows every - Chris, do me a favor. Name for me every single person in that law firm, right now, go ahead. Come on. Let's do it, buddy. Now, you can't, just like Brett Kavanaugh."

The week's most of outrageous statements are next. A special thank you tonight to HBO's resident liberal loud mouth Bill Maher for doing a live show on Friday nights and always providing me with a wealth of outrageous comments to use on Saturday nights. Here is my favorite this week. Comparing working in the White House to being in Iraq as well as expressing his love for the anonymous White House coward wimp."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "Well look, Judge, the one thing that needs to be mentioned about this op-ed; it's a new strategy by the far left. If you read it, the most interesting part that they actually admit that President Trump is doing a good job. So some would kind of argue that he's not doing a good job because the results are undeniable, the results are historic are the results are making America better for all people. They are now trying a new narrative, that is not really him, it's the deep state underneath him that is preventing him from his own instincts that is making this country better. And so if you think about it, they fail in trying to say that and I think that's an interesting take. Secondly, total outrageous comments by Bill Maher, it's reprehensible and disgusting to even say that working in the White House would be comparable to a war where we lost thousands of American brave souls, soldiers on the front lines and so, look, I think it's very interesting that the left is now using this line of attack against the President."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's an insult to those - the blood and treasure that we left over there. But now, Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday said this. Take a listen. JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE\": First off, can you imagine having Donald Trump as a father-in-law? I mean, looking at you across the table with that orange puss on all the time. Judging - resenting you for all the disgusting things he knows you are doing to his shiny and beautiful daughter. Every day you come to work at the White House, your boss has his wife sitting in his lap. It's a lot to swallow."

      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, the left has killed comedy in America. That's not funny. It's not even close to being comedic, but what I find interesting is now they are going after Jared. And look, I can speak from personal experience. Jared is one of the most of loyal, hardworking underappreciated people in the White House that is championing prison reform. He helped get the World Cup and the Olympics which got zero media coverage whatsoever. Obama tried to get it and failed terribly. And so look, to go after Jared now is again totally and morally reprehensible. But with the left right now, and Judge, you know this and you articulate it so well in your book, the gloves are off. They are not playing nice anymore. They've hijacked comedy. They've hijacked our schools, they've hijacked the media, and now they are going after people that are going to work every single day and they are humbly serving our country such as Ivanka and Jared and look, we have to realize that we are in a fight for the soul of this country and it starts and ends with defending this President."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

So, they promote these narratives and then they get more and more outrageous in their narratives. I mean, Jimmy Kimmel was out of control. Anyway, Charlie Kirk, always good to have you here. Thanks for being with us tonight."

      "utterance": "President Trump, conservatives love him and liberals, well, not so much. But what about America's populace. Joining me now, one of the voices of that movement, author of the new book, \"Positive Populism: Revolutionary Ideas to Rebuild Economic Security, Family and Community in America,\" and the host \"The Next Revolution\" here on Fox News Channel, my friend, Steve Hilton. All right, Steve, what's your book about?"

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "So it really picks up on the things that you were talking about in your open, Judge, and also in your conversation with Michelle. You know, you talked about the elitism that Obama represents, and the corrupt deep state power structure. Those are the words used, it's such an important term and then with Michelle, about how the elites in Washington, DC, all of those insiders, have they done well out of the economy for the last few years, but working people have lost out. What my book is about is setting out a set of ideas to keep the populist revolution going, to keep it on beyond what we've already seen from President Trump and into the future so that we really help working people. But more importantly, we really take apart that deep state power structure- all the bureaucrats, the permanent bureaucracy. This book is really full of ideas, specific ideas. Not everyone is going to agree with everything in there, but it's really radical ideas. For example on the deep state, there is a specific idea in there, if we really want to do something about it, it's not just the leaker and the anonymous op-ed writer. It's actually those of thousands - hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats. Who are they? What do they do? What's their agenda? One of my proposals is literally publish their names and their job descriptions, what they do, and then we can decide whether we need them or not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, Steve, let's talk about - you are going to publish their names, their job description and all of that, but can we fire them? Are the civil service laws so tight that the presidents who come in can't fire them or at least their legal team says, \"Oh, we can't fire them,\" let them stay?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "You are right. That's the real point. But you have got to know who to fire - you've got to know what you are dealing with. I tried this in the British government back in the day when I was there, and we didn't even know who they were. You have got to change the rules because cutting the bureaucracy down, firing them, not just a few here and there. My proposal was to reduce the whole thing by 90%, so you end up with 10% of what it is now, so it's not just a small cut, it's radically trimming it and sending those powers back to the states, back to local government, getting rid of this concentration of power that's been such a disaster."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And you know what that sounds so relevant to the news tonight, when you talk about anonymous, the alleged letter, or the letter that was allegedly written by someone in the administration, I mean, we should be able to know who in the administration has an agenda that's different than the President's. Lie detectors and Obama did the lie detectors all the way down to what is it? Level 15 in the Federal government. I mean, they shouldn't have to deal with these holdovers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And it's holdovers - it's decade after decade actually because what's really has been going on in America, it doesn't matter who has won the election. It's the same people who have been in charge -- the insiders, the ruling class -- and that's what President Trump is up against, and so to help him advance this populist revolution that he started, we need these ideas."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
