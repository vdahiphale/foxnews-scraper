Donald Trump, with his dictatorial attitude, now wants to be president for life. Fake news.  I'd love Oprah to win. I'd love to beat Oprah. I know her weakness. Conor Lamb, Lamb the sham, right?

So he goes -- and in the spur of the moment he says, and I'm going to come back here and we're going to do a rally for you. And you get six weeks down the road and you realize, oh, this candidate is not lighting the world on fire. He still could win, Saccone could win, it's just going to be close. And so, I think that the president's time could be spent doing a lot of other things. Like, does it help him get any of his agenda passed? Does it help -- not really, but did the president have fun, was anybody hurt, not necessarily. And I think the most journalists like Chuck Todd -- well, I think most journalist do not want to become the story, OK? Like, there are some that we know that are in the briefing room."

You never know -- like the joke might work, the joke might not work, but there's always a chance when you open your mouth among friends at a rally, you're going to say something that isn't going to work.

They're all playing games. But the public behavior of a president, we've never seen anything like this. So, I mean, to my mind, he goes after Maggie Haberman of the New York Times and calls her a Hillary flunky. He goes after Chuck Todd.

And they wanted someone to come in and flip over the table and he's doing that. And it might be beneath the traditional standards of the presidency, as you said, and I agree with that, but he's now changed the game and kind of renegotiated what those standards are. And that's the reality that the media still has not accepted. And they're still covering him that they're shocked that he's behaving this way.

And it just - - you know, in terms of the impact it had on them, their lives, what you were doing there. And I went on to work, obviously, in that office and try cases there in that same, you know, courtroom where O.J.'s case had been tried on the ninth floor at the Criminal Courts Building. And I remember at the time when this happened being in law school and everybody just watching it, watching the chase, everything. I mean, from a prosecutor's perspective, when you look at the enormous body of evidence, forensics, the science, the DNA behind it, there would just be no question. I mean, I don't remember ever getting a case as a D.A. that had that much compelling, persuasive evidence.

I did it.\" Because he knows he's not going to get hit with the double jeopardy. But to Kimberly's point, he never should have been out of -- out in 2006. They made so many mistakes on the prosecutorial side, from the glove, from the venue, to the jury selection, to some of the ridiculous witnesses, to the mishandling of the evidence and the DNA. It's a tragedy that this guy is even out right now. But I understand why the Goldman family -- I think time has passed.

They were able to get the guy. And he came in and he was armed. He was trying to shoot people. So it was a whole situation. But nevertheless, why wouldn't you want to be welcoming to police? Like, why not? They're the ones putting their lives on the line every day.
