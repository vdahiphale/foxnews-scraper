The coronavirus task force will be coming out again in an hour from now for their Friday update. So, in the meantime we will break it all down.  First of all, the first phase could see the reopening of gyms, restaurants, maybe theaters, and sport venues, but with strict social distancing measures in place. Schools would stay closed, and high-risk individuals would stay home. The other phases would then loosen restrictions more if cases continue to fall. But there are some critics of the plan including Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling those guidelines, quote, \"vague and inconsistent.\" And here is more reaction from other Democrats.",

And last Friday was the end of the week of which Jerome Adams, the surgeon general had said that this is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, that was when we had hopefully reaching the apex and the peak. This week we are talking about the reopening. And we have some guidance. Some of it is vague because the states are going to have to decide based on their different criteria.

He says here's the road map, you drive the car. And now he is accused of punting by Joe Biden? Are you serious? It is so pathetic. And then I predicted this yesterday, I said that Pelosi wasn't going to say anything until after the plan is revealed because she did not want any skin in this game. She preferred to get stand in front of her double wide refrigerator and suck down ice cream until she gets an ice cream headache than actually offer practical advice.  You know, you can sit on a fence and you could, you know, crap on people doing the job when you are out of power, that make sense. But at this point, it's just so obvious and so sad. In this situation, people's lives are going to, there is going to be death. Because every path that we choose is going to have death.

Let's see there's a little bit more, testing that you should be doing.

They are going to have a different project and process moving forward on this. But it's interesting to watch what's happening here in D.C. or not in D.C. where lawmakers are at home. You have Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi criticizing this plan, and continually saying that you have to be careful, you have to make sure the economy isn't open too quickly.   Well, when they are sitting there at home and not refilling the paycheck protection plan with or program, and not coming up with any other ideas about how to get people some economic health while they continue to advocate for the economy to be close, it's really easy to do that.  And it's also easy to do that when you are getting a paycheck. And the bottom line, I think for people who are getting cabin fever as one said, is they want to be able to make their own decisions about their own risk. At this point they understand a lot more about the virus than we did two months ago, and they understand what precautions they need to take to not get sick, but they really want to be able to do that on their own without being dictated to by the government.",

And then there's Cuomo, everybody on the left loves him they want him to run for president, so President Trump gives him free power and they say, he can't handle it, he can't do it by himself all of a sudden. Cuomo is complaining about not getting the resources, he just donated hundreds of ventilators to other states because he had overcapacity. Because the president gave him so many. They just built hospital in Long Island they haven't even used it yet. So, I would stop complaining already before the president has even given you any additional resources. This -- the country is viewing this from two different perspectives. There are people that are better off, that are kind of having a little fun, may be working from home, they are still getting paid. They are zooming, you know, they are doing their thing, they're cooking. And then there's people that can't afford to work from home.   They don't have a job. They have lost a business which had been in their family for generations. And they're dying to get back to work. And one side doesn't understand the other side. You know, how could you not want to protect the health? What about if it spreads further?  And then the other side is saying, wait a second, you guys understanding my position, I need to work to feed my family. Or else, this is it for me. And they are talking across of each other, and a lot of it has to do with New York. The state of New York has 225,000 cases. New Jersey has 75,000 cases. Combined that's 300,000 virus cases. The next biggest state that has that case is like 30,000 in Massachusetts. Other states like Wyoming, North Dakota, Hawaii, Vermont, West Virginia, they have a couple hundred cases.  And so, to say that to New York should open up at the same rate as Vermont which has like a handful of cases is stupid. Everybody knows that's stupid.

First of all, we've been able to buy some time with getting the hospitals ready and the equipment and beds that they need to handle the situation moving forward, but also what she says is like driving a car and getting a car accident and then saying that you're not allowed to go to the hospital because you got in an accident and made the choice to go do that.  I think that people are smart enough to make their own decisions about understanding the risk. They understand if they don't want to get sick, they don't have to go out, but they don't want to be told that they can't do basic things like garden on their own property. That's the first thing. The second thing is, you know, in this new plan, one of the things that stuck out to me and the road map that the White House put out is elective surgeries in phase one will now be allowed to resume. That I think is such a crucial point, because elective surgery includes biopsies for cancer detection. I've heard from doctors who have said they were unable to operate on their breast cancer patients at this point. I mention our family friend who has a collapsed lung. And just think about how much damage that is doing to people's health and mental health as a result of not being able to get to the healthcare that they need in those circumstances.  So, there are consequences to all of these things. I don't think that they are all arbitrary. But in Michigan they certainly have been, which is why you are seeing people say enough is enough, I'm essential, it's essential to feed my family and provide for myself. I make my own decisions.",

I think Governor Charlie Baker up in Massachusetts is one of them. I put Governor Polis of Colorado in that basket as well. It doesn't mean they won't have protests of people complaining about the lockdowns.  But I do think that from a governor standpoint, that leadership, when you are looking to see who is doing a good job and who isn't, you can compare those governors to somebody like Governor Northam in Virginia who all of a sudden today said, OK, or yesterday said we're going to be lockdown till June 10th. But didn't give any more reasons or data or explanations. And this idea that Katie was just talking about, about elective surgeries. There are a lot of hospitals across the country that are desperate for patients. They are running out of money. And Nancy Pelosi and Schumer say that they want to hold up the money for the small businesses because they want to help the hospital. Well, one of the ways to help the hospitals would be allow the governors to make that decision to allow for hospitals that can handle it to do these elective surgeries.

Liberate Michigan, and the flags at the rally, they're Trump flags, it makes it seem so political. And I think people are right to sometimes say to government, don't be intrusive. You know, don't step on my rights. We are going to act together. And America has acted together in terms of social distancing, in terms of the hand washing, everything to lower the curve.  So, we don't want to give that up just suddenly and without reason. I think you've got to give some leeway to elected officials who are looking out for the public's health.

There are people who support the president because they like the fact that he is engaged in the politics of division.

The reason why you have Donald Trump sitting in the White House, the big reason is because people got very sick of the political correctness garbage, of being accused of being a racist just because you disagreed with some kind of policy. If you want to close borders or more border security, you didn't like -- you were xenophobic and didn't like immigrants for some reason. That was pushed aside.

First of all, the first phase could see the reopening of gyms, restaurants, maybe theaters, and sport venues, but with strict social distancing measures in place. Schools would stay closed, and high-risk individuals would stay home. The other phases would then loosen restrictions more if cases continue to fall.

And last Friday was the end of the week of which Jerome Adams, the surgeon general had said that this is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, that was when we had hopefully reaching the apex and the peak. This week we are talking about the reopening. And we have some guidance. Some of it is vague because the states are going to have to decide based on their different criteria.

He says here's the road map, you drive the car. And now he is accused of punting by Joe Biden? Are you serious? It is so pathetic. And then I predicted this yesterday, I said that Pelosi wasn't going to say anything until after the plan is revealed because she did not want any skin in this game. She preferred to get stand in front of her double wide refrigerator and suck down ice cream until she gets an ice cream headache than actually offer practical advice. You know, you can sit on a fence and you could, you know, crap on people doing the job when you are out of power, that make sense. But at this point, it's just so obvious and so sad. In this situation, people's lives are going to, there is going to be death. Because every path that we choose is going to have death.

We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't need or use, gave large numbers of ventilators that you should have had and helped you with. Let's see there's a little bit more, testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money, help, and equipment than any other state by far, and these great men and women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good.

But I will say this. In terms of the plan, Dana, to me, I feel like everybody has got cabin fever. We know about the high unemployment numbers. Everybody wants to get out and get back to work but we have to be careful. We can't let sort of emotions that, you know, drive us, and impatience, because if we don't have testing, if we don't have contact tracing, then we can get ourselves in a very difficult situation where we put our workers, the people going back to work at a very high level of risk, and we put all of their customers, the people they come into contact with, work with --"

They are going to have a different project and process moving forward on this. But it's interesting to watch what's happening here in D.C. or not in D.C. where lawmakers are at home. You have Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi criticizing this plan, and continually saying that you have to be careful, you have to make sure the economy isn't open too quickly. Well, when they are sitting there at home and not refilling the paycheck protection plan with or program, and not coming up with any other ideas about how to get people some economic health while they continue to advocate for the economy to be close, it's really easy to do that. And it's also easy to do that when you are getting a paycheck. And the bottom line, I think for people who are getting cabin fever as one said, is they want to be able to make their own decisions about their own risk. At this point they understand a lot more about the virus than we did two months ago, and they understand what precautions they need to take to not get sick, but they really want to be able to do that on their own without being dictated to by the government."

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, if Democrats have a problem with the plan, take it up with Fauci and Birx. They are the experts that signed off on it. And then there's Cuomo, everybody on the left loves him they want him to run for president, so President Trump gives him free power and they say, he can't handle it, he can't do it by himself all of a sudden. Cuomo is complaining about not getting the resources, he just donated hundreds of ventilators to other states because he had overcapacity. Because the president gave him so many. They just built hospital in Long Island they haven't even used it yet. So, I would stop complaining already before the president has even given you any additional resources. This -- the country is viewing this from two different perspectives. There are people that are better off, that are kind of having a little fun, may be working from home, they are still getting paid. They are zooming, you know, they are doing their thing, they're cooking. And then there's people that can't afford to work from home. They don't have a job. They have lost a business which had been in their family for generations. And they're dying to get back to work. And one side doesn't understand the other side. You know, how could you not want to protect the health? What about if it spreads further? And then the other side is saying, wait a second, you guys understanding my position, I need to work to feed my family. Or else, this is it for me. And they are talking across of each other, and a lot of it has to do with New York. The state of New York has 225,000 cases. New Jersey has 75,000 cases. Combined that's 300,000 virus cases. The next biggest state that has that case is like 30,000 in Massachusetts. Other states like Wyoming, North Dakota, Hawaii, Vermont, West Virginia, they have a couple hundred cases. And so, to say that to New York should open up at the same rate as Vermont which has like a handful of cases is stupid. Everybody knows that's stupid. But they are trying to attack the president for politics. And that's just wrong."

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing at least two federal lawsuits over her stay-at-home order which includes a ban on visits to friends or relatives.

It's crazy."

    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Right. It's ridiculous and it's very personal for these people. And I don't really understand what Joy Behar is saying. First of all, we've been able to buy some time with getting the hospitals ready and the equipment and beds that they need to handle the situation moving forward, but also what she says is like driving a car and getting a car accident and then saying that you're not allowed to go to the hospital because you got in an accident and made the choice to go do that. I think that people are smart enough to make their own decisions about understanding the risk. They understand if they don't want to get sick, they don't have to go out, but they don't want to be told that they can't do basic things like garden on their own property. That's the first thing. The second thing is, you know, in this new plan, one of the things that stuck out to me and the road map that the White House put out is elective surgeries in phase one will now be allowed to resume. That I think is such a crucial point, because elective surgery includes biopsies for cancer detection. I've heard from doctors who have said they were unable to operate on their breast cancer patients at this point. I mention our family friend who has a collapsed lung. And just think about how much damage that is doing to people's health and mental health as a result of not being able to get to the healthcare that they need in those circumstances. So, there are consequences to all of these things. I don't think that they are all arbitrary. But in Michigan they certainly have been, which is why you are seeing people say enough is enough, I'm essential, it's essential to feed my family and provide for myself. I make my own decisions."

The protesters were comparing her actions to fascist dictators. It wasn't that there were Nazis there, it was that they were unfairly. They were unfairly comparing her to Hitler, which is wrong.

There are other examples though of governors who have done a pretty good job of ignoring the national politics and avoiding that and speaking very clearly to their states. I think Governor Charlie Baker up in Massachusetts is one of them. I put Governor Polis of Colorado in that basket as well. It doesn't mean they won't have protests of people complaining about the lockdowns. But I do think that from a governor standpoint, that leadership, when you are looking to see who is doing a good job and who isn't, you can compare those governors to somebody like Governor Northam in Virginia who all of a sudden today said, OK, or yesterday said we're going to be lockdown till June 10th. But didn't give any more reasons or data or explanations. And this idea that Katie was just talking about, about elective surgeries. There are a lot of hospitals across the country that are desperate for patients. They are running out of money. And Nancy Pelosi and Schumer say that they want to hold up the money for the small businesses because they want to help the hospital. Well, one of the ways to help the hospitals would be allow the governors to make that decision to allow for hospitals that can handle it to do these elective surgeries. Then you won't have to give them so many taxpayer dollars in order to take care of their short fall."

      "utterance": "By the way, I just want to underline what Dana just said, because you know, I know some doctors in my family. And again, the hospitals are struggling. And people who do need to have the elective surgeries. In some cases, they have to let doctors who are not in the emergency rooms and the like, they have to lay them off or put them on leave for a while, because they are not getting the income from those surgeries. Over all, though, I would say, you know, I don't want to see this become a big political fight. And the thing with these rallies, you know, the president tweeting today, liberate Minnesota. Liberate Michigan, and the flags at the rally, they're Trump flags, it makes it seem so political. And I think people are right to sometimes say to government, don't be intrusive. You know, don't step on my rights. We are going to act together. And America has acted together in terms of social distancing, in terms of the hand washing, everything to lower the curve. So, we don't want to give that up just suddenly and without reason. I think you've got to give some leeway to elected officials who are looking out for the public's health. But you -- I don't think we want to politicize this so that, certain people think this way, certain people -- no, let's not do that with this. This is too important and too deadly. I was shocked. Shocked, Jesse, to see it was 2,200 people, I think died in America yesterday, and 2,500 on Wednesday. Over 33,000 Americans dead as a result of this. This is serious business."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. The Trump campaign is accusing Joe Biden of a deplorables moment, just like what happened with Hillary Clinton's famous remark, or infamous remark, I should say, in 2016. The presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden, was talking about Trump supporter's when he said this. There are people who support the president because they like the fact that he is engaged in the politics of division. They really support the notion that, you know, all Mexicans are rapists, and all Muslims are bad, dividing this nation based on ethnicity and race. So, Jesse, I thought I'd come to you and just ask the obvious question, I mean, isn't it true that the president can say some divisive, polarizing things?"

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, but so do Democrats, it's a wash. It's politics. It doesn't really bother me that much. The point is this, Juan. Joe Biden is supposed to be the Democratic that can win over disaffected Trump supporter's in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The white working-class men and women of this country. That's his whole appeal. And then he goes and says something like this. He is supposed to be the guy. Yes, Mitch McConnell is going to work with me when I get in there. I'm going to restore dignity and civility and honor and that kind, and then he goes and says this. Do I think it's the same thing as the basket of deplorables with Hillary? No, but it's not good. And he just hasn't had a great run since this started. He botched the travel ban. It took two weeks for them to set up a home camera in his library. Then when they did get the feed up, he was -- couldn't communicate effectively. Then he got hit with a sexual assault allegation, and now this. it's like, you know, he's not performing well in a time when, you know, you're either a prime time player you're not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's a fair point. So Katie, I think from the Joe Biden perspective, people think, oh, Joe Biden is supposed to be a guy who's calm and a healer and more empathetic, but I don't think that he would play to the way -- I don't think he plays the Trump game, which Trump has played to obvious success."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Juan, one look at Joe Biden's history shows that he's not a guy who has a long temper, that someone who is -- not someone who doesn't want to fight in political battles. I mean, Joe Biden is not a very nice guy when it comes to the political game. And he's been portrayed as such to kind of rewrite his own history and record, but he's not that kind of person. The reason why you have Donald Trump sitting in the White House, the big reason is because people got very sick of the political correctness garbage, of being accused of being a racist just because you disagreed with some kind of policy. If you want to close borders or more border security, you didn't like -- you were xenophobic and didn't like immigrants for some reason. That was pushed aside. And for Joe Biden to now alienate those voters that, as Jesse pointed out, he needs shows that again, his campaign keeps throwing things up against the wall, and nothing is sticking. If that's the final argument that you're trying to make, you're losing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So, Dana, I was just struck by the idea that -- I don't know that Joe Biden really could win voters who are hardcore Trump supporters at this point. The Trump's base has never really gone away. They're there around 40, 45 percent in all the polls I see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's got an uphill battle. But remember, he was the one that said that if you are an Obama-Trump voter, that his pitch was that he could win those people back. And this kind of language is obviously not going to do that. It's also strange to me that, you know, he was the person that was going to be able to appeal to the lunch pail crowd. And a weak nominee would try to continue to win over his base over and over again, a strong nominee would start to veer to the middle. And he's not doing that right now. So -- I also saw that somebody suggesting that Elizabeth Warren really would be a good nominee for him. He doesn't need to pick her as his VP. He already got her endorsement. She didn't win her own state. She probably couldn't win a single -- help him win a single battleground state. I mean, I don't think -- that one, you could probably just cross off your list."

What you're conflating, and I understand this, is that what Trump does, he actually goes after a person. The problem with what Hillary did and what Joe Biden does is they go after the people. You can go after the person, but when you go after the people, it looks really, really bad. By the way, to Dana's point about Liz Warren endorsing Biden, is that kind of interesting that she was the woman who absolutely destroyed Bloomberg, who would have been a better candidate over sexual harassment, but then just adores the guy who's being accused of sexually assaulting a woman. I think that's pretty amazing."

And they're like, oh, we know, we'll take it to the pond. It's going to be set free and live a life on the pond.
