It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Another day, another scandal for CNN. Today, Project Veritas, the conservative investigative group released a video of prominent CNN left wing contributor Van Jones apparently downplaying the significance of the Russia investigation. FOX News hasn't verified the authenticity of the video but a man who appears to be Van Jones is heard saying, quote, \"The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.\"  The video is released just a day after Project Veritas put out a separate undercover video of CNN help producer John Bonifield calling the Russia story b.s. This, despite the networks nearly nonstop coverage of the investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and then- candidate Trump's campaign. And that's not all.  Yesterday, we told you how three CNN journalists resigned over a retracted article that said a Trump advisor was under investigation for ties to a Russian investment funds. \"The New York Post\" is reporting that CNN only retracted the article after it was threatened with legal action. Take a listen to how radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is reacting.",

And I think they would be able to get it. The other thing is that earlier this week, I listened to a podcast that \"The New York Times\" does, and they were interviewing one of the fathers whose son had been shot in the face by an illegal immigrant who should have been deported and his son died. And he said that he met President Trump and it meant so much to him to have somebody listen to him. The reporter then asked, why did you choose this issue to work on? Why not gun control? And I just thought, oh, it's the wrong question because it is -- because this is actually something that you can actually do to help prevent additional crimes.

It's very consistent with what President Trump has said about strengthening our borders and strengthening security. This is not some egregious or inappropriate law, this makes a lot of sense. This is a deterrent. This will save lives. This does help national security and strengthen our borders, and this increases penalties in a proportionate way for those who would commit heinous felonies, acts of violence, and illegally reenter over and over again. This is the first president to strongly address and listen to the voices of the victims of violent crime to those families who Washington has turned a deaf ear on. Now, he's paying attention to them.

It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Another day, another scandal for CNN. Today, Project Veritas, the conservative investigative group released a video of prominent CNN left wing contributor Van Jones apparently downplaying the significance of the Russia investigation. FOX News hasn't verified the authenticity of the video but a man who appears to be Van Jones is heard saying, quote, \"The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.\" The video is released just a day after Project Veritas put out a separate undercover video of CNN help producer John Bonifield calling the Russia story b.s. This, despite the networks nearly nonstop coverage of the investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and then- candidate Trump's campaign. And that's not all. Yesterday, we told you how three CNN journalists resigned over a retracted article that said a Trump advisor was under investigation for ties to a Russian investment funds. \"The New York Post\" is reporting that CNN only retracted the article after it was threatened with legal action. Take a listen to how radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is reacting."

      "utterance": "Could Donald Trump be the end of CNN? What a legacy that would be. I think that is what the Trump administration is doing with many in the media. They are like cats. He's got this little red laser light and it's just causing him to make fools of themselves that everyone is laughing at them as they're crashing into walls, the sofa and the floor. And that is what little Jim Acosta had happened to him yesterday."

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, it's tempting to rip CNN to shreds given the pleasure they took to our travails. Or every Sunday that human thumb Brian Stelter would go off on us and it's not a nothing burger, it's a nothing caviar. I will defend Van Jones in the sense that I don't think he was ever on the Russian Trump thing, the narrative of the network. Definitely, they are pushing this. But he always seemed more measured of the crew that he kind of, so I don't think he's being a hypocrite. And so I have to praise him for being consistent off-camera and on camera because like I said, this will happen to us. If you aren't consistent on camera and off-camera, and you say you're for something in the green room and you're against it when you are here, you deserve to be called out. I don't think that happened to Van Jones. One other point. I find it interesting how the media loves this kind of stuff when they aren't the target."

So, I think he has actually been consistent. And it's kind of a bummer that you can't feel like you have any privacy whatsoever in any of your conversations, but I guess for him, I do think that he has been consistent."

Not only are they fake news, they are very fake news. And it's hard to defend your integrity when you are firing three people, when some of your best and brightest \"analysts,\" I put that in quotations are saying something that is directly opposite from what your network has been pushing for the last couple of months.

Kate's Law increases the penalties on illegal immigrants who repeatedly defy deportation. Today, President Trump met with immigration crime victims."

That's existing immigration laws. For years, the pundits, journalists, politicians in Washington refused to hear your voices, but on election day, 2016, your voices were heard all across the entire world. Right? You better believe it. Nobody died in vain, I can tell you. If they can just support these two things, Kate's Law and sanctuary cities, then President Trump would be able to say, look at what I've done on border enforcement, and now let's move to what you really want which is comprehensive immigration reform. And I think they would be able to get it. The other thing is that earlier this week, I listened to a podcast that \"The New York Times\" does, and they were interviewing one of the fathers whose son had been shot in the face by an illegal immigrant who should have been deported and his son died. And he said that he met President Trump and it meant so much to him to have somebody listen to him. The reporter then asked, why did you choose this issue to work on? Why not gun control? And I just thought, oh, it's the wrong question because it is -- because this is actually something that you can actually do to help prevent additional crimes. If you could deport people who are here illegally, that's when you can get guns control done. GREG GUTFELD, \"The Five\" HOST, FOX NEWS: Yeah."

Those are the things that make up the liberal media brain. Victims of the illegal violence are in that equation, and it took President Trump to introduce that into the world, and then you have the podcast, but they still can't let go."

What do you think that is? KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"The Five\" HOST, FOX NEWS: So disturbing, isn't it? This law (inaudible) legal covering this, it should have been passed three years ago and should have been taken to the senate floor. It's very disturbing to me. I come from San Francisco. I worked there as a prosecutor. The law should be followed and upheld, and here it makes a lot of sense. It's very consistent with what President Trump has said about strengthening our borders and strengthening security. This is not some egregious or inappropriate law, this makes a lot of sense. This is a deterrent. This will save lives. This does help national security and strengthen our borders, and this increases penalties in a proportionate way for those who would commit heinous felonies, acts of violence, and illegally reenter over and over again. This is the first president to strongly address and listen to the voices of the victims of violent crime to those families who Washington has turned a deaf ear on. Now, he's paying attention to them. I think it's very important. This is an important issue. It would cut back so much on crime, like Dana says. Take the illegal immigrants who are here, the people who come in over and over again to commit these crimes, and put this penalty. You have to make sure they don't come back in and re-offend in a way like criminal recidivists that they have been doing over and over again. You would care about this if this was your family.

President Trump has continued down that path, may be even more aggressively because now he's throwing out people with traffic tickets.

I don't know why we still need that. I don't think we need people like Condoleezza Rice coming out and saying Trump is a patriot. I think everybody knows Trump is a patriot. I think some people in the media that listen to this treason talk with Russia still think this guy is some sort of a trader. So maybe when they hear Condleezza Rice on CNBC say Trump is real patriot, they will say, oh, maybe he is. I don't think we need that."

They totally lost touch with reality. They lost touch with their constituency. Russia is not going to put food on people's tables. Russia is not going to put your kids through college.

You're supposed to -- talking about reporters -- tell people often what they don't want to hear, that's your job of course, but if you're not popular, you don't get promoted in the news game, and somebody else will have to feed your kid.

When you look at the polls and the complete disfavor and low regard that the public, the American public, the voting public, has for the mainstream media, for the stories, for the fake news, there is a reason they are in the fix they're in. They need to take a closer look at themselves, their ethics, and their journalistic standards, and then maybe things won't be so rough for them."

If all the news outlets are doing better, the ratings are better, subscriptions are up, you are a young entrepreneurial reporter, I would ask your editor for a road trip budget. Hit the road for the next six months. Don't come back until you've had some experiences with people who are actually doing the voting."

They knew that he was doing this and they said wow, this guy is 20 years old, Justin Korva, he walks over 3 miles to work every day to his job at a taco restaurant in Rockwall, Texas. So people in that community would notice him. It's super hot outside. They put out a box for donation. And then last Friday, they surprised him with a car while he was at work. Something he has always wanted. They also paid his insurance for a year plus two years worth of oil changes and a $500 gas card. What an inspiring story. Way to go, Justin, happy for you."

There were so many fans of \"The Five.\" I got to say thank you. And of course, Lionel Richie is a fan. He watches \"The Five.\" We got to hang out with him backstage. Here he is with my wife and some friends. By the way, the guy in the black hat, big conservative, Armstrong Williams. The show was absolutely terrific.
