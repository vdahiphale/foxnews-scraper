Socialism - socialism is here. Open season for Republican death in Vermont.\" Morin says her platform of low taxes and small government apparently makes socialists want to kill her.

Strangely, you didn't hear calls for gun control in the days after that happened.  And at this point, we've practically forgotten it ever happened at all. And so the cycle has accelerated.

What is the point?   Well Republicans, obviously, are the focus of most of it, conservatives, more generally, anyone else who descents from the one true faith of cultural Leftism. But really the target is the country itself.  The Left is angry at America. They say so all the time. This is not the Democratic Party you grew up in or that you remember if you're over 30. That party may have stood for some bad ideas, and it did, but there was never really a question about its fundamental loyalty to America or the people who live here. The party of FDR and LBJ, even of Bill Clinton, was basically a patriotic party. It was an American party. Not anymore. In 2018, anyone who considers America a distinct physical place with meaningful borders and its own history and traditions and language and culture and values won't feel comfortable in the Democratic Party. Indeed, may not even be allowed in that party.  To modern Democrats, the leaders of the party, America is an economy with land attached. It's a massive private equity scheme from which they are benefiting. Its people are interchangeable human widgets to be discarded and replaced when their usefulness expires.  Was it always this way? Was this always what America was like, you might ask? Shut up, they'll explain. Before Obama got elected, America was truly a horrible place, a nightmare.

Texas Senate candidate Robert Beto O'Rourke agrees with this. He recently told the crowd that police in America murder and imprison people solely because of their skin color. Now, that's factually untrue. It's ridiculous. And, of course, he didn't even try to prove it was true.  But it's also a slur on decent people of all colors who are trying their best to serve this country in law enforcement. O'Rourke's fellow democrats could have said something about this but they didn't. They're not allowed to. Nobody is. Defend America and you will be punished. Former Congresswoman Mary Bono lost her job just this week as President of USA Gymnastics. What did she do wrong? Well she leveled a veiled criticism at Colin Kaepernick. That's unacceptable now.  Kaepernick makes millions denigrating our national symbols. He's a hero. Nike hired him. If you complain about that though, you're the villain, and you're out. Defending America is suddenly a firing offense on the Left.  Democrat forced to resign over patriotic Facebook posts Mark Salvas learned this the hard way. Salvas wasn't simply a loyal Democrat. He was the Head of Allegheny County Pennsylvania Democratic Party, also a military veteran. You think he'd be allowed to stick up for America once in a while, but no.  He made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post. \"I stand for the flag. I kneel at the cross.\"  Now, not so long ago, most Democrats would have nodded in agreement at that. Today, it's hate speech. And he lost his job. But tonight, their loss is our gain. And Mark Salvas joins us now.  Mark, thanks a lot for coming on the show. Did I misstate that? I mean did you have to leave your job running the County's Republican - rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook?",

The Trump Administration, they're telling us, isn't doing enough in response to this. Why? Well, of course, because Trump loves dictators. He just does, loves the dictators. It's not really true. The real reason that Trump is being soft on the Saudis, if he is, in fact, being soft is because the people who surround him are pushing him to do that. Neo-cons love the Saudis because the Saudis oppose Iran. It's that simple, and nothing that's happened in the last week is going to change that. Now, we're not here to endorse Saudi Arabia. It's obviously a corrupt medieval desert theocracy. But we should pause for a moment and point out the hypocrisy from our own press. Saudi Arabia has been in the news for a long time like a 100 years. And none of them ever seem to care about Saudi implication in 9/11, Saudi government funding radical Islamic ideology around the world, funding insurgents in Syria, radical Imams in the West, they barely even covered the Saudi - Saudi military campaign in Yemen, which has been horrifying. And then, twice in the past two years, this country, the United States bombed Syria, even though no apparent American interests were at stake there. Why did we do that? Well in part because Saudi Arabia pushed us to do it. And you know what the media said? They loved it. Watch.",

This time, a letter was sent to Collins' home addressed to her husband, claiming it contained the deadly poison ricin. Parts of Collins' home and her dog are now in quarantine while a crime lab checks out the letter. A GOP candidate running for Vermont State Legislator also got a threatening letter reminiscent of a mystery novel. The letter to Deserae Morin was made up of words pulled out of printed material to spell quoting here, \"We are hunting you. My comrades will kill you and the Constitution. Socialism - socialism is here. Open season for Republican death in Vermont.\" Morin says her platform of low taxes and small government apparently makes socialists want to kill her.

It was just last year that progressive activists tried to murder an entire field of Republican lawmakers practicing baseball. He gravely wounded one of them. Strangely, you didn't hear calls for gun control in the days after that happened. And at this point, we've practically forgotten it ever happened at all. And so the cycle has accelerated.

Well Republicans, obviously, are the focus of most of it, conservatives, more generally, anyone else who descents from the one true faith of cultural Leftism. But really the target is the country itself. The Left is angry at America. They say so all the time. This is not the Democratic Party you grew up in or that you remember if you're over 30. That party may have stood for some bad ideas, and it did, but there was never really a question about its fundamental loyalty to America or the people who live here. The party of FDR and LBJ, even of Bill Clinton, was basically a patriotic party. It was an American party. Not anymore. In 2018, anyone who considers America a distinct physical place with meaningful borders and its own history and traditions and language and culture and values won't feel comfortable in the Democratic Party. Indeed, may not even be allowed in that party. To modern Democrats, the leaders of the party, America is an economy with land attached. It's a massive private equity scheme from which they are benefiting. Its people are interchangeable human widgets to be discarded and replaced when their usefulness expires. Was it always this way? Was this always what America was like, you might ask? Shut up, they'll explain. Before Obama got elected, America was truly a horrible place, a nightmare.

      "utterance": "Racist, front to back. In other words, our laws and our police are illegitimate and they're immoral. Don't worry about violating or ignoring them. Texas Senate candidate Robert Beto O'Rourke agrees with this. He recently told the crowd that police in America murder and imprison people solely because of their skin color. Now, that's factually untrue. It's ridiculous. And, of course, he didn't even try to prove it was true. But it's also a slur on decent people of all colors who are trying their best to serve this country in law enforcement. O'Rourke's fellow democrats could have said something about this but they didn't. They're not allowed to. Nobody is. Defend America and you will be punished. Former Congresswoman Mary Bono lost her job just this week as President of USA Gymnastics. What did she do wrong? Well she leveled a veiled criticism at Colin Kaepernick. That's unacceptable now. Kaepernick makes millions denigrating our national symbols. He's a hero. Nike hired him. If you complain about that though, you're the villain, and you're out. Defending America is suddenly a firing offense on the Left. Mark Salvas learned this the hard way. Salvas wasn't simply a loyal Democrat. He was the Head of Allegheny County Pennsylvania Democratic Party, also a military veteran. You think he'd be allowed to stick up for America once in a while, but no. He made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post. \"I stand for the flag. I kneel at the cross.\" Now, not so long ago, most Democrats would have nodded in agreement at that. Today, it's hate speech. And he lost his job. But tonight, their loss is our gain. And Mark Salvas joins us now. Mark, thanks a lot for coming on the show. Did I misstate that? I mean did you have to leave your job running the County's Republican - rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook?"

And one of the things that's interesting in the affidavit is it says that there's a - there's a co-conspirator involved who is her boss at the Treasury Department. We tried calling the Treasury Department's finance - FinCEN office and asking them which - which part of the office was she in, so we could determine who her boss was, and they wouldn't tell us.

The Trump Administration, they're telling us, isn't doing enough in response to this. Why? Well, of course, because Trump loves dictators. He just does, loves the dictators. It's not really true. The real reason that Trump is being soft on the Saudis, if he is, in fact, being soft is because the people who surround him are pushing him to do that. Neo-cons love the Saudis because the Saudis oppose Iran. It's that simple, and nothing that's happened in the last week is going to change that. Now, we're not here to endorse Saudi Arabia. It's obviously a corrupt medieval desert theocracy. But we should pause for a moment and point out the hypocrisy from our own press. Saudi Arabia has been in the news for a long time like a 100 years. And none of them ever seem to care about Saudi implication in 9/11, Saudi government funding radical Islamic ideology around the world, funding insurgents in Syria, radical Imams in the West, they barely even covered the Saudi - Saudi military campaign in Yemen, which has been horrifying. And then, twice in the past two years, this country, the United States bombed Syria, even though no apparent American interests were at stake there. Why did we do that? Well in part because Saudi Arabia pushed us to do it. And you know what the media said? They loved it. Watch."

If you're concerned about sucking up to strongmen what do you make of what the media and the Left more broadly has done with the biggest and most heinous and powerful, by the way, dictatorship in the world every single day? That would - of course, would be the Chinese government. China has murdered far more people than Saudi Arabia even considered beheading. The press doesn't care.
