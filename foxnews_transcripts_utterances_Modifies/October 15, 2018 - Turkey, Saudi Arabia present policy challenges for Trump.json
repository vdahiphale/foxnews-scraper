Two months later he was charged with membership in an armed terrorist organization for allegedly backing a coup attempt in Turkey, faced 35 years in prison. July he was taken from prison, placed under house arrest. And in August, the U.S. put some sanctions on a couple of Turkish officials. Today, again, he is leaving, time served already the sentence. Releasing a statement, \"We are grateful for the president's commitment and efforts in securing my release. My entire family thanks the president, the administration, and Congress for their unwavering support. This is the day our family has been praying for. I am delighted to be on my way home to the United States.\" Finally, a good news story on a Friday of a busy week.  Let's bring in our panel and start there: Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the Washington Free Beacon; Karen Tumulty, opinion writer for the Washington Post, and Marc Thiessen, fellow at American Enterprise Institute. Marc, good news story, and sounds like the president making clear no deal was done.",

He's been doing this fairly consistently. He's made it a priority of his foreign policy.   And he's done interest not by giving bribes, not by sending planeloads of cash with unmarked bills to foreign regimes because that creates an incentive to take Americans hostage.
