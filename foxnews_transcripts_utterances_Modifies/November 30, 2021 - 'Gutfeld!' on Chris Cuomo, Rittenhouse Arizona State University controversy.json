The guy touched more women than Pete Davidson at a wrap party. Chris admitted to helping his brother out in fighting the accusations, and who wouldn't help his brother really. But new documents reveal he was in regular touch with his bros' former top aide and his accusations piled up, Chris demanded knowing when damaging articles would come out, promising he'd uses media connections to help his sleazy sibling. So, this is turning into the best lifetime movie I've ever seen. And I've seen them all, including the 12 men of Christmas. Delicious. Now, previously, Chris said he never made calls to the press about his brother. And why shouldn't we believe him? He's been so honest before.",

After hearing all this, I'd wonder how does Chris keep his job? But then, I remember this guy. True, that was an unintentional error, and everyone deserves forgiveness for honest mistakes. But Greg, even if that involves burping the worm during a network Zoom call. Well, I go back and forth on this, much like Toobin. But my point is this. It's natural for network competitors to enjoy the spectacle of arrivals implosion. It's like when they demolish an old hotel in Vegas, you love to watch it. And Cuomo kind of deserves it. He's a blowhard who lauded Antifa and smear decent focus bigots. He turns out fake news like the Amish-do-butter. Telling you to live by the rules that he then happily pisses on like a urinal cake. He screamed at you to obey lockdowns as he violated his own. Seriously what a list of obnoxious to choose from? It's like the polyester shirts section at Walmart.

Seriously, Fox, how can you expect me to maintain a Bolivian cocaine habit, six mistresses, three full-time cabana boys in St. Barths, on a 14 mil a year salary? It's like they don't even consider the fact that my shoe inserts are made of ivory. Last week, I had to let a houseboy go because it's nonstop crying upset by Bengal tigers. So, what am I getting at? The scuttlebutt in this high school cafeteria called the media is that Chris is what you find next to your ham and eggs that I hop, toast. Well, it's either toast or a Lee press-on nail. But he's like the Greeks, ancient history. He's like, peaches at the supermarket, canned. He's like a loaded gun on an Alec Baldwin set, discharged. But why should he be fired? What did he do wrong? I mean, besides help to corrupt politicians, smearing accuser, by using his network connections, that's it? Come on. Who hasn't done that before? Am I right?

And you've seen it yourself. So, and so leaves Fox for someplace else, and suddenly they're different. So, the old line is, don't hate the player, hate the game. I came up with that as a kid while playing spin the bottle with my grandmother's schnauzer -- the bitch. But the game these days is to inflame divide and incite. Until we change that game, there will always be more Chris Cuomo than Greg Gutfeld. Firing them does no good because another one bubbles up.

He could nominate her to the bench if an opening happens before the next election. Saving the party a whole lot of electoral embarrassment.

I'm not sure Michelle is interested in running though. The job ages you too much. Look at her husband. There's also talk of a Harris-Buttigieg ticket.

Several lefty student groups at Arizona State University -- they have a university there -- are campaigning to get Kyle Rittenhouse kicked out of the schools' online classes. They call him murderer Kyle Rittenhouse and they're hosting a rally in support of their demands, which includes banning Rittenhouse, reaffirming support for the Multicultural Center as a safe space from white supremacy, which is like demanding a safe space from ghosts. They also want funds redirected from the ASU Police Department to the Multicultural Center because a lack of police really helped matters in Kenosha, and finally and oddly, to quote, \"make Gutfeld do his show shirtless.\" That's funny. I can't argue there Susan, the kids want what they want. Stop laughing. Now, the school confirm that Rittenhouse was enrolled as a non-degree online student but he hasn't gone through the admissions process and is no longer enrolled, which means he filled out an online form where they will take anyone, and the fact is Rittenhouse was found not guilty. It's only fair he deserves another shot, which is poor wording on my part. Meanwhile, ASU students for Socialism said they don't feel safe with Kyle being at the school, even if it's just online. But with socialists that weak, how are they going to implement gulags? A little history humor there. It's sad how much the school has changed.

But new documents reveal he was in regular touch with his bros' former top aide and his accusations piled up, Chris demanded knowing when damaging articles would come out, promising he'd uses media connections to help his sleazy sibling. So, this is turning into the best lifetime movie I've ever seen. And I've seen them all, including the 12 men of Christmas. Delicious.

It's natural for network competitors to enjoy the spectacle of arrivals implosion. It's like when they demolish an old hotel in Vegas, you love to watch it. And Cuomo kind of deserves it. He's a blowhard who lauded Antifa and smear decent focus bigots. He turns out fake news like the Amish-do-butter. Telling you to live by the rules that he then happily pisses on like a urinal cake.

It was either -- yes, it's true. it was either that or the other nuclear option, which would involve using enormous bombs to blow up the world. Which seems drastic. But so is nominating Kamala to the Supremes. But I guess nothing says you're the worst person ever at the easiest job ever. They're giving you a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. When I heard this, I threw back my head and laughed like Kamala. It's not as easy as she makes it look. I herniated three disks. While this nightmare scenario is highly unlikely, possibly a rumor propelled by Joe's flatulence, it is constitutionally possible. He could nominate her to the bench if an opening happens before the next election. Saving the party a whole lot of electoral embarrassment. But a new poll from The Hill, the paper, not the mount of dirt, claims just the opposite. Saying Harris and Michelle Obama are the Dems' top picks for 2024, if Biden doesn't run. I'm not sure Michelle is interested in running though. The job ages you too much. Look at her husband. There's also talk of a Harris-Buttigieg ticket.

Several lefty student groups at Arizona State University -- they have a university there -- are campaigning to get Kyle Rittenhouse kicked out of the schools' online classes. They call him murderer Kyle Rittenhouse and they're hosting a rally in support of their demands, which includes banning Rittenhouse, reaffirming support for the Multicultural Center as a safe space from white supremacy, which is like demanding a safe space from ghosts. They also want funds redirected from the ASU Police Department to the Multicultural Center because a lack of police really helped matters in Kenosha, and finally and oddly, to quote, \"make Gutfeld do his show shirtless.\" That's funny. I can't argue there Susan, the kids want what they want. Stop laughing. Now, the school confirm that Rittenhouse was enrolled as a non-degree online student but he hasn't gone through the admissions process and is no longer enrolled, which means he filled out an online form where they will take anyone, and the fact is Rittenhouse was found not guilty. It's only fair he deserves another shot, which is poor wording on my part. Meanwhile, ASU students for Socialism said they don't feel safe with Kyle being at the school, even if it's just online. But with socialists that weak, how are they going to implement gulags? A little history humor there. It's sad how much the school has changed. Playboy magazine once named ASU the number one party school back in 2002. We asked an ASU student who graduated that year to comment."

The site's founder said that Santa's body type and age are COVID-19 comorbidities, prompting many of them to retire to avoid the risks. A performer booking agency in San Francisco and Santa costume store owner in North Carolina have reported similar Santa's shortage issues.

So, he's not making as many visits. So, Santa is not going to come to your mall, because a lot of you have been bad. And you know who you are? Every one of you. So that's why Santas are down. Because people have been bad. Don't blame the pandemic isn't really that naughty and nice list. And then naughty list is thick this year."
