      "sentences": "Good evening from New York. I'm Jesse Waters in for Laura and this is an Ingraham Angle special, The Russian cloud. The Russian probe has indeed been hanging like a cloud over the Trump administration. But the script is flipping as the investigators come under investigation. Tonight we are going to examine these issues. Whether Spygate is the Watergate of our era or even worse. Our Intel experts explain why timing is now the key to proving whether the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign. Former FBI agents examine James Comey's claim that President Trump simply made up Spygate despite all the growing evidence. Signs Americans are fed up with Russia, Russia, Russia as Democrats start to fear a major backlash in November and whether Trump can persuade Mueller to wind up his investigation by consenting to an interview. Now, let's begin our Ingraham Angle special report on the Russian cloud with a look at Spygate.  That's what President Trump calls the growing reports that the FBI, under Obama, placed at least one informant or spy in his Presidential campaign. Those reports also fuel suspicion on the right that the Russian investigation has been nothing more than a political coup by Obama allies in the deep state against the duly elected President of the United States, in the era of an exploding surveillance state. Have we actually witnessed an administration infiltrate the presidential campaign of an opposing party. An editorial in Wednesday's Investor's Business Daily points how timing is everything.  The IBD noted that the timeline of the FBI's Russia investigation keeps shifting. And the earlier the probe began quote, \"the less likely it is that it had anything to do with Russian involvement in the 2016 elections but everything to do with stopping the surprising surge of Trump during the GOP primaries and beyond\". Let's examine that prospect with some top notch experts from our FBI special agent Jeff Beatty is in Orlando.  In Washington Bill Binney who served more than 30 years as an Intel official with the NSA before turning whistle blower. And here in New York Steven Rogers, a former member of FBI joint terrorism task force. Steve we'll start with you. I have a theory here and one's bad and one's a little worse. First, the Obama administration thought there was Russian infiltration so they used the Trump officials as bait in order to lure the Russians in, but nothing materialized. So then they looked around and they thought, you know I have some Trump people on the hook here, let's turn the screws. Or it was deceitful from the very beginning, they wanted eye and ears on the Trump campaign so without any probable cause they cooked up this echo chamber of spies and lies of misinformation to get the surveillance. What do you think?",

But let me just give you what I see as the bluff, the bottom line upfront. The FBI gave a defensive briefing to the Democratic National Committee when they had information that there was a foreign entity trying to sway influence or move into or penetrate the Democratic apparatus. They did not do that for the Republican apparatus as Steve eluded to. What they did from the very beginning was treat the Republican apparatus differently. Democrat, defensive briefing, let's work together. Republican, I really think it was just a fig leaf to use other government agencies to introduce a Russian raison d'etre to explain why they could then go ahead, launch an investigation for two purposes Jesse. I think first of all to get political Intelligence as what was going on on the inside of the campaign so they could use it. But secondly, to be able to destroy their enemy.

So the Democrats are frustrated right now, and there are a few people out there who are trying to raise the red flags. One of them is Mark Penn, a former Clinton camp person saying hey, guys, get off the special counsel, get off of Russia. Come up with a message because you don't have one.

      "utterance": "Good evening from New York. I'm Jesse Waters in for Laura and this is an Ingraham Angle special, The Russian cloud. The Russian probe has indeed been hanging like a cloud over the Trump administration. But the script is flipping as the investigators come under investigation. Tonight we are going to examine these issues. Whether Spygate is the Watergate of our era or even worse. Our Intel experts explain why timing is now the key to proving whether the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign. Former FBI agents examine James Comey's claim that President Trump simply made up Spygate despite all the growing evidence. Signs Americans are fed up with Russia, Russia, Russia as Democrats start to fear a major backlash in November and whether Trump can persuade Mueller to wind up his investigation by consenting to an interview. Now, let's begin our Ingraham Angle special report on the Russian cloud with a look at Spygate. That's what President Trump calls the growing reports that the FBI, under Obama, placed at least one informant or spy in his Presidential campaign. Those reports also fuel suspicion on the right that the Russian investigation has been nothing more than a political coup by Obama allies in the deep state against the duly elected President of the United States, in the era of an exploding surveillance state. Have we actually witnessed an administration infiltrate the presidential campaign of an opposing party. An editorial in Wednesday's Investor's Business Daily points how timing is everything. The IBD noted that the timeline of the FBI's Russia investigation keeps shifting. And the earlier the probe began quote, \"the less likely it is that it had anything to do with Russian involvement in the 2016 elections but everything to do with stopping the surprising surge of Trump during the GOP primaries and beyond\". Let's examine that prospect with some top notch experts from our FBI special agent Jeff Beatty is in Orlando. In Washington Bill Binney who served more than 30 years as an Intel official with the NSA before turning whistle blower. And here in New York Steven Rogers, a former member of FBI joint terrorism task force. Steve we'll start with you. I have a theory here and one's bad and one's a little worse. First, the Obama administration thought there was Russian infiltration so they used the Trump officials as bait in order to lure the Russians in, but nothing materialized. So then they looked around and they thought, you know I have some Trump people on the hook here, let's turn the screws. Or it was deceitful from the very beginning, they wanted eye and ears on the Trump campaign so without any probable cause they cooked up this echo chamber of spies and lies of misinformation to get the surveillance. What do you think?"

Why didn't the FBI go and look at the server at the DMC and do a forensic audit. I mean wouldn't that be the first place you'd look if you were looking for Russian Intel infiltration?"

      "utterance": "Well you know that goes back to 2015 and I'm a believer in your course of action too that you outlined at the top of the show Jesse. But let me just give you what I see as the bluff, the bottom line upfront. The FBI gave a defensive briefing to the Democratic National Committee when they had information that there was a foreign entity trying to sway influence or move into or penetrate the Democratic apparatus. They did not do that for the Republican apparatus as Steve eluded to. What they did from the very beginning was treat the Republican apparatus differently. Democrat, defensive briefing, let's work together. Republican, I really think it was just a fig leaf to use other government agencies to introduce a Russian raison d'etre to explain why they could then go ahead, launch an investigation for two purposes Jesse. I think first of all to get political Intelligence as what was going on on the inside of the campaign so they could use it. But secondly, to be able to destroy their enemy.

We are at the point where a house divided will fall on itself and the American society as a whole will fall on itself if we don't get to the bottom of what the truth is. Not the half-truth, but the full truth. And the only way to do this is to have these agents come out whether it's through subpoenas and testifying to these committees.

Because you look at it going back at it I mean, to James Comey so I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I actually read his book and that's actually what changed my opinion of him that too often, one, he is always on the right side of history throughout. The only real vulnerability that he shares is maybe that he was a bully to a college kid one time but outside of that his professional career he makes every decision rightful, every single time. And then when you look at what happened with Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton on the tarmac right there shows that there's political involvement in that and as the FBI director he needed to address that.

But I want to play for you what Sally Yates, the acting attorney general at the very beginning of the Trump administration, she's the one partly responsible for interviewing Michael Flynn at the beginning, what she said today on \"Morning Joe.\" Let's watch."

And I think of all of the terrible things that happened to so many people like Michael, like some of the other people who are involved allegedly with this informant, I actually spoke very positively. I got a positive impression about this informant and a couple of people I mentioned him to in the campaign. I was a pretty positive endorsement. So I hope and pray that all these allegations turn out to be false. And part of why I'm somewhat open about my communications with him is that it will lead to some truth finally from the Department of Justice. I have been asking for the DOJ to own up to these things. It's funny, the defamation suit I have against a top media organization and DOJ, the media organization is actually much more honest than the false pleadings by the DOJ so far. Hopefully they clean up."

Let me tell you something that I know for a fact. This informant, this person that they tried to plant into the campaign and even into the administration if you believe \"Axios,\" he is not the only person that came at the campaign, and the FBI is not the only Obama agency that came at the campaign. I know because they came at me. And I'm looking for clearance from my attorney to reveal this to the public, this is just the beginning.

And I heard your poll numbers earlier, the one poll number we should focus on is 75 percent, and that's the number of Americans who give Donald Trump credit for crushing it on the economy. So the Democrats are frustrated right now, and there are a few people out there who are trying to raise the red flags. One of them is Mark Penn, a former Clinton camp person saying hey, guys, get off the special counsel, get off of Russia. Come up with a message because you don't have one.

But the megaphone with the media, the machine, the Democratic Party apparatus, they are not talking about kitchen table issues, Rachel.

They thought that they could start with this whole Russia hoax. And they thought they could continue their resistance. I know our guest here, Jason Altmire, says the resistance. Well, the resistance isn't the Democrat Party and the American people see that. And I think what they didn't count on was after a year and a half of spying on Trump, trying to frame people from his campaign, they have come up with nothing in a year and a half, zero evidence. And then there's something else that they didn't expect, and that's what I said earlier. They didn't expect him to crush it on the economy, to decimate ISIS, to really keep all of the promises that he did on the campaign trail. And I can tell you that here in Wausau, Wisconsin, when I talk to people, that's the one thing -- it's interesting, it's the one thing I hear the most. Whether they agree with him or not, they go this is a guy that keeps his promises. And voters I think didn't expect that because they got cynical and thought it would happen."

      "utterance": "The Trump legal team has gone on to the offensive since adding Rudy Giuliani. He's trying to get Bob Mueller to end the part of the Russia investigation looking into the president. Giuliani told \"The Huffington Post\" Thursday that Trump, quote, could probably decide by June 12th whether to testify in front of Mueller's team. But he also told \"The Washington Post\" that the president was still more likely to meet with North Korean President Kim Jong-un than Mueller. Speaking of which, President Trump tweeted tonight, the summit may still happen. But back to the Mueller probe. Let's look into legal strategies with attorney and Democrat Raj Goyle and Republican attorney Kenneth Del Vecchio of New Jersey. It's my opinion, Kenneth, the president shouldn't go near Bob Mueller for a few reasons. One, I don't trust Mueller. Two, the president has a big mouth and he likes to talk, and he likes to talk a lot. And that's just not a good strategy when you are facing a possible indictment by someone who doesn't seem to like you too much."

You don't go and talk with U.S. attorneys, with the Justice Department, unless you are dead in the water. And since Trump is innocent, he's only going to go there to get his words potentially twisted, to get some bogus obstruction or perjury charges filed against him. And you have to look at it first from the criminal law perspective. And as a criminal lawyer, I would advise him 100 percent not to go. Now, the political angle is secondary, and it's a deep second. But what are the political ramifications of this? so Mueller is going to do what? He's going to subpoena him in front of a grand jury? So he will take the Fifth. The same people that love Donald Trump are going to love him."

If a U.S. attorney knows that an underling is investigating somebody who he knows is innocent, let's just say the guy's name is Bob, and he is investigating Bob for murder. But the U.S. attorney himself knows that he is innocent because he was with him at the time of the murder, not only would he have the right to end that investigation, he actually has the duty. So if Donald Trump knows he is innocent or the people around him are innocent, he actually has a duty almost to end the Mueller investigation."
