Fox News alert, protests underway in Louisville, Kentucky, after one officer was indicted in connection with the death of Breonna Taylor.   Ex-cop, Brett Hankison faces three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. The grand jury, however, did not charge any of the three officers directly in Taylor's death. Matt Finn is on the ground in Kentucky with the latest, since I've seen you in about -- I have not seen you in about two hours, Matt. What is the latest?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, we were in Frankfurt, the capital, for the attorney general's press conference. Now, we are back here in Louisville. Our reporter, Jeff Paul, is actually among the protesters.  Now, I am here in the downtown area. A large portion of this downtown has been entirely blocked off, barricaded by police.  There are heavy trucks and physical barricades here, police only letting in essential personnel. But the big news today, of course, is that not of the officers in the Breonna Taylor case were charged with murder. One former officer, Detective Hankison, was charged with wanton endangerment, three counts. That's a much lesser charge.  Of course, there are many people here on the ground and across the nation who are not happy with today's outcome. The attorney general says two out of three of the officers involved, Cosgrove and Mattingly, were of authorized to use force in the Breonna Taylor case. They were returning fire because they were shot at first. The Kentucky attorney general also says all three officers were not involved in obtaining the actual warrant. They only had the information relayed to them about carrying it out, and that evidence shows that the evidence shows the officers knocked and denounced at Breonna Taylor's apartment. It was not a no-knock warrant according to Kentucky's attorney general.  The attorney general says that was corroborated by independent witnesses. The AG also revealing Breonna Taylor was actually shot six times, not five times. Only one was considered fatal. But the attorney general says his office could not definitively conclude who fired that fatal shot. The FBI says it was Officer Cosgrove.  Now, in a statement, the officers reported that after they entered Breonna Taylor's apartment, forcibly entered, a male, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was holding a gun. His arms were extended in a shooting stance. And that Walker testified or told police that he did fire the first shot at police, hitting one of the officers in the leg.   And that ultimately, all of the officers responded. Here's Breonna Taylor's attorney responding to this a short while ago.",

You could see what is set up right out here about half a mile away from the mayor's home. You have several police officers out here, and that sort of where they drew the line.  Marchers came right up to that line and they wouldn't let them through. And there was some sort of interaction between police and a few of the protesters, and then the police officers started just rushing through this way. And they pushed them back. I want to just step in the street real quick for a second. And they pushed them back that way down the street where we assume and haven't been able to make it over there yet.   But we assume the majority of the protesters now remain on that side of the police blockade. About 12 people, I would say, were arrested out here. They had these plastic kind of zip ties around the back of them, and then they were carted out of here in some big police vans. And really what is interesting is we've got this curfew tonight that's been implemented at 9:00 p.m. So we'll see what the rest of the night holds because there are still several protesters out there trying to -- wanting -- seemingly wanting to get closer and closer to the mayor's house after the announcement was made today in the Breonna Taylor case, Dana.",

We watched as hundreds of businesses boarded up here in the past 24 to 48 hours.   We know. We showed you a short while earlier. There are only certain ways in and certain out. Police are forming these very intense barricades, only letting essential personnel in. You could those large trucks down the end of this road as well. And that scene is repeated all across downtown Louisville. Also, you know, our Jeff Paul is walking among the actual protesters right now.  I am hearing that arrests are being made, that there are human barriers being formed already. You know, beginning yesterday morning, police started to close off these streets. Businesses started boarding up. And there was, you know, actual some local reports and reactions saying, hey, this is, you know, too strong of a reaction. But apparently, you know, the police department and the mayor, wanted to be completely prepared for this decision, and here we are. There are many people who are unhappy with it. So you can imagine that the protests, which have already started, are going to go through the night. Hopefully, they do not become violent.  But, you know, I have covered protests in Minneapolis, in Portland, in Seattle, in many cities across the country. And unfortunately, as the sun starts to set, which is going to begin to do in just a short while, things could take a nasty turn.

But in 2015, Obama officials alerted the White House, said Biden's odd Ukrainian business deals may be a conflict of interest since his dad was overseeing Ukrainian problems. There was the smoke of sleaze, lavish spending, wired mountains of cash. Meaning, they shared the exact concerns Trump had when he made that perfect phone call. But when your dad is the number two guy, Hunter could look out for number one. Making millions he made more doing nothing then you'll make in a lifetime of working hard. And the White House ignored the lunacy of the VPs son sitting on a board of a company owned by a corrupt oligarch, while the White House tried to deal with the corruption. Joe should have stopped this but he didn't. Treasury records show potential criminal transactions between Hunter, his family, and Ukrainian, Russian, Russian, and Chinese nationals, some linked to prostitution and human trafficking. The Dems' response, this probe, wasted effort that could have been directed at COVID, this from the clowns who embraced a phony dossier for years, then gleefully shelved the pandemic aside to indulge their impeachment fetish. And speaking of clowns with fetishes, the media have already buried the story. It's a hatchet job, they say. Dems call it a witch hunt. Who cares?  What goes around comes around.

And if you're a Republican who votes mainly because of the courts, then you don't get -- like, just get it done whenever they get it done. I will say that the Democrats also on process they again, just like biting off their nose to spite their face. Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader has put in place something today and he probably will threaten to do it again. It's called the two-hour rule, which means that the Senate cannot do any business after 2:00 p.m. The problem was, as Senator Marco Rubio pointed out today, at 2:00 p.m. today, they were supposed to have a briefing on election security and interference from the guy that's in charge over at the DNI's office or the Homeland Security Office. So, they couldn't have their briefing. So, there wasn't a briefing on election security because they're throwing a tantrum about the Republicans being in power. Again, the Democrats, they're in -- they're in a bind, right. But if they would do probably do a better job spending their time talking about the consequences of a conservative court rather than just the process, because they will lose on the process.",

Anyway, last night, it was so different because I got to see the Nationals play the Phillies, Jesse's Phillies, and there was a magic moment. Take a look at a game-winning extra-inning home run by a rookie. That was Yadiel Hernandez's first home run in the big leagues. At age 32, Hernandez is the oldest player in Major League history to hit a game-winning home run. It's the first home run of his career. The reason Hernandez is just getting to the majors at 32 is a wonderful backstory. He defected from Cuba in 2015, put himself at risk to get here. He's been in the Nationals Minor League system since then. And as you can see, his teammates were excited to win a game, but even more excited to see a dream come true for that young man.",

Fox News alert, protests underway in Louisville, Kentucky, after one officer was indicted in connection with the death of Breonna Taylor. Ex-cop, Brett Hankison faces three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. The grand jury, however, did not charge any of the three officers directly in Taylor's death. Matt Finn is on the ground in Kentucky with the latest, since I've seen you in about -- I have not seen you in about two hours, Matt. What is the latest?"

      "speaker": "MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Dana, we were in Frankfurt, the capital, for the attorney general's press conference. Now, we are back here in Louisville. Our reporter, Jeff Paul, is actually among the protesters. Now, I am here in the downtown area. A large portion of this downtown has been entirely blocked off, barricaded by police. There are heavy trucks and physical barricades here, police only letting in essential personnel. But the big news today, of course, is that not of the officers in the Breonna Taylor case were charged with murder. One former officer, Detective Hankison, was charged with wanton endangerment, three counts. That's a much lesser charge. Of course, there are many people here on the ground and across the nation who are not happy with today's outcome. The attorney general says two out of three of the officers involved, Cosgrove and Mattingly, were of authorized to use force in the Breonna Taylor case. They were returning fire because they were shot at first. The Kentucky attorney general also says all three officers were not involved in obtaining the actual warrant. They only had the information relayed to them about carrying it out, and that evidence shows that the evidence shows the officers knocked and denounced at Breonna Taylor's apartment. It was not a no-knock warrant according to Kentucky's attorney general. The attorney general says that was corroborated by independent witnesses. The AG also revealing Breonna Taylor was actually shot six times, not five times. Only one was considered fatal. But the attorney general says his office could not definitively conclude who fired that fatal shot. The FBI says it was Officer Cosgrove. Now, in a statement, the officers reported that after they entered Breonna Taylor's apartment, forcibly entered, a male, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was holding a gun. His arms were extended in a shooting stance. And that Walker testified or told police that he did fire the first shot at police, hitting one of the officers in the leg. And that ultimately, all of the officers responded. Here's Breonna Taylor's attorney responding to this a short while ago."

He also said he is going to start a task force to investigate warrants, you know, and warrants such as knocking and entering in the Breonna Taylor case to determine, you know, if the is legality and how unnecessary they are moving forward. Also, he says that celebrities and influencers are going to try to imply that they know Kentucky laws better than the attorney general and his investigators.

      "utterance": "And Dana, things really taking a turn here in Louisville after several hours of peaceful and very spirited protesting and marching through the street. You could see what is set up right out here about half a mile away from the mayor's home. You have several police officers out here, and that sort of where they drew the line. Marchers came right up to that line and they wouldn't let them through. And there was some sort of interaction between police and a few of the protesters, and then the police officers started just rushing through this way. And they pushed them back. I want to just step in the street real quick for a second. And they pushed them back that way down the street where we assume and haven't been able to make it over there yet. But we assume the majority of the protesters now remain on that side of the police blockade. About 12 people, I would say, were arrested out here. They had these plastic kind of zip ties around the back of them, and then they were carted out of here in some big police vans. And really what is interesting is we've got this curfew tonight that's been implemented at 9:00 p.m. So we'll see what the rest of the night holds because there are still several protesters out there trying to -- wanting -- seemingly wanting to get closer and closer to the mayor's house after the announcement was made today in the Breonna Taylor case, Dana."

The attorney general was asked what it was like when he met with Breonna Taylor's family today. And he spoke very movingly about how was it was extremely difficult. All right, we lost Matt. But that was a great question, and I wish we could get an answer. Because what I was going to ask -- and Jeff Paul, maybe you have the answer to this. He talked about how he had met with Breonna Taylor's family. But have we heard directly from them and not from lawyers?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINN",
      "utterance": "Sure. Let's actually walk here. We are in downtown Louisville. I have to say we've been here for more than a week now. This city, over the past 24 to 48 hours, has been so heavily boarded up and shut down, at least in this square mile radius. We watched as hundreds of businesses boarded up here in the past 24 to 48 hours. We know. We showed you a short while earlier. There are only certain ways in and certain out. Police are forming these very intense barricades, only letting essential personnel in. You could those large trucks down the end of this road as well. And that scene is repeated all across downtown Louisville. Also, you know, our Jeff Paul is walking among the actual protesters right now. I am hearing that arrests are being made, that there are human barriers being formed already. You know, beginning yesterday morning, police started to close off these streets. Businesses started boarding up. And there was, you know, actual some local reports and reactions saying, hey, this is, you know, too strong of a reaction. But apparently, you know, the police department and the mayor, wanted to be completely prepared for this decision, and here we are. There are many people who are unhappy with it. So you can imagine that the protests, which have already started, are going to go through the night. Hopefully, they do not become violent. But, you know, I have covered protests in Minneapolis, in Portland, in Seattle, in many cities across the country. And unfortunately, as the sun starts to set, which is going to begin to do in just a short while, things could take a nasty turn. I will say, at least, authorities do seem very much prepared here in Louisville."

      "utterance": "That is my understanding. And the attorney general said today that, you know, the two officers that were not charged were authorized to use the force that they did because, you know, investigators believed that Kenneth Walker fired first at them, that Kenneth Walker even testified that he fired first at them. So they were simply returning his fire."

And he has put that front and center in everybody's brainpan. This, after the Democrats, prominent Democrats were bailing out rapists and murderers and rioters. So they don't give a damn about the victims. They only care about the criminals. Now, I want to comment on Joe Biden. Joe Biden says he beat the socialist. Yet, he absorbs all of his principles.

GOP senators released their report on Hunter Biden's shady dealings when his pop was VP. Joe claims his kid just got lucky and found a job on Craigslist. But in 2015, Obama officials alerted the White House, said Biden's odd Ukrainian business deals may be a conflict of interest since his dad was overseeing Ukrainian problems. There was the smoke of sleaze, lavish spending, wired mountains of cash. Meaning, they shared the exact concerns Trump had when he made that perfect phone call. But when your dad is the number two guy, Hunter could look out for number one. Making millions he made more doing nothing then you'll make in a lifetime of working hard. And the White House ignored the lunacy of the VPs son sitting on a board of a company owned by a corrupt oligarch, while the White House tried to deal with the corruption. Joe should have stopped this but he didn't. Treasury records show potential criminal transactions between Hunter, his family, and Ukrainian, Russian, Russian, and Chinese nationals, some linked to prostitution and human trafficking. The Dems' response, this probe, wasted effort that could have been directed at COVID, this from the clowns who embraced a phony dossier for years, then gleefully shelved the pandemic aside to indulge their impeachment fetish. And speaking of clowns with fetishes, the media have already buried the story. It's a hatchet job, they say. Dems call it a witch hunt. Who cares? What goes around comes around. This ain't the Steele dossier. It's the real dossier, no wonder it's not leading the news. So Juan, this is great. We have got Russians, sex trafficking, money, this is the dossier you wanted all along. It's just the wrong guy."

I guess that's totally different. And also, remember the meeting that Don Jr. had where no money or information exchanged hands. You guys wanted to send him to prison.

And if you're a Republican who votes mainly because of the courts, then you don't get -- like, just get it done whenever they get it done. I will say that the Democrats also on process they again, just like biting off their nose to spite their face. Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader has put in place something today and he probably will threaten to do it again. It's called the two-hour rule, which means that the Senate cannot do any business after 2:00 p.m. The problem was, as Senator Marco Rubio pointed out today, at 2:00 p.m. today, they were supposed to have a briefing on election security and interference from the guy that's in charge over at the DNI's office or the Homeland Security Office. So, they couldn't have their briefing. So, there wasn't a briefing on election security because they're throwing a tantrum about the Republicans being in power. Again, the Democrats, they're in -- they're in a bind, right. But if they would do probably do a better job spending their time talking about the consequences of a conservative court rather than just the process, because they will lose on the process."

People start wondering what Rand Paul might do. Well, we know what he's going to do. And what happens is, boom, they get in, and then we just realized we wasted five weeks, which is more than enough time. I mean, you could do this in two days. You could do this in one day, just have the --- have the straight up and down vote. And even better is that it's a woman so you can't portray her as a gang rapist, beer-guzzling heathen. I guess you could say that you want to have abortions in a back alley, I'm helping the Democrats there, or that she expired The Handmaid's Tale, which is false, but they keep saying that.

This is a project that is put together by an amazing photographer named Melanie Dunea. Look her up, Melanie Dunea. So, it highlights the beauty and color that still exists in New York City. Like here we are. These are silk beautiful, limited-edition scarves. They are based on photographs she took the city over the last few months. It's like wearable art. They look amazing. You could do them as face coverings or framed on a wall, but I am going to wear mine or I'm going to have Jasper wear mine. A portion of the proceeds go to NYC COVID-19 Response and Impact Fund. She's an amazing woman. They're beautiful and creative. I mean, look at that, everybody."

Anyway, last night, it was so different because I got to see the Nationals play the Phillies, Jesse's Phillies, and there was a magic moment. Take a look at a game-winning extra-inning home run by a rookie. That was Yadiel Hernandez's first home run in the big leagues. At age 32, Hernandez is the oldest player in Major League history to hit a game-winning home run. It's the first home run of his career. The reason Hernandez is just getting to the majors at 32 is a wonderful backstory. He defected from Cuba in 2015, put himself at risk to get here. He's been in the Nationals Minor League system since then. And as you can see, his teammates were excited to win a game, but even more excited to see a dream come true for that young man."

I actually taught her how to sing like that. And she's doing pretty well with all of my musical instruction. So, the song is available. It's called Strong. It features Charles Esten. And it's about Julian's mom's journey fighting cancer for the past four years. And you know, you can get it anywhere you get music. Where do you get music now?"
