Some have even refused to say how they feel about Brown versus the Board of Education. The way to get through the confirmation process now is basically not to say anything. And I think the Democrats will try very, very hard to pin these nominees down on how they feel about Roe, how they feel about Griswold, et cetera, and they are not going to succeed."
