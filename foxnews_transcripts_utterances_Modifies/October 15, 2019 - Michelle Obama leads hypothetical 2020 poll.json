She was asking, did you guys talk about your business deals? He said no. She didn't say, hey, look at the photograph. Remember the Nickelback picture? She didn't say, well, why were you guys purposely keeping each other in the dark then? Is it to have some sort of plausible deniability? Or how about when he said, well, I don't think I was qualified to be on the board and I didn't know anything about Ukraine or about natural gas, but I probably knew more about that than the other people on the board.

My sense is that Hunter was contrite and he was pretty honest in saying that, you know what, you got a lot of breaks because his last name is Biden, and he doesn't even know the extent of all the brakes and the money that come his way because his last name is Biden. And he admits that it created a negative perception even if it broke no laws. So he -- I think he was very contrite on that level. But by coming clean, Jesse, it seems to me he creates pressure right now on the Trump kids to come clean, because you have Don Jr., you have Eric, you have Ivanka, who all have huge multinational global business dealings going on while their dad is in the White House. I think last year the profits were between 29, $135 million. And, of course, property is being sold. The father has never divested himself from the Trump Company.

The only mistake was not taking into account a Rudy Giuliani or a president would be scrutinizing him.  If I can comment for a second on what you were saying, Juan, I think a tremendous difference to me as a citizen is how much the business dealings were intertwined with the state. And I want to take this moment to just point out how intertwined Hunter Biden is with the Chinese state. You know his attorney came out the other day and said, well, he's stepping down as director of the board and he's received no profit from his stake, but that's not true. What he invested in, his 400,000 and some change investment, gave him control and influence over $1.5 billion in capital over there. And what does that fund that he is an owner of investing? Really sensitive assets like the state owned in China nuclear power company and the U.S. And the Chinese they have -- that company has reported in their documents specifically that they lure investors who, because they are sons of officials, or children of officials to leverage the network, and that he had a 30 percent stake the entire time.

The lesson here is that there is a downside to nepotism. So you get all the benefits, right? You get all the benefits up front jobs, you get to first-class airfare, you get to pick up chicks, all the stuff that Hunter Biden has been doing. But then when the poop hits the fan you get it all over you. So this was a kind of -- this was a karma-esque. Is that a word? And this is a kind of a new thing. It's a golden rule, I think, of the Donald Trump presidency. For every action, there is a powerful reaction. So you gin up -- you gin up a Ukrainian phone call. We're going to gin up Hunter. So they might actually be -- in terms of importance of stories, they might just be the same. But if you're going to push this one up, I'm going to do it to you. And this Hunter story actually sticks because people understand rich kids who get away with stuff. And that's different to Juan's point, than Donald Trump's kids because they actually work for a living. Do you think Trump lets his kids slide at work?

I mean did he know that that was a promise that they made, they were going to have two systems, one state and they were going to allow in 2020, a phase in of democracy and elections.

The core issue was, is the Biden family for sale, and how did sleepy Joe not know about the foreign influence through his son and she didn't get to that. She was asking, did you guys talk about your business deals? He said no. She didn't say, hey, look at the photograph. Remember the Nickelback picture? She didn't say, well, why were you guys purposely keeping each other in the dark then? Is it to have some sort of plausible deniability? Or how about when he said, well, I don't think I was qualified to be on the board and I didn't know anything about Ukraine or about natural gas, but I probably knew more about that than the other people on the board. Well, she could have asked, well, you know, the former president of Poland is on the board, an international investment bank is on the board. Cofer Black is on the board, former CIA I think you don't know more than they do about Ukraine and natural gas.

My sense is that Hunter was contrite and he was pretty honest in saying that, you know what, you got a lot of breaks because his last name is Biden, and he doesn't even know the extent of all the brakes and the money that come his way because his last name is Biden. And he admits that it created a negative perception even if it broke no laws. So he -- I think he was very contrite on that level. But by coming clean, Jesse, it seems to me he creates pressure right now on the Trump kids to come clean, because you have Don Jr., you have Eric, you have Ivanka, who all have huge multinational global business dealings going on while their dad is in the White House. I think last year the profits were between 29, $135 million. And, of course, property is being sold. The father has never divested himself from the Trump Company.

The only mistake was not taking into account a Rudy Giuliani or a president would be scrutinizing him. If I can comment for a second on what you were saying, Juan, I think a tremendous difference to me as a citizen is how much the business dealings were intertwined with the state. And I want to take this moment to just point out how intertwined Hunter Biden is with the Chinese state. You know his attorney came out the other day and said, well, he's stepping down as director of the board and he's received no profit from his stake, but that's not true. What he invested in, his 400,000 and some change investment, gave him control and influence over $1.5 billion in capital over there. And what does that fund that he is an owner of investing? Really sensitive assets like the state owned in China nuclear power company and the U.S. And the Chinese they have -- that company has reported in their documents specifically that they lure investors who, because they are sons of officials, or children of officials to leverage the network, and that he had a 30 percent stake the entire time.

It's like, yeah, I shouldn't have 15 wine coolers, but it's not wrong. I shouldn't have thrown up at the boss's picnic. I did nothing wrong, but I shouldn't have done it. The lesson here is that there is a downside to nepotism. So you get all the benefits, right? You get all the benefits up front jobs, you get to first-class airfare, you get to pick up chicks, all the stuff that Hunter Biden has been doing. But then when the poop hits the fan you get it all over you. So this was a kind of -- this was a karma-esque. Is that a word? And this is a kind of a new thing. It's a golden rule, I think, of the Donald Trump presidency. For every action, there is a powerful reaction. So you gin up -- you gin up a Ukrainian phone call. We're going to gin up Hunter. So they might actually be -- in terms of importance of stories, they might just be the same. But if you're going to push this one up, I'm going to do it to you. And this Hunter story actually sticks because people understand rich kids who get away with stuff. And that's different to Juan's point, than Donald Trump's kids because they actually work for a living. Do you think Trump lets his kids slide at work? If you asked his kids, would it have been easier to work for a stranger than your dad, they would have said stranger because their dad never rests.

The people that they did get access to seem to me to be kind of low-level players without any editorial power, and they've aid thing, as you've mentioned, that Zucker feels guilty about The Apprentice, and now he's trying to get revenge, or that people in the elevator on election night were pretty bummed out at CNN. Yeah, that's not breaking news to me. The main takeaway is, is that CNN says it's a nonbiased down the middle straight news organization, even in prime time, when they're clearly not. But other than that, I think the guy is kind of a rat, more of a disgruntled employee. He's not a whistleblower because nothing out there on the tape was illegal.

That was a horrible year he had last year and then he treated the way his whole team and we'll see how he does this year. But he did damage his brand a little bit. Not a lot, but a little bit, because a lot of patriotic Americans didn't like what he had to say, and he can say whatever he wants, but there is consequences to his freedom of speech too. And I assume that he was just trying to make sure that the league makes money and that his teammates make money and that no one rocks the boat. That's what he was trying to do, because he's kind of the ambassador for the NBA. He's not a human rights advocate. But then to say that the guy in Houston, the GM was uneducated or misinformed about what's going on in Hong Kong, that was disrespectful and insulting, because I mean does he know that the Chinese gave the British 100 year lease on Hong Kong after they lost back-to-back opium wars. I mean did he know that that was a promise that they made, they were going to have two systems, one state and they were going to allow in 2020, a phase in of democracy and elections. But the Chinese have reneged on that and are installing their handpicked communist candidates in Hong Kong and are ripping away the actual candidates from Hong Kong's ballots. That's what this is about. And I don't know if he knows about it or not, but he shouldn't say what he said to the GM."

So, him telling us to be more thoughtful is a little strange. The bigger point is that celebrities are outspoken when there's no skin in the game. Right. They'll condemn religious bakers, right. Or someone who doesn't want a gender-neutral bathroom. You get rewarded for that on media and in social media, but when there's skin in the game, when there's money to be make, when you have a billion dollar contract or you have a fear of being called intolerant then there is a strange silence over the execution of gays or imprisonment over art or freedom of expression or honor killings for dating the wrong person.

It was just done really sloppily and horribly and there's obviously a firestorm from it. But he was basically saying, look, just wait a week, you're in Japan right now. There are guys that are still in China. He was trying to say, I think that I understand the censorship that could occur. These guys could literally knock on the door and hold our guys hostage because of how state run, and dictatorial China is. So, I see that element. I think as citizens and patriots here, as you said earlier, the one thing that we can export is liberty and freedom. So, the thought that someone would be either the hold hostage to their business interests in China or that we don't include that in the conversation when something as fundamental as liberty is on the table then that's an issue. Final point, I was part of NFL China launch in the late 2000s, which obviously failed. It totally failed. No one wanted football over there, but they love basketball and it's a big deal over there and there's a lot of more complicated business interests that if we had issues, I mean let's look where our phones are made."

He's talking about the business or is what Emily was saying the fact that you had teams on the ground there, but even from a business point of view wouldn't it be - it might be in your short-term interest to say nothing, but in long-term, I think social justice has proven to be good business for American companies.

So, Jesse said that he doesn't consider - LeBron James doesn't consider himself a human rights advocate, but he does consider himself a social justice warrior. So, social justice for who and is it for your fans? The NBA has all the power. They held all the cards right now and they basically played the worst possible hand. They lost everything. And people in Hong Kong, they won't forget this and maybe it doesn't matter to LeBron James. He's a billionaire, he doesn't necessarily matter. He doesn't seem to understand why people are mad. That's what I think is the most troubling thing. Like if you don't really understand them, what are we fighting for? You seem to understand him when Colin Kaepernick is doing it, but you don't for other people around the world. That doesn't make sense. The other thing is, he's trying to like, figure out a way to get around or maybe you shouldn't tweet. No actually, no, we actually have free speech too. And don't tell me what I can or cannot tweet and there might be consequences that a business owner wants to take. Right we talked about that when it came to Colin Kaepernick as well with Nike.

Seeing mom in costumes in front of classmates however didn't go over well with her four boys when she started doing this six years ago. But now, the kids are dressing up with her.
