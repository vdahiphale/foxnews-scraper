I point to you and tell my kids, anything is possible. Just look at that guy.\"  Well, anything I can do to help the kids. My own kids wrote that.  Anyway, more tweets: \"Well, Cavuto just came on the tube. Time to watch 'Dallas' or 'Lost' on Amazon flick channel. I can't stand the guy's attitude.\" You're watching \"Dallas\"? All right, that's neither here nor there. That's what I'm thinking.  This was one of my favorite, though.

They were pretty serious about that.  All right, we are back.  I want to thank Charles and Sandra and David Asman and all the others who were here in my absence on both my shows, on my weekend show, all great people. But I'm still alive. All right, still alive, apparently, is infrastructure on Capitol Hill. But here's the deal. They're still miles apart on this thing. It is still very expensive when they talk about how they're going to ultimately get it done.   We're going to talk to Senator John Barrasso, the GOP Conference chair, on where this is going, because they're narrowing the difference a little bit, but they're still, still miles apart. Let's get the read from Blake Burman at the White House, where things stand right now.  No one complains about Blake, by the way. They love Blake -- Blake.",

That is important, Neil, because the White House has come down to $1.7 trillion, but they want to pay for an infrastructure package by raising the corporate tax rate. So, earlier today, I asked the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, if the White House would accept a proposal in which the tax code is not changed. Listen here.",

In the House, there's maybe that two/three-vote threshold the Democrats have. There's something like a dozen Democrats who want that as a part of the package. The White House doesn't necessarily want it as a part of the package. So you have got that issue in the House. And then, in the Senate, the corporate tax rate, 28 percent is what the president wants to raise it to.  But all you have to look toward is Joe Manchin, who says, for example, just one senator, that he doesn't want to go all the way up to 28 percent. So, even if the Democrats say, you know what, we tried, we negotiated, we're going to go at this alone, and use reconciliation, which is what they did for the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package, no guarantee, Neil, that they have the votes to go at it alone and be successful potentially this time around.",

There's $700 billion in this last COVID so-called relief package which had very little to do with coronavirus, $700 billion that's not even supposed to get sent out until 2022 and beyond.

They have more regulations, more demands, more mandates, which just add to the cost of getting the job done, so you get less bang for the buck. So, we're going to come back with a proposal that's focused on core infrastructure, things that the American people think of as infrastructure.

And that is Elizabeth Warren's plan to or hopes to really beef up the budget, triple it to more than $30 billion. She wants to go after those who are maybe not paying all their taxes.

And this is an issue of financial privacy. The -- you mentioned the budget impact of this, which would be tens of billions of dollars. I believe the Biden plan would cost $80 billion in terms of just beefing up the IRS. Look, I think the American people just want a simple tax plan. I go back to Steve Forbes. If you had a simple flat tax, got rid of all the deductions, all the loopholes, all the carve-outs that the lobbyists have put in the code, we could have very simple plan with a fairly low rate, raise as much money as we do today.

When you add all of this complexity, I mean, we have tens and tens of thousands of pages of IRS regulation and code. A lot of the uncollected taxes is people can't figure out the tax system. Again, making it simple and easy, I think, would be by far the best way to make the tax system collect more revenue. People will comply with the code if they think they think it is fair. A lot of Americans don't. I want to make one other point about this, Neil. It used to be that liberals cared about issues of civil liberties. And the -- what you will have is government agents looking into every single aspect of your private life. There have been abuses at the IRS for decades, for decades, going back to Nixon and before that, using the IRS tax code to harass political enemies and so on.

In fact, the people in Chattanooga have been told they're going to have to see more school students coming in, they're going to have to accommodate these people that are going to be moving into the school system. But we don't know the numbers. We don't know who. We don't know what grades. How do you plan in that environment? What do the hospitals do? Are they going to be overwhelmed again with these people coming into the system? And law enforcement, again, is going to have to deal with this. I talk with sheriffs every day in my home state. And the crisis at the border -- and, again, make no mistake, this is a part and product of the border crisis that the Biden administration precipitated back in January. I warned then that this would happen. And that's -- this is exactly what's happening. We're seeing more flow of illegal drugs, more human trafficking. Our law enforcement is being overwhelmed in Tennessee. And we have had more deaths from fentanyl poisoning since this border crisis has occurred. That's why I went down to Guatemala and Mexico three weeks ago now, Neil, to get to the bottom of this. And the Biden administration has yet to send Kamala Harris there.",

If you listened to Senator Roger Wicker up on Capitol Hill today, he suggested that it could be in the area of about a trillion dollars to be paid for by keeping the corporate tax structure in place and maybe using unspent COVID funds is what some Republicans are talking about. That is important, Neil, because the White House has come down to $1.7 trillion, but they want to pay for an infrastructure package by raising the corporate tax rate. So, earlier today, I asked the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, if the White House would accept a proposal in which the tax code is not changed. Listen here."

When you look at the House, there are Democrats in the House who want the SALT cap repeal, that having to do with your taxes. In the House, there's maybe that two/three-vote threshold the Democrats have. There's something like a dozen Democrats who want that as a part of the package. The White House doesn't necessarily want it as a part of the package. So you have got that issue in the House. And then, in the Senate, the corporate tax rate, 28 percent is what the president wants to raise it to. But all you have to look toward is Joe Manchin, who says, for example, just one senator, that he doesn't want to go all the way up to 28 percent. So, even if the Democrats say, you know what, we tried, we negotiated, we're going to go at this alone, and use reconciliation, which is what they did for the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package, no guarantee, Neil, that they have the votes to go at it alone and be successful potentially this time around."

Republicans are going to come back with an offer that's going to focus on things that the American people think of as traditional infrastructure, physical infrastructure, roads, bridges, ports, airports, waterways, broadband, the things that make a difference in people's lives and will help get this economy moving forward."

Do this with money that has been approved, but not yet spent. There's $700 billion in this last COVID so-called relief package which had very little to do with coronavirus, $700 billion that's not even supposed to get sent out until 2022 and beyond.

We know what works. The other thing that we're dealing with the Democrats is, they don't want any of the regulatory relief that we think is necessary from the standpoint of being able to build things better and faster and cheaper and smarter. They have more regulations, more demands, more mandates, which just add to the cost of getting the job done, so you get less bang for the buck. So, we're going to come back with a proposal that's focused on core infrastructure, things that the American people think of as infrastructure. And we're leaving out the social spending, the tax credits for electric vehicles, over $100 billion there, so-called climate justice.

And that is Elizabeth Warren's plan to or hopes to really beef up the budget, triple it to more than $30 billion. She wants to go after those who are maybe not paying all their taxes. One interesting feature of that would require banks to report account flows of wealthy clients. This goes far beyond what President Biden has been offering to beef up the budget for IRS. What do you think?"

I mean, 100,000 is a medium-sized city in America. So, I don't think the American people are too eager to see 100,000 people snooping into their tax records. And this is an issue of financial privacy. The -- you mentioned the budget impact of this, which would be tens of billions of dollars. I believe the Biden plan would cost $80 billion in terms of just beefing up the IRS. Look, I think the American people just want a simple tax plan. I go back to Steve Forbes. If you had a simple flat tax, got rid of all the deductions, all the loopholes, all the carve-outs that the lobbyists have put in the code, we could have very simple plan with a fairly low rate, raise as much money as we do today. And you wouldn't need another 100,000 IRS agents."

But that being said, I'm curious as to what you make of the administration's effort, and really coupling it with what Elizabeth Warren wants to do to target the rich, because she is all but saying they're the ones dodging the tax man, they're the ones that should be penalized. In fact, she carves out extra penalties for those who earn over $2 million. What do you make of that approach?"

      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "Look, the higher you raise the tax rate, the higher the incentive to cheat on taxes. Our system -- I mean, we have we have said this for 100 years. Our system is really based on voluntary compliance, Americans voluntarily complying with the IRS tax code. And they do that when they view the system is fair and simple, and they're paying what they owe, and the guy next to him is paying what they owe. When you add all of this complexity, I mean, we have tens and tens of thousands of pages of IRS regulation and code. A lot of the uncollected taxes is people can't figure out the tax system. Again, making it simple and easy, I think, would be by far the best way to make the tax system collect more revenue. People will comply with the code if they think they think it is fair. A lot of Americans don't. I want to make one other point about this, Neil. It used to be that liberals cared about issues of civil liberties. And the -- what you will have is government agents looking into every single aspect of your private life. There have been abuses at the IRS for decades, for decades, going back to Nixon and before that, using the IRS tax code to harass political enemies and so on. I'm not too comfortable with the idea of giving the IRS $30 billion more money to do that."

That project helped build a library of 15,000 bat samples; 400 new coronaviruses were discovered, including one that had a 96 percent match to COVID-19. And lawmakers today wanted to know if the Wuhan lab could have been using this bat library of viruses to try to engineer one of them to be more dangerous and more contagious, something called gain of function research."

And they're just like the one that is in Wuhan. And so I believe, with what we now know, that a couple of technicians seem to have gotten sick very early on in January or even before, in December of 2019, that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is likely the source, because this gain of function research, which you just -- which one of your correspondents just discussed, is very, very serious stuff.

And there's a -- and there are a great many ways in order to accomplish what the left is saying they want. But that isn't really what they want. And that is, if you take law enforcement, and you train officers properly, you compensate officers properly, you treat officers properly, they will then, in turn, be able to effectively police. And that's all everybody wants, and yet we're not hearing that. All we're hearing is, let's take away qualified immunity. Let's make it easier to prosecute.

We're seeing this in every city in America. Forty police officers have given their life, have been murdered in the line of duty just since January 1, 40 cops. Now, you don't see any of those families getting invited to the Biden White House, do you? And this is another part of the disrespect that this administration is showing the American law enforcement officer. You're absolutely right. Crime is what should be focused on. But it's not.

Senator, do we know at this point how many of these youths have gone into Tennessee, been located, relocated in Tennessee, not just the ones who might be flying over Tennessee? Do we know any numbers?"

      "utterance": "Neil, it's great to be on with you. And the answer is, no, we don't at this point. I'm pushing hard for transparency on this. And the Biden administration is blocking us. You notice that they move these planes in, in the dead of night. They're coming in both by commercial airlines, as well as private air. And the planes that we have we found out about at least are landing after midnight. They're dispersing the people that are coming in. We hear they're unaccompanied minors. They could be adults. We're asking these questions right now. Are these people vaccinated? Have they been vetted? What sort of people are moving through the state? What sort of people are residing and staying in the state? These are questions that need to be answered. You mentioned the governor's response to the Biden administration when they reached out and asked for permission. He said he wasn't ready to accept these people. They are an illegal entry into the United States. They have not properly -- we don't know that they have been properly vetted, nor do we know what type of health crisis that they might present. Certainly, we need to know, because this is going to overcrowd our schools. It's going to overwhelm our hospitals. It's going to overtax our public safety. We have got an important right to know what the Biden administration is doing with these people that they're moving into our state."

    {
      "speaker": "HAGERTY",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is not harmful or divisive. This is responsible. We need to know who's moving into our cities. We need to be able to plan for this. We need to be able to address it. I mean, what do you say to the suburban household whose kids are already in an overcrowded school situation? How do we accommodate this? In fact, the people in Chattanooga have been told they're going to have to see more school students coming in, they're going to have to accommodate these people that are going to be moving into the school system. But we don't know the numbers. We don't know who. We don't know what grades. How do you plan in that environment? What do the hospitals do? Are they going to be overwhelmed again with these people coming into the system? And law enforcement, again, is going to have to deal with this. I talk with sheriffs every day in my home state. And the crisis at the border -- and, again, make no mistake, this is a part and product of the border crisis that the Biden administration precipitated back in January. I warned then that this would happen. And that's -- this is exactly what's happening. We're seeing more flow of illegal drugs, more human trafficking. Our law enforcement is being overwhelmed in Tennessee. And we have had more deaths from fentanyl poisoning since this border crisis has occurred. That's why I went down to Guatemala and Mexico three weeks ago now, Neil, to get to the bottom of this. And the Biden administration has yet to send Kamala Harris there."

In the meantime, keeping an eye on when it comes to home sales. They're doing just fine, thank you. But now we have finally hit that point where some of these homes are getting so expensive, they're not selling as quickly as they were, if they're selling at all. We will explain -- after this."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

The total regulations on a new home is right around $94,000. That's about a quarter of the cost of an average new home. So, you have that increasing over the last five years, Neil, and you have the immediate problem of extremely high material costs all converging at the same time."

In the meantime, following the great reopening in America, with cruise lines saying they're ready to get back to business and get you on the water and concert promoters saying they're doing the same.

I'm not going to hold a grudge here, but it's a sure sign as any that people have an itch to get outside and there are plenty of opportunities. Mike Gunzelman, the Internet radio host sensation, Kat Timpf, the FOX News contributor, \"Sincerely Kat,\" newly married, by the way, I might point out. Great to have both of you guys.

And I think, sometimes, people forget that the live event and concert industry got absolutely decimated the last 14 months. It's estimated $30 billion was lost in revenue for it. So, it's not the Roaring '20s anymore. It's the roaring 2020s. And it's happening. Garth Brooks, for example, announced a huge stadium tour, 60,000, 70,000 people happening in July.
