There is anxiety in Democratic circles about, even though they don't like the Arizona law, they wish the federal government hadn't sued, which inflames the issue.  Inflaming the issue might help, and in some cases should motivate the Hispanic base of the Democratic Party and turnout. On the other hand, at least in the mountain west, this law is popular and nationally it's pretty popular. However, the politics of this are more complicated than at first glance. In California, western states, big Hispanic population, you have Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor running Spanish language billboard ads saying \"I'm against the Arizona law and it would have been against proposition 187,\" the famous anti-immigrant or perceived that way, California law.   In Texas, 30 percent Hispanic population, the race for governor between the incumbent Rick Perry and the former mayor of Houston Bill White has closed. Many people think it's a Hispanic backlash. It is a little complicated.  In some places the Democrats are definitely going to be hurt by this. Certainly in Arizona there are three Democratic congressional incumbents that will be hurt, but it's not true across the board.",

It was all left out. Holder explains it and he says it's because a stronger case is the one on narrow federal grounds, that it is the exclusive province of the federal government. If that is the strongest case, he has a weak case, because it's very hard to argue that this as he does in the lawsuit that Arizona is weakening the federal government ability to enforce immigration law. If anything it is adding the state institution as auxiliary of federal government enforcement. So it's a weak case.   I think he knows if he did it on a civil rights basis it would go nowhere. The law explicitly excludes the use of race as a criteria in stopping people. I think he knows he has a weak hand. He did this, as Mara indicates, as a way to strengthen the base in a base election.

Meg Whitman can take the administration that the Obama administration is bad and California doesn't need this law. Federal candidates, people running for Congress, House and Senate, are they going to defend the Obama administration swooping down? There are millions of state enforcement and immigration law. On the book, there were laws in Arizona that had had lawsuits filed by the governor.  Doesn't San Francisco refuse to enforce the immigration laws? Where is Eric Holder Justice Department swooping down and saying this is an outrage, you can't have different laws in San Francisco than you have in Orange County.

      "utterance": "For the federal government to challenge this law on the basis that it has preempted the area and therefore the state of Arizona needs to butt out I think is wrong. It would be one thing if the federal government had controlled the border already, but it hasn't."

They are going to take a look at that as well. Meantime, some Democratic governors are criticizing the administration's effort here. Tennessee's Democratic governor Phil Bredesen says voters want to hear about job creation, and he called this potential political effect toxic. Colorado's Democratic governor Bill Ritter also expressed anxiety about this. What about the politics of this and the policy? We’re back with the panel. Mara?"

      "utterance": "Both of the governors are retiring so they are free to say what they think. There is anxiety in Democratic circles about, even though they don't like the Arizona law, they wish the federal government hadn't sued, which inflames the issue.  Inflaming the issue might help, and in some cases should motivate the Hispanic base of the Democratic Party and turnout. On the other hand, at least in the mountain west, this law is popular and nationally it's pretty popular. However, the politics of this are more complicated than at first glance. In California, western states, big Hispanic population, you have Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor running Spanish language billboard ads saying \"I'm against the Arizona law and it would have been against proposition 187,\" the famous anti-immigrant or perceived that way, California law. In Texas, 30 percent Hispanic population, the race for governor between the incumbent Rick Perry and the former mayor of Houston Bill White has closed. Many people think it's a Hispanic backlash. It is a little complicated. In some places the Democrats are definitely going to be hurt by this. Certainly in Arizona there are three Democratic congressional incumbents that will be hurt, but it's not true across the board."

Charles, what about the attorney general's phrasing of this, saying they wanted to challenge it the best way they could, but he might go back at it if and when the law goes into effect, essentially if he loses?"

      "utterance": "Well, it was the first administration explanation of why after weeks of complaining about the law exclusively on the grounds of it being violation of civil rights and perhaps involving invidious racial discrimination, there was not a word of that if the lawsuit. It was all left out. Holder explains it and he says it's because a stronger case is the one on narrow federal grounds, that it is the exclusive province of the federal government. If that is the strongest case, he has a weak case, because it's very hard to argue that this as he does in the lawsuit that Arizona is weakening the federal government ability to enforce immigration law. If anything it is adding the state institution as auxiliary of federal government enforcement. So it's a weak case. I think he knows if he did it on a civil rights basis it would go nowhere. The law explicitly excludes the use of race as a criteria in stopping people. I think he knows he has a weak hand. He did this, as Mara indicates, as a way to strengthen the base in a base election. But overall I think it will hurt them. The majority of the Americans are against the lawsuit."

      "utterance": "Candidates can make decisions based on where they're running know it's bad. If you run for federal office, you are citing two gubernatorial races. In my state, I don't think it's necessary. That is what Meg Whitman is saying. It does not hurt Meg Whitman the fact that the Obama administration is suing Arizona. Meg Whitman can take the administration that the Obama administration is bad and California doesn't need this law. Federal candidates, people running for Congress, House and Senate, are they going to defend the Obama administration swooping down? There are millions of state enforcement and immigration law. On the book, there were laws in Arizona that had had lawsuits filed by the governor. Doesn't San Francisco refuse to enforce the immigration laws? Where is Eric Holder Justice Department swooping down and saying this is an outrage, you can't have different laws in San Francisco than you have in Orange County. In most areas of law there is complementary state and local and federal enforcement. The idea that the Justice Department comes down and goes to federal judge to overturn what the voters of Arizona, legislature and governor want in Arizona will not play well."

It is controlling the border better than it has in the past. There are more boots on the ground there. Crime is down, and actually illegal immigration is down, too. That is a matter of debate.
