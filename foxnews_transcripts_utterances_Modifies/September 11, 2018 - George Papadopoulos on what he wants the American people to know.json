      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Today did mark the 70th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 attacks on this country. This morning, President Trump, he visited Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a new monument has been erected for those brave passengers, the crew of Flight 93. Remember, let's roll?  They fought back, ultimately crashing that plane into a remote field. And coming up tonight, we will show you the president's powerful remarks earlier in Pennsylvania.  And it is the sixth anniversary of what was the horrific Benghazi terror attack and Obama is trying to say, oh, that was a conspiracy. It didn't go down the way we know.  He's trying to rewrite history. We have the evidence. In a few minutes, we'll respond to the former president, a Hannity mini-monologue. Also, a new low if it's possible for liberal \"Morning Joe\" Scarborough. He used today's somber anniversary to call Trump's presidency worse than the 9/11 attacks. We will respond to MSNBC's pathetic morning show host.  Also tonight, major breaking news surrounding the deep state. We now have tonight just uncovered literally about an hour ago, brand-new text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. We were right, and I look like yes, high- ranking officials in the DOJ and FBI worked together to leak false Russian information to you, the American people to destroy then-President Trump, like they did before the election with the phony FISA. You're going to see these damning new texts. And only 56 days to go until the most important midterm in your life, and I do have an urgent warning to you. Come November, everything is at stake.  All of that, plus Eric Trump joins us in a few minutes and I have an exclusive interview with George Papadopoulos and his wife Simona. But that's coming up later.   First, tonight's breaking news opening monologue.",

All told, 2,977 innocent men and women and children lost their lives at the hands of pure evil in our lifetime, fulfilling what they think is there evil ideology designed by evil man by the name of Osama bin Laden.   Now, some of the finest people on earth were senselessly killed. Good, hardworking people in the World Trade Center, first responders, police, over 300 firemen. While everybody was washing down, they rushed into those burning towers. Many others in the Pentagon, the passengers, the crew of the planes that were brutally hijacked and used as weapons of war, including the brave men and women on Flight 93, they fought back against their attackers -- let's roll -- causing that plane to crash in a remote field in Pennsylvania, miles away from what we believe was their intended target in Washington, D.C. Today, President Trump visited a brand-new monument honoring those brave American souls and he delivered these powerful remarks. Let's take a look.",

Meanwhile, one particularly unhinged -- while MSNBC conspiracy TV morning host seems to have really forgotten just how devastating 9/11/2001 was. Yes, good old liberal Joe put out a new op-ed. He put it in \"The Washington Post.\" It's entitled: Trump is harming the dream of America more than any foreign adversary ever could.  Yesterday, the day before 9/11, literally, he's promoting this absurd article and he sends out a tweet that reads, quote: My latest, Trump is damaging the dream of America more than any terrorist attack ever could.  And according to the tweet and that op-ed, Joe Scarborough thinks Trump is worse than 9/11 where we lost nearly 3,000 people. Yes, the economy has turned around, Joe. People have jobs. Four million fewer people on food stamps, 4 million new jobs are created. Really? That's how low you're going to sink?  You know, sometimes, I literally hang -- there is no net underneath me right now. This is a live show. I do three hours of live radio every day.   Sometimes you can say things and they come out wrong. As Congress would say, revise, extend our remarks. Some things can be unintentional, slip of the tongue. This was thought-out written piece.

And after facing much backlash for his absurd comparison, liberal Joe, he partially tried to backtrack as well thought out, quote, column and said he should have shown more care and wording his tweet. And then his blushing bride-to-be, fellow host Mika Brzezinski, vigorously defends him on Twitter.  Of course, America's, you know, cutest couple. Joe and Mika perfect example of what happens when Trump derangement syndrome gets way out of control. At this point, I don't even think these two can ever recover. It's that sick. We'll deal more with this later but we now have some very important breaking news tonight. Literally minutes ago, Sara Carter handed us brand- new never before seen, unearthed text once again between FBI love birds Strzok and Page. Why don't they just hand them all over? In September 2016, months before the election, it appears Strzok and Page were working, or contributing to an op-ed about Russian election interference. Look at your screen right there, September 2nd. Lisa Page asked Strzok, quote, we are still writing the op-ed, yes? Strzok then responds: yes-ish.   And on September 5th, 2016, \"The Washington Post,\" they published a story about Russian interference on the very same day. Sara Carter reporting tonight the former FBI lovebirds share a link to an article. And Strzok writes: just read the article. We say a lot of the same things. I guess that's OK.  And then Page writes back, quote: Yes, but that's why ours is going to need to be more folksy, so it's not like a news article. Maybe like more smelly Walmart people-ish. Strzok had said that. And these new text released yesterday from Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, you have a pretty clear picture of what's going on, including this text from Strzok to Page, it took place on April 10th, 2017, reading, quote: I had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you what I want to talk to you about. Media leak strategy with the DOJ before you go. Oh, FBI and DOJ colluding.  And then two days later on April 12th, Strzok warned Lisa Page that the two damning articles were coming out about her namesake, Carter Page and then on April 22nd, we originally believed this was on April 12th, Meadow's office corrected that earlier today, same point though. Peter Strzok told Lisa Page, quote, article is out, well done, Page.  This is what we have now been telling you, what is a coordinated effort, the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ leaking anti-Trump information before the election, after the election, to the press first to stop them from becoming president and then to destroy his presidency. But sneaky Peter Strzok, he's now trying to actually put out his own conniving spin on this fresh new scandal. His attorney says: The term media leak strategy in Mr. Trump's text refers to a department-wide initiative to detect and stop leaks to the media. The president and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American people.  Oh, but our words sound exactly alike. We are going to have to make it more folksy. Don't insult our intelligence. This is the same Peter Strzok who claimed under oath that political bias didn't impact his work as an FBI agent. But Hillary should win 100 million to nothing.   Now, the same super patriot who played a critical role in exonerating Hillary Clinton -- we know she committed felonies and fomenting this witch hunt from the get-go against go against Donald Trump while trashing him on his work phone, openly wishing Hillary would win the election.  How could anyone vote for Trump? I just was in a Walmart. Smelly Walmart people were there, I could smell the Trump supporters. And earlier today, the president responded on Twitter, quote: So terrible, nothing being done at the DOJ or FBI, but the world is watching. And they get it completely. We did reach out to Strzok, Page and the DOJ, we have yet to get a response. We'll have more on these breaking news developments. Sarah and Greg will join us in a few minutes.   But we shift our focus to what is the most in important midterm election of your life. Now, I'm going to say this for the next 56 days. Last night, I called on you to wake up, pay attention. Republicans, to be very blunt because I only tell you the truth, they are in real danger of losing the House of Representatives. And the Senate? I'm not that comfortable about that either. Look at your screen. If that is your district, you will likely decide the fate of this country in 56 days. Democrats win these races, the Trump agenda will be stopped. It will halt right in its tracks.   All the progress we've been telling you about, the Democrats, their insane quest for impeachment will begin in earnest. Just listen to Chuck and Maxine Waters.  The Senate? Frankly also up for grabs. Republicans lose the Senate, you can forget about constitutionalist judges getting confirmed. It won't happen. And meanwhile, right here on this program, we have long warned that it's only a matter of time before the aggressive threatening rhetoric and tactics coming from the left is going to result, somebody is going to get hurt or killed. Here's kind of what I'm talking about. Take a look.",

It never heard of him before but he is running as a Republican in California's 25th district.  And guess what? He was approached at a campaign booth by a man who is making disparaging remarks about the Republican Party. Well, that deranged individual then pulls out a switchblade and attempted to stab Peters but the knife thankfully malfunctioned and then they had a confrontation.  I've said it a million times before and I'll say it again, the tactics of the anti-Trump resistance have gone way too far and while Peters was able to escape unharmed, and I always blame people for what they do, you can't blame people's rhetoric for what people's actions are, but you've got to admit this is not helping.

No helicopters made it to Benghazi, no marines were sent to the rescue. Everybody knew they were under fire. And on Friday, last week, President Obama called his administration's deadly failure to act, subsequent apparent cover-up nothing more a crazy GOP-led to conspiracy theory. That is the subject of tonight's mini monologue to Obama. It is too a day we can't forget, that is September 11th 2012, the U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, I've met his family, CIA contractors Ty Woods, another great family, Glen Doherty, they were all murdered. Some of them big heroes in all of this. This was a well-coordinated assault. Dozens of heavily armed radical Islamic militants against U.S. diplomatic position in Benghazi. They used automatic rifles, they used grenades, they used RPGs and other military style weapons. Within an hour the Obama administration officials, they were briefed about this attack. U.S. surveillance drone was even sending back live footage. The State Department notified the administration that a radical Islamic terrorist group named Al-Sharia, Ansar al-Sharia was responsible. The militants, they quickly overran the lightly guarded main U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi and set fire to the ambassador's quarters. Under heavy fire. By the way, that Ambassador -- Ambassador Stevens had requested many times of Secretary of State Clinton in her office that they get reinforcements. They were denied. Many Americans managed to thankfully evacuate because there was a nearby CIA outpost which was subsequently attacked multiple waves of Jihadists. This all occurred over the course of 13 long hours. Right here on this program I had the privilege of interviewing the brave men and women who were told to stand down, not help, put their careers on the line and saved literally dozens and dozens of lives and two of them you saw lost their life and they told the truth about what happened that night.

They just happen to have RPGs in their back pocket. Now, of course Obama knew that this was just the opposite. This blatant cover-up just one small part of the Benghazi scandal and more importantly, why was there a lightly armed diplomatic post in a failed state overrun with terrorists where the U.N. had left, Great Britain had left? Why were reinforcements not immediately sent from across the Mediterranean? Why was this assault allowed to continue for 13 long excruciating hours?

This morning, President Trump, he visited Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a new monument has been erected for those brave passengers, the crew of Flight 93. Remember, let's roll? They fought back, ultimately crashing that plane into a remote field. And coming up tonight, we will show you the president's powerful remarks earlier in Pennsylvania. And it is the sixth anniversary of what was the horrific Benghazi terror attack and Obama is trying to say, oh, that was a conspiracy. It didn't go down the way we know. He's trying to rewrite history. We have the evidence. In a few minutes, we'll respond to the former president, a Hannity mini-monologue. Also, a new low if it's possible for liberal \"Morning Joe\" Scarborough. He used today's somber anniversary to call Trump's presidency worse than the 9/11 attacks. We will respond to MSNBC's pathetic morning show host. Also tonight, major breaking news surrounding the deep state. We now have tonight just uncovered literally about an hour ago, brand-new text between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. We were right, and I look like yes, high- ranking officials in the DOJ and FBI worked together to leak false Russian information to you, the American people to destroy then-President Trump, like they did before the election with the phony FISA. You're going to see these damning new texts. And only 56 days to go until the most important midterm in your life, and I do have an urgent warning to you. Come November, everything is at stake. All of that, plus Eric Trump joins us in a few minutes and I have an exclusive interview with George Papadopoulos and his wife Simona. But that's coming up later.

Now, some of the finest people on earth were senselessly killed. Good, hardworking people in the World Trade Center, first responders, police, over 300 firemen. While everybody was washing down, they rushed into those burning towers. Many others in the Pentagon, the passengers, the crew of the planes that were brutally hijacked and used as weapons of war, including the brave men and women on Flight 93, they fought back against their attackers -- let's roll -- causing that plane to crash in a remote field in Pennsylvania, miles away from what we believe was their intended target in Washington, D.C.

We were not at war with them. We better be prepared and we better accept that sad but true reality. Meanwhile, one particularly unhinged -- while MSNBC conspiracy TV morning host seems to have really forgotten just how devastating 9/11/2001 was. Yes, good old liberal Joe put out a new op-ed. He put it in \"The Washington Post.\" It's entitled: Trump is harming the dream of America more than any foreign adversary ever could. Yesterday, the day before 9/11, literally, he's promoting this absurd article and he sends out a tweet that reads, quote: My latest, Trump is damaging the dream of America more than any terrorist attack ever could. And according to the tweet and that op-ed, Joe Scarborough thinks Trump is worse than 9/11 where we lost nearly 3,000 people. Yes, the economy has turned around, Joe. People have jobs. Four million fewer people on food stamps, 4 million new jobs are created. Really? That's how low you're going to sink? You know, sometimes, I literally hang -- there is no net underneath me right now. This is a live show. I do three hours of live radio every day. Sometimes you can say things and they come out wrong. As Congress would say, revise, extend our remarks. Some things can be unintentional, slip of the tongue. This was thought-out written piece.

What he said about majority black countries. That is tearing more at the fabric of America than attacks on the Twin Towers did. We rebuilt from that. We became stronger because of that.

And then his blushing bride-to-be, fellow host Mika Brzezinski, vigorously defends him on Twitter. Of course, America's, you know, cutest couple. Joe and Mika perfect example of what happens when Trump derangement syndrome gets way out of control. At this point, I don't even think these two can ever recover. It's that sick. We'll deal more with this later but we now have some very important breaking news tonight. Literally minutes ago, Sara Carter handed us brand- new never before seen, unearthed text once again between FBI love birds Strzok and Page. Why don't they just hand them all over? In September 2016, months before the election, it appears Strzok and Page were working, or contributing to an op-ed about Russian election interference. Look at your screen right there, September 2nd. Lisa Page asked Strzok, quote, we are still writing the op-ed, yes? Strzok then responds: yes-ish. And on September 5th, 2016, \"The Washington Post,\" they published a story about Russian interference on the very same day. Sara Carter reporting tonight the former FBI lovebirds share a link to an article. And Strzok writes: just read the article. We say a lot of the same things. I guess that's OK."

      "utterance": "Yes, but that's why ours is going to need to be more folksy, so it's not like a news article. Maybe like more smelly Walmart people-ish. Strzok had said that. And these new text released yesterday from Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, you have a pretty clear picture of what's going on, including this text from Strzok to Page, it took place on April 10th, 2017, reading, quote: I had literally just gone to find this phone to tell you what I want to talk to you about. Media leak strategy with the DOJ before you go. Oh, FBI and DOJ colluding. And then two days later on April 12th, Strzok warned Lisa Page that the two damning articles were coming out about her namesake, Carter Page and then on April 22nd, we originally believed this was on April 12th, Meadow's office corrected that earlier today, same point though. Peter Strzok told Lisa Page, quote, article is out, well done, Page. This is what we have now been telling you, what is a coordinated effort, the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ leaking anti-Trump information before the election, after the election, to the press first to stop them from becoming president and then to destroy his presidency."

The president and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American people. Oh, but our words sound exactly alike. We are going to have to make it more folksy. Don't insult our intelligence. This is the same Peter Strzok who claimed under oath that political bias didn't impact his work as an FBI agent. But Hillary should win 100 million to nothing. Now, the same super patriot who played a critical role in exonerating Hillary Clinton -- we know she committed felonies and fomenting this witch hunt from the get-go against go against Donald Trump while trashing him on his work phone, openly wishing Hillary would win the election.

But we shift our focus to what is the most in important midterm election of your life. Now, I'm going to say this for the next 56 days. Last night, I called on you to wake up, pay attention. Republicans, to be very blunt because I only tell you the truth, they are in real danger of losing the House of Representatives. And the Senate? I'm not that comfortable about that either. Look at your screen. If that is your district, you will likely decide the fate of this country in 56 days. Democrats win these races, the Trump agenda will be stopped. It will halt right in its tracks. All the progress we've been telling you about, the Democrats, their insane quest for impeachment will begin in earnest. Just listen to Chuck and Maxine Waters. The Senate? Frankly also up for grabs. Republicans lose the Senate, you can forget about constitutionalist judges getting confirmed. It won't happen. And meanwhile, right here on this program, we have long warned that it's only a matter of time before the aggressive threatening rhetoric and tactics coming from the left is going to result, somebody is going to get hurt or killed.

Over the weekend, well, someone did in fact get in the face of a Republican congressional candidate. The guy's name is Rudy Peters. It never heard of him before but he is running as a Republican in California's 25th district. And guess what? He was approached at a campaign booth by a man who is making disparaging remarks about the Republican Party. Well, that deranged individual then pulls out a switchblade and attempted to stab Peters but the knife thankfully malfunctioned and then they had a confrontation. I've said it a million times before and I'll say it again, the tactics of the anti-Trump resistance have gone way too far and while Peters was able to escape unharmed, and I always blame people for what they do, you can't blame people's rhetoric for what people's actions are, but you've got to admit this is not helping. The next victim might not be so lucky. But if it was a conservative, oh, they go nuts blaming, oh, talk radio and the FOX News Channel. I'm now holding individuals responsible.

Sara, let's go to the news. This just broke within the last hour or so. You've now got new text messages on top of the old text messages. We've got a response from the attorney from Peter Strzok.

There has never been any proof of this. We know now based on these text messages, not only did they use a dossier that was unverified, a dossier that was salacious, one that even Christopher Steele, he wrote himself that it was not verified and now, we are seeing in these text messages that they were shifting the narrative. What's most important here, Sean, is that Congress get to the bottom of this. That is why they are asking Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate this. We need to re-question all of these players, Strzok, Page, Sally Yates, the boss of Bruce Ohr, everyone. Everybody needs to be re-questioned on this and they need to find the answers to these questions because, honestly, it's not looking good for them."

Number two, doesn't he get to decide, Rob Mueller has to go to him and say, I want to subpoena Donald Trump and I went to get him under oath and I want to have a year-long court fight to make him testify before a grand jury? So, if Rod Rosenstein is conflicted in this whole thing, which we now know he is because he signed forth by the FISA warrant, the third renewal, how does that work? And he is a witness in the Comey firing because he wrote the recommendation."

I mean, Rod Rosenstein himself was the one that wrote the letter to recommend the firing of Comey. He wrote the letter to President Trump, so he's either a witness or a co-conspirator. He can't be in charge of this investigation. And another point in fact, Sean, he signed that fourth FISA, and this is why it is imperative that President Trump declassify those documents, declassify the FISA documents that need to be declassified, the \"Gang of Eight\" dossier that they showed it to particular members of Congress, that's very important because that also contains exculpatory information in the Bruce Ohr interviews with the FBI. Once all that information is out, the American people are going to know the truth, and that's why it is so important to hold these people in the DOJ accountable and get those documents declassified."

He's a professor at Link Campus in Rome, which is a partner of the company that's in London. In this company, this university trains secret services agent of western- type intelligence.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "On 9/11, our world changed forever. We'll never forget what happened 17 years ago, but tonight it's also important to remember another date, at 9/11 2012. Four brave Americans lost their lives during what was a horrific assault against a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. For 13 hours no American jets were scrambled near the attack. No helicopters made it to Benghazi, no marines were sent to the rescue. Everybody knew they were under fire. And on Friday, last week, President Obama called his administration's deadly failure to act, subsequent apparent cover-up nothing more a crazy GOP-led to conspiracy theory. That is the subject of tonight's mini monologue to Obama. It is too a day we can't forget, that is September 11th 2012, the U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith, I've met his family, CIA contractors Ty Woods, another great family, Glen Doherty, they were all murdered. Some of them big heroes in all of this. This was a well-coordinated assault. Dozens of heavily armed radical Islamic militants against U.S. diplomatic position in Benghazi. They used automatic rifles, they used grenades, they used RPGs and other military style weapons. Within an hour the Obama administration officials, they were briefed about this attack. U.S. surveillance drone was even sending back live footage. The State Department notified the administration that a radical Islamic terrorist group named Al-Sharia, Ansar al-Sharia was responsible. The militants, they quickly overran the lightly guarded main U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi and set fire to the ambassador's quarters. Under heavy fire. By the way, that Ambassador -- Ambassador Stevens had requested many times of Secretary of State Clinton in her office that they get reinforcements. They were denied. Many Americans managed to thankfully evacuate because there was a nearby CIA outpost which was subsequently attacked multiple waves of Jihadists. This all occurred over the course of 13 long hours. Right here on this program I had the privilege of interviewing the brave men and women who were told to stand down, not help, put their careers on the line and saved literally dozens and dozens of lives and two of them you saw lost their life and they told the truth about what happened that night. Let's listen to those people that were there."

They were used 15 minutes in, and in 10 more minutes, like 25 minutes we were told to wait again. And we're finally back orders. It's hard to maintain your composure, but you do. The full truths weren't being told. That's why we did, and why we are telling the truth right now."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Just the opposite of what Obama said. I guess Obama missed those interviews because on Friday he is trying to rewrite history claiming that his administration's shameful actions are surrounding the Benghazi attacks were nothing more than a Republican-led conspiracy theory. Watch him lie."

      "speaker": "BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "The politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party. This Congress has championed the unwinding of campaign finance laws to give billionaires outside influence over our politics, embraced wild conspiracy theories like those surrounding Benghazi or my birth certificate. Rejected science, rejected facts on things like climate change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So let's help Obama remember the actual crazy conspiracy and what it looks like. Twenty twelve, Susan Rice, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., five days after the Benghazi attacks, the Obama administration book tour on five different Sunday morning shows to lie to you, the American people, saying over and over that the attacks were just an out-of-control protest, a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video. They just happen to have RPGs in their back pocket. Now, of course Obama knew that this was just the opposite. This blatant cover-up just one small part of the Benghazi scandal and more importantly, why was there a lightly armed diplomatic post in a failed state overrun with terrorists where the U.N. had left, Great Britain had left? Why were reinforcements not immediately sent from across the Mediterranean? Why was this assault allowed to continue for 13 long excruciating hours? Then Secretary of State Clinton saying at a congressional hearing at the time if you continue -- you know, she's actually lying also. It's unbelievable. Joining us now, the author of the upcoming book, \"The Deep State,\" Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, author of \"Why We Fight,\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.

Ambassador Stevens on dozens of occasions asked for more protection from Hillary Clinton, secretary of state and the Obama administration, which he was denied. Jason is absolutely right.

Take a look at this, yesterday was the statistical peak of hurricane season and we have four systems we are watching. This one, real quick, I'll tell you if you are in Texas, you're watching this over the next couple of days. We might see something form here while we are talking about Florence. That's obviously the big storm that is getting very close here now towards the Carolinas. We know it is going to make landfall across the Carolinas. We don't know exactly at what point that happens or exactly where that happens but they are tracking the storm, takes it somewhere here Thursday evening into Friday morning. Somewhere along the North Carolina to South Carolina coastline and a lot of indications that it is stall somewhere around here, possibly just offshore, possibly just on shore. We'll have big impacts. We'll certainly going to see the surge in the wind but some spots we'll probably going to see after 30 inches of rain.
