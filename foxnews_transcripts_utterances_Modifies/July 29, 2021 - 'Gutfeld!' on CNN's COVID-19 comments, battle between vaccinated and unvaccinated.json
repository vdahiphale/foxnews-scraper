      "sentences": "How dare you insult roaches like that? Also, what are you doing later? I'm just talking with the producers. Having a good time. Oh, man. Here we go. What a show. Welcome to the world of us versus them where a profit- seeking media creates new targets to replace old ones. The goal is to pit two camps against each other as they back one and demonize another. So, it's like the Yankees versus the Red Sox, Ali versus Frazier, Brian Stelter versus footlong hoagie. The media has done this to the religious, to Republicans, to Trump supporters, the flyover country often pitting their elite activist class above these groups, where they happily punched down like a street thug wailing on an 80-year-old Asian woman. And now they have a new villain. It's when they've demonized knowing it does more harm than no good but it's how they afford the alimony, Geraldo. Yes. The lab created battle in the media octagon is now the vaxxed versus the unvaxxed. Yes, sex and gender can't be binary but the vaccine debate sure can. And this artificial construction. It's the sub intellect rubes who aren't getting vast and the highly intelligent over educated coastal elites who are. But the facts like a hollow point bullet hitting a pumpkin blow holes in their skeevy narrative. So who's not vaxxed? Turns out roughly half the employees at key city public safety agencies in New York. And those aren't Fox viewers. Ms. Behar. Add that to the 50,000 illegal immigrants released into the U.S. but I guess they don't count right because they didn't vote for Trump. The U.S. versus them or the us versus them narrative falls apart even more. When you really look at who's not being vaxxed then they suddenly become Republicans, Democrats, blacks, whites, the poor, the young and the middle class. A group as diverse as Geraldo is ex-wives. And the bi -- and the bifurcation that CNN pushes disappears, much like their audience. And oddly, The New York Times nails it by splitting Americas into -- Americans into five vaccine groups. The enthusiasts, the watchful, the cost anxious, the system to stressors and the skeptics. So when you hear of a system the stressor, you think that has to be a Trumper. Nope. system does stressors think the healthcare system doesn't treat them fairly. According to the Times, most but not all, are people of color and they live in D.C., Maryland in Georgia. So unless you're a figment of Jesse Smollett's imagination. I don't think anyone there runs around screaming MAGA country. Then there's the watchful, these are the wait and see types who check out what friends experience with the vax before getting it. Now if only they spied on their friends for white supremacist tendencies, the FBI would love them. But I get an understand the watchful. It's like me at a party waiting to see if everyone trying Kat's special brownies calls 911. Before I try it myself. So you know where these people live? They dominate in Delaware. Home to our basement-dwelling president who recently accused skeptics of killing people before walking it back. Hope there were no stairs involved. They also live in Rhode Island in Hawaii, not republican holdouts. But islands, we went to a Castaway for comment.",

      "sentences": "You think I was going to leave that out, Geraldo? The .60 percent of American adults have received their first shot, but it has nothing to do with us versus them. It's just that America is made up of individuals who have different reasons for different decisions. But the news prefers groups over individuals in order to create a conflict narrative that helps pay the bills. If Stelter doesn't sell the news, like it's a pro wrestling match, there's no way he could afford pie every night. Which brings us to the COVID skeptics. Why are they skeptical? Well, they believe in alternative theories, and some of them like Anthony Weiner's selfie are mostly just nuts. But others are just anti-government. Thank you. Geraldo just got that. But it's more -- it really is more about the media than anything because who is pushing the vaccine hardest? It's the same people who push collusion and obstruction, the fine people hoax. The myriad of phony scandals that were debunked the next day. They said the world was going to end in eight years. Remember that? These people are more full of crap than a septic tank the day after a Kardashian Thanksgiving. The media also ignored the riots in the destruction of last summer, preferring to chase the fantasies of white supremacy. As COVID exploded in China they focused on impeachment. Yet these same people called you racist for questioning COVID origins smearing millions of Americans who realize there's something fishy, as opposed to batty about gain of function, instead of looking at crime and safety the Press obsessed over identity politics with the same fervor John Hinckley did Jodie Foster. And that distorted reality big time. For example, the number of unarmed black men killed by police, according to The Washington Post was between 12 and 27. Yet nearly half a very liberal Americans think it's between 1000 and 1000. So where did they get that perception from the same dishonest rage machine that brands Americans' murderers for fearing a jab? So maybe before you crap all over Americans and place them in this us versus them prison, examine the role you play in creating this polarity? You'll find that it has nothing to do with health and everything to do with looking for a fight.",

A coalition of concerned parents is nearing the number of signatures required to recall three members of their inept far-left school board. If successful, this initiative would join a recall of California Governor Gavin Newsom, and possibly San Francisco D.A. Chesa Boudin. I haven't seen this many recalls since I saw sold those edible lawn darts. Parents cite three main objections, the board members lowering of admission standards, poor management of the COVID crisis, and an obsession with dividing the community by race and victim status. The board also decided to focus on renaming schools instead of reopening them. And like all bad left the idea, its hit minority and low income families the hardest. 69 percent of the parents backed the recall with particular support from Asian Americans, especially after school board Commissioner Alison Collins tweeted racist remarks about the Asian community, then had the nerve to sue the district for violating her First Amendment rights. So, here's some free speech for the comm-ish and her fellow recallees, you suck. Your arrogance and incompetence or hurting kids and parents aren't going to take it anymore. But it's like my dad once said, we never know the love of a parent until we become parents ourselves. I still remember him saying that as we left him in the woods.

      "utterance": "How dare you insult roaches like that? Also, what are you doing later? I'm just talking with the producers. Having a good time. Oh, man. Here we go. What a show. Welcome to the world of us versus them where a profit- seeking media creates new targets to replace old ones. The goal is to pit two camps against each other as they back one and demonize another. So, it's like the Yankees versus the Red Sox, Ali versus Frazier, Brian Stelter versus footlong hoagie. The media has done this to the religious, to Republicans, to Trump supporters, the flyover country often pitting their elite activist class above these groups, where they happily punched down like a street thug wailing on an 80-year-old Asian woman. And now they have a new villain. It's when they've demonized knowing it does more harm than no good but it's how they afford the alimony, Geraldo. Yes. The lab created battle in the media octagon is now the vaxxed versus the unvaxxed. Yes, sex and gender can't be binary but the vaccine debate sure can. And this artificial construction. It's the sub intellect rubes who aren't getting vast and the highly intelligent over educated coastal elites who are. But the facts like a hollow point bullet hitting a pumpkin blow holes in their skeevy narrative. So who's not vaxxed? Turns out roughly half the employees at key city public safety agencies in New York. And those aren't Fox viewers. Ms. Behar. Add that to the 50,000 illegal immigrants released into the U.S. but I guess they don't count right because they didn't vote for Trump. The U.S. versus them or the us versus them narrative falls apart even more. When you really look at who's not being vaxxed then they suddenly become Republicans, Democrats, blacks, whites, the poor, the young and the middle class. A group as diverse as Geraldo is ex-wives. And the bi -- and the bifurcation that CNN pushes disappears, much like their audience. And oddly, The New York Times nails it by splitting Americas into -- Americans into five vaccine groups. The enthusiasts, the watchful, the cost anxious, the system to stressors and the skeptics. So when you hear of a system the stressor, you think that has to be a Trumper. Nope. system does stressors think the healthcare system doesn't treat them fairly. According to the Times, most but not all, are people of color and they live in D.C., Maryland in Georgia. So unless you're a figment of Jesse Smollett's imagination. I don't think anyone there runs around screaming MAGA country. Then there's the watchful, these are the wait and see types who check out what friends experience with the vax before getting it. Now if only they spied on their friends for white supremacist tendencies, the FBI would love them. But I get an understand the watchful. It's like me at a party waiting to see if everyone trying Kat's special brownies calls 911. Before I try it myself. So you know where these people live? They dominate in Delaware. Home to our basement-dwelling president who recently accused skeptics of killing people before walking it back. Hope there were no stairs involved. They also live in Rhode Island in Hawaii, not republican holdouts. But islands, we went to a Castaway for comment."

      "utterance": "You think I was going to leave that out, Geraldo? The .60 percent of American adults have received their first shot, but it has nothing to do with us versus them. It's just that America is made up of individuals who have different reasons for different decisions. But the news prefers groups over individuals in order to create a conflict narrative that helps pay the bills. If Stelter doesn't sell the news, like it's a pro wrestling match, there's no way he could afford pie every night. Which brings us to the COVID skeptics. Why are they skeptical? Well, they believe in alternative theories, and some of them like Anthony Weiner's selfie are mostly just nuts. But others are just anti-government. Thank you. Geraldo just got that. But it's more -- it really is more about the media than anything because who is pushing the vaccine hardest? It's the same people who push collusion and obstruction, the fine people hoax. The myriad of phony scandals that were debunked the next day. They said the world was going to end in eight years. Remember that? These people are more full of crap than a septic tank the day after a Kardashian Thanksgiving. The media also ignored the riots in the destruction of last summer, preferring to chase the fantasies of white supremacy. As COVID exploded in China they focused on impeachment. Yet these same people called you racist for questioning COVID origins smearing millions of Americans who realize there's something fishy, as opposed to batty about gain of function, instead of looking at crime and safety the Press obsessed over identity politics with the same fervor John Hinckley did Jodie Foster. And that distorted reality big time. For example, the number of unarmed black men killed by police, according to The Washington Post was between 12 and 27. Yet nearly half a very liberal Americans think it's between 1000 and 1000. So where did they get that perception from the same dishonest rage machine that brands Americans' murderers for fearing a jab? So maybe before you crap all over Americans and place them in this us versus them prison, examine the role you play in creating this polarity? You'll find that it has nothing to do with health and everything to do with looking for a fight."

And in the most recent study available on political affiliations of journalists, the percentage of full time U.S. journalists who claim to be Republican is 7.1 percent.

If successful, this initiative would join a recall of California Governor Gavin Newsom, and possibly San Francisco D.A. Chesa Boudin. I haven't seen this many recalls since I saw sold those edible lawn darts. Parents cite three main objections, the board members lowering of admission standards, poor management of the COVID crisis, and an obsession with dividing the community by race and victim status. The board also decided to focus on renaming schools instead of reopening them. And like all bad left the idea, its hit minority and low income families the hardest. 69 percent of the parents backed the recall with particular support from Asian Americans, especially after school board Commissioner Alison Collins tweeted racist remarks about the Asian community, then had the nerve to sue the district for violating her First Amendment rights. So, here's some free speech for the comm-ish and her fellow recallees, you suck. Your arrogance and incompetence or hurting kids and parents aren't going to take it anymore.
