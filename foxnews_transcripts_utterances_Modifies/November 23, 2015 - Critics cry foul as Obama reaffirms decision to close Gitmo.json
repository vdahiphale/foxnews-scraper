      "sentences": "WE HAVE RIGHT STRATEGY FOR ISIS AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT THROUGH   Michelle Fields: The president says that his strategy is working, whatever that strategy is, but it’s obviously not.  We have multiple attacks in Paris, attacks in Beirut, the bombing of a Russian airliner.  ISIS right now is a cancer on the world and this president thinks he’s going to solve that cancer by giving it a little bit of Tylenol and a Band-Aid.  That is not how we tackle this issue.  These are not some terrorist organizations that are dealing in the shadows.   This is an organization that is basically a state.  It has complete control over lots of territory.  It has its own welfare system.  It’s time that we take them seriously. Jessica Tarlov:  The Obama strategy to defeat ISIS, he’s made it clear that he will be accelerating the strategy.  The baseline strategy will remain the same.  We’re just going to do more of it, which is to use a series of airstrikes to build coalition forces to support Kurds and Iraqi Sunnis.  We need to do more of that obviously.  Jonathan Hoenig:  If you ask the average American what is the Obama strategy, I bet you maybe one in 10,000 would be able to articulate that.  What we know is that the strategy has been weak.  This is tremendous evasion on the president’s part.  Militant Islam is raging worldwide.  Five major Islamist attacks in November, and they’ve gotten more bloody, more brazen, so what is it that the rest of us are seeing that the president is not?  WHITE HOUSE PLANNING TO RELEASE MORE GITMO DETAINEES BY EARLY NEXT YEAR  Jonathan Hoenig:  I’m bewildered.  Is this how a country acts during a war?  A week of tremendously murderous attacks, you’re releasing these Islamists the same week?  I think from the president’s and John Kerry’s perspective somehow keeping Gitmo open, being aggressive about American self-defense encourages the enemy.  Almost like we’re asking for it by looking out for ourselves.   As long as they have that type of attitude, one of the four released from Gitmo ends up back on the battlefield instead. Jessica Tarlov:  These detainees, the five that went back were low level detainees.  A 2009 task force that was made up of six security agencies actually approved the release of four of five of them back in 2009 and we were still holding…  Michelle Fields:  There’s no such thing as a low level terrorist.  These people are not going to go back and join their local reading book club.  They’re going to go and they’re going to retaliate against the United States.   This idea that these people are committing terrorist acts because of Guantanamo Bay is ridiculous.  They’re going after anyone who is not an extreme Muslim.  That’s what they’re doing. DONALD TRUMP RENEWS CALL TO SECURE BORDER AMID RPTS OF SYRIANS TRYING TO SNEAK INTO US  Jonathan Hoenig:  I have been an advocate for open immigration but the refugee issue is a little bit different.  The reason we have a refugee crisis and have to be worried about them is a function of our inability and willingness to destroy militant Islam.  During times of war, it is perfectly appropriate to restrict immigration for your enemies or known enemies.   Michelle Fields:  This is exactly why we shouldn’t have open borders.  We’re always at war with these people.  They’re always going to want to kill us.  We need to have borders that are actual borders.  Not like right now where anyone can slip in, they can cross the border, go through Central America.  This is a problem. Jessica Tarlov:  We have a million less undocumented immigrants in this country than we did eight years ago.  The numbers are not adding up.  If you paid attention to anything Martin O’Malley said during the debate.  There’s 11 million here, there used to be 12 million.  You can’t just walk across the border anymore.",
