We're moments away from President Trump taking the stage in the battleground state of Pennsylvania for his fourth and final rally of the day, and we're going to bring you the President once he begins. But first, the homestretch: that's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words.  President Trump surging into Election Day with a lot of momentum. He has won back to back to back weeks since kicking COVID. America shattered economic records in the third quarter, posting a 33.1 percent growth number, best in history, and it wasn't even close.  The country is spending, shopping and eating out again, buying homes and building new ones. We still have a lot of work to do, but it's a V-shaped recovery. Four times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery. And if Democrat governors would fully reopen their states, we could all start getting back to normal again.  The Biden family business scandal broke wide open this week. Over seven million people watched Tucker Carlson, Tuesday. He had Biden family business partner, Tony Bobulinski on.",

Jim Biden is referenced, as you know, 10 percent. It doesn't say Biden, it says Jim, and then it has 10 percent for the big guy held by H. I a thousand percent sit here and know that the big guy is referencing Joe Biden. That's crystal clear to me because I lived it. I met with the former Vice President in person multiple times.",

But that's what's happening.   According to reports, the F.B.I. opened a money laundering investigation into Hunter Biden and his associates that remains open and active today.

Trust me, he's big.  The polls are tighter than they've ever been in the battlegrounds, Real Clear Politics average. It's a dead heat in Florida, North Carolina and Arizona and Trump is within the margin of error in Pennsylvania and within striking distance in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.   Now personally, I believe Trump will get even better in the battlegrounds than the mainstream media poll show. I don't believe a lot of these polls. It's neck and neck everywhere and the President is in a great position. Republicans are tied or ahead in early voting in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Georgia. Republican enthusiasm is huge. And in Florida, Republicans are wiping out the Democrat early vote advantage and they are on pace to put Biden behind where Hillary was in 2016.  The Democrats are getting nervous. These headlines POLITICO, \"We've got to stop the bleeding; Democrats sound alarm in Miami.\" Bloomberg, \"Biden aides see warning signs in black, Latino turnout so far.\"  \"New York Times,\" \"Can we trust Pennsylvania's polls?

Let's not kid ourselves, the Democrats and the media impeached Donald Trump for being right about Joe Biden's corruption. They impeached Donald Trump to distract from what Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and the Biden crime family were actually doing.  We now know it now. They have 1,000, probably more than 1,000 times the amount of evidence and corroboration against Hunter Biden, against Joe Biden, himself than they ever did against my family before they started the Russia hoax, and that they went with for four years. They are still talking about it as though it's real. They are still pretending it's a real thing, even though it's been totally, totally cleared. They did that. For this, now they have 1,000 times that on the guy that could be the President of the United States. He could be beholden to China, to Russia, all of those millions of dollars that Putin associate to Hunter. I mean, we've never seen corruption like this. This guy makes Hillary Clinton seem like she is a kid in kindergarten, in terms of corruption, and no one is to know about it. It's actually really sick, Jesse. Everything we know and love about America is at stake in this election. Because if they win, Big Tech is going to continue to do this unchecked. They are going to be able to stymie you, suppress your free speech, suppress your liberties, and shut everything we know and love about this country down. We can't allow that to happen. Everyone has to get out and vote. Everyone has to bring their friends. They have to see what we're up against. They have to understand that there's people voting for Joe Biden, that wouldn't if they actually knew the truth, but they are never going to see the truth, and that's their plan and we can't allow that to happen in America.

Do you know how many of them had given up on the Republican Party prior to Donald Trump? Millions -- who he has now brought back into the fold, and for all the knocks on him and his style and the bravado and the tweets and whatever. He has single handedly transformed the Republican Party from a tired old party perceived to be for the rich guy back to its roots, which is for the working class. And let me tell you something, Don Jr. is right. I'm out here in Florida. I can't get out much now in the last week or so. But I've been around for a while as an activist at heart, Jesse. There is something happening down here. And if you're ignoring it, you are insane. And even the blue counties, Republican turnout is off the charts in the blue counties. Imagine the other counties.",

Pennsylvania used to be called fool's gold because Republicans would chase it every year and get their asses kicked, can I say that? And now Trump potentially wins this twice. But think about what happens in Philly and Detroit if President Trump polls 15 percent of the black vote. Michigan, and Pennsylvania is in play every cycle. Cobble that together with the roughly 4.6 million white middle class working for a living again, dirt under the fingernails, voters who put their you know, work their butts off to make this country run, who sat out some of these election cycles.

That got her a concession speech and a set of steak knives, right. It means nothing. You have to look at four states, four states only, Jesse, right, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Pennsylvania. If the President takes Florida and he is trending in that direction to take Florida and North Carolina, same thing, Arizona same thing. It comes down to Pennsylvania, or perhaps Michigan. If everything else holds in terms of 2016, in other words, the President could lose Michigan and Wisconsin. All he has to do is win Pennsylvania or lose Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and hold Michigan and he wins. So this whole thing about a landslide for Biden, no. Again, it comes down to a couple of states and Pennsylvania right now is trending in the President's direction if you look at the Real Clear Politics Index of Polls.

That's the kind of thing over time that you have to build trust with. And the fact is, even though people complain about his style, the fact is, his transparency has been nothing like it in the history of at least recorded world leadership, where this has been the same guy that we saw come down that escalator in 2015 and '16 and announced his candidacy. And he has done what he said he would do. I would add, Jesse, in your list of things that Americans appreciated that any other President could have done, but didn't bother to do is the First Step Act, it is justice reform, and may I add the first Middle East peace deal in over a quarter of a century that moves our families and our children and grandchildren further away from a nuclear exchange, they say it would be limited. There is no such thing as a limited nuclear exchange. He has accomplished something with foreign policy in the Middle East that will change the next 100 to 200 years. It's an extraordinary event.

The country is spending, shopping and eating out again, buying homes and building new ones. We still have a lot of work to do, but it's a V-shaped recovery. Four times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery. And if Democrat governors would fully reopen their states, we could all start getting back to normal again. The Biden family business scandal broke wide open this week. Over seven million people watched Tucker Carlson, Tuesday. He had Biden family business partner, Tony Bobulinski on."

Jim Biden is referenced, as you know, 10 percent. It doesn't say Biden, it says Jim, and then it has 10 percent for the big guy held by H.

It's neck and neck everywhere and the President is in a great position. Republicans are tied or ahead in early voting in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Georgia. Republican enthusiasm is huge. And in Florida, Republicans are wiping out the Democrat early vote advantage and they are on pace to put Biden behind where Hillary was in 2016.

Someone that is now -- you know, you have a Naval Intelligence Officer that is literally saying I was there, Joe Biden knew all about it, and the mainstream media is not even covering it.

Social media, you have, you know, Big Tech and Google. I mean, these are probably trillion dollar industries that have decided they are going to be cheerleaders for the left. They will do whatever they can in their power to suppress information about Joe Biden, to hide Donald Trump's accomplishments. I mean, look at what -- they don't even talk about four peace deals in the Middle East. I mean, at any other point in history, Jesse, that would be the Holy Grail of geopolitical politics. They refuse to talk about it. They refuse to talk about the corruption, millions of dollars exchanged, the Joe Biden hard drive. Let's not kid ourselves, the Democrats and the media impeached Donald Trump for being right about Joe Biden's corruption. They impeached Donald Trump to distract from what Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and the Biden crime family were actually doing. We now know it now. They have 1,000, probably more than 1,000 times the amount of evidence and corroboration against Hunter Biden, against Joe Biden, himself than they ever did against my family before they started the Russia hoax, and that they went with for four years. They are still talking about it as though it's real. They are still pretending it's a real thing, even though it's been totally, totally cleared. They did that. For this, now they have 1,000 times that on the guy that could be the President of the United States. He could be beholden to China, to Russia, all of those millions of dollars that Putin associate to Hunter. I mean, we've never seen corruption like this. This guy makes Hillary Clinton seem like she is a kid in kindergarten, in terms of corruption, and no one is to know about it. It's actually really sick, Jesse. Everything we know and love about America is at stake in this election. Because if they win, Big Tech is going to continue to do this unchecked. They are going to be able to stymie you, suppress your free speech, suppress your liberties, and shut everything we know and love about this country down. We can't allow that to happen. Everyone has to get out and vote. Everyone has to bring their friends. They have to see what we're up against. They have to understand that there's people voting for Joe Biden, that wouldn't if they actually knew the truth, but they are never going to see the truth, and that's their plan and we can't allow that to happen in America.

You know, they'll talk to in front of crowds and tell them everything they want to hear about conservative values and fighting for them and then they get down to D.C. and they fold over, they roll over and die each and every time. I think it's a mandate for Republicans to actually step up to do the things that their constituents want, to not be manipulated by some left-wing newspaper, who is going to write a bad article about them. Who cares? Get out there. Fight for what the people that put you in office want for a change. Get out there and do that. So we do have to win the House. We do have to win the Senate to make that happen. We had that in '16. We had the House and the Senate. But you had Paul Ryan, you had the weakest leadership in the history of Republican Party doing that. He didn't want to do anything to upset his beloved friends in the media who hated his guts anyway, but they knew they could manipulate him, so they pretend that they were friends and he rolled over and died. We can't have that anymore. We need to win the House. We need to win the Senate. And then we need to go fight. We've got to put an end to the Big Tech monopolies. We've got to break up the protections that they get from 230. If they're going to be functioning as, you know, publishers stymieing free speech, I mean, the basic fundamental rights that Americans hold so near and dear, they are running roughshod with this as though it doesn't even exist and they are getting away with it and we've sat by on the sidelines watching for too long. Republicans have, especially by just pretending it's not going on. They don't -- they are not in touch with their base enough to understand that this is a number one issue with our people that I see every day on the ground, thousands of them. We have to push back, and we have to end this nonsense once and all, or in a couple of years, you're going to wake up and you're not going to have a voice whatsoever."

Now, you actually have it, you have the hard drives. You have the receipts. You have the wire transfers. You have the money. You have eyewitnesses, you know, that are Democrats. This isn't a partisan hackery. You have all of these things. They went after us for four years for a tiny -- for accusing us of a tiny fraction of the stuff that Hunter Biden has actually been doing. They better do that. But the F.B.I., they had this laptop. They allowed impeachment to happen knowing that they were right about Joe Biden, my father's instincts again, just like he was right when he said the Obama-Biden campaign was spying on him. He knew because he understands how this world works. He understands when something isn't quite right, he gets it. So he was right then and he is right this time, but look at what the F.B.I. did to us. They railroaded us with a made up dossier. They worked together with that agent of Russia, an actual Russian spy, to come up with the Steele dossier, sell it to the media to try to set up a coup. So you've got to clean house at the upper level of the F.B.I., not the door kickers, those guys come up to me every day, they can't believe what's going on with the disgraceful leadership in their own agencies.

Do you know how many working class Americans whose fingernails get dirty for a living, who leave their work boots at the front door, because they don't want to drag what they are working in inside the house? Do you know how many of them had given up on the Republican Party prior to Donald Trump?

He has single handedly transformed the Republican Party from a tired old party perceived to be for the rich guy back to its roots, which is for the working class. And let me tell you something, Don Jr. is right. I'm out here in Florida. I can't get out much now in the last week or so. But I've been around for a while as an activist at heart, Jesse.

I would say that the Trump coalition that he has cobbled together in 2016 and what we think is going to happen again, in 2020, of middle class working class, white Americans was cracking the 60 percent ceiling with Hispanics, which we expect him to do and now getting into double digits with black Americans.

Let me just reiterate what you said because it's important. These are constituencies that haven't traditionally been Republican in enough numbers where we could put together and cobble together a winning ticket. You're right. Historic numbers of minority voters. If Trump gets 15 percent of the black vote, Jesse, that's going to be a game changer. It's over. Pennsylvania is in play. Pennsylvania used to be called fool's gold because Republicans would chase it every year and get their asses kicked, can I say that? And now Trump potentially wins this twice. But think about what happens in Philly and Detroit if President Trump polls 15 percent of the black vote. Michigan, and Pennsylvania is in play every cycle. Cobble that together with the roughly 4.6 million white middle class working for a living again, dirt under the fingernails, voters who put their you know, work their butts off to make this country run, who sat out some of these election cycles.

He was under surveillance apparently by the F.B.I. because they thought he was spying for the Communist Chinese, and Jim Biden and Joe's son are doing business with communist spies.

You want to check my shape, man, let's do push-ups together, man. My name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women created by -- go -- you know the -- you know the thing. I have a record of over 40 years, and that I'm going to beat Joe Biden.

LARA TRUMP, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, I guaranteed it in 2016, Jesse, and I am guaranteeing it now. We've been working very hard in North Carolina.

We might not know what state the other one is in because it's been so crazy. But I'm telling you, Jesse, we continue to say it feels exactly like 2016, except bigger. The energy out there right now, the enthusiasm to re-elect President Trump is palpable everywhere. People are so excited, and I continue to hear people tell me I didn't vote for Donald Trump in 2016, either they didn't vote or they voted for Hillary Clinton. They are so excited to cast a vote. They are going to be first in line on Tuesday to vote for President Trump."

So if that's true. I mean, you're tacking on millions of more voters, new voters, and the registration numbers that the Republicans have been doing are just gangbusters. Early vote is looking good across the board. You know, people like to doubt the polls. I saw a poll out today just broke in Iowa, President Trump is up eight. And I saw a poll out in Arizona, the President Trump is up three. You know, if you look at the numbers, and you look at the crowds and the enthusiasm, the President looks like he is running a winning campaign and you can't say that for Joe Biden."

You see the president is now heading to his fourth rally of the day. We're going to bump it up to five soon, and people are continuing to come out. But look, I just think it speaks to the enthusiasm that has always been there for this President, but then he delivered for the American people, he actually kept his promises. And some other statistic that I think is very interesting you were talking about the Trump rallies, around 20 percent of the people that attend Trump rallies, Jesse are registered Democrats. So you can factor that in however you want. It seems like a big win for us. But look, we take nothing for granted. Unlike the other side, we feel like we actually have to get out there. We want to work for the votes. We want to campaign around the country and that's what we've all been doing."

Joining us now to discuss is Joe Concha, media reporter for \"The Hill.\" All right, Joe, I know you have about a dozen TVs in your little media basement den and you're checking out what everybody is saying on cable and on the networks. I know, you're all over Twitter. Let me ask you what your assessment is about the media mood in the country right now. If Joe Biden is indeed about to unleash a 400 Electoral College vote landslide and just wipe the floor with the President as the polls indicate, don't you think that the media would be a little more gleeful, they'd be a little more cocky and have a little more Mojo because when I'm looking at the media landscape right now on the eve of this election, I'm seeing a lot of tense people on the left. Is that what you're seeing?"
    },

      "utterance": "It seems that there's a lot of stress, Jesse, and there is polls saying that, forget journalism, just people in general are stressful about this election coming up on Tuesday, and that tells you it is a close race. The bottom line is that, you look at national polls, ignore national polls, it means nothing. Hillary Clinton won the national or the popular vote in 2016. That got her a concession speech and a set of steak knives, right. It means nothing. You have to look at four states, four states only, Jesse, right, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona and Pennsylvania. If the President takes Florida and he is trending in that direction to take Florida and North Carolina, same thing, Arizona same thing. It comes down to Pennsylvania, or perhaps Michigan. If everything else holds in terms of 2016, in other words, the President could lose Michigan and Wisconsin. All he has to do is win Pennsylvania or lose Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and hold Michigan and he wins. So this whole thing about a landslide for Biden, no. Again, it comes down to a couple of states and Pennsylvania right now is trending in the President's direction if you look at the Real Clear Politics Index of Polls. It is going his direction because of the fracking issue, and that's why he is now doing four rallies tonight and today in that Keystone State, Jesse."

They've wiped out the Democrat early vote lead basically in Florida, where I think Biden is going in there with less of an advantage than Andrew Gillum went in there with DeSantis and you remember what happened there. Also Arizona again, early vote, wiped out by the Republicans there and that's a red state. So I agree, North Carolina is looking good for the Republicans; Florida and Arizona, he gets those core there. He just picks up one of the four in the Rust Belt because I agree, those three states that you named up there, also, Minnesota is in play. They are confident about that. All right, Joe Concha watching everything the media does and taking notes. Thank you again."

Joining me now for more on the state of the race with just two days ago, FOX News contributor, Tammy Bruce. All right, Tammy, let's take a look back at the last four years, I believe he's going to win another four. But some of these critical moments that I think really put him in a position to win on Tuesday. When he stuck with Kavanaugh, when he brought Bill Barr in to call Mueller's bluff with the hoax, when he had the instincts to reopen the economy when he did, because any longer, I don't think the economy would have survived. And then when the riots occurred, to be able to come in strong and back police then and then to recover from COVID so quickly, and jumped back on that debate stage and really give it to Joe as just a washed up, do nothing, say everything politician really puts him in a good position."

But more than anything else, he created the best economy the world has ever seen and that is why he had the flexibility to do what it is we needed to do leading up to this. And this is why Americans have the confidence and that's what the economy is based on -- it is consumer confidence, the belief that the future is going to be okay, that they had the confidence that he would bring it back because he did it in the first place. That's the kind of thing over time that you have to build trust with. And the fact is, even though people complain about his style, the fact is, his transparency has been nothing like it in the history of at least recorded world leadership, where this has been the same guy that we saw come down that escalator in 2015 and '16 and announced his candidacy. And he has done what he said he would do. I would add, Jesse, in your list of things that Americans appreciated that any other President could have done, but didn't bother to do is the First Step Act, it is justice reform, and may I add the first Middle East peace deal in over a quarter of a century that moves our families and our children and grandchildren further away from a nuclear exchange, they say it would be limited. There is no such thing as a limited nuclear exchange. He has accomplished something with foreign policy in the Middle East that will change the next 100 to 200 years. It's an extraordinary event. It's a development brought by a man who was not beholden to the swamp, and that is what makes him different and that's why he is also going to win on Tuesday. I agree with you."
