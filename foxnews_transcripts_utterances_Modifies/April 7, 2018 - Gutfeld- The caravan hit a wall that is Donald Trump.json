Fast forward to today and you can see lines everywhere n- for iPhones, at ball games on Gordon Ramsay's forehead and there's even a line to get into this country.

I can't keep my philosophers together in my head, but you are right. These drones are designed to basically fly over to the terrorist's house, not kill anybody over here and over here, but just wait, hover over and wait for the terrorist to come out to water his lawn because they do have lawns and then it just zaps you. You can't have -- that's the best technology for war ever."

Don't ask a brat. Results from a new study revealed a third of young American millennials aren't sure that the earth is round. Here's what 18 to 24-year-olds said when asked, \"Do you believe the world is round or flat?\" Sixty-six percent have always believed the earth is round, yippee. Nine percent always thought that the world was round, but more recently became skeptical..."

I mean, there are some things we can look at here and all understand that we are on the same page, but I would say that people should have a better understanding of why it is they believe what they believe because for example, okay, we can all agree the earth is round, but you ask people about climate change and they will just say, because -- the answer really is because all the smart people say so, and that should never be your baseline of why you think something is or is not true.

You see. You see what I am talking about. Also, think of the mystery of the earth's underside.
