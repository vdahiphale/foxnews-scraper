Everyone pretending like they know what's going to happen with the relief package is either lying or, they are lying. Because no one knows what's going to go on. They didn't know what was going to happen with the bailouts, they didn't know what was going to happen with the stimulus.   You get these moments in history where there is a huge problem and Washington rushes together in a smoke-filled room and just inject billions or in this case trillions of dollars into the economy with kind of their eyes closed and kind of peeking in between their fingers. Some people are positioning themselves in Washington and saying this is not good enough for your average worker. Some people are just saying this is the kind of fast, direct, big relief we needed in order to get this economy rebounded again. We'll see how it plays out. No one is going to know.  But it reminds me of \"Pulp Fiction.\" Remember when Uma Thurman OD's (Ph) and they run into that little house and they draw with a sharpie that little mark on her chest and they take the heroin O.D. and a needle, and Travolta just has to kind of close his eyes and just stab this thing directly into her chest hoping it's going to revive her and that's what they are doing in D.C.

If you need to get help the people in need this is what you got to do. Here's what draw makes me laugh. It's like when you were a kid or teenager, or young adult, you use to read in National Geographic or Reader's Digest about a lost tribe still living a primitive lifestyle, untouched by the modern era.  That's our government. I mean, all of us are working from home. They can't vote from home. They still have to come in and do a roll call even though we have one of the most contagious diseases in history running through the population. Even the signing, when you're watching the signing you're going like, those are all really powerful people, they shouldn't be in that office together. And then you're watching they're debating on the floor and it's like why are they there? And then you have this other guy say well, no, they all have to fly back. They all have to fly back.

The only movies that I really knew where like the \"Muppet\" movie. And do you remember in the \"Muppet\" movie when -- no, I'm kidding. I can't. I can't come up with the analogy.  But here's the thing. If we have to do it again, remember that this wasn't like what happened in 2008. Where the banks were failing because of the mortgage lending and everything. Now, in that situation, I know people were mad about it. Like bailing out the banks, but the government actually ended up making money from those banks because within two years the banks paid that money with interest.  So, in this situation the government is telling people, you cannot go to work. And so, the government then has to do something and if it's $2 trillion then that's $2 trillion and then we'll figure it out on the other end. I don't think nitpicking it right now is going to be worth it but you are going to see a lot of it. I thought it was interesting that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went so crazy over it on the floor but then didn't object to it and that's partly because I think she realizes that the people she represents in her district are going to need that help.",

Now, a lot of business owners are excited obviously about the loan forgiveness aspect but I want to highlight something about the payroll protection aspect of it. So, essentially, for there to be actual forgiveness these business owners need to hire back about 90 percent of the workforce that they've laid off. So, unless their doors are open, however, they will be essentially inheriting unemployment wages from the government. It's just transferring those wages that the Fed pays over to the business owner.  So, if you take a restaurant, right, they are doing take out only, they have less hours, they are making 10 percent of their revenue but they are paying a full staff at home.

So, you know, remember, Roosevelt's new deal in 1932 was the antidote to Hoover's inaction from 1929. And so we have on our side finally a federal government that as Jesse put it as juicy in the Dow, but you know, at least it's making strides to acknowledge that there is a correlation and that you can't acknowledge the economic deaths without recognizing the physical deaths as well. And I'm not an epidemiologist obviously, but I have to point out that, you know, to Cuomo's point, that Harvard just published this study at their school of public health, that essentially multiple targeted social distancing measures is way more effective than full lockdown quarantine because you have to balance out our herd immunity, too. And for all of these predictions floating around the one thing people agree on is that at some point there will be a resurgence of this whether it's the fall or next year or both.

      "sentences": "And thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It's been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world. We've had great success over the last month. We've, as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us, purchased and delivered. And we've made it available to the states. And the governors have been very gracious for the most part, I would say. There a couple that aren't appreciative for the incredible job. They have to do a better job themselves. That's part of the problem. But generally speaking, I have to tell you, the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he's very thankful. And Governor Cuomo has been very nice. They really appreciated I think what the federal government has done. When you look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, it's been really incredible. Nobody has seen it. They'll build hospitals in two or three days, portable hospitals. This afternoon, I invoke the Defense Production Act, to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal, and we've delivered thousands of them. And oftentimes, you don't need ventilators very much. Hospitals don't have very many. And now we're turning out that we have to produce large numbers. But we've been able to do that and we're going to be doing a lot more. This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had to deal with this. As an example, General Motors and I guess they thought otherwise, they didn't agree, and now they do. They do agree and I think we might be able to pull it, but we let them know the way we felt, and they can't be doing that. We'll work in partnership with the private sector but where an emergency exists, and it's very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly. We will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available lawful authorities to get the job done. This afternoon, I also signed an executive order investing and very, very strongly investing the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act, to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus, the invisible enemy, as we say. My order also establishes that Peter Navarro, a very trusted person from the White House, and he's been an incredible -- he's done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going economically. But my order establishes that Peter will serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator for the federal government. That's a very important position. More important, probably than it's almost ever been in our country. And so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It's -- he's -- I know he's going to do a fantastic job. He's been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter is a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard, has a master's in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard, and he's a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job. And I'd like to maybe ask before I continue, Peter, just say a few words, please. Peter? Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

We are also awaiting a White House coronavirus task force briefing that set to begin very soon. President Trump teasing a very big announcement about much-needed ventilators. He is also invoking the Defense Protection Act to have General Motors produce more ventilators. The signing of the stimulus bill comes after more political infighting on Capitol Hill. House Republican Thomas Massie drawing bipartisan fury including from the president after he delayed the process by insisting (AUDIO GAP) over questionable spending including $11 billion for three international development organizations.

On the other hand, you kind of think, well, if you are a conservative the Constitution says that Congress is responsible for spending a nation have a voice vote, everybody should be accountable.

It doesn't really matter, they needed to get the money out fast and big and that's what they did. Everyone pretending like they know what's going to happen with the relief package is either lying or, they are lying. Because no one knows what's going to go on. They didn't know what was going to happen with the bailouts, they didn't know what was going to happen with the stimulus. You get these moments in history where there is a huge problem and Washington rushes together in a smoke-filled room and just inject billions or in this case trillions of dollars into the economy with kind of their eyes closed and kind of peeking in between their fingers. Some people are positioning themselves in Washington and saying this is not good enough for your average worker. Some people are just saying this is the kind of fast, direct, big relief we needed in order to get this economy rebounded again. We'll see how it plays out. No one is going to know. But it reminds me of \"Pulp Fiction.\" Remember when Uma Thurman OD's (Ph) and they run into that little house and they draw with a sharpie that little mark on her chest and they take the heroin O.D. and a needle, and Travolta just has to kind of close his eyes and just stab this thing directly into her chest hoping it's going to revive her and that's what they are doing in D.C. They are giving it their best shot with as much juice as possible."

But I do want to ask you about the idea of, you know, shocking the system back to reality because what we see in the bill is money for people who are workers, unemployed, people who can't work and get a paycheck right now. They've expanded unemployment benefits. In addition, there's about $1,200 going to all people who earn below, I think it's like $100,000 a year, $500 per child.

Libertarians has the luxury of standing outside the brawl and wagging their finger. But in this case, you can't be stepping outside of this and wagging your finger. The libertarian has to suck it up and sit out or realize that this is not a time to be, you know, the principles perfect, you know, be perfect and principled. If you need to get help the people in need this is what you got to do. Here's what draw makes me laugh. It's like when you were a kid or teenager, or young adult, you use to read in National Geographic or Reader's Digest about a lost tribe still living a primitive lifestyle, untouched by the modern era. That's our government. I mean, all of us are working from home. They can't vote from home. They still have to come in and do a roll call even though we have one of the most contagious diseases in history running through the population. Even the signing, when you're watching the signing you're going like, those are all really powerful people, they shouldn't be in that office together. And then you're watching they're debating on the floor and it's like why are they there? And then you have this other guy say well, no, they all have to fly back. They all have to fly back. It's 2020. Are they in some kind of time capsule from the 1930s? I mean, they really are like a lost tribe that has yet to discover a Coke bottle. There is my analogy."

The only movies that I really knew where like the \"Muppet\" movie. And do you remember in the \"Muppet\" movie when -- no, I'm kidding. I can't. I can't come up with the analogy. But here's the thing. If we have to do it again, remember that this wasn't like what happened in 2008. Where the banks were failing because of the mortgage lending and everything. Now, in that situation, I know people were mad about it. Like bailing out the banks, but the government actually ended up making money from those banks because within two years the banks paid that money with interest. So, in this situation the government is telling people, you cannot go to work. And so, the government then has to do something and if it's $2 trillion then that's $2 trillion and then we'll figure it out on the other end. I don't think nitpicking it right now is going to be worth it but you are going to see a lot of it. I thought it was interesting that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went so crazy over it on the floor but then didn't object to it and that's partly because I think she realizes that the people she represents in her district are going to need that help."

Look, my movie analogy for this is \"Footloose.\" Which is that you can't have your prom or your dance without a warehouse to hold it in. So, I want to point out something about the stimulus bill that it delves (Ph), tells in with all of the quarantine a the stay-at-home. Now, a lot of business owners are excited obviously about the loan forgiveness aspect but I want to highlight something about the payroll protection aspect of it. So, essentially, for there to be actual forgiveness these business owners need to hire back about 90 percent of the workforce that they've laid off. So, unless their doors are open, however, they will be essentially inheriting unemployment wages from the government. It's just transferring those wages that the Fed pays over to the business owner. So, if you take a restaurant, right, they are doing take out only, they have less hours, they are making 10 percent of their revenue but they are paying a full staff at home. That's just an empty payroll."

First of all, if you ever want to see how bias works compare how they treat somebody they like with someone they don't like when those two people share the same opinion. So, Cuomo and Trump actually share the same opinion about balancing the prevent -- the tamping down of a pandemic and preserving the future of your economy, they both share the same sentiment. However, they portrayed Cuomo as, you know, a potential presidential candidate while they say Trump is going to kill World War II veterans which is what as you know morning blow said. But the idea, everybody understands what's going on but the media pretends that they aren't. We know that this is not a stoplight that goes from red to green, or green to red. We know this is going to be phased. Everybody understands it and this could be face having to do with your health risk. That's how it's going to work.

And they are both interrelated in terms of these choices and decisions that are being made. And I think, you know, people keep talking about that we are careening into another Great Depression but what we had this time that we didn't have last time was strong federal leadership and action. So, you know, remember, Roosevelt's new deal in 1932 was the antidote to Hoover's inaction from 1929. And so we have on our side finally a federal government that as Jesse put it as juicy in the Dow, but you know, at least it's making strides to acknowledge that there is a correlation and that you can't acknowledge the economic deaths without recognizing the physical deaths as well. And I'm not an epidemiologist obviously, but I have to point out that, you know, to Cuomo's point, that Harvard just published this study at their school of public health, that essentially multiple targeted social distancing measures is way more effective than full lockdown quarantine because you have to balance out our herd immunity, too. And for all of these predictions floating around the one thing people agree on is that at some point there will be a resurgence of this whether it's the fall or next year or both. And so, we need to have a herd immunity to combat that and that's only going to be achieved through relaxing the quarantines and having some type of social interaction."

And when you look at -- when you look at people suffering, death -- by the way that the infection rates are increasing because we're testing more. And these are people that really want more testing, so you're naturally going to see more infection rates. But if you see that as an opportunity to direct attention to yourself on social media, you're what scientists would call a scumbag and you're somebody that we will not forget. When this is all over and done with -- because you don't want to have -- you don't want to say who are the heroes and who were the villains now, we will have plenty of time for that later.

I -- there -- I wish I could remember the name of the writer, but on nationalreview.com, there's a piece about China today that is so important. And if you are a journalist, and you care about freedom of speech, and the rights of journalists, then you should actually be really exposing what China is doing. And you should be very clear that these are the recorded cases in America. We know that China is not telling the truth. We know that. We know that because the journalists were thrown out. They're treated like crap. They have to like figure out a way to use emojis to get around the censors. So they're not even doing anything to help their fellow journalists. The other thing is, I read a report today about how China has sent all of these tests to Spain and Italy and elsewhere to help them and the tests are defective. So how can we possibly trust the numbers that are coming out of China? And the other reason that the numbers are not so bad in China right now is they stopped testing."

My point here would be you know, when they say that the United States is number one, I don't -- I just want to emphasize, I don't know that we can trust China's numbers. The President says he was talking with the Chinese leader, yes, last night, President Xi. I don't -- I don't know if he asked him, hey, can we get the actual numbers. Can we know where things are because you know, like right now we're using models from Italy and Europe, but China was way ahead of that? We could have information about how we deal with the cycles, the rise, the fall the spikes, if China would actually be honest with us. And I don't think they've been honest. So I think that should be the focus here is because that kind of modeling could help us with what we're dealing with at the moment.

I missed the commercial breaks. But I love this the forced pause of having more time with Peter and Jasper and being a little bit quieter and yes, I really like it. You know, you always tell me I say yes to too many things."

      "utterance": "And thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It's been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world. We've had great success over the last month. We've, as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us, purchased and delivered. And we've made it available to the states. And the governors have been very gracious for the most part, I would say. There a couple that aren't appreciative for the incredible job. They have to do a better job themselves. That's part of the problem. But generally speaking, I have to tell you, the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he's very thankful. And Governor Cuomo has been very nice. They really appreciated I think what the federal government has done. When you look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, it's been really incredible. Nobody has seen it. They'll build hospitals in two or three days, portable hospitals. This afternoon, I invoke the Defense Production Act, to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal, and we've delivered thousands of them. And oftentimes, you don't need ventilators very much. Hospitals don't have very many. And now we're turning out that we have to produce large numbers. But we've been able to do that and we're going to be doing a lot more. This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had to deal with this. As an example, General Motors and I guess they thought otherwise, they didn't agree, and now they do. They do agree and I think we might be able to pull it, but we let them know the way we felt, and they can't be doing that. We'll work in partnership with the private sector but where an emergency exists, and it's very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly. We will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available lawful authorities to get the job done. This afternoon, I also signed an executive order investing and very, very strongly investing the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act, to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus, the invisible enemy, as we say. My order also establishes that Peter Navarro, a very trusted person from the White House, and he's been an incredible -- he's done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going economically. But my order establishes that Peter will serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator for the federal government. That's a very important position. More important, probably than it's almost ever been in our country. And so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It's -- he's -- I know he's going to do a fantastic job. He's been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter is a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard, has a master's in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard, and he's a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job. And I'd like to maybe ask before I continue, Peter, just say a few words, please. Peter? Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
