He will likely continue his attacks, almost certainly, on Joe Biden. And the latest e-mail controversy involving Biden's son Hunter.  With just two weeks to go until Election Day, President Trump is desperately trying to paint the Biden family as what he calls a criminal enterprise.  This evening, a top U.S. official is trying to shoot down one theory about the possible source of the Hunter Biden story. The Trump campaign is also trying to get some last minute changes to the format for the second and final presidential debate.  We have \"FOX TEAM COVERAGE\", we begin tonight though with senior political correspondent Mike Emanuel. And new information on that Hunter Biden e-mail story. Good evening, Mike.",

Authorities believe many homes will be lost there. The fire started around noon, Saturday, and was pushed by strong winds in the area. Evacuations were ordered and by Sunday morning, the fire had burned nearly 14 square miles. Q13 Fox in Seattle covering Alaska. A tsunami warning remains in effect for parts of southern Alaska, after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck-off Sand Point late today. So, far, fortunately, no word of any damage. And this is a live look at San Francisco. Take a look at this picture. You can barely see the Golden Gate Bridge from our affiliate Fox 2. What a great shot.  One of the big stories there tonight, the San Francisco zoo's missing lemur is returned, and a suspect has been arrested. The 21-year-old male, ring- tailed lemur was reported missing Wednesday. Thursday afternoon, a 5-year- old boy spotted him at a playground in Daly City. A suspect was arrested Friday and faces four felony charges. The 5-year-old, by the way, has since been rewarded with a lifetime membership to that zoo. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. What a live look it is.

Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent levy on earnings up to $137,700. Mr. Biden's Social Security plan, analyzed this month by the progressive leaning Urban Institute, would retain the $137,700 payroll tax ceiling, but impose the 12.4 percent tax on earnings above 400,000. The doughnut hole would spare the upper-middle-class from higher taxes, but only temporarily. With each passing year the doughnut hole shrinks. The payroll tax ceiling already increases annually with nominal wage growth, but Mr. Biden's $400,000 threshold isn't indexed. This means that over about three decades, the payroll tax ceiling would be phased out. High earners would be hit immediately with an effective tax increase of 12.4 percent of their wages, but with time and wage growth, the Biden plan would raise the tax for employees earning above $137,700 by the same 12.4 percent of income.\" Thanks for bearing with me. Back with the panel. Mollie, when the vice president, former vice president, says on the trail I will not raise taxes for anyone making less than 400,000, that shoots a hole in that.",

It's not just with things like Social Security issue, but also that he has said that he would come on his first day in office, repeal President Trump's tax reform and tax cuts that were done early in his administration, which of course lowered taxes on the vast majority of Americans. And so if those were to be done away with, that's significant. So too are changes to regulations, which has been another key part of the Trump administration, pulling back regulations that limit businesses.

That analysis is based on what the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute has said, and Moody's.

This is a live look right now, it's a democracy in action. Early voting in the big battleground state of Florida which both campaigns believe it's critical on their road to the White House. The Trump campaign today predicted they will win Florida. Former Vice President Biden last week in South Florida said if he wins Florida, it's all over. As always in the largest swing state, presidential election are razor tight and could go either way. Here's the scene early this morning at the Jacksonville, solid line with social distancing in place. The same was true in Palm Beach County as well. Their voters stood outside with their umbrellas, but they stayed in line regardless to get their vote in early reflecting Florida's voter enthusiasm.

Authorities believe many homes will be lost there. The fire started around noon, Saturday, and was pushed by strong winds in the area. Evacuations were ordered and by Sunday morning, the fire had burned nearly 14 square miles. Q13 Fox in Seattle covering Alaska. A tsunami warning remains in effect for parts of southern Alaska, after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck-off Sand Point late today. So, far, fortunately, no word of any damage. And this is a live look at San Francisco. Take a look at this picture. You can barely see the Golden Gate Bridge from our affiliate Fox 2. What a great shot. One of the big stories there tonight, the San Francisco zoo's missing lemur is returned, and a suspect has been arrested. The 21-year-old male, ring- tailed lemur was reported missing Wednesday. Thursday afternoon, a 5-year- old boy spotted him at a playground in Daly City. A suspect was arrested Friday and faces four felony charges.

But you do see that Joe Biden has had, because the media have basically run the Joe Biden campaign and not allowed any negative information about their preferred candidate, he has fairly high favorables. And so having this kind of story come out at this time, at a time when it's coming down to the wire, at a time when the battleground states are very much in contention according to the Real Clear Politics average, and of course the battleground states are where it matters, is not what the Biden campaign wants. And so they are just desperate to keep people saying, falsely, that it's Russian disinformation so they don't have to deal with the actual substance of these emails, which show how the Biden family has traded on access to Joe Biden for family wealth gains. And that is a legitimate story, and it's something that the media definitely need to look into."

And I think if you end the campaign the way the president is ending after having served for four years, I think it's revealing and it tells something about how the president feels about his performance. Put aside how we may complain about the media. I've never seen a person who had such a house -- a vacation house, a plane, a helicopter, complain so much. If he is serious about leading another four years, he should lay out what that predicate will look like. I think these questions about Joe Biden and his family, the public temper tantrums the president shows around it, I'm not convinced that that's the way to end it. If he has four years, a plan to generate more jobs and growth and ensure that every American gets a vaccine, that's what he should be talking about. The more Joe Biden talks about those things, the more successful his campaign will be in the more likely it will be that he wins this race in the next two weeks."

But there's no state that has taken such a sharp turn not just against drum, but in collateral damage down ballot for candidates like McSally. I have remained a little skeptical that a state could swing so hard, but survey after survey have reinforced it, and it has a lot to do with coronavirus. You have a lot of older voters and you have a lot of suburban families in Arizona who, like a lot of Americans, have been aghast at the way the president has dealt with this. They've punished him for it. And his message there has to be that he's going to do better and get better at this, and soon."

But the issue is taxes, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" had an interesting op-ed, and I'm going to get in the weeds here by reading this, but bear with me. \"The hidden trap in Biden's tax hike. Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent levy on earnings up to $137,700. Mr. Biden's Social Security plan, analyzed this month by the progressive leaning Urban Institute, would retain the $137,700 payroll tax ceiling, but impose the 12.4 percent tax on earnings above 400,000. The doughnut hole would spare the upper-middle-class from higher taxes, but only temporarily. With each passing year the doughnut hole shrinks. The payroll tax ceiling already increases annually with nominal wage growth, but Mr. Biden's $400,000 threshold isn't indexed. This means that over about three decades, the payroll tax ceiling would be phased out. High earners would be hit immediately with an effective tax increase of 12.4 percent of their wages, but with time and wage growth, the Biden plan would raise the tax for employees earning above $137,700 by the same 12.4 percent of income.\" Thanks for bearing with me. Back with the panel. Mollie, when the vice president, former vice president, says on the trail I will not raise taxes for anyone making less than 400,000, that shoots a hole in that."

This has been interesting that no matter who is doing the analysis, whether it's progressive or independent or conservative analysts, they say that various aspects of former Vice President Biden's plan would raise taxes on people who make less than $400,000 a year. It's not just with things like Social Security issue, but also that he has said that he would come on his first day in office, repeal President Trump's tax reform and tax cuts that were done early in his administration, which of course lowered taxes on the vast majority of Americans. And so if those were to be done away with, that's significant. So too are changes to regulations, which has been another key part of the Trump administration, pulling back regulations that limit businesses. And then finally, the issue with trade and whether China can continue its unfair practices that harm American workers and companies. And so all of these things are very different between the two candidates, and they will affect the American worker."

      "utterance": "Well, a couple things. I'm surprised we have not gotten into it more. When you analyze the Biden tax plan, here's what's clear. There are 335 million Americans who will not see their taxes go up. In fact, they will see a tax cut more likely than not. That analysis is based on what the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute has said, and Moody's. We can go back and forth with competing think tanks and others that may say one thing, but one thing everyone agrees on, we may disagree on whether or not that payroll tax goes off in 30 years, I'm not convinced of that. But we can all agree that about 17 million of the 350 million Americans may see a tax increase. So if we're going to play the politics around whose taxes goes up whose taxes go down, if you're one of the 333 million Americans, which means 95 percent of Americans, your taxes will go down under a Biden presidency."
