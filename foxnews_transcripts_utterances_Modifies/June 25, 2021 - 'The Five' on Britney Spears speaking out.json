Now, we have been getting what we call, again, sonar sound devices that we're getting from inside the rubble in various areas. And again, it is a very slow and methodical process because every time we start breaching parts of the structure, we do get debris that falls on us. In regard to the structural engineer, we do have structural engineers that are embedded with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue to prevent the building from collapsing on our firefighters as we continue with the search and rescue phase. Again, since 1:48 a.m., Miami-Dade Fire Rescue has not stopped.  Again, the optics may seem that there's nothing going on on top, but all operations, I cannot emphasize enough, all operations are occurring underneath the rubble. They are occurring underneath the parking garage where we have teams of firefighters constantly as they continue making cuts, breaches and placing sonar devices, search cams to locate victims.  As we make one hole, we access a floor, we continue to the various areas.

And that's on the architect, the developer and the contractor, and if they have a review every 40 years, they were in the review process to pass the inspection, the reporting is that they were already talking about making structural changes in order to pass inspection.  And if you add that to the \"USA Today\" report that says there was a survey done in the '90s that said the structure was sinking, you have to ask yourself, when did the association know about this and if they didn't do anything about it, you're going to see one of the biggest lawsuits in Florida history because its negligent homicide, and that's really the key to this, is knowing when these structural imbalances were and doing nothing about it and that is just a horrible, horrible tragedy.",

In the meantime, on a much different scale, brand-new fallout in Britney Spears years long legal drama to break free of her conservatorship, support pouring in for the pop star after dramatic testimony which she details what she called \"abusive conservatorship\" and severe mistreatment by her own dad. Spears telling the court she had no control over her life or her finances, making other explosive claims like how she was forced into involuntary medical evaluations and rehab, and she was made to take medication against her will.  Spears also saying \"I want to be able to get married, have a baby. I was told right now under the conservatorship I am not able to get married or have a baby.\" Katie, it is absolutely infuriating to me that they even made her have an IUD. She can't even control her own reproductive, you know, rights, it's outrageous.",

They are supposed to be so that you can help someone live a happy life because they are not in a position where they can take care of themselves in a proper careful way. This is not that. I mean, her testimony about what they've done to her, she likened it to being sex trafficked and to being stuck as a prisoner inside her own home. They are clearly not taking care of her in a way that has anything to do with loving her or wanting her to live the best life that they can to help her through. And when it comes to what the judge is going to say, we'll have to see, you know, the rules and the laws for conservatorships are basically impossible to get out of. And when I watched the documentary \"Framing Britney Spears,\" one thing that stood out to me is they said she wasn't competent enough to hire her own lawyer.  But then they allowed her to be competent enough to sign her entire life away for the rest of her life as a young woman into this lifelong conservatorship.

Governor Cooper, my good friend, great governor, but most important thing, he's a man of enormous integrity. I know he really is. He's doing an incredible job. I'm lucky to have you as a partner, Gov. And as we as we move along here, look, you know, main thing you want to do is start off with -- waves should never start off. Are there -- you have any chairs out there? If you have a chair, sit. Don't stand for me. I was getting -- I was getting to feel really guilty, man. I said that a while ago, as the press will tell you about a year ago, I said, why didn't everybody sit down. And somebody in the front said, I don't have a damn seat. That's why. I don't want to get in trouble. Thank you. I thought you didn't have any seats so I really feel guilty. Folks, look, it's great to be with Mayor Baldwin of Raleigh and Mayor Schewel of Durham and joined by proud Native Son of North Carolina, the administrator of the EPA in Washington D.C. Michael Regan. Where are you, Michael. I'm always worried -- I'm always worried that I'll come back to North Carolina and Michael's with me, that the Governor is going to take him back. But I need him. Look, folks, he's doing one heck of a job at EPA. And if you want to talk about health, think about the environment. Think about what's being done, but we're changing the EPA and it makes a big deal. It's also -- it's also out there across the state encouraging people to get vaccinated as well. I wanted to come to Raleigh thank everyone in this room for everything you're doing to get your community vaccinated. It matters. It matters. You're saving lives. That's not hyperbole. I'm going to remind everybody, we lost 600,000 dead in America in about a year. That's more than every life lost in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, Iraq, Iran across the board, Afghanistan. More lives lost in a year in every major war in the 20th century and the 21st century. And guess what, folks, there are may lives lost all around the world. And America might say this is not -- I didn't plan on saying this, but I'm going anyway. We have an obligation in the United States of America, to live up to who we are. America is only -- is a unique nation. We're the only nation formed based on an idea, an idea, not on ethnicity, not on ideology, an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal. Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal. There are over 100 countries in the world that have no capacity to help themselves right now. None. And that's why I get somewhat criticized, but that's why I've worked so darn hard after being able to nail down in the first 100 days over 60 million doses of vaccine for Americans.

So, that argument doesn't fly. But when it comes to what he's trying -- the argument is trying to make -- he's very out of touch with the current situation when it comes to firearms. First time buyers last year, 40 percent of them were women. More than 50 percent of them were African-Americans. The left is losing this argument. They act -- they're trying to continue this narrative that the only people who buy guns are white supremacists. That's just not true. It's borne out by the data. And the bottom line is that they are buying guns, if you ask them why, to protect themselves from criminals because all these people who are in charge of the Democratic cities are taking away their police.

That's why we're here, we're holding the traffic scenes right now, providing support. We have all our assets here and once that transition comes we'll be a part of that investigation.

If you don't mind, just for people watching so we can be clear (inaudible) who have been accounted for at this time, not necessarily from the collapse but just rather the structure in its entirety, people who are evacuated from the building, that's a question. And regarding the search efforts under the rubble, can you see at all whether anyone has been located and that we've heard reports of people hearing sounds, trying to locate individuals. Can you please (inaudible) you may have found at this point?"

This is an additional two victims that were pulled from the rubble. Now we have now a total of 11 patience that were treated. Of those 11, now we're up to four patients that have been transported. Now, we have been getting what we call, again, sonar sound devices that we're getting from inside the rubble in various areas. And again, it is a very slow and methodical process because every time we start breaching parts of the structure, we do get debris that falls on us. In regard to the structural engineer, we do have structural engineers that are embedded with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue to prevent the building from collapsing on our firefighters as we continue with the search and rescue phase. Again, since 1:48 a.m., Miami-Dade Fire Rescue has not stopped. Again, the optics may seem that there's nothing going on on top, but all operations, I cannot emphasize enough, all operations are occurring underneath the rubble. They are occurring underneath the parking garage where we have teams of firefighters constantly as they continue making cuts, breaches and placing sonar devices, search cams to locate victims. As we make one hole, we access a floor, we continue to the various areas. But to answer the question, we did receive sounds, not necessarily of people talking but sound, what sounds like people banging -- well, not people, but sounds of a possibility of a banging. Short of that, we haven't heard any voices coming from the pile."

They assess the structure every hour. In addition to every hour, they conduct assessments every time there's a weather shift. What we do is we just make sure that again, we place seismic devices on the building to determine that any stress cracks, you know, enlarging from there. We also make sure that we don't have any shifting of the floors. Every time we make a breach underneath the ground, we do have some debris that rains down on the firefighters, and again, what we encountered was some shifting of the debris and eventually we did have a small fire which was extinguished within 20 minutes."

It's not clear that that sound is coming from humans. It is a banging. They are not sure where it's coming from. No human voices involved, but there is a sound. And for officials here, as well as the governor of Florida, this is still very much a search and rescue operation. The other thing is they say it's deceptive. Much of that work, much of the effort to rescue people is going on underneath the surface, under the parking garage. It is there that they are cutting, drilling, digging, working with dogs, tunneling through to try to find and rescue anyone. So much of the work going on underground and still some hope as urban search and rescue teams continue to work throughout the night tonight to try to rescue as many as 99 people still unaccounted for, Dana?"

The other is, Florida International University investigator saying that this building has been sinking at 2 millimeters a year since the 1990s. There has been a lawsuit by residents of the building for cracks in the building, leakage from the pool, construction on the building, a major construction next to the building. Right now, all we have is theories why possibly this tragedy could have occurred but no clear answer yet as to what caused the collapse."

But Steve, the question I have for you, this seems so -- everyone is so measured in their remarks. This seems to me an unfolding catastrophe. If 99 people are still unaccounted for, we are hearing the officials speak of sounds of banging here or there, but that building as I understand it, pancaked. So there's not a whole lot of space in the building that has collapsed. Is there a sense of that menace? Is there a sense that this is a tragedy of really significant proportions, Steve?"

I think there is still hope and still tremendous fear and anxiety, but the fact that it could be 99 has not set in here yet and you are right to point out, the destruction is incredible. When you do look at it, it's not just the edge of this building that was ripped away, it was actually roughly half of 136 condominium units. And the pancake itself of rubble is about three stories high with no space in between. So, it's a devastating scene, hard to imagine people coming out of there. They did rescue 36 overnight but just two pulled from the rubble."

      "utterance": "Well, I just have a comment. I spoke to a builder today who said cracks had to have been visible and now you heard people say, yes, there was a litigation over cracks. And because it was a pancake, that it only means one thing. This building had to have been built structurally wrong. And that's on the architect, the developer and the contractor, and if they have a review every 40 years, they were in the review process to pass the inspection, the reporting is that they were already talking about making structural changes in order to pass inspection. And if you add that to the \"USA Today\" report that says there was a survey done in the '90s that said the structure was sinking, you have to ask yourself, when did the association know about this and if they didn't do anything about it, you're going to see one of the biggest lawsuits in Florida history because its negligent homicide, and that's really the key to this, is knowing when these structural imbalances were and doing nothing about it and that is just a horrible, horrible tragedy."

In the meantime, on a much different scale, brand-new fallout in Britney Spears years long legal drama to break free of her conservatorship, support pouring in for the pop star after dramatic testimony which she details what she called \"abusive conservatorship\" and severe mistreatment by her own dad. Spears telling the court she had no control over her life or her finances, making other explosive claims like how she was forced into involuntary medical evaluations and rehab, and she was made to take medication against her will. Spears also saying \"I want to be able to get married, have a baby. I was told right now under the conservatorship I am not able to get married or have a baby.\" Katie, it is absolutely infuriating to me that they even made her have an IUD. She can't even control her own reproductive, you know, rights, it's outrageous."

Conservatorships are supposed to be about taking care of somebody who can't take care of themselves. They are supposed to be so that you can help someone live a happy life because they are not in a position where they can take care of themselves in a proper careful way. This is not that. I mean, her testimony about what they've done to her, she likened it to being sex trafficked and to being stuck as a prisoner inside her own home. They are clearly not taking care of her in a way that has anything to do with loving her or wanting her to live the best life that they can to help her through. And when it comes to what the judge is going to say, we'll have to see, you know, the rules and the laws for conservatorships are basically impossible to get out of. And when I watched the documentary \"Framing Britney Spears,\" one thing that stood out to me is they said she wasn't competent enough to hire her own lawyer. But then they allowed her to be competent enough to sign her entire life away for the rest of her life as a young woman into this lifelong conservatorship. So, everything that we've seen so far just doesn't add up in terms of being ethical or moral or based in any kind of ability to treat her fairly."

And they have a system set up where now there is a team of lawyers for him, there's a team of lawyers for her. She pays both teams of lawyers, and her lawyers are court-appointed lawyers. So, they didn't have a lot of money to get begin with. Now, they are getting loads of money from Britney. They're going to prolong this because they've hit the jackpot. And it's a Catch-22. So, if they say, you know what, we're going to send you for an evaluation every single day and she says no, I'm fine, I don't want to do that. She's now said she's uncooperative. And then if she goes and talks to the people at the therapy session, says I'm angry, says I'm depressed, well then, she's angry and depressed and she needs to stay in the conservatorship. If you are incapacitated, you do this to someone, but she is not incapacitated. She's putting on shows. She's hosting shows. She's actually paying the salaries of a multitude of people. All she wants to do is have a regular life with a kid and a husband and they are not letting her do that. They are making her work like an animal for their own financial interests."

Are there -- you have any chairs out there? If you have a chair, sit. Don't stand for me. I was getting -- I was getting to feel really guilty, man. I said that a while ago, as the press will tell you about a year ago, I said, why didn't everybody sit down. And somebody in the front said, I don't have a damn seat. That's why. I don't want to get in trouble. Thank you. I thought you didn't have any seats so I really feel guilty. Folks, look, it's great to be with Mayor Baldwin of Raleigh and Mayor Schewel of Durham and joined by proud Native Son of North Carolina, the administrator of the EPA in Washington D.C.

I wanted to come to Raleigh thank everyone in this room for everything you're doing to get your community vaccinated. It matters. It matters. You're saving lives. That's not hyperbole. I'm going to remind everybody, we lost 600,000 dead in America in about a year. That's more than every life lost in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, Iraq, Iran across the board, Afghanistan. More lives lost in a year in every major war in the 20th century and the 21st century. And guess what, folks, there are may lives lost all around the world. And America might say this is not -- I didn't plan on saying this, but I'm going anyway. We have an obligation in the United States of America, to live up to who we are. America is only -- is a unique nation. We're the only nation formed based on an idea, an idea, not on ethnicity, not on ideology, an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal. Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal. There are over 100 countries in the world that have no capacity to help themselves right now. None.

So, that argument doesn't fly. But when it comes to what he's trying -- the argument is trying to make -- he's very out of touch with the current situation when it comes to firearms. First time buyers last year, 40 percent of them were women. More than 50 percent of them were African-Americans. The left is losing this argument. They act -- they're trying to continue this narrative that the only people who buy guns are white supremacists. That's just not true. It's borne out by the data. And the bottom line is that they are buying guns, if you ask them why, to protect themselves from criminals because all these people who are in charge of the Democratic cities are taking away their police.
