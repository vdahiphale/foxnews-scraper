We think this silliness on both sides, with keeping the government closed, and not knowing whether you are going to push up against a debt ceiling, whether you even have a budget process, it's worrying us. And we think we're going to have to take some action if it doesn't improve, and soon. And America's pristine rating, the envy of the world, is now in question as we become the laughingstock of the world.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  And what in the world is going on here?  Whether you are taking the side of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer or the president of the United States and leading Republicans over whether it is justified right now to continue day 19, the 19th day in a row a quarter of the United States government has not been able to function, and whether a battle over a wall or security on the border is justification for that, whether you stand by that or not, and whatever your merit or rationale for that reasoning or not, the fact of the matter is that this fact of the matter is this is the stuff that makes the world look at us and say, you know, um, you guys don't look like you're firing on all cylinders. Now, you wouldn't see it at the corner of Wall and Broad today. We will get into that in just a second. But suffice it to say, unless something dramatically improves in the next 48 hours, we are going to break the record for the longest government shutdown, partial or otherwise, since Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich were going at it in 1995.  Where do we stand right now? Let's go to Blake Burman at the White House.  Blake, amazing.",

You had dueling tweets and comments coming out from the president and Democrats after that about-30-minute-or-so meeting. This was what President Trump had to say about it.   He took to Twitter, wrote the following. He said -- quote -- \"Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked, what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up? Are you going to improve border security, which includes a wall or steel barrier? Nancy said no. I said bye-bye. Nothing else works.\" That's what came just about as Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were out at that very stakeout camera, where you just heard the vice president, Mike Pence, talking, and they too gave their play-by-play.

And you can't do anything. You can't spend any more money, commit to any more funding, do pretty much anything until they raise that debt ceiling.   And what Fitch is saying and what some of these other ratings agencies are worried about is that, at the rate this is going, we're going to get to a point where we're going to hit that ceiling, and no one is going to be able to resolve these differences. So forget about a quarter of the United States government inactive. We could have the entire United States government inactive if you don't find a way to raise some money, and fast.

My understanding is the president is traveling to Texas tomorrow, down to McAllen, Texas. I welcome that. I have been down there plenty of times. And I know I always learn something when I go down there.  So I do think the president's visit to Texas is important to learn what's going on the border. And, at the end of the day, Neil, at the end of the day, I think what's going to happen is, the president is going to have to exercise his executive authority to move money from the Department of Defense to the border and build the wall in the area that he feels is most important.  And I know there are people on my side who don't like that approach. But, at the same time, we just simply can't go on with this impasse.

If Democrats want to be serious about some of the ideas that have been bandied about on the campaign trail, like Medicare for all, potentially a green New Deal, they have to start putting pen to paper and writing it into legislation.

They changed the rules so that they no longer have to have a stand-alone vote on the debt limit. Instead, the vote on their budget would suffice. So what that means is, they can vote for any spending that they want and not say that they want to pay for it because the debt limit will increase as a result of it. Another thing that House Democrats changed in their rules with dynamic scoring, and that's where you get into an argument about what it means to have a lower corporate tax rate. Remember, we're one of the only countries that we compete with that has state corporate tax rates. So when you look at something like a 25 percent...",

We think this silliness on both sides, with keeping the government closed, and not knowing whether you are going to push up against a debt ceiling, whether you even have a budget process, it's worrying us. And we think we're going to have to take some action if it doesn't improve, and soon. And America's pristine rating, the envy of the world, is now in question as we become the laughingstock of the world. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And what in the world is going on here? Whether you are taking the side of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer or the president of the United States and leading Republicans over whether it is justified right now to continue day 19, the 19th day in a row a quarter of the United States government has not been able to function, and whether a battle over a wall or security on the border is justification for that, whether you stand by that or not, and whatever your merit or rationale for that reasoning or not, the fact of the matter is that this fact of the matter is this is the stuff that makes the world look at us and say, you know, um, you guys don't look like you're firing on all cylinders. Now, you wouldn't see it at the corner of Wall and Broad today. We will get into that in just a second. But suffice it to say, unless something dramatically improves in the next 48 hours, we are going to break the record for the longest government shutdown, partial or otherwise, since Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich were going at it in 1995.

You had dueling tweets and comments coming out from the president and Democrats after that about-30-minute-or-so meeting. This was what President Trump had to say about it. He took to Twitter, wrote the following. He said -- quote -- \"Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked, what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up? Are you going to improve border security, which includes a wall or steel barrier? Nancy said no. I said bye-bye.

Here we are in the very early portions of January.

And you can't do anything. You can't spend any more money, commit to any more funding, do pretty much anything until they raise that debt ceiling. And what Fitch is saying and what some of these other ratings agencies are worried about is that, at the rate this is going, we're going to get to a point where we're going to hit that ceiling, and no one is going to be able to resolve these differences. So forget about a quarter of the United States government inactive. We could have the entire United States government inactive if you don't find a way to raise some money, and fast.

My understanding is the president is traveling to Texas tomorrow, down to McAllen, Texas. I welcome that. I have been down there plenty of times. And I know I always learn something when I go down there. So I do think the president's visit to Texas is important to learn what's going on the border. And, at the end of the day, Neil, at the end of the day, I think what's going to happen is, the president is going to have to exercise his executive authority to move money from the Department of Defense to the border and build the wall in the area that he feels is most important. And I know there are people on my side who don't like that approach. But, at the same time, we just simply can't go on with this impasse.

And the catch here is that these are bills that Senate Republicans have supported in one way or another already.

Now, I..."

So, for example, last night, the president talked about drugs coming across the southern border. You know the facts. Those drugs are coming through legal ports of entry. A wall on all the -- all the rest of the border will do nothing to stop that. So, let's just be smart about this."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, but I guess what is confusing me, Senator, is that, in the past -- and both sides are guilty of this. I don't know your personal positions over the years. But it seems to me that Democrats in the past have supported this type of funding. And now, suddenly, because of this president, Republicans claim they are not. Is it fair to say that a way, a middle ground might need to be open to wall or some funding, maybe you can just call it, I don't know, cottage cheese or something, so to get the wall terminology out of the way, so at least talks can advance?"

It's one thing to say hey we like grid and gridlock in D.C., but another when you have both parties at war. And I think that can have a -- we're fragile.

And we were discussing the normal issues that confront us. And we have got to do better at getting a he budget out on regular order anyway. But here, when we look at border security, the president and vice president came into our luncheon here. And our caucus is, I think, fairly steadfast that the merits of the case favor us. Most of the Democrats have been on record very recently for wanting everything we're talking about. It's just that now, at this stage of the game, they think they can get by with doing nothing.

A source close to Rosenstein has always maintained those comments were sarcastic. This morning, the incoming chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee told FOX that he will drill down on the surveillance abuse allegations once he takes the gavel, which happened just a few minutes ago, in fact, adding that Rosenstein will be part of it.

If you want to look at the tea leaves, that may be another indicator the investigation is winding down.

He, after all, did hold this position before. He was held in very high regard. He's extremely popular with the rank and file. And he really cut his teeth as a professional in the Justice Department. He identifies very closely with it. So I think you could not pick a better choice for this time at the Justice Department.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's much more intriguing to look at the Mueller report timing. Rosenstein likely does know when that report is likely to be submitted. Once it does, it will be a furious fight that will go on over how much of the report will be made public, whether it will be given to Congress. The White House may very well ask for a chance to have a reply that's given to Congress when the report is sent over. It is very likely to raise privilege issues. It's very likely to ask for review. All those issues are likely to drag out a bit. He will probably - - Rosenstein probably doesn't want to start that process unless he could finish it. So the question is whether this has more timing to do with that than the incoming attorney general."

TURLEY: Well, many of us expected for a report to be released either at the end of the 2018 or the beginning of 2019. Keep in mind, the special counsel doesn't have to issue a single omnibus report. It could be a couple of reports looking at collusion and another one looking at obstruction. So we don't know what's coming out of that gate. But the anticipation is that the special counsel will be looking at the calendar. There are plenty people in Congress that I think are very uneasy that they're running out of runway, that there's two years left in this administration. Everything is sort of on hold waiting for the report. The Democrats have already said they're going to be sending out subpoenas. There was a suggestion today that Donald Trump Jr. might be the first one to get a subpoena. But it's really the report that the committees are waiting for."

      "utterance": "It's important, you would think, as head of the House Budget Committee, it would start with you, that Medicare should be for everybody, Medicare for all? I support Medicare for all. What we're going to do in the hearing is explore the options that are available to the country to expand health care to everybody through a Medicare-like program, consider the varieties of how we could do that, and what the impact on the budget would be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, that's a $100 billion price tag some are saying, dwarfing the $5 billion for the wall here. That is just for starters. Among some of the plans a lot of Democrats are cooking up in the House to help get better health care coverage for Americans, on even revisiting the idea of a higher top rate for individuals, not necessarily the 70 percent top rate that some have envisioned. Get the read on all that and what the direction the House is going with senior fellow at the Natural Taxpayers Union Mattie Duppler, Democratic strategist Marjorie Clifton. Mattie, he's just new in the job. The House Budget chief seems to be saying, though, I'm open to these ideas. Longer term, they will save money and Americans will be better off. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATTIE DUPPLER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "So something to remember about budgets and the way Congress handles them is, they are not signed into law by the president. Each chamber writes its own. And under normal order, a House and Senate would reconcile their two budgets. Now, I don't think we will see a Democrat House and a Republican Senate reconcile their budget plans. But what we do know about budgets is, they are really a governing document for the vision that party wants to set for America. We saw this with Paul Ryan when he was Budget chairman. He really put forth a lot of the ideas that ended up becoming legislation, like tax reform, that really framed the debate about what the House GOP was all about. So I expect this to be the same for Democrats. If Democrats want to be serious about some of the ideas that have been bandied about on the campaign trail, like Medicare for all, potentially a green New Deal, they have to start putting pen to paper and writing it into legislation. I do think they are going to be in trouble when the American public sees that sticker shock about how much those plans will cost. That's the problem with a budget. You need to actually budget the money for what you want to spend."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, but Republicans are not doing a great job keeping to a budget either. Marjorie, I do want to get your reaction to something else the Budget Committee chief had said, responding to this growing wave among some, not all, Democrats for a higher top rate. Listen to this. All right, I apologize. I thought we had it. We don't."

      "utterance": "Yes."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What he talked about was responding to Congressman Ocasio-Cortez's view of a 70 percent top rate. He wasn't exactly for that, but he did say that the corporate rate has got to be raised, and he will do everything he can on that front, but did say that it's just a matter of time that other rates go up for the rich, et cetera. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLIFTON",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, you have to realize the corporate tax rate was changed pretty dramatically from 20 -- from 35 percent down to 21. And that was a big jump that even Republicans went, that's a little aggressive. So the rate that they're talking about is actually between 25 and 28 percent, which is a little more palatable. I mean, we have a, by 2020, $21 trillion deficit, and that is nothing to sniff out. And issues that are going to be critical are things like immigration and health care."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But isn't weird, though, Marjorie? And I don't blame Democrats. So, don't -- a significant of the blame for Republicans. But both parties have piled up deficits."

      "speaker": "CLIFTON",
      "utterance": "Sure. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Both parties are good at talking a good game and getting budgets into control. And both parties have done miserably."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLIFTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. And so I think that there needs to be a new way of looking at that -- at this. And it's going to be interesting, with a Democratic House, a Republican Senate, how are we going reconcile the budget? And, right now, what we're looking at is hitting that deficit ceiling, which, March 1, goes into effect, which means automatic cuts across the board, so 11 percent in defense spending, 9 percent in all other spending. And there's a lot of people thinking that may be not a bad thing, because who else is going to come up with a solution?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's where we're heading. And that, by the way, that debt ceiling you talk about on March 1, I mean, they either raise that debt ceiling, as they do time and again, or they address it seriously. Mattie, it's one of the reasons why the folks at Fitch Investors, the ratings folks, are saying, you know, your AAA rating, that's not a guaranteed thing. Are they justified in saying that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPPLER",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, we saw that in 2011. And I would say that we have been at an economic expansion ever since the rating agencies called into question the United States' debt rating. Now, I want to revisit what was that just said, though, about how you have to deal with the debt limit. Two important things that House Democrats did when they took control. They changed the rules so that they no longer have to have a stand-alone vote on the debt limit. Instead, the vote on their budget would suffice. So what that means is, they can vote for any spending that they want and not say that they want to pay for it because the debt limit will increase as a result of it. Another thing that House Democrats changed in their rules with dynamic scoring, and that's where you get into an argument about what it means to have a lower corporate tax rate. Remember, we're one of the only countries that we compete with that has state corporate tax rates. So when you look at something like a 25 percent..."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, bottom line, we're not making progress. Marjorie, real quickly, is it your sense that we're going to blow past that deadline and blow past this debt ceiling?"

      "speaker": "CLIFTON",
      "utterance": "It's not starting off on the right foot, especially today with Nancy Pelosi and Trump already at odds."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLIFTON",
      "utterance": "So I can't say I feel a lot of promise. I do think there's an important thing to look out with health care. I don't think that Medicare for all is a palatable option, but there are things that we could look at within the Affordable Care Act that would get us in a better place."
