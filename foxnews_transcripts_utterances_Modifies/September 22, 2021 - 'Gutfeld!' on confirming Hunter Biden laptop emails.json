      "sentences": "Quick. Someone helped him by releasing more blackface photos.  Happy Wednesday. So Politico just published quite the bombshell. Turns out the e-mails from Hunter Biden's laptop were authenticated. Yes, imagine that. Authenticating things we already knew to be true. So what are you going to tell us next? Hunter likes blow in hookers? Who doesn't though? Well done, fellows. Everybody in the media take the year off. Too late. You already had.  Yes. This news comes from a new book. But it's not new to any of us, thanks to the reporting of the New York Post. And it was only because the rest of the media wanted Joe Biden to win that it was buried faster than your kid's guinea pig you accidentally stepped down because you were drunk. But just for old times' sake, let's report the so called news. A person who had independent access to hunter Biden's e-mails confirms to the e-mails the Post published.   Including one about a potential deal with China with the line 10 held by H for the big guy. That is Joe Biden. I'm guessing that 10 though had more zeros following it than Joy Reid's Twitter account. Now, we already knew this because we didn't ignore hundreds of former business partner toady Tony Bobulinski, love that name. He confirmed them up forever ago. The book also confirms that e-mails released by the Swedish government also match e- mails from the laptop. I know. Who knew Sweden had a government? Anyway, but it's that China e-mail that matters. It reveals the Biden's were in cahoots to make a butt load of money with an enemy. That fact would have doomed Joe's election chances if it was treated like the deadly grenade that it was. But thanks to the press and big tech, it didn't. They're more rotten than a month old bag salad. So just for old times'   sake, let's look back at how the compliant media treated this story when it first came out. First, CNN, check out these graphics. First, how the newest anti Biden narrative was manufactured. And U.S. authorities investigating if recently published e-mails are tied to Russian disinformation efforts in targeting Biden. So reliable sources my ass. Now I'd say Stelter should eat some crow but he might go into toxic shock because it's a protein. He's only reliable sources a bucket of raw cookie dough. And remember, NPR, why haven't you seen any stories from NPR about the New York Post Hunter Biden story? Well, we don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories. Yes, right, NPR. You do that. Ignore that story and focus instead on a legally blind transgendered pony who makes a living doing porn. Pretty good stuff. By the way. Here's MSNBC. Why does Rudy Giuliani have access to peddle this disinformation repeatedly?  This is not censorship. Facebook is under no obligation to allow a disputed report that appears to contain disinformation and Joy Reid tweets, good for Joe Biden, no need to dignify a Russian hatchet job. We're not doing e- mails again, America. Come on, Joy. You get any dumber we're going to start calling you Don Lemon. And remember that letter signed by 50 former Intel officers, right, huh?   Hunter Biden's story is Russian disinfo. Dozens of former Intel officials say. Well either they were duped or they were traitors, that letter came together faster than a new Bong at Kat's house. Yet all the hacks swallow that B.S. like it was Beluga caviar. Look at all these jackasses. David Frum, Max Boots, David Corn, Ben Rhodes, Tommy Vietor. Remember Evan McMullin? He doesn't. The list --the list of dolts goes on and on. Thanks to Drew Holden who compiled them. Seriously, that must be a Guinness Book world record for (BLEEP) stack that high. And now it's so cute to see these dopes who painted Trump as a Russian spy while bearing Biden's connection to China, then get mad at the dope they elected. Yes, that same press now cries because the guy they carried to the White House now won't answer their questions.",

But the irony is this rich as a Burisma shareholder, Afghanistan, the drone strike, inflation, COVID, division, polarization, crime and the Haitians who prove living under bridges isn't just for Americans anymore. Just eight short months, Biden turned America from us first to dead last. It's like my favorite blow of dog Gladys. Joe's presidency has quickly deflated.  And like Gladys, he doesn't answer questions either. I prefer it that way.  But remember, he didn't really want to run, he knew he was as done as burnt ribeye. He just wanted to go back to Delaware and wander into neighbor's yards without his pants on. It's like the good old days. So it's all in the press and they still love to bury things. Take the border for months horrifying video relayed the hell that was going on. But they ran from that footage like it was an incoming Zoom call from Jeffrey Toobin. But the media only cared when they found that one image they could use to demonize border control. But now surprise, surprise, the so called whipping has been downgraded to wielding, then whirling and now it's just twirling. What's next? Wooing? They were wooing them. Turns out the only things getting whipped at the border are Joe's and Kamala's asses.   The Washington Post now admits the Border Patrol did not appear to strike anyone. Ye, but you can't unring that bell. The idiots who read their garbage digested that crap hall and will continue to use it every time they argue with the same person. But that paper is now mostly fake stories and corrections. I would line my birdcage with it but then I'd end up with a parrot who will hate America. Praise China. And demand and nonsense gender pronoun. And no Joy. They weren't whips. They were rains.",

That is bonkers. And I think one of the most important things about this revelation from Politico is, it's not like these e-mails were about Hunter Biden's colorful personal life. They were about his foreign business dealings about which his father said he had never heard anything, never spoke to his son. And that appears to be very much contradicted.

      "utterance": "Quick. Someone helped him by releasing more blackface photos. Happy Wednesday. So Politico just published quite the bombshell. Turns out the e-mails from Hunter Biden's laptop were authenticated. Yes, imagine that. Authenticating things we already knew to be true. So what are you going to tell us next? Hunter likes blow in hookers? Who doesn't though? Well done, fellows. Everybody in the media take the year off. Too late. You already had. Yes. This news comes from a new book. But it's not new to any of us, thanks to the reporting of the New York Post. And it was only because the rest of the media wanted Joe Biden to win that it was buried faster than your kid's guinea pig you accidentally stepped down because you were drunk. But just for old times' sake, let's report the so called news. A person who had independent access to hunter Biden's e-mails confirms to the e-mails the Post published. Including one about a potential deal with China with the line 10 held by H for the big guy. That is Joe Biden. I'm guessing that 10 though had more zeros following it than Joy Reid's Twitter account. Now, we already knew this because we didn't ignore hundreds of former business partner toady Tony Bobulinski, love that name. He confirmed them up forever ago. The book also confirms that e-mails released by the Swedish government also match e- mails from the laptop. I know. Who knew Sweden had a government? Anyway, but it's that China e-mail that matters. It reveals the Biden's were in cahoots to make a butt load of money with an enemy. That fact would have doomed Joe's election chances if it was treated like the deadly grenade that it was. But thanks to the press and big tech, it didn't. They're more rotten than a month old bag salad. So just for old times' sake, let's look back at how the compliant media treated this story when it first came out. First, CNN, check out these graphics. First, how the newest anti Biden narrative was manufactured. And U.S. authorities investigating if recently published e-mails are tied to Russian disinformation efforts in targeting Biden. So reliable sources my ass. Now I'd say Stelter should eat some crow but he might go into toxic shock because it's a protein. He's only reliable sources a bucket of raw cookie dough. And remember, NPR, why haven't you seen any stories from NPR about the New York Post Hunter Biden story? Well, we don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories. Yes, right, NPR. You do that. Ignore that story and focus instead on a legally blind transgendered pony who makes a living doing porn. Pretty good stuff. By the way. Here's MSNBC. Why does Rudy Giuliani have access to peddle this disinformation repeatedly? This is not censorship. Facebook is under no obligation to allow a disputed report that appears to contain disinformation and Joy Reid tweets, good for Joe Biden, no need to dignify a Russian hatchet job. We're not doing e- mails again, America. Come on, Joy. You get any dumber we're going to start calling you Don Lemon. And remember that letter signed by 50 former Intel officers, right, huh? Hunter Biden's story is Russian disinfo. Dozens of former Intel officials say. Well either they were duped or they were traitors, that letter came together faster than a new Bong at Kat's house. Yet all the hacks swallow that B.S. like it was Beluga caviar. Look at all these jackasses. David Frum, Max Boots, David Corn, Ben Rhodes, Tommy Vietor. Remember Evan McMullin? He doesn't. The list --the list of dolts goes on and on. Thanks to Drew Holden who compiled them. Seriously, that must be a Guinness Book world record for (BLEEP) stack that high. And now it's so cute to see these dopes who painted Trump as a Russian spy while bearing Biden's connection to China, then get mad at the dope they elected. Yes, that same press now cries because the guy they carried to the White House now won't answer their questions."

Just eight short months, Biden turned America from us first to dead last. It's like my favorite blow of dog Gladys. Joe's presidency has quickly deflated. And like Gladys, he doesn't answer questions either. I prefer it that way. But remember, he didn't really want to run, he knew he was as done as burnt ribeye. He just wanted to go back to Delaware and wander into neighbor's yards without his pants on. It's like the good old days. So it's all in the press and they still love to bury things. Take the border for months horrifying video relayed the hell that was going on. But they ran from that footage like it was an incoming Zoom call from Jeffrey Toobin. But the media only cared when they found that one image they could use to demonize border control. But now surprise, surprise, the so called whipping has been downgraded to wielding, then whirling and now it's just twirling. What's next? Wooing? They were wooing them.

Ye, but you can't unring that bell. The idiots who read their garbage digested that crap hall and will continue to use it every time they argue with the same person. But that paper is now mostly fake stories and corrections. I would line my birdcage with it but then I'd end up with a parrot who will hate America. Praise China. And demand and nonsense gender pronoun. And no Joy. They weren't whips. They were rains."

That is bonkers. And I think one of the most important things about this revelation from Politico is, it's not like these e-mails were about Hunter Biden's colorful personal life. They were about his foreign business dealings about which his father said he had never heard anything, never spoke to his son. And that appears to be very much contradicted.
