This hearing needs to be about establishing a pattern of facts, a timeline, and getting direct testimony on the record. When did you know and -- what did you know and when did you know it? And then you can present that evidence to the American people and that's how you get to the truth and accountability. Kabul did not fall in 11 days, Dana. That is a lie. It took months for the Afghan army to desert and surrender. The Taliban takeover came after three months. Biden was briefed by the intelligence agencies, State Department cables went out, embassy cables went out. Biden knew in July that the Taliban was taking over because he got on the phone call with the Afghan president and said lie for me. Make sure it looks better on the ground so I get help politically and then maybe I'll give you a little more air support. So the lies cost lives, and we need to know the facts. So, Al Qaeda's back in Afghanistan and we have dead Marines and we have a huge technology transfer to the Chinese military, which we're going to have to deal with in the Pacific. And now we're importing all these child brides. We're bringing in thousands of Afghan men who married 12 years old, Cruz got into that. Where are these people going to live, Dana? In America we call them child molesters. They're not going to live in Antony Blinken's neighborhood. So what are we going to do with them? So, if this was a Republican president, he'd already have impeachment hearings. They -- the Democrats go after these hearings like litigators doing a homicide trial.

They were denying people coming into the airport and they were telling people to come to the airport when they couldn't get there because the Taliban wasn't letting them through, for weeks on end. The bipartisan nature of this I thought was interesting, and based on the idea that when you listen to each of them speak today and this happened a lot yesterday in the House, every single senator and congressman has a story linked to trying to getting somebody out of Afghanistan. And it is, you know, the job of congressional offices and offices in the Senate to help get people home, but it really is the State Department's job. And for the administration up to this point to keep saying that this was a successful airlift, it was a successful evacuation, when you have senators and congressmen still getting phone calls from Americans and SIVs who are stuck in Afghanistan that really makes it a lot closer to each of their offices and the work that they're doing.",

And McKenzie, General McKenzie says, why don't you take it, I'll just take the airport.

I'm actually trying to get my people vaccinated and you coming in with this heavy federal government push is just making it much harder for me. The other thing is in the Washington Post today, there's this big piece about the concern that the vaccine hesitancy about COVID could actually spill over into other vaccines like for chickenpox, measles, polio, things like that. What's interesting to me about that is where was that concern a year ago to almost to the day when Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were running for president and vice president, and they said they would be unwilling to take the vaccine if it was approved under a Trump presidency.

The other thing I would add, because I know other people got to get in here is that when you go through this vaccine, and you want people to take the vaccine, I think it would be perfectly honest to say who's not taking it. PhDs aren't taking it. There's a huge number of medical experts who aren't taking it. And the African American Community, 40 percent have been vaccinated.

This hearing needs to be about establishing a pattern of facts, a timeline, and getting direct testimony on the record. When did you know and -- what did you know and when did you know it? And then you can present that evidence to the American people and that's how you get to the truth and accountability. Kabul did not fall in 11 days, Dana. That is a lie. It took months for the Afghan army to desert and surrender. The Taliban takeover came after three months. Biden was briefed by the intelligence agencies, State Department cables went out, embassy cables went out. Biden knew in July that the Taliban was taking over because he got on the phone call with the Afghan president and said lie for me. Make sure it looks better on the ground so I get help politically and then maybe I'll give you a little more air support. So the lies cost lives, and we need to know the facts. So, Al Qaeda's back in Afghanistan and we have dead Marines and we have a huge technology transfer to the Chinese military, which we're going to have to deal with in the Pacific. And now we're importing all these child brides. We're bringing in thousands of Afghan men who married 12 years old, Cruz got into that. Where are these people going to live, Dana? In America we call them child molesters. They're not going to live in Antony Blinken's neighborhood. So what are we going to do with them? So, if this was a Republican president, he'd already have impeachment hearings. They -- the Democrats go after these hearings like litigators doing a homicide trial. Republicans, you act like it's a debate club. No. We want answers, we deserve answers and we're not going to get it if you beat around the bush."

A huge moment in his time as Secretary of State, for better or for worse, and I did like the dynamic better in person. It needs to be treated with respect especially since we lost American lives, 13, and 18 wounded. But it felt like a bipartisan shellacking to me. It felt like yesterday was longer time limits.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, the State Department has now tried to kind of take credit for these private group and organizations that have been able to get people out when the government has failed to do so. And when the Secretary of State was asked if the State Department, you know, didn't allow certain flights to take off, if they were denying people access to the airport, the answer from the Secretary of State was no, when we know from talking to a number of people and from sourcing that they were denying flights taking off. They were denying people coming into the airport and they were telling people to come to the airport when they couldn't get there because the Taliban wasn't letting them through, for weeks on end. The bipartisan nature of this I thought was interesting, and based on the idea that when you listen to each of them speak today and this happened a lot yesterday in the House, every single senator and congressman has a story linked to trying to getting somebody out of Afghanistan. And it is, you know, the job of congressional offices and offices in the Senate to help get people home, but it really is the State Department's job. And for the administration up to this point to keep saying that this was a successful airlift, it was a successful evacuation, when you have senators and congressmen still getting phone calls from Americans and SIVs who are stuck in Afghanistan that really makes it a lot closer to each of their offices and the work that they're doing."

It turns out that 18 million Afghans depend on the government to live for their food and clothing. So, congratulations Taliban. You got a country to run, all right. Not just people to behead. You actually got to do other stuff, so they want some aid. And they also say thank you very much but can we have more. So they want more. I don't see why we give them anything but you go ahead, you want more. So, I want you to see -- the big thing was over the last few days is it's Trump's fault. It was Trump's deal, we had no choice. So the guy that's professionally and undoing everything President Trump does, and I think Joe Biden takes great pride in it, everything Donald Trump does, he undoes. When it comes to Taliban deal, well, this is iron clad. This is the deal that Trump had. Its six pages. My health club contract is harder to get out of than this. It is as generic as it gets. Anyone can get out of this. And you almost went to law school or you did go to Syracuse thought you were at the bottom of your class. You could have handled how to get out of this agreement. And so I texted Mike Pompeo and I said to -- where was the deal? What's the big difference?"

We had constant deterrent. We would hit them as soon as they broke this agreement. And (inaudible) the butcher, they said to him flat out, if you break any of these, you take any of these provinces, I know where you live. We will kill you like we just killed Soleimani. And he got that. That's why he called at the edge of Kabul and said do you want me to take it or do you want to take it? And McKenzie, General McKenzie says, why don't you take it, I'll just take the airport. Can we just honestly say that's one of the stupidest responses to the Taliban, and there's been a lot that I've ever heard in my life. I could not have been more frustrated because not one Democrat did what Joe Lieberman did, what Senator Lugar did to President Bush, what Senator Hagel did. They questioned war decisions, they forgot about party. Nobody forgot what party they were in today on the Democratic side even though Menendez did say, well, we're going to find out about that, but there was more kissing his butt than calling him out."

But I will say it's been a long time since Ronald Reagan was governor of California, but conservatives have been making up some ground in these more conservative districts and I think that people in California, including minorities, care a lot about crime and homelessness affecting their communities and the places that they live. And it's interesting to me, to ask the question to someone like Gavin Newsom or President Joe Biden. To all the Democrats who are voting against Gavin Newsom or are the Donald Trump?

They get to smile for all the cameras. And all of the working class people serving them have to be faceless, they are masked and we've seen this as a habit with the left. And she claims to be fighting for the people and I watched a video of her having her train carried through the carpet into the Met by a bunch of people working there who were masked. We saw Nancy Pelosi do this with her big outdoor dinner while the servants, many people of color, by the way, you know, serving them. We saw this with President Obama's party. So this idea now of the left and the elites allowing the pandemic -- and they've never had to deal with it. They all flew in on private jets, they don't have to worry about vaccine mandates for their commercial travel if they want to go see their family. But the people that they think should serve them and work for them, they have to be subjugated to all these rules. So, it's not about her dress. It's not about criticizing her body, as she said in her defense of this. This is about Marxism and what -- communism at its core, which is the elites get to do whatever you want, and all the peasants and the little people have to serve them and they have to obey all the rules that they want to just go to work for a day."

And the Republicans have taken a different tack in the last several years that they're more of the party of the working class. And you might start to see a little bit more of this if the Republicans can figure out how to do this. She didn't pay for the ticket. The ticket was donated. Do you think that the person who donated the ticket to the nonprofit fundraiser didn't deduct that from their taxes? Of course they did. And they didn't show up in hybrid cars, and Green New Deal vehicles. They are right now trying to pass a $3.5 trillion bill and reverse engineering it like it's going to help all sorts of people. And the trust in government is at such a low ebb right now that -- I mean, I don't know if he's going to pass or not. The thing for her is she knows how to get attention. She does very well.

AOC hasn't ever written a bill that's gotten out of committee her entire career. She just lets Nancy and Chuck do it with a roomful of lobbyists. They carve out the loopholes.

So, maybe on the masking thing, if that -- if we really truly believe that masks were going to be the end-all cure-all, maybe you could have an argument about that. But we're actually talking about vaccines. And all the governors -- for example, I think Asa Hutchinson from Arkansas had a very good point. It's like, what are you doing? I'm actually trying to get my people vaccinated and you coming in with this heavy federal government push is just making it much harder for me. The other thing is in the Washington Post today, there's this big piece about the concern that the vaccine hesitancy about COVID could actually spill over into other vaccines like for chickenpox, measles, polio, things like that. What's interesting to me about that is where was that concern a year ago to almost to the day when Kamala Harris and Joe Biden were running for president and vice president, and they said they would be unwilling to take the vaccine if it was approved under a Trump presidency.

Not only that, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, partly an apologist or, you know, apologist for Trump or anybody else, he says, listen, you don't want to do that. I have conversations with people in my office to describe why they should get the vaccine, what rDNA technology is. The other thing I would add, because I know other people got to get in here is that when you go through this vaccine, and you want people to take the vaccine, I think it would be perfectly honest to say who's not taking it. PhDs aren't taking it. There's a huge number of medical experts who aren't taking it. And the African American Community, 40 percent have been vaccinated.

The natural immunity conversation is obviously a huge element in all of this. And I think that's why it was part of the Biden vaccine mandate that you could also get tested on a weekly basis, and that would cover you in terms of being vaccinated. Like, you can get on an airplane, you can do all of those things. The Kaiser Family Foundation who I think really leads the way in terms of great data when it comes to health care, has a lot of interesting information about who people turn to when they want advice from this, and its friends and family and your personal doctor. That's where people are getting most of this information. I think that is a good thing. But I also do you know that a lot of private businesses have welcomed Biden's mandate because they don't want to be the ones to say you're going to lose your job if you don't do this, they can now say, these are the rules. And we have seen huge spikes in people getting vaccinated because of it. And we know that that does count -- cut down on your chance of ending up on a ventilator in a hospital and that is a good thing."

This is a workaround through the Labor Department that Congress has not authorized the Labor Department to do this. This is a major rule. So, this is not going to fly. And a new thing that just broke. Hospitalizations, they keep talking about overwhelming hospitalizations. It's not necessarily people going in because they have COVID. They're going in for other things, and they happen to pop positive for COVID."
