We are getting brand new information on the charges against Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and singer R. Kelly. Both facing some stunning charges tonight related to sexual offenses. And there heat also on labor secretary Alexander Acosta for his questionable handling of another very high-profile sexual impropriety case. On a Friday night, a breaking news on “The Story.”  But first tonight, the message from presidential candidates who supported former \"Empire\" star Jussie Smollett, is that regardless of whatever happened, they say it should not detract from this.",

Just last year, the FBI released statistics that revealed a 17 percent increase in the number of hate crimes in America.\" Smollett is hardly the only hoax perpetrated on the public in the name of gaining the aura of what is now referred to as victimhood chic or convincing the public that Trumpism leads to bigotry.  Here are just a few of the examples of similar acts since President Trump was elected. Indiana, Hitler references and gay slurs spray-painted on St. David's Episcopal Church right after the election. Trump backers were blamed.   But it turned out that it was the organist at the church. He was a gay man who said that he was fearful about the outcome of the election and he wanted others to \"be scared with me.\" In New York, 18-year-old Yasmin Seweid shocked the city in 2016 with a terrible story about Trump supporters who had screamed at her on the subway and tried to rip off her hijab. Two weeks later, she admitted she had made the whole thing up. And in Michigan, when graffiti saying KKK and leave n-word, kept showing up over the course of a month at Eastern Michigan University. It turned out that it was coming from a former African-American student who had gone there.   And, of course, the recent Covington high school boys, who Nathan Phillips claimed were attacking four black individuals on the plaza in Washington, D.C. But then the tape later revealed that it was actually the opposite. Members of the Black Israelites were, in fact, taunting the boys, calling them incest babies among other things. My next guest has written extensively about hate crime statistics as they actually exist in this country. Robby Soave is the associate editor at Reason, and the author of the upcoming book Panic Attack: Young Radicals In The Age of Trump. Robby, good to have you here tonight.",

What is actually going on in the country, is it something to be concerned about? Is it epidemic? What have you found when it comes to hate crimes?   Absolutely. If you look at the data that the federal government specifically, the FBI compiles relating to hate crimes, you find that, well, yes it would appear that there was a slight increase from 2016 to 2017. Actually, many more police agencies submitted data in the latter year. So, what looks like arise could just be the fact that now we have more municipalities being counted.  I went that all the way back to 1996 and found actually the number of hate crimes total overall was higher than even what they counted today with all the additional police office's submitting data. If you look like in the long term, you see kind of fluctuations year to year. But they don't really connect to anything they're just it happens to do with who's submitting data and how good a job they're doing. It does not support this kind of narrative that the country is getting more frightening and more horrifying for black people, gay people, et cetera.",

If you look not only at the different municipalities that are reporting these things. But also what they report, each state defines hate crimes differently. What's a hate crime in one place may not be in another. And it's important to point out that during the Clinton-era -- you know, the 1990s, hate crimes were being reported in a much higher rate.

FBI and court records also show that Epstein put together a network of underaged girls and forced them to perform sex acts at his Palm Beach mansion and he was suspected of trafficking minors from overseas to various sex parties at his homes around the world. Bottom line, he was facing a 53-page indictment and a life sentence in maximum security prison and, yet, ended up serving 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach county jail allowed to leave six days a week to go to work. How is that possible? Well, that's where Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta comes in. In 2007, Acosta was Miami's top prosecutor and accepted a deal called a non- prosecution agreement, which allowed Jeffrey Epstein to plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court and get immunity from federal charges. The deal also protected Epstein's accomplices meaning if ever well-known influential people were also having sex with minors they would not be prosecuted. And to top it all off, the alleged victims had no recourse. In fact, the victims' attorneys say it's as if Acosta allowed Epstein to write up the agreement. But now a federal judge in Florida says prosecutors led by Acosta broke the law by signing the deal with Epstein without notifying his sex abuse victims. The Labor Department is now defending Acosta's actions saying the decisions, quote, \"were approved by department leadership and followed departmental procedures.\" Three House Democrats Jackie Speier, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Lois Frankel are calling on President Trump to demand Acosta's resignation and today the president said this.

Joining me now Lisa Boothe, Jessica Tarlov, and Susan Li. All, I mean, it's just unbelievable. You get which is the next shoe to drop. But with regard to Jussie Smollett which I should mention which was not in that intro he is claiming that he has been wronged that due process has not been carried out for him. And I just want to be on the record saying that he, you know, this process is ongoing although it is pretty easy to say that it looks not so good for him.",

Here are just a few of the examples of similar acts since President Trump was elected. Indiana, Hitler references and gay slurs spray-painted on St. David's Episcopal Church right after the election. Trump backers were blamed. But it turned out that it was the organist at the church. He was a gay man who said that he was fearful about the outcome of the election and he wanted others to \"be scared with me.\" In New York, 18-year-old Yasmin Seweid shocked the city in 2016 with a terrible story about Trump supporters who had screamed at her on the subway and tried to rip off her hijab. Two weeks later, she admitted she had made the whole thing up. And in Michigan, when graffiti saying KKK and leave n-word, kept showing up over the course of a month at Eastern Michigan University. It turned out that it was coming from a former African-American student who had gone there. And, of course, the recent Covington high school boys, who Nathan Phillips claimed were attacking four black individuals on the plaza in Washington, D.C. But then the tape later revealed that it was actually the opposite. Members of the Black Israelites were, in fact, taunting the boys, calling them incest babies among other things."

What is actually going on in the country, is it something to be concerned about? Is it epidemic? What have you found when it comes to hate crimes? Absolutely. If you look at the data that the federal government specifically, the FBI compiles relating to hate crimes, you find that, well, yes it would appear that there was a slight increase from 2016 to 2017. Actually, many more police agencies submitted data in the latter year. So, what looks like arise could just be the fact that now we have more municipalities being counted. I went that all the way back to 1996 and found actually the number of hate crimes total overall was higher than even what they counted today with all the additional police office's submitting data. If you look like in the long term, you see kind of fluctuations year to year. But they don't really connect to anything they're just it happens to do with who's submitting data and how good a job they're doing.

The increase had to do with bomb threats made by a single person, a teenager who is crazy who lived in Israel. That he made against Jewish institutions. Which is terrible, don't get me wrong. But again there's -- this is not -- there's no evidence there that this is some actual increase in violence and that it has something to do with our current political situation.

If you look not only at the different municipalities that are reporting these things. But also what they report, each state defines hate crimes differently. What's a hate crime in one place may not be in another. And it's important to point out that during the Clinton-era -- you know, the 1990s, hate crimes were being reported in a much higher rate.

We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible, promotes the values of the NFL and is lawful which I guess some people would find interesting given some of what we've seen.

They charged him with two misdemeanor counts, could get up to 60 days in jail as the highest possible penalty. That's not going to happen. They'll offer him diversion like any first-time offenders or pay a minor fine. What he's not charged with, Martha, and it's important for people to understand that. He's not charged with human trafficking. It's alleged that the girls were trafficked but there's no allegation that he knew or should have known that they were."

This one was a spa, you know, probably the like a strip mall spa, like the kind of place people go to get their nails done and that kind of thing and they said where the girls were sleeping there and eating in the back backdoor and not leaving, never, never leaving the building, Mark."

So if they don't want to be performing these acts, and they are they are being trafficked, I'm questioning why they let them do these acts for a period of time to be able to arrest 25 people."

What, against people like Bob Kraft who will literally pay in the worst case scenario, assuming he's guilty of both charges and I don't know what the evidence is, he'll pay a fine like most first-time offenders, big deal. So the answer is you want to protect the victims but they engage in at least 25 separate acts. You got 25 different John's and they didn't want to do that."

Congratulations to Kelly and her entire family. Now, Kelly Knight craft took the diplomatic post back in October 2017. She is the first woman to hold this position. Originally, coming from Kentucky, she served in a diplomatic role overseeing U.S. engagement in Africa under President George W Bush. She's married to Joe Craft. He runs Alliance Resource Partners. It's the third largest coal producer in the United States. Now, this is a position the President has been waiting to fill for several months after former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley announced at the end of last year she was returning to private life. And Knight-Craft's nomination comes after Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman and our former Fox News colleague announced she was withdrawing her name for personal reasons just last week. But now the focus is on Kelly Knight Craft who won't just walk into the position, shall face Senate confirmation, and the Trump administration wants to get her up to speed and up to the U.N. as soon as possible.

The fact is the President has fulfilled yet another promise to protect human life and I think this is a very important one.

And I think it's disingenuous for any of the Democrats whether it's Jay Inslee of Washington or Nancy Pelosi to somehow pretend that all that Planned Parenthood is out there to do is to provide contraceptive services and to help women have better health. It's an abortion clinic. That's basically what they do. And most of the other things, even pap smears and mammograms, they don't actually do it at Planned Parenthood. They simply are the middleman and they refer it to someone else. Why don't we get the middleman out of it and let people get those services? We all think that's a good thing.

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. What's paramount in this case is that some 80 women came forward claiming that from 2001 to 2006 they were molested and abused by billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. FBI and court records also show that Epstein put together a network of underaged girls and forced them to perform sex acts at his Palm Beach mansion and he was suspected of trafficking minors from overseas to various sex parties at his homes around the world. Bottom line, he was facing a 53-page indictment and a life sentence in maximum security prison and, yet, ended up serving 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach county jail allowed to leave six days a week to go to work. How is that possible? Well, that's where Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta comes in. In 2007, Acosta was Miami's top prosecutor and accepted a deal called a non- prosecution agreement, which allowed Jeffrey Epstein to plead guilty to prostitution charges in state court and get immunity from federal charges. The deal also protected Epstein's accomplices meaning if ever well-known influential people were also having sex with minors they would not be prosecuted. And to top it all off, the alleged victims had no recourse. In fact, the victims' attorneys say it's as if Acosta allowed Epstein to write up the agreement. But now a federal judge in Florida says prosecutors led by Acosta broke the law by signing the deal with Epstein without notifying his sex abuse victims. The Labor Department is now defending Acosta's actions saying the decisions, quote, \"were approved by department leadership and followed departmental procedures.\" Three House Democrats Jackie Speier, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Lois Frankel are calling on President Trump to demand Acosta's resignation and today the president said this. Watch."

      "utterance": "Yes. I just want to bring up this woman Carmia Tang because she represents so many other people in Chicago who are fighting to have their cases be the focus of attention. Her son was murdered, shot in Chicago, shot and killed in Chicago. Where is his national media attention, she says. Parents and families of gun violence matter, too. Can we please get the same efforts and national media attention that Smollett got with his alleged attack? You know, Jessica, there comes a point obviously a big story, people are interested in it across the nation. But there comes a point where I almost don't want to -- I don't want to say his name anymore because it is horrible that he has gotten more attention than these stories."

      "utterance": "And I think that's what the team behind \"Empire\" felt when they cut him out of the last two episodes. Not only was this very upsetting for the cast and crew members they are part of the \"Empire\" family. But I think they were trying to do their part to remove this from the national consciousness because it has been so difficult. I agree with Lisa that the Chicago Police Department must feel that they have an ironclad case here against him for them to come out so passionately. And I would say as well, people should look at the interview that Rahm Emanuel gave. He was very emotional there talking about what they have done in that city to try to tamp down on gun violence and to change the narrative about Chicago and the damage that this has done because of it. And I think it's also important when you look at the Chicago Police Department to think about what happened with Laquan McDonald, for instance, a story that got all of our attention --"

      "utterance": "Yes. So, he was making $125,000 an episode. He did this to boost up his salary. He already made $7 million and he was trying to rival the stars of the show like Terrence Howard and Taraji Henson who are famous before they got to \"Empire.\" This to me is entitlements and he's pretty much ruined his career because Disney bought off 21st Century Fox. They don't want anything to do with bad press. They are very image conscious and I think this is probably the worst career move he could have made?"

Kelly also with Justin Fairfax some of that getting attention and then also with Robert Kraft is the fact that law enforcement is involved in all three of these incidents. My understanding is with the Justin Fairfax case Vanessa Tyson has gone to the Suffolk County district attorney. So, the good news is at least they are going to a place where --"

It said this. \"I was watching your show last night with my mom and I notice an error on the screen when Martha goes to commercial breaks. And there's an error on the keyboard and a z is where the y should be. I seem to always notice details,\" Carson says like this. \"And I thought Martha would want to know, too. And Carson, you could not be more correct. He says, \"I try to write to her but I'm not allowed to have a social media account yet,\" which means you have a very smart mom, Carson. \"I'm only 12 years old. Thank you, and have a good night. I have to get back to my homework now.\" Good catch, Carson. I am a stickler for typos of any kind. So, you and I are on the same wavelength. We are so happy that you corrected that and please let us know, Carson, if we get anything else wrong. Thank you. We read all of your e-mail and you are about to see we listen. This is for \"The Story\" tonight on a Friday night. We will see you back here on Monday. Tucker is up next but first, watch closely, Carson, we fixed it. I promise.
