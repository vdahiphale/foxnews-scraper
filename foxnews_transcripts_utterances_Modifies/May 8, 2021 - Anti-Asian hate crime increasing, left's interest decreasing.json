Systemic radicalism. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Now you may be breathing a sigh of relief if your son or daughter was stuck in virtual learning and is now back in the classroom. But do you really know what your school system is getting ready to marinate your kids in next fall. It's called the anti-racist curriculum and instituting it has been one of the main goals of the far-left BLM movement for years. The killing of George Floyd last May gave them the moral cover to shame quivering white liberals into giving into their demands. Activists guilted suburban women, nervous kids and goofy millennials to supportive hashtags. They posted them all last May as you remember, and June. And companies wrote huge checks to BLM to avoid being targeted. Big city mayors empathized with an even join social justice protests, as looters and violent rioters caused massive damage all around. Even Mitt Romney got into the act. He is so cool. What Mitt probably didn't understand was that it was never about standing up for equal justice for Black Americans. It was always about a full-blown revolution, a series of moves designed to completely upend American society. And the only way to really accomplish that is by changing how and what we teach our kids. So, they want to control language, instill fear, and enforce rules with explicit and implicit threats. And of course, some cases life altering punishment. Enter the twisted notion of what the anti-racist curriculum really is. It's largely the brainchild of people like Ibram Kendi. And in the body is there supposed aim of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in our schools. The acronym DEI, in this case, stands for divisive, erroneous and insidious, or insipid, or invidious. You take your pick. Now, the entire premise of this sicko undertaking is that America is systemically racist, that white privilege has infected the entire country and from the founding, by the way, and that it all has to be remade according to new, very subjective DEI standards. Schools, both public and private, are scrambling to hire DEI consultants who get paid big bucks to tell them how racist their school is, how racist it always was. And then they begin to put in new systems in place of the old systems to cleanse them of their inherent bias. Now, remember, though, the learning and all that unlearning never ends, because it's all deeply embedded.",

A survey I received today from Fairfax County Public Schools in Northern Virginia shows how this is all going down. In order to justify what they are planning, which is a new anti-racist curriculum, the county solicited responses and input from community members. Parents and others are asked to react to a slew of inane statements taken right out of a BLM workshop. Now, their idea of an evolved educational environment is where, \"multiple identities\" are valued and affirm - affirmed. And get this, that multiple identities are taught about in the schools. What does that mean? Well, who needs Socrates, Shakespeare and Tocqueville and Melville, when your kids can learn from the brilliant thinkers like Robin DiAngelo and Mr. Kendi.

Now, you got to hand it to these folks. They've created an entire industry around stoking white guilt and shaking down wimpy corporate bigwigs and then pressuring school bureaucracies that just crumble and fall right over. The Fairfax County survey addresses curriculum materials to represent different races and identities. And my personal favorite survey question is whether the curriculum used in Fairfax County should teach students how to challenge power and privilege in society. Guess challenge your teacher when you don't get the right grade. And it even advances the hilarious proposition that teaching methods focused on being anti-racist and anti- biased would advance academic excellence and somehow accelerate learning. Oh, my god! Well, this survey in Fairfax County is being replicated and distributed nationwide, versions of it. And unsuspecting parents have no clue about what's about to hit their kids. These radicals want to graduate agitators, graduate activists and graduate comrades in an anti-American movement that our enemies abroad are thrilled to see taking root. Look at questions 33 through 35. Teachers should have materials to guide them in creating anti-racist and anti-bias curriculum environments. Teaching methods should offer students' ways to take action against racial and social injustice. Give students opportunities to recognize injustices that individuals create, biased-based beliefs and languages, and that systems create discrimination and oppression. Well, parents are finally beginning to catch on to this madness just moments ago. It's just happened. Fairfax County Schools held an open forum for parents and a dad who had just returned from deployment leveled a stinging indictment of this entire BLM-sponsored curriculum idea.",

Zoom into your school board meetings if you have to, or go in person, if you can. Run for school board positions when they become available as elections in Texas showed us this week. You can actually win and make a huge difference. Don't be afraid. They want you afraid. The corporate media won't show you what the \"Angle\" revealed tonight. They don't even want their own viewers to know about it. It's that radical. But you deserve to know what's happening in the American public school system. And if this can happen just miles from the Washington monument, it can happen anywhere, and it is happening. Now, we have some good governors who are working to ban this poisonous ideology. But if you live in a blue state or in a liberal county, this is probably already occurring right under your noses. The Democrats have tied themselves to an anti-American ideology committed to poisoning the minds of our children against what is the greatest country that the world has ever seen. This should be an issue until the Democrats are shellacked at the polls for encouraging Americans to hate each other and hate their own country. And that's the \"Angle\". Joining me now Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at Hoover; and Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative author, filmmaker and host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast. Dinesh, now the following is a real line in the sand moment that we discussed and following this issue tonight. You're either in or out, you're either an anti-racist with an agenda to work with BLM, or you're basically a racist, whether you admit it or not. That's how serious this is. DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Yes, absolutely. This is actually a way to bring Marxism to America by taking the old category of class and substituting race. Race works better for these people than class because there is, in fact, a deep racial history in America. But of course, America is a different society now than it was, let's say, 1950, let alone in 1850. In fact, if you made a kind of hierarchy today of the groups that are doing best in academic performance and economic success, they would be Asian- Indians, then you'd have the Japanese, then you'd have the Chinese, essentially, the Asian-Americans dominate the ethnic groups at the top. So where is this white privilege? Whites are actually not at the top of the totem pole of American society anymore. The only category in which whites are on top is accumulated wealth, which of course reflects the legacy of the past. But it's very difficult for these critical race theory people to explain why Orientals and Asian- Americans are doing the best, because obviously they're not discriminating against anybody. They are outperforming everybody. And so merit here is what's responsible for these differences in performance. But that has to be concealed, it has to be hidden, it has to be denied. So critical race theory is a massive pretense to get away from the idea of merit and substitute the bogus category of contemporary racial oppression.",

Because in the most recent high-profile attacks, the assailants don't quite fit the left's narrative. Now, what do I mean? Let's look at some of the recent examples. On Monday night, two Asian women in New York City were attacked by a hammer wielding maniac. Does she look like a white supremacist Trump supporter? Well, doesn't look like it. Neither does this person who viciously assaulted two Asian women Tuesday morning at a Baltimore liquor store. The man you see beating that poor woman with a cinderblock is believed to be Daryl Doles. He has since been arrested and charged by police. Again, the media told us basically there was MAGA hat wearing bigots carrying out these attacks, yet time and again we see that's not the case. Hence the media silence. But perhaps they're also silent because the soft on crime policies they champion are responsible for some of these heinous attacks. In fact, according to KGO in San Francisco, on Friday a man named Sidney Hammond allegedly brutally assaulted an Asian man walking his one- year-old child in a stroller. Hammond was arrested and released less than a month ago for an assault at that very same location. Joining me now is Ying Ma, author of \"Chinese Girl in the Ghetto,\" and Harmeet Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberty and a civil rights attorney.

Systemic radicalism. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Now you may be breathing a sigh of relief if your son or daughter was stuck in virtual learning and is now back in the classroom. But do you really know what your school system is getting ready to marinate your kids in next fall. It's called the anti-racist curriculum and instituting it has been one of the main goals of the far-left BLM movement for years. The killing of George Floyd last May gave them the moral cover to shame quivering white liberals into giving into their demands. Activists guilted suburban women, nervous kids and goofy millennials to supportive hashtags. They posted them all last May as you remember, and June. And companies wrote huge checks to BLM to avoid being targeted. Big city mayors empathized with an even join social justice protests, as looters and violent rioters caused massive damage all around. Even Mitt Romney got into the act. He is so cool. What Mitt probably didn't understand was that it was never about standing up for equal justice for Black Americans. It was always about a full-blown revolution, a series of moves designed to completely upend American society. And the only way to really accomplish that is by changing how and what we teach our kids. So, they want to control language, instill fear, and enforce rules with explicit and implicit threats. And of course, some cases life altering punishment. Enter the twisted notion of what the anti-racist curriculum really is. It's largely the brainchild of people like Ibram Kendi. And in the body is there supposed aim of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in our schools. The acronym DEI, in this case, stands for divisive, erroneous and insidious, or insipid, or invidious. You take your pick. Now, the entire premise of this sicko undertaking is that America is systemically racist, that white privilege has infected the entire country and from the founding, by the way, and that it all has to be remade according to new, very subjective DEI standards. Schools, both public and private, are scrambling to hire DEI consultants who get paid big bucks to tell them how racist their school is, how racist it always was. And then they begin to put in new systems in place of the old systems to cleanse them of their inherent bias. Now, remember, though, the learning and all that unlearning never ends, because it's all deeply embedded."

Even Lincoln wasn't woke. Pull down those statues, kids. Go for the memorial next time. A survey I received today from Fairfax County Public Schools in Northern Virginia shows how this is all going down. In order to justify what they are planning, which is a new anti-racist curriculum, the county solicited responses and input from community members. Parents and others are asked to react to a slew of inane statements taken right out of a BLM workshop. Now, their idea of an evolved educational environment is where, \"multiple identities\" are valued and affirm - affirmed. And get this, that multiple identities are taught about in the schools. What does that mean? Well, who needs Socrates, Shakespeare and Tocqueville and Melville, when your kids can learn from the brilliant thinkers like Robin DiAngelo and Mr. Kendi. ROBIN DIANGELO, AUTHOR OF \"NICE RACISM\": White privilege is the automatic taken for granted advantage bestowed upon white people. IBRAM KENDI, AUTHOR OF \"HOW TO BE AN ANTIRACIST\": It is critical for white people, for people in general to stop denying their racist ideas.

      "utterance": "Now, by the time they get through with our schools, the topics of race, racism, bias, identity-based bias, and of course, the old standby white privilege, they're going to permeate every subject matter taught, every minute of every day. Now, you got to hand it to these folks. They've created an entire industry around stoking white guilt and shaking down wimpy corporate bigwigs and then pressuring school bureaucracies that just crumble and fall right over. The Fairfax County survey addresses curriculum materials to represent different races and identities. And my personal favorite survey question is whether the curriculum used in Fairfax County should teach students how to challenge power and privilege in society. Guess challenge your teacher when you don't get the right grade. And it even advances the hilarious proposition that teaching methods focused on being anti-racist and anti- biased would advance academic excellence and somehow accelerate learning. Oh, my god! Well, this survey in Fairfax County is being replicated and distributed nationwide, versions of it. And unsuspecting parents have no clue about what's about to hit their kids. These radicals want to graduate agitators, graduate activists and graduate comrades in an anti-American movement that our enemies abroad are thrilled to see taking root. Look at questions 33 through 35. Teachers should have materials to guide them in creating anti-racist and anti-bias curriculum environments. Teaching methods should offer students' ways to take action against racial and social injustice. Give students opportunities to recognize injustices that individuals create, biased-based beliefs and languages, and that systems create discrimination and oppression. Well, parents are finally beginning to catch on to this madness just moments ago. It's just happened. Fairfax County Schools held an open forum for parents and a dad who had just returned from deployment leveled a stinging indictment of this entire BLM-sponsored curriculum idea."

And we're going to continue to cover this in the coming weeks and months. Because you need to know what's happening in these schools, demand to know what your tax dollars are funding, who these diversity consultants are, and equity and inclusion officers. Zoom into your school board meetings if you have to, or go in person, if you can. Run for school board positions when they become available as elections in Texas showed us this week. You can actually win and make a huge difference. Don't be afraid. They want you afraid. The corporate media won't show you what the \"Angle\" revealed tonight. They don't even want their own viewers to know about it. It's that radical. But you deserve to know what's happening in the American public school system. And if this can happen just miles from the Washington monument, it can happen anywhere, and it is happening. Now, we have some good governors who are working to ban this poisonous ideology. But if you live in a blue state or in a liberal county, this is probably already occurring right under your noses. The Democrats have tied themselves to an anti-American ideology committed to poisoning the minds of our children against what is the greatest country that the world has ever seen. This should be an issue until the Democrats are shellacked at the polls for encouraging Americans to hate each other and hate their own country. And that's the \"Angle\". Joining me now Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at Hoover; and Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative author, filmmaker and host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast. Dinesh, now the following is a real line in the sand moment that we discussed and following this issue tonight. You're either in or out, you're either an anti-racist with an agenda to work with BLM, or you're basically a racist, whether you admit it or not. That's how serious this is. DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Yes, absolutely. This is actually a way to bring Marxism to America by taking the old category of class and substituting race. Race works better for these people than class because there is, in fact, a deep racial history in America. But of course, America is a different society now than it was, let's say, 1950, let alone in 1850. In fact, if you made a kind of hierarchy today of the groups that are doing best in academic performance and economic success, they would be Asian- Indians, then you'd have the Japanese, then you'd have the Chinese, essentially, the Asian-Americans dominate the ethnic groups at the top. So where is this white privilege? Whites are actually not at the top of the totem pole of American society anymore. The only category in which whites are on top is accumulated wealth, which of course reflects the legacy of the past. But it's very difficult for these critical race theory people to explain why Orientals and Asian- Americans are doing the best, because obviously they're not discriminating against anybody. They are outperforming everybody. And so merit here is what's responsible for these differences in performance. But that has to be concealed, it has to be hidden, it has to be denied. So critical race theory is a massive pretense to get away from the idea of merit and substitute the bogus category of contemporary racial oppression."

This is the CEOs of Delta, Coke, $16, $17 million a year, Mark Zuckerberg pouring $500 million into the last election to warp a precinct or two. So - and this, it's not a political revolution. As you point out, I love the word marinate. This is 360 degrees. This is Maoist, this is changing the founding day. This is changing commercials. This is getting national anthem. This is redefining the number of genders. It's total. It's 24/7. And finally, your right to really focus on education. I spent my whole life - (inaudible) the enlightenment, but we've lost the university. What's keeping America sane are the 65 percent. Let's face it. They don't have a BA. That we're out in the practical world and they were not in that insane asylum in the last 20 years. They have their finger in the dike. And now, the left says, well, there's one last challenge. We won all these institutions, but we haven't won K-12. So I think that's really correct of you to point out they want to go after charter schools, home small, parochial schools, and they want to turn it over the teacher union because in one generation, from seven to 17, if they take over K-12, it won't be they want to change America, the next generation, they won't even know what America is or was."

We are erasing women as a category, which is why, look, for years I've been asking leftists the simple question, what is a woman? Can you define? We know you don't like the old traditional definition of an adult human female. OK, well, then what is the definition now? Can you tell me? What do you think a woman is when you use the term?

But it is these days, which is why it does require some courage to say as insane as that is. And that's why as conservatives, this is a hill worth dying on, on this issue. Because if we give up on this, if we give up on - if we let the left sort of have it with the gender madness and we give into it, then we've given up on reality. And once you give up on reality, what else is there worth fighting for? So I think we have to we have to stick to our guns here."

      "utterance": "You can always count on Al. But just like that, the media's outrage over the plight of Asian-Americans has suddenly gone poof. Why? Because in the most recent high-profile attacks, the assailants don't quite fit the left's narrative. Now, what do I mean? Let's look at some of the recent examples. On Monday night, two Asian women in New York City were attacked by a hammer wielding maniac. Does she look like a white supremacist Trump supporter? Well, doesn't look like it. Neither does this person who viciously assaulted two Asian women Tuesday morning at a Baltimore liquor store. The man you see beating that poor woman with a cinderblock is believed to be Daryl Doles. He has since been arrested and charged by police. Again, the media told us basically there was MAGA hat wearing bigots carrying out these attacks, yet time and again we see that's not the case. Hence the media silence. But perhaps they're also silent because the soft on crime policies they champion are responsible for some of these heinous attacks. In fact, according to KGO in San Francisco, on Friday a man named Sidney Hammond allegedly brutally assaulted an Asian man walking his one- year-old child in a stroller. Hammond was arrested and released less than a month ago for an assault at that very same location. Joining me now is Ying Ma, author of \"Chinese Girl in the Ghetto,\" and Harmeet Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberty and a civil rights attorney. Harmeet, is it a coincidence that all these attacks on Asian- Americans in San Francisco coincided with the pro-crime policies of the District Attorney Chesa Boudin?"

And Chesa has been the district attorney for about a year, but before that we had George Gascon, who is now the district attorney in Los Angeles. And this light on crime policy has been permeating the state since Jerry Brown was the government, and just this week Governor Newsom has announced the release of 76,000 violent felons ahead of schedule in order to alleviate prison overcrowding. What we are seeing here is Asian Americans really being thrown under the bus by Asian American and other Democrat leaders. San Francisco actually has quite a bit of Asian representative in our legislature and at the top of our city government, and nobody is standing up for these victims. And so they are the victims of this no woke culture, and nobody is advocating for their rights."

YING MA, AUTHOR, \"CHINESE GIRL IN THE GHETTO\": No, I think if you talk to Asian Americans who live in these crime ridden areas, these heavily Democratic areas, they want police presence. I know that well because I grew up in inner city Oakland. While all these leftists and BLM activists are chanting defund the police, and while radicals are burning down your Wendy's and looting Target stores, ordinary, law-abiding Americans, especially those who live in inner cities or heavily urban areas, they welcome the police to come and protect them. And so I think what we need is we need officials, political leaders who will actually uphold law and order. Laura, let me actually get to something you said earlier about the media and the Democratic leaders being silent. I am actually not so sure that they have become silent. What they have done is that they continue to pretend that they are on the side of the victims while refusing to identify the race of the attackers. And so they continue to blame Trump, they blame systemic racism, they blame white supremacists. And the facts just don't bear that out. But meanwhile all kinds of leftist Asian organizations and activists have raised a lot of money with that rhetoric. And it is irresponsible, and it is also not going to solve the horrific crimes --"

Both of those ladies are in the hospital, and our prosecutor is offering them a pilot program of emotional support once they get out of the hospital. That's what's going to happen. And the Asian-American leaders are not just lying about it being this is MAGA country, as an attacker like Jussie Smollett. They are actually demagoguing and gaslighting Asian victims and telling them they are being racist and fanning the flames of a racist trope of black-Asian hatred if they speak up and name the actual people who are committing these crimes. I don't want to demonize all people one side or the other, but if you are lying about the problem, you will never solve the problem.

It was an extremely restrictive study, and basically showed that there was no difference with the masks. So two pretty interesting pieces of data there.

And it's interest what it said about the cloth masks, because in July of 2020 the Center of Evidence Based Medicine in Oxford University found that Vietnamese hospital workers were 13 times more likely to come down with influenza like illness after wearing the mask. So yes, I had a student come into my office. He was complaining that he couldn't breathe. He was wearing a bandana mask. It was tied really tight around his neck. And he said when we told him to take it off, he said I can't. I have been wearing for two weeks. So we tried to take it off, and it was tied very tightly. We had to cut it off with scissors and throw it away. So the misuse with these masks is phenomenal. And these kids, it's not a reality that they can do to do it right."
