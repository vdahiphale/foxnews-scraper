It's his war in the sense that his party has taken it upon himself to continue with and to succeed in it. And thus the reason he issued a deadline is a way to appease his left. That sends a message of half-heartedness. It sends a message of indecision. He talked to the G-20 about the obsession people have with his withdrawal date.

You have basically the Obama administration in its second stage. The first stage was to try to change Iranian behavior by being nice, by engaging. Now they say we’re going to pass sanctions, we'll be tougher and rally the world community and see if we can change the behavior that way.   The really interesting thing is the CIA Director Leon Panetta a couple weekends ago was asked whether the sanctions would in fact change the Iranian behavior, which is really the key to the administration policy at this point.

If you believe Iran will go nuclear, you say, OK, we'll live with deterrence. But deterrence depends on having a deterrent. We had a deterrent in the cold war and that stopped the Soviet Union.  The United States a few weeks ago signed on to a resolution which singled out Israel for the possession of nuclear weapons. It didn't even have a mention of Iran, the first time our American administration had done that. The Bush administration did not sign on to that because it knows if Iran is going to go nuclear, its only protection if you want never again, its only protection is to have its own nukes.  And here is this administration surprising Israel by signing on to a resolution which is condemning its possession of nukes. Think of how that undermines Israeli security.",

Where he hasn't done as well for the public case for the war, which I think has been is lacking. He needs to be making the argument and making it regularly and making it consistently and making it forcefully explaining to the Democratic base why he is doing what he's doing. We have not had that from him."

What you see is the votes that took place on the House floor last week where we had – the vote for immediate withdrawal defeated, but you had votes there with Pelosi supporting them, saying you know what, the situation there is not good and we can't have an indefinite assignment, and wanting the troops and for the White House to be aggressive about holding to that deadline."

Of course it's a national war, but I'm saying he shouldn't concede to the left of the party a weak policy on Afghanistan if he commits the troops which he did. You can't have a half-hearted policy. It's his war in the sense that his party has taken it upon himself to continue with and to succeed in it. And thus the reason he issued a deadline is a way to appease his left. That sends a message of half-heartedness. It sends a message of indecision. He talked to the G-20 about the obsession people have with his withdrawal date. He is the one who made it and he’s the one that set it. It tells people in the region that he is sounding an uncertain trumpet."

I think the difficulty is, again for both sides, there is so much, there are so many substantive disagreements and so much substantive baggage, largely, the way the Obama administration handled one of our long-time allies, that it will be hard to overcome that, and particularly on the question of Iran. You have basically the Obama administration in its second stage. The first stage was to try to change Iranian behavior by being nice, by engaging. Now they say we’re going to pass sanctions, we'll be tougher and rally the world community and see if we can change the behavior that way. The really interesting thing is the CIA Director Leon Panetta a couple weekends ago was asked whether the sanctions would in fact change the Iranian behavior, which is really the key to the administration policy at this point. And he said probably not. So, I think that is going to be the topic one of the discussion."

Again, nobody talks in the terms publicly. That's just not the way you do it. So we're still at the point of the U.N. sanctions passed, and President Obama saying there will be additional effort by the U.S. to isolate Iran. And here we are talk about things like gasoline, jet fuel, but also the banking system, to limit their ability not only to do anything internationally, but to make life more difficult for them as a civil society so that Iranian citizens will put pressure on the Iranian leadership."

      "utterance": "Everybody knows the sanctions aren't going to work. Everybody knows the U.S. has shot all the arrows out of its quiver. Nobody believes this will deter the Iranian regime. It will get nukes. But here's where the real issue is between Israel and the United States, which hasn't gotten a lot of press. If you believe Iran will go nuclear, you say, OK, we'll live with deterrence. But deterrence depends on having a deterrent. We had a deterrent in the cold war and that stopped the Soviet Union. The United States a few weeks ago signed on to a resolution which singled out Israel for the possession of nuclear weapons. It didn't even have a mention of Iran, the first time our American administration had done that. The Bush administration did not sign on to that because it knows if Iran is going to go nuclear, its only protection if you want never again, its only protection is to have its own nukes. And here is this administration surprising Israel by signing on to a resolution which is condemning its possession of nukes. Think of how that undermines Israeli security."

And third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about the historic contribution to science and math and engineering.\""
