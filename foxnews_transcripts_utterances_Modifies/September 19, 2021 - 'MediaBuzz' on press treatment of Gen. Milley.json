Even Mark Milley concedes that he called his counterpart in China without approval from the president and had a conversation about military action. And so I think the range of opinion that you're seeing here are people who say already we know enough, you know, not just for this but for many other problems and failures that Mark Milley has had. He should be fired, he should be held accountable for violating the chain of command here. The moderate position seems to be, well, obviously, we need to know what happened on the phone calls, what was he doing. But the larger perspective too, I think, is important, which is the claim is that it was okay to violate these norms and violate the Constitution, violate chain of command because Donald Trump was going to do a nuclear war with China. That's just preposterous. The real problem with President Trump, according to the establishment, was that he was too resistant to military action. He was engaging in peace deals, he wants to pull out of Afghanistan, he wasn't engaging in what Pentagon wanted to do in terms of invading new countries or strikes. And so that underlying argument that really he was going to do something unlike anything he had ever said or done before is what really should have much more scrutiny by the media.",

I think that has a lot to do with vaccine hesitancy. We have seen both the media and public health officials lose a lot of trust in recent years and they've lost that trust through their own bad decisions. They lie, they politicize thing, they're hypocritical, and they contradict themselves. And then when someone questions it or has an alternative viewpoint, they get mocked and deride it. That is doing nothing to convince people about the efficacy of vaccines. And so what I found was interesting was that they attacked her and then she goes back and she kind of fought back with them in defense of just being able to talk about these things without being told you can't talk about stories you hear.

That had to be the most overhyped, overplayed, overdramatized event in a very long time. Donald Trump who supported the intent of the protest is very much in the news, thanks to Bob Woodward. The new book by Woodward and his \"Washington Post\" colleague Robert Costa has detonated a neutron bomb with much of the fallout aimed at General Mark Milley, who obviously cooperated with the book \"Peril.\" The clash between conservative and liberal media is this. Was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs acting courageously when, according to the book, he twice reassured China the U.S. would not attack because it was worried about Trump's mental state? And when Milley told senior defense officials to check with him on any presidential order to launch a nuclear strike? Or was Milley out of control and undermining the civilian chain of command? These are crucial questions for the press. Woodward is sometimes accused of granting favorable treatment to those who give him access as a dilemma that all authors face since they have a better understanding of those who talked than of those who don't. And Trump, who is denouncing the book, wouldn't speak to Woodward and Costa. Once the hearings and investigations are underway, once the book is out and not just leaked, we'll see how it holds up to media scrutiny. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ. The press quickly divided into two warring camps, those on the left using the book to hail Mark Milley and those on the right practically calling him a traitor."

Even Mark Milley concedes that he called his counterpart in China without approval from the president and had a conversation about military action. And so I think the range of opinion that you're seeing here are people who say already we know enough, you know, not just for this but for many other problems and failures that Mark Milley has had. He should be fired, he should be held accountable for violating the chain of command here. The moderate position seems to be, well, obviously, we need to know what happened on the phone calls, what was he doing. But the larger perspective too, I think, is important, which is the claim is that it was okay to violate these norms and violate the Constitution, violate chain of command because Donald Trump was going to do a nuclear war with China. That's just preposterous. The real problem with President Trump, according to the establishment, was that he was too resistant to military action. He was engaging in peace deals, he wants to pull out of Afghanistan, he wasn't engaging in what Pentagon wanted to do in terms of invading new countries or strikes. And so that underlying argument that really he was going to do something unlike anything he had ever said or done before is what really should have much more scrutiny by the media."

This man has not been found to be proven guilty, talking of things like treason, which by the way, you can be hung for in this country. That is just absolutely ridiculous. I would say that whether this was Donald Trump as president or as we have right now Joe Biden, the jumping to conclusions and trying to ruin an individual's career and picking on some of the highest levels of the most wonderful military in the world concerns me.

Two, we should not get all our information from the book, any book that's written by anyone. What I want to see again is the facts and we are hearing testimony.

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think -- first of all, the story is so ludicrous. It is hard not to laugh about the actual story that began the whole thing. But I think it really does speak to a really important thing, which is the reaction to when she did tell the story, was this attempt to just shut her down, to mock her, to deride her? I think that has a lot to do with vaccine hesitancy. We have seen both the media and public health officials lose a lot of trust in recent years and they've lost that trust through their own bad decisions. They lie, they politicize thing, they're hypocritical, and they contradict themselves. And then when someone questions it or has an alternative viewpoint, they get mocked and deride it. That is doing nothing to convince people about the efficacy of vaccines. And so what I found was interesting was that they attacked her and then she goes back and she kind of fought back with them in defense of just being able to talk about these things without being told you can't talk about stories you hear. I think that's a really dangerous and un-American thing. It is good for people to be able to talk openly so that more information can be shared about the goodness of these vaccines."

We saw larger numbers of the African-American community affected both physically and financially from COVID-19. We see a problem within the African-American community, disparity when we look at numbers in that Latino minority groups as far as people not being vaccinated. Yes. You know what? This country -- Mollie, I agree with you. It's a crazy, ridiculous story. We rarely agree on stuff. I agree on that. I wouldn't say this is un-American. It's so American. This is what's become so American, is that anybody out there would believe a rapper whose cousin in Trinidad's boyfriend's claim, we have no physician in Trinidad saying, I examined X and this resulted in what.

You have this complete debacle with the booster shots. Sixteen to two votes against what Joe Biden had said. You have so many areas of problems, whether it is immigration or the economy or trying to get out of a bad news cycle by drone striking 10 innocent people in Afghanistan. This is complete and utter incompetence. And the tone of the coverage is not accurate relative to what we're actually experiencing."

      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "I don't think he got ahead of the scientists. One of the things that make our nation great is the agencies like the FDA. I know some people are going to freak out and are probably tweeting me right now. But the FDA does a great job. What happens -- any of us that worked in politicians or with politicians know you get a phone call, a heads up, look, you know, we're probably going to have everybody have the boosters. Further research now shows we're going to dial back on that, we're going to have it for 65-year-olds and healthcare professionals, people who have severe illness. It doesn't mean we won't get the boosters. They're just concerned about the timing right now and they want more time. So I don't think there was disconnect at all. It's just like we see with masks and everything, this is a fluid situation. This virus keeps mutating, delta (INAUDIBLE). And usually when a virus mutates, according to scientists and doctors, it becomes weaker. We saw that wasn't the case with delta."

Mollie, I've got about half a minute. You mentioned problems at the border, Afghanistan, and now COVID. NNC's Chuck Todd this morning said that President Biden has a credibility crisis on his hands. It's so striking because we hear very little of that from most of the mainstream media. Quick thought?"

But there is just no comparison to what we endured for all four years of the Trump administration, where things that weren't a problem or that were completely made up like the Russia collusion hoax were dominating every day of the news. And here you have legitimate crises like the American drone striking these people and then saying that no one is going to be held accountable for it and claiming to stand by the intelligence, the border surge with tens and thousands of people streaming, and the media say we will give a light criticism and then it's all well and good.

That's a shame not just for the women in this story but for, you know, women and victims of -- men or women of things like this because, look, the overriding narrative is that these women were so brave to get up there and tell their stories. That's true. They really were very brave to do this. I cried a little bit. But really a very important take-away is this isn't the first time they had to do that. You listened to McKayla Maroney said, hey, I already told this story to the FBI, only to be told it wasn't enough. They didn't do anything. She did this in order to protect other little girls from going through what she went through and it wasn't enough. I think whenever this sort of thing is in the news, a lot of times, people say, hey, why didn't they say something sooner or why don't women speak up about this right away? Well, this is exactly why, because sometimes they do and it's not enough."

Washington Post sports columnist Sally Jenkins says there should be a special prosecutor to probe this law enforcement coverup. One agent conveniently fired just days before the hearing. The media dropped the ball on this story because we've known about the outlines for a long time but not so much about the horrible and blatant FBI shortcomings."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Just because we already know about Larry Nasser, he's already in prison for the rest of his life, that doesn't mean that the way this happened was okay, because he is the one who did this but because of what the FBI failed to do, there are dozens more little girls who are victims that didn't have to be. That has to matter not just for those little girls but for people everywhere, because if this could possibly happen, this is wrong. This has to change."

      "utterance": "And, you know, Larry Nasser preyed upon another 70 or possibly as much as another 120 young girls after the FBI was told by a couple of these brave women, originally back in 2015. The media are very good at short-term outrage. Perhaps we are getting what Simone Biles said, the pain of the abuse by the team doctor never goes away. I'm just wondering why there isn't more of a focus right now on what happened at the FBI because it's just a colossal failure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",

If you're one of these people who has gone through this, it's something that affects you for the rest of your life. There will be certain things that trigger you for the rest of your life. It changes your life. There was a piece in The Guardian too saying what happened with the FBI did here was surprise -- horrible but it wasn't shocking. We talk all the time about how, you know, stuff like this, sex crimes like this, they're often, you know, under-prosecuted but they're also under-investigated as well."

Well, this was the last strike by the U.S. military before we pulled up stakes entirely in Afghanistan and it was a tragic, tragic error. I mean, not only did it not hit ISIS-K, it hit 10 people, seven children, and the target, rather than being a terrorist, in fact was an aide worker."

But frankly, there's some other shows that have just had a ban on anybody who they feel has -- is an election denier. I think that's moral posturing.

And I've been really strong on this since COVID first came out. This is about the science. I have not seen any credible information that would indicate that the vaccines are not a tremendous good, I'm not saying that there can't be some public health or side effects or whatever but -- so to put somebody on who conceivably is going to stop people from getting a vaccine that can save their lives, no, why would I put them on television."

And Milley says well, the calls to China and the nuclear strikes discussions very routine, nothing to it. At the same time, you've had Woodward on your show every the years.

It's the fact that I have and, you know, some would say I should get a life, I've read a lot of these post-Trump books. And Milley is in every one of them, and you know, talking about how he disapproved and felt he had had been drawn into the photo op at Saint John's Church and how he felt about Trump in the final days. And it's -- I can't tell whether it's him talking directly to the authors or him talking to somebody who clearly had authority to talk to the authors. You kind of wonder for a chairman of the joint chiefs who is supposed to be apolitical, he just seems to be awfully public and awfully political in the things he's saying and I think that's something that in that hearing, in the Senate next week, the 28th, is going to come up and I don't think he's going to look so good."

But, you know, we move on. We seem incapable, I don't know, we seem incapable, Howie, of focusing on what unites us and we seem to just want to pick the scab of the things that divide us.

      "utterance": "Well, yes, but, you know, I tried to write it as a thriller. My feeling -- this is going to sound really presumptuous -- because I think history is written wrong. I think we spend too many histories. We know what happened, now let's talk about why or how it happened. No. In the moment that it was happening they didn't know what was going to happen so when Panetta gets the lead about Bin Laden might be in this compound, he doesn't know if it's true or not. When Obama makes the decision to launch the raid, he says it's no more than 50/50."

They may get Bin Laden but they are not coming home. So, if you can transmit that, it seems to me that, you know, the biggest compliment somebody paid, I know how the story ends but I was on the edge of my seat the last 100 pages."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "OK. But the Post went much further than that, saying the talk show host suggested, quote, \"hospitals shouldn't treat unvaccinated patients who prefer to take Ivermectin, as in not treat them at all. So, Kimmel has a right to be ticked off. Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is coming out with a tell-all book, that, according to Politico, paints her ex-boss Melania Trump as the doomed French queen, dismissive, defeated, detached. Grisham says her breaking point was the charge of a rigged election. The former first lady's office dismisses the book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now\" as an attempt to redeem herself after a poor performance as press secretary, failed personal relationships and unprofessional behavior in the White House. Now a source close to the book's publication tells me the personal attack shows that team Trump is afraid of the book and engaging in character assassination. The source says Grisham spares no one in this book including herself. Wall Street Journal expose shows that Facebook doesn't enforce its rules for about six million celebrities, politicians and journalists. Internal documents calling this not publicly defensible and a breach of trust. Talk about a double standard. Another document admits that on Facebook's Instagram we make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls. Mark Zuckerberg's company says the paper cherry picked the findings for lopsided reporting of. Piers Morgan needed a next act after famously walking out on a British morning show over his criticism of Meghan Markle. Now he's signing with Fox where among things, he'll do a global show for a new Rupert Murdoch network in the U.K. that will also here on Fox Nation and in Australia. Plus write a write a column for the New York Post and the London Sun. Meantime, Fox has bought the gossip outfit TMZ what news report say is less than $50 million. You know by now Gavin Newsom beat the California recall in a blowout and Larry Elder who told me he might file suit conceded. A national press assault helped the governor make the radio talk show host the issue and Elder may have contributed when he backed off from saying Joe Biden legitimately won the White House."

      "utterance": "I don't believe the election was won fairly and squarely. There are all sorts of reason why the 2020 election, in my opinion, was full of shenanigans. And my fear is they're going to try that in this election right here."

      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "Talking about a rigged election in a two to one Democratic state, probably not the best strategy. All right. Let me sneak in one more here and overtime. Does Newsmax allow any criticism of Donald Trump. Host Grant Stinchfield cut off army veteran Joe Saboe who is trying to get people out of Afghanistan when he said in mild terms that multiple administrations were at fault and the Trump administration's efforts were fairly weak."
