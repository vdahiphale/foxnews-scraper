Vietnam probably gets along better with us than China and Russia these days. So, I am encouraged by the chance. There's plenty of reasons to poke holes in it.

So many of us were riveted by -- it is an important moment, and not just in America political history but in international discourse and diplomacy. I really hope and pray that this is the first step of yet many meetings between the United States and North, South Korea, China, be able to work together. Nuclear scientists involved, to be able to trust but verify, which is Reagan's policy, and really work towards peace. No one benefits, you know, for war. And so, in that sense, I think this was something that was important, it's a step in the right direction. Can you say that he trusts 100 percent the actions of that man that has run, you know, a brutal regime of torture and behaves in a way horrifically to his own people? Perhaps, we have some small part to play in stopping that, shedding some light on it, and not continuing to remain to have them isolated, to create and commit their horrors without the rest of the world knowing about it. I believe the president when he says that Otto Warmbier did not die in vain. That really did cast a very bright light on what was going on in North Korea. And, I think, really was --- really so pivotal in terms of being able to get POW's, MIA, you know, remains home, be able to negotiate for the other hostages that were held there. That does matter to those families and those that have been grieving and looking to bury their loved ones. So, I say, let's give this a chance.

It's been so many years in the coming and I applaud the efforts of presidents past for putting their effort forward to try to make this happen. It's all part of the process. But perhaps this time around, there was a little bit of a unique approach. And I mentioned yesterday, I do think that part of it is something that Kim Jong-un is a little bit fascinated by President Trump, and who he is as an individual and who he was prior to becoming President of the United States. So, it's somebody that he feels a little bit different. Perhaps, that relationship is one that can actually move the ball forward because it is a unique, unconventional diplomacy that the president engages in. That's why he said I don't need to be preparing for hours and hours. I've been ready to do this negotiation. And, so far, it has produced very auspicious results.

And it was a public display for everybody so that it makes it hard for people to back away from it. It framed the future for that guy, Kim Jong-un, because he now feels like he has something. It's easier to try to want something than to lose something. So, he feels that he has something. And Trump has got him past the sale. He's envisioning himself in this world.

And Harris grew up in this military family, which she admits, you know, was not always easy. But that's why there were so many valuable life lessons that came out of this and her experience.

And if they want an example it's Vietnam and China. Command economies where we never want to live, but they found a way to put some market principles in there where we actually get along with both. Vietnam probably gets along better with us than China and Russia these days. So, I am encouraged by the chance. There's plenty of reasons to poke holes in it.

That's not the answer. That's not what you have to do. So, I think the rhetoric, I hated to do it, sometimes I felt foolish doing it, but we had no choice."

So many of us were riveted by -- it is an important moment, and not just in America political history but in international discourse and diplomacy. I really hope and pray that this is the first step of yet many meetings between the United States and North, South Korea, China, be able to work together. Nuclear scientists involved, to be able to trust but verify, which is Reagan's policy, and really work towards peace. No one benefits, you know, for war. And so, in that sense, I think this was something that was important, it's a step in the right direction. Can you say that he trusts 100 percent the actions of that man that has run, you know, a brutal regime of torture and behaves in a way horrifically to his own people? Perhaps, we have some small part to play in stopping that, shedding some light on it, and not continuing to remain to have them isolated, to create and commit their horrors without the rest of the world knowing about it. I believe the president when he says that Otto Warmbier did not die in vain. That really did cast a very bright light on what was going on in North Korea. And, I think, really was --- really so pivotal in terms of being able to get POW's, MIA, you know, remains home, be able to negotiate for the other hostages that were held there. That does matter to those families and those that have been grieving and looking to bury their loved ones. So, I say, let's give this a chance. Kudos to our president for being able to make this happen, which so many people didn't think."

You do not ignore it in the hopes that you will learn lessons from it and move forward more effectively, smarter, brighter, especially towards achieving such incredibly important goals as denuclearization and having peace over in that region. It's been so many years in the coming and I applaud the efforts of presidents past for putting their effort forward to try to make this happen. It's all part of the process. But perhaps this time around, there was a little bit of a unique approach. And I mentioned yesterday, I do think that part of it is something that Kim Jong-un is a little bit fascinated by President Trump, and who he is as an individual and who he was prior to becoming President of the United States. So, it's somebody that he feels a little bit different. Perhaps, that relationship is one that can actually move the ball forward because it is a unique, unconventional diplomacy that the president engages in. That's why he said I don't need to be preparing for hours and hours. I've been ready to do this negotiation. And, so far, it has produced very auspicious results. I think this is part of it of a new chapter going forward with North Korea and South Korea and China as well."

When you -- the American public, and I actually believe the world was in this room, all right. That's why that video actually played to a lot more than Kim Jong- un. It played to everybody. And it was a public display for everybody so that it makes it hard for people to back away from it. It framed the future for that guy, Kim Jong-un, because he now feels like he has something. It's easier to try to want something than to lose something. So, he feels that he has something. And Trump has got him past the sale. He's envisioning himself in this world. And once you get somebody to test drive that car, it's hard to get them out of that car. So, I think the lesson here is this is a framework that could be used with Iran. And Iran in a transparent way in which you don't lie to the American people. And you don't feed billions to them."

It's less than what they agreed to before, but I think that this is the first meeting, and I think there was a chance for President Trump to size up his adversary. And he said I'll know within the first minute, and I guess within the first minute he must have felt like it's worth continuing on. When the history of all of this is written, it will be interesting to find out how much the CIA influenced that video because of the profile that they have of Kim Jong-un."

They didn't care about basketball and pop culture, and they didn't want all of this stuff. And so, there is something happening there that I wonder if the CIA eventually, may be in 80 years will be able to reveal the documents and show us what that is."

Anything short of that, the same people are going to say the same exact thing. All I say is this. This is the beginning. If this is the end, I agree with them, but it's just the beginning. Next week you're going to see the beginning. Because the president doesn't say this for no reason. You go in to see the dismantling of something beginning next week. You're going to hear about the progress with Pompeo and Bolton beginning next week. It's going to gradually get tighter. It's going to gradually get hotter, and it's going to get more and more interesting as we move forward. Because I believe it's not so much the video works. This guys out of options.

He was -- I'm not going to say his name, because he's a nice -- he's a nice guy. But the criticism will be familiar. They will combine past criticism of Trump about other things that are unrelated to North Korea. With what about-ism. Like what about Cuba? Which Trump has nothing to do with. He's inheriting the job.

It reminded me of Kanye West: \"Oh, Obama wouldn't meet with me, but Trump would meet.\" Trump apparently likes celebrities. But in terms of diplomacy, to me, what you get here is the echo chamber on the right generally saying, \"Oh, you know what? We've got to defend Trump, despite the fact that he got so little.\" But you do see people on the right -- I'm thinking here like Max Boothe and Shapiro, others -- who are saying just the plain fact.

So this is amazing, because not only is Harris Faulkner an eight-time Emmy- Award-winning journalist and star here at FOX News, she is part of an incredible military family. And the book pays tribute to her father, retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Bob Harris who served two tours in Vietnam as a combat pilot. And Harris grew up in this military family, which she admits, you know, was not always easy. But that's why there were so many valuable life lessons that came out of this and her experience. And I know she credits her father and her family for her successes in life. I really encourage you to get this book. It's excellent, and you get to know a lot more about Harris and why she grew to be the person that she is."

It took 11 weeks to put it together, but they actually were able to clean it up. It had red paint. They painted \"killer\" on him and his wife's grave. Yesterday Howard Keitel was able to marshal the forces and get the War of 1812 guys out. They fixed the gravesite. I think it's absolutely terrible, but it's great that our seventh president is restored. And now they have security cameras, sadly, to watch his home.
