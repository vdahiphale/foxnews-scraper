So let's see how big of a deal this is, and to remind people, General McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, in an interview in Rolling Stone made disparaging comments, he or his top aides did, about the president, the vice president, the national security adviser to the president, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, and the special envoy to the region.

That's one of the real problems. I interviewed Senator McCain this afternoon on the phone, and I think his argument is a very good one.

This strategy depends on the Afghanistan government, who isn't capable or competent of doing the building after we clear and hold. And that's the problem.  And what you get from this article is the sense of what we heard before is that the civilian side, Ambassador Eikenberry and others aren't sure that it can succeed and don't think Karzai is capable of doing the civilian end of this which is so crucial to real counterinsurgency.

It could be that unlike Iraq there isn't a central government capable of doing this. And secondly, unlike Iraq, it could be that the insurgents are so embedded and indigenous that it could be a different war. In Iraq the surge succeeded largely because we had the population, for example in Anbar behind us. Why? Because Al Qaeda was an alien element, soldiers from Egypt, elsewhere, Afghanistan, Pakistan, who were hated in the end.   Here the local insurgents in Afghanistan are mostly indigenous. It's not a foreign legion of Egyptians in there. And they may be so embedded that it could be a difficult win, because if you want to be as protective as McChrystal is and have rules of engagement, which are incredibly restrained because you don't want to hurt the locals, and the insurgents are embedded, then you can never shoot or kill and destroy an insurgent.  And they rearm, they fade away, and they remain. That has been a real complaint of the troops on the ground.",

What are the questions that it raises for you about the likelihood that the counterinsurgency, the idea of clearing areas, holding them, protecting population centers, Marjah, Kandahar, that the basic strategy can work?"

Counterinsurgency was supposed to be an overwhelming boots on the ground, in and amongst the population, doing clear, hold, and build. This strategy depends on the Afghanistan government, who isn't capable or competent of doing the building after we clear and hold. And that's the problem. And what you get from this article is the sense of what we heard before is that the civilian side, Ambassador Eikenberry and others aren't sure that it can succeed and don't think Karzai is capable of doing the civilian end of this which is so crucial to real counterinsurgency. Now, that contradiction has to be resolved if this thing is going to succeed."

      "utterance": "Counterinsurgency depends on having a local government that after you clear can be put in place and hold. It hasn't happened in Marjah. That's why we are now behind. It could be that unlike Iraq there isn't a central government capable of doing this. And secondly, unlike Iraq, it could be that the insurgents are so embedded and indigenous that it could be a different war. In Iraq the surge succeeded largely because we had the population, for example in Anbar behind us. Why? Because Al Qaeda was an alien element, soldiers from Egypt, elsewhere, Afghanistan, Pakistan, who were hated in the end. Here the local insurgents in Afghanistan are mostly indigenous. It's not a foreign legion of Egyptians in there. And they may be so embedded that it could be a difficult win, because if you want to be as protective as McChrystal is and have rules of engagement, which are incredibly restrained because you don't want to hurt the locals, and the insurgents are embedded, then you can never shoot or kill and destroy an insurgent. And they rearm, they fade away, and they remain. That has been a real complaint of the troops on the ground."

McChrystal and Petraeus think it can work and their judgment I think is probably the best around, but I'm skeptical."
