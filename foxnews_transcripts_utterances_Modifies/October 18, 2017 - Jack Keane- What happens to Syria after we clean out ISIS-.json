They did so, according to new reporting on the FBI investigation, by bribing and giving kickbacks to American contractors in order to push through the deal that they very much wanted. And they ended up with a fifth of all of the U.S. supply of the atomic material. And regardless of the FBI bribery investigation, it was ongoing. Ironically, under the direction of Robert Mueller, now in charge of the new Russia investigation, Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton were too, on the committee, who signed off and said that this deal would be OK.  Also, simultaneously at this time, Bill Clinton was making millions from the Russians for speeches that he was giving that was going back to the Clinton Foundation. So, there are questions that have arisen, again, on all of this, and they do need answers. And Senator Chuck Grassley was pushing for them today. Watch.",

It just might be the Obama administration, instead of the Trump administration. So, the attorney general who might be on the griddle, eventually, is former Attorney General Eric Holder, whose Justice Department spent four years quietly probing allegations that could be damaging to Bill and Hillary Clinton. This exclusive from The Hill newspaper, revealing that before the Clinton State Department OK that controversial pact, the Uranium One deal you mentioned in 2010, they gave the Russians more than 20 percent of American uranium supply. The Hill reported that federal agents \"attained an eyewitness account backed by documents indicating Russian nuclear officials that routed millions of dollars designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton's charitable foundation during the time that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided that favorable decision to Moscow.\" Remember, this was all happening as Hillary Clinton was literally hitting the reset button on warmer relations with Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and his administration. The uranium pact was a sweetheart deal for Putin from then-President Barack Obama. And his ace in 2010 insisted there was no national security reason for the U.S. to oppose a deal, and no evidence any Russians or Clinton Foundation donors had engaged in wrongdoing. Those claims now being called into question at this hearing today and the current Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested, he's taking a close look at that probe that started under the Obama administration.

But, you know, clearly, something to pay Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech while his wife sits on the board to make the decision to allow this deal to go through, to me, is pretty clear evidence of bribery. And I'm so glad you played that clip from Mitt Romney and Barack Obama's debate in 2012.

For example, this Uranium One deal, we're talking about how 20 percent of the United States uranium production. What people are forgetting is that the Russians can't actually take the uranium outside of the United States, they don't have export permits. The Uranium has to stay here in the United States. Also, the United States does not have a very big uranium production capacity. Only 2 percent of the world nationally; we're a net importer. The reason why the Russians actually took a controlling stake in the Uranium One Company, the Canadian company, because they wanted Kazakhstan uranium mines where they can't export the uranium.

They had a pretty good response time, the first six officers. By the time the SWAT team got there the shooting had stopped on the crowd, so then they had a barricaded situation.

When the New York Times broke the story laying out decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer apologized for some misdeeds, denied others, and threatened to sue the Times. But within days, dozens of more allegations surfaced, including from A-list actresses like Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein was then dismissed by his company's board of directors, kicked out of the motion picture academy and left by his wife. The floodgates had opened and it wasn't just Harvey Weinstein. Social media was now replete with stories of assault, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, quote, if all the women who've been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote, Me Too, as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem. With that, Me Too became a rallying cry to stand against sexual misconduct.  One of the Me Too messages came from Olympic gold gymnast Michaela Maroney, who claims that beginning at age 13 she was molested by Dr. Lawrence Nasser, the former team doctor for the U.S. women's gymnastics team. Nasser is in jail facing 22 molestation counts involving at least seven other gymnasts. Maroney posted, quote, people should know that this is not just happening in Hollywood, this is happening everywhere. And because of the groundswell, Isa Hackett, the producer of Amazon's Man in the High Castle, says she was inspired to make a public accusation against Amazon studio head Roy Price. Five days after the accusation, Roy Price resigned. Finally, in California's democratically controlled state capital, the cry of Me Too became Us Too, when 140 women including lawmakers, lobbyist, and capital staff from both parties signed a letter calling out the pervasive culture of sexual harassment that plagues their industry. The leather states in part, quote, why didn't we speak up? Sometimes out of fear, sometimes out of shame. Often these men hold our professional fate in their hands. Our relationships with them are crucial, crucial to our personal success, and it is not just in the U.S. Me Too stories have inundated the internet from all around the globe. Martha.",

They have lectured the rest of the country about misogyny, sexual harassment, sexual assault. They really should have been cleaning up their own neighborhood. And in terms of how we prevent this from happening across the board in every industry, not just in Hollywood, there has to be a sea change of how women are portrayed in pop culture coming directly from Hollywood. When you look around at the people who are directing these films, who were in charge, who are doing the castings from the casting couch, not people being interviewed, but the people deciding who's going to be in film, it's all about portraying women as sex objects. And until that can change, until women are not objectified as -- all around our culture, you see it in Times Square, you have women on billboards, you see it coming from Hollywood.

She says, \"Like so many across the country, the past presidential election and countless events that have unfolded has galvanized me. For these reasons I decided not to return for another season of 'Chelsea,' and instead devote as much time as I can to become more knowledgeable and engaged citizen and focus on projects that are significant. My goal is to be better informed to raise my voice and participate in a more meaningful way.\" She wants to travel across the country, she says, and visit areas and people that I don't know enough about. Speak to colleges and listen to students and get a better understanding of our political divide. Handler's talk show has struggled, it was switched from a daily show to a weekly show in its second season, and never really broke out in late night. I've always think about that, will you miss that? Tweet me at @marthamaccallum. Thanks for sharing our story tonight. Good to have you here as always. We will be right back here tomorrow night at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is up next.

They did so, according to new reporting on the FBI investigation, by bribing and giving kickbacks to American contractors in order to push through the deal that they very much wanted. And they ended up with a fifth of all of the U.S. supply of the atomic material. And regardless of the FBI bribery investigation, it was ongoing. Ironically, under the direction of Robert Mueller, now in charge of the new Russia investigation, Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton were too, on the committee, who signed off and said that this deal would be OK. Also, simultaneously at this time, Bill Clinton was making millions from the Russians for speeches that he was giving that was going back to the Clinton Foundation. So, there are questions that have arisen, again, on all of this, and they do need answers. And Senator Chuck Grassley was pushing for them today. Watch."

It just might be the Obama administration, instead of the Trump administration. So, the attorney general who might be on the griddle, eventually, is former Attorney General Eric Holder, whose Justice Department spent four years quietly probing allegations that could be damaging to Bill and Hillary Clinton. This exclusive from The Hill newspaper, revealing that before the Clinton State Department OK that controversial pact, the Uranium One deal you mentioned in 2010, they gave the Russians more than 20 percent of American uranium supply. The Hill reported that federal agents \"attained an eyewitness account backed by documents indicating Russian nuclear officials that routed millions of dollars designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton's charitable foundation during the time that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided that favorable decision to Moscow.\" Remember, this was all happening as Hillary Clinton was literally hitting the reset button on warmer relations with Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and his administration. The uranium pact was a sweetheart deal for Putin from then-President Barack Obama. And his ace in 2010 insisted there was no national security reason for the U.S. to oppose a deal, and no evidence any Russians or Clinton Foundation donors had engaged in wrongdoing. Those claims now being called into question at this hearing today and the current Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested, he's taking a close look at that probe that started under the Obama administration.

So, here we are again on this Uranium One story based on the brand-new reporting, and the exhaustive piece that was at The Hill, that was posted on The Hill yesterday. Charlie, you know, we sort of gave this a day to kind of digest it and look it over. Now, obviously, it was the source of questions on the Hill, so this is clearly something that is back on the front burner."

I mean, you know, there's a lot to investigate here, far more to investigate here than there is evidence to suggest that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. You know, what we have here -- who knows the extent of the bribery was that occurred between the Russians and American officials. But, you know, clearly, something to pay Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech while his wife sits on the board to make the decision to allow this deal to go through, to me, is pretty clear evidence of bribery. And I'm so glad you played that clip from Mitt Romney and Barack Obama's debate in 2012. Still, the most shocking, stunning, amazing thing of all of this is that the previous White House agreed to give 20 percent of our uranium over to our greatest nuclear rival on the planet, and that is terrifying."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "ZAC PETKANAS, FORMER SENIOR DNC ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first off, we don't know what was told or what's not, that's the nature of the letters that Grassley sent. But I think it's important that we clear up a couple misconceptions here. Number one -- I mean, yes, we do need to relook at all of the deals we have with Russia after the Russians attacked the United States. But let's also not blow these deals out of proportion. For example, this Uranium One deal, we're talking about how 20 percent of the United States uranium production. What people are forgetting is that the Russians can't actually take the uranium outside of the United States, they don't have export permits. The Uranium has to stay here in the United States. Also, the United States does not have a very big uranium production capacity. Only 2 percent of the world nationally; we're a net importer. The reason why the Russians actually took a controlling stake in the Uranium One Company, the Canadian company, because they wanted Kazakhstan uranium mines where they can't export the uranium. They don't actually care about these uranium mines --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, Charlie, the argument that Zac is making is this is just a little bit of uranium, it's really nothing to worry about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "And this is what is so and quite frankly why I think Donald Trump got elected in the first place is that the previous administration clearly did not view Russia as any kind of threat whatsoever, they got walked all over by Russia, by Vladimir Putin, and did everything that they could possibly have done, most of it was probably stupid as opposed to trying to stand up for them. That set up a deal, the situation, where Vladimir Putin and the Russians went after our election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, clearly, you know, if it was just such a tiny amount of uranium and it really wasn't consequential, Zac, you need to explain why there would've been this enormous bribery effort, these kickbacks that were given to people, and why there was so much money flowing to Bill Clinton from the Russians at the same time. And then, mysteriously, the committee that is Hillary sits on to sign off on this deal says it's OK, even though there's an FBI investigation going on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETKANAS",
      "utterance": "So, first off, there are a couple -- there are a couple of misconceptions with there. The bribery that you're talking about involves a separate FBI case that involves a uranium trucking company."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "The American trucking company."

      "speaker": "PETKANAS",
      "utterance": "It has nothing to do with the Uranium One sale. No, the bribery --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "North American uranium operation that had to do with trucking and transport, and then also mines in Canada, connected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETKANAS",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry, but that's simply not what is reported. What is reported is that there was an FBI investigation into a bribery scandal that involves the trucking company that is concluded in 2015 where somebody went to jail. Conflating these two things is just not fair. But the other thing that I think is really important to understand here is that, yes, we do need to look at all of the Russian money that is now sloshing around here in the United States after the Russians have attacked the United States. And that begins with the millions of dollars that have gone to the RNC that Special Counsel Mueller is looking into now."

      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, the real issue here is nuclear power industry is actually deteriorating, and it is a strategic asset, and it's really unfortunate. And it's happening, because Democratic administrations have incentivized wind and solar at the expense of nuclear, and they just priced out of the market. But it weaves to be the number one producer of industrial based uranium fuel in the world. Now, we've almost zeroed out. So, we take in every single year, 89 percent of uranium fuel for our nuclear power plants, et cetera, come from foreign sources. That's all the Russians got involved in this. That's just -- that is really the issue here. Certainly, the bribery thing has got to be investigated, with got to find out if people have dirty hands here, to be sure."

So, you know, when you play out what happens next year between Iran and between the United States and Russia, all of whom have a stake in wanting Syria to be stable in their own way of looking at that, what do you think is next?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly, what ISIS Caliphate in Iraq and Syria is largely gone, we've got to clean out where the leaders have fled to, they're in the southeastern part of Syria and the Euphrates River Valley as it runs into Iraq. So, we've to get down in there and clean all of that out. And then, we come to the issue that you are talking about. And I don't think we really have a strategy here. The issue is, what about Syria after we cleaned out ISIS? What the Iranians fully intend to do is they have, with the support of the Russians, they have rolled up Western Syria, and we are not taking that back; Assad is staying in power. There is no political procedure that will get him out of power even though the administration desires that. That train has left the station. But Eastern Syria is another thing, Martha. And the Iranians want to run the table and take over Syria completely and after we clean out ISIS, they're moving in there with Russian support and with Syria and ground forces, but mostly with their own ground forces -- the Hezbollah by and large are there by the tens of thousands."

We've got to put together a plan to do it, and people are wringing their hands about it because they are concerned that we could wind up in a war with the Iranians. Well, the alternative is the Iranians are going to be able to build a land bridge from Iran through Iraq, because their political influence in Iraq is greater than ours into Syria, all the way to Lebanon to the Mediterranean, they want a port on the Mediterranean in Lebanon. That's them -- their proxies in Lebanon, they run the country with Lebanon -- the Hezbollah. They have a huge strategy in the region that dominates and influence the Middle East. And the president has a strategy now to push back on it, but we don't have one yet for Syria."

I heard a Fox Contributor just a couple hours ago say the war on drugs was a failure, it was not, it was not, it was not. From 1979-1992, Martha, we got illegal drug use down in this country by more than 50 percent. This was a function of advertising. Remember the drugs off the diving board into an empty swimming pool, fried eggs on drugs? Local law enforcement, teachers, ministers, priests, rabbis, advocacy from the federal government, what President Bush did? We took this thing to the bad guys in South America and we worked on all fronts and because of that, we got this problem down. Now, if you get any problem down, teenage pregnancy, homelessness, desertion by more than 50 percent, I don't think you can call it a failure and it can be done again. We have to recognize the problem for what it is."

But I don't agree with you that there isn't still a problem with prescriptions because you can have a minor surgeries, you can have your wisdom teeth taken out -- like my daughter did -- and get sent home with a bottle of these things, 30 of them! In a bottle. You know, to a 20-year-old, I think that's insane. I mean, try Advil, and if you really have a problem, give us a call and maybe we'll give you one or two of these. But there's absolutely a flood of these painkillers in the market, and they're sitting around in people's homes and people are getting their hands on them and that's the route that many people take that then leads to heroin."

Take a look at the medical examiner reports, the death reports by state, and see what the cause of death is and you will see it's not, for the most part anymore, and still some, yes, you are right, Martha, the diversion of legal drugs. It is, for the most part, these illegal drugs. There's no reason we can't get after all of this problem at once. We can get after the places that are distributing too many of these pills and we can get after the Chinese and the Mexicans, and the people who are sending the stuff in. But we've got to be serious.

But, look, most places I know, if you have shots fired, the police department responds within minutes, especially in a place where -- Vegas, where you have a large amount of crime that people are having to deal with constantly. So I really do question what happened in those moments after he was shot, why wasn't that called in? And it took -- you know, I'm familiar with breaching operations. I'm familiar with counter battery fire looking at where fire is coming from. But Martha, it had this information been passed to the appropriate people during the time of the shooting things could have been done to either laydown suppressive fire on the sniper's nest, or hasten the breaching operation going in the room. Remember, the SWAT guys didn't go in from -- to my recall about an hour after the initial shooting started. So there's more questions here about timelines."

So when you hear -- when you hear of him describe this incident, I agree with the colonel that once somebody is hit it should have been shots fired, I'm hit, or man down, and that would have accelerated the emergency, the 911 call, perhaps police would have got there quicker, but I doubt it. They had a pretty good response time, the first six officers. By the time the SWAT team got there the shooting had stopped on the crowd, so then they had a barricaded situation. So 17 minutes, it was a barricaded situation. So that's understandable. But I do agree that there was a lapse -- a small lapse of time or maybe intelligence."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. When the New York Times broke the story laying out decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer apologized for some misdeeds, denied others, and threatened to sue the Times. But within days, dozens of more allegations surfaced, including from A-list actresses like Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. Weinstein was then dismissed by his company's board of directors, kicked out of the motion picture academy and left by his wife. The floodgates had opened and it wasn't just Harvey Weinstein. Social media was now replete with stories of assault, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, quote, if all the women who've been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote, Me Too, as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem. With that, Me Too became a rallying cry to stand against sexual misconduct. One of the Me Too messages came from Olympic gold gymnast Michaela Maroney, who claims that beginning at age 13 she was molested by Dr. Lawrence Nasser, the former team doctor for the U.S. women's gymnastics team. Nasser is in jail facing 22 molestation counts involving at least seven other gymnasts. Maroney posted, quote, people should know that this is not just happening in Hollywood, this is happening everywhere. And because of the groundswell, Isa Hackett, the producer of Amazon's Man in the High Castle, says she was inspired to make a public accusation against Amazon studio head Roy Price. Five days after the accusation, Roy Price resigned. Finally, in California's democratically controlled state capital, the cry of Me Too became Us Too, when 140 women including lawmakers, lobbyist, and capital staff from both parties signed a letter calling out the pervasive culture of sexual harassment that plagues their industry. The leather states in part, quote, why didn't we speak up? Sometimes out of fear, sometimes out of shame. Often these men hold our professional fate in their hands. Our relationships with them are crucial, crucial to our personal success, and it is not just in the U.S. Me Too stories have inundated the internet from all around the globe. Martha."

It can be in radio, it can be in banking. I mean, when you look at the hashtag and you look at the various backgrounds and careers of these women have. For me too of my experiences, what happened in D.C. where a man came to my hotel room at 2:00 AM, he was the man I was interviewing with for a job and told me if I let him in the room I would get the job. I did not and I did not get the job. And in Boston, when I was fresh out of college, I went to the boss of my boss and said this man is sexually harassing and, I guess, borderline assaulting me, and he brought the man in, sat him next to me, ask him, and the two of them laughed at how delusional I was. And that's why, I think, Martha, so many women have kept their mouth shut for so long, the fear of these powerful individuals who do hold our fate professionally in their hands."

But I don't want to distract away completely from Hollywood being somewhat responsible for the culture that has developed. Hollywood has a very big impact on American culture, they know that they do. And over the course of the past 30 years they have had a rape culture problem that they have refused to acknowledge. They have lectured the rest of the country about misogyny, sexual harassment, sexual assault. They really should have been cleaning up their own neighborhood. And in terms of how we prevent this from happening across the board in every industry, not just in Hollywood, there has to be a sea change of how women are portrayed in pop culture coming directly from Hollywood. When you look around at the people who are directing these films, who were in charge, who are doing the castings from the casting couch, not people being interviewed, but the people deciding who's going to be in film, it's all about portraying women as sex objects. And until that can change, until women are not objectified as -- all around our culture, you see it in Times Square, you have women on billboards, you see it coming from Hollywood. That is the main thing. Women are used as sex objects in movies. I'm not so sure we're going to see so much of this changing in the future."

The three of us being on television tonight, there'll be comments about our physical appearance on social media. It comes from Madison Avenue. It comes from Hollywood, too. But it also comes from our homes. What are the men and women in the families teaching our sons and the men of the future? I think in the past we have seen a tolerance for this, and there has to be zero tolerance, and this has to begin, quite frankly, at home, and by examples of fathers and others in business.

And if you would rather eat ice cream go ahead because there's no consequences. I mean, what kind of the statement was that? It was the most worthless statement he could have made. He would have been better off just saying we have no rules, we're totally unable to demand that our players respect the flag and the anthem, and so it's every man for himself.

It almost sounds like Roger Goodell is trying to negotiate with these players, you know, if that he will sort of go a bit of a distance towards the things that they care about, perhaps he can get them to stand up for the flag?"

They can protest police brutality, they can protest anything they want, maybe they could go out and protest domestic violence since there seems to be a higher than normal level of domestic violence within the ranks of the NFL. That might be a good cause to get them involved in. Look, I don't care what they do on their own time. But when they're on the clock of the employer, when they're wearing the uniform of their team."

For these reasons I decided not to return for another season of 'Chelsea,' and instead devote as much time as I can to become more knowledgeable and engaged citizen and focus on projects that are significant. My goal is to be better informed to raise my voice and participate in a more meaningful way.\" She wants to travel across the country, she says, and visit areas and people that I don't know enough about. Speak to colleges and listen to students and get a better understanding of our political divide. Handler's talk show has struggled, it was switched from a daily show to a weekly show in its second season, and never really broke out in late night. I've always think about that, will you miss that? Tweet me at @marthamaccallum. Thanks for sharing our story tonight. Good to have you here as always. We will be right back here tomorrow night at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is up next.
