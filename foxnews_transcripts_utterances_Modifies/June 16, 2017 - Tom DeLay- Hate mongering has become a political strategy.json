He cites security concerns after GOP lawmakers were fired upon during baseball practice this week. Smart move or too overreaction?  Let's ask former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.  Good to have you here, sir.  Do you think that he's right to be concerned right now, given all that has happened? Or do you just keep moving on, business as usual?",

What has been happening as this hate-mongering and the politics of personal destruction that is going on, the Democrats' whole political strategy is called resistance. That, in itself, defines for you where they're taking all this. And all the attacks that are coming against Trump, against conservatives are coming as a political strategy. And it's turned into action, the kids tearing down the buildings and hurting people in Berkeley and on other campuses around, the Black Lives Matter.  All of these kinds of things are building up an energy that we have to be concerned with. I don't know that I would have canceled my town hall meeting, but I certainly would have had security there.",

And we have turned love into hate and politics into hate. And that hate cannot be turned down, unless we -- we look at ourselves and see what is happening.  The baseball game was great. I really liked to see what it was, what went on there. But people have to think about what they're doing. I mean, the Democrats, for instance, are putting millions of dollars in organizations to do nothing but destroy people and their family.   Media Matters is one of them. Another group called CREW.
