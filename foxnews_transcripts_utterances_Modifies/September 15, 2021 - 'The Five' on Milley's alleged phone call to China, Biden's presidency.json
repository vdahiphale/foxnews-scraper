And that he would warn China if the U.S. was going to attack. Another allegation details how Nancy Pelosi called General Milley after the capitol riots and told him to protect the nuclear codes from former President Trump. Milley reportedly agreed and then took steps to potentially limit Trump's power. Defense officials are telling Jennifer Griffin those two allegations are not true and the calls with China were not secret and Milley's office issuing a statement today saying his actions were routine and part of his normal duties.

But I do know that my sources in Trump world are saying that he probably had his team leak this, Milley, to make himself look heroic, and it's blowing up in his face. They say this guy wants to be loved by the left and he wants to be known as the guy that saved America from Trump. Remember, he was part of this cabal with Mattis and General Kelly that were going to protect America from Trump's base or instincts. I'm also told he's always been very dismissive of civilian control, always kind of disrespectful when civilians pipe up about what they think the military should be doing. And he's always said the same thing. The military is independent, the military is independent. It's actually not independent, it's underneath civilian control. And I know he is a four-star general and I respect him for that, but he is also a four-star leaker. Because as you know, Dana, I have read every single mainstream media book about 2020. And this guy, Milley, comes off better than Joe Biden. It's almost like he would write his own book like, I don't know, \"How I Saved the World.\" That's the kind of savior complex that this general has. So, let's look at the allegation. Let's say the Chinese did think, falsely, that we were about to launch some sort of strike on the Chinese mainland and Milley takes that information. Milley should take it to the defense secretary then go the commander in chief and let the commander in chief's administration decide what message to send to China. If anything at all, maybe keep them guessing, but he said he carved out, allegedly, the commander in chief, the civilian side from this, this is the greatest intel ever. Our biggest enemy thinks we are about to hit him, and you don't tell the commander in chief that? That's crazy. And to say, we won't going to hit you, you know, if we do hit you, we'll let you know. That is not how the U.S. military speaks to our enemies. And it also tells the Chinese that the civilian side in not even in control of the country that the U.S. military is running America, and that's very dangerous. The other allegation, which has been widely reported, was that he went to Nancy and Chuck -- I'm not going to say crying, but he does cry, and say, listen, we are going to put up roadblocks in case Trump wants to launch a use of force. Now anybody that knows Trump knows he wouldn't do that, very reticent and precise with his use of force. And if you are a Republican, Democrat, it's dangerous from a democracy to do that. So, if he goes out there and testifies, he has to be honest with the American people and flat out say, I either did this or I didn't and let the chips fall.",

She allegedly was screaming, she was hysterical, so he then calls everyone together and says, look, the only way this is going to work with the nuclear football, is we got to go through x, y, and z. Look, he is a political -- I don't want to call him what I want to call him, but he is a political person. He went to the church with President Trump, when President Trump carried the bible, when everybody on the left said, you know, the National Guard moved everyone out, they didn't move everyone out. OK? And then he apologized for walking with the president. This guy is a political operative, he's got no command, his role is to advise, and you know what, as if Afghanistan wasn't enough. We now need this to get him the hell out of the Pentagon. He needs to be gone. And shame on him. And by the way, if you were any kind of man, he would have gotten together and at least told the cabinet, for the 25th amendment, as opposed to running around, if didn't want to tell the president. And the fact that he told Esper, it's not enough for me, that's not enough. He should have gone and spoken to the president with Esper. Who the hell is he to call the Chinese?

That's now been confirmed by an Axios report today. Josh Rogan is also in agreement with what he is hearing from his sources. His chain of command would be to go to Esper, to have the secretary of defense there when he is having this conversation. And he said that he absolutely, or his office said, did not violate the chain of command when it comes to the nuclear codes.

And I think the deliberate decision by people like Facebook that enabled the spread of this kind of thing, and apparently, a whistleblower had to come forward.

Even on Section 230, I don't think that actually is an issue here for this particular one because it's more of an issue -- it's a cultural issue. It's a subconscious issue for young girls. And it can lead to really disruptive behavior, of course. I know that in Utah, they're trying to deal with the fact that there had been a lot of, unfortunately, a terrible trend of teen suicide. And one of the things they decided to do was to try to create a three- number suicide hotline so that people would have -- be able to have more immediate access. The one -- but one thing that might be able to help is some of these options like you can limit the amount of time you have available to you on your phone. Like, it could automatically turn off. But then if you have somebody like Britney Spears, an influencer. So, she just got engaged, and she announced to her fans, I'm taking a break from Instagram so that I can celebrate my engagement.

You have drugs, mental illness, suicide, early death. Essentially, they were indulged without discipline. This is what Instagram is doing. It democratized fame. So, all of these young girls now can get the same effects that were available to other people that were famous. They create their own little famous pool. And that's what happens. To the point about the magazine things, this is a girls problem created by girls. There's no men have anything to do with this. If girls don't want to look at plus-size models on Sports Illustrated, they want to look at beautiful models on the front of glamour or Cosmo, right?

But I do know that my sources in Trump world are saying that he probably had his team leak this, Milley, to make himself look heroic, and it's blowing up in his face. They say this guy wants to be loved by the left and he wants to be known as the guy that saved America from Trump. Remember, he was part of this cabal with Mattis and General Kelly that were going to protect America from Trump's base or instincts. I'm also told he's always been very dismissive of civilian control, always kind of disrespectful when civilians pipe up about what they think the military should be doing. And he's always said the same thing. The military is independent, the military is independent. It's actually not independent, it's underneath civilian control. And I know he is a four-star general and I respect him for that, but he is also a four-star leaker. Because as you know, Dana, I have read every single mainstream media book about 2020. And this guy, Milley, comes off better than Joe Biden. It's almost like he would write his own book like, I don't know, \"How I Saved the World.\" That's the kind of savior complex that this general has. So, let's look at the allegation. Let's say the Chinese did think, falsely, that we were about to launch some sort of strike on the Chinese mainland and Milley takes that information. Milley should take it to the defense secretary then go the commander in chief and let the commander in chief's administration decide what message to send to China. If anything at all, maybe keep them guessing, but he said he carved out, allegedly, the commander in chief, the civilian side from this, this is the greatest intel ever. Our biggest enemy thinks we are about to hit him, and you don't tell the commander in chief that? That's crazy. And to say, we won't going to hit you, you know, if we do hit you, we'll let you know. That is not how the U.S. military speaks to our enemies. And it also tells the Chinese that the civilian side in not even in control of the country that the U.S. military is running America, and that's very dangerous. The other allegation, which has been widely reported, was that he went to Nancy and Chuck -- I'm not going to say crying, but he does cry, and say, listen, we are going to put up roadblocks in case Trump wants to launch a use of force. Now anybody that knows Trump knows he wouldn't do that, very reticent and precise with his use of force. And if you are a Republican, Democrat, it's dangerous from a democracy to do that. So, if he goes out there and testifies, he has to be honest with the American people and flat out say, I either did this or I didn't and let the chips fall."

She allegedly was screaming, she was hysterical, so he then calls everyone together and says, look, the only way this is going to work with the nuclear football, is we got to go through x, y, and z. Look, he is a political -- I don't want to call him what I want to call him, but he is a political person. He went to the church with President Trump, when President Trump carried the bible, when everybody on the left said, you know, the National Guard moved everyone out, they didn't move everyone out. OK? And then he apologized for walking with the president. This guy is a political operative, he's got no command, his role is to advise, and you know what, as if Afghanistan wasn't enough. We now need this to get him the hell out of the Pentagon. He needs to be gone. And shame on him. And by the way, if you were any kind of man, he would have gotten together and at least told the cabinet, for the 25th amendment, as opposed to running around, if didn't want to tell the president. And the fact that he told Esper, it's not enough for me, that's not enough. He should have gone and spoken to the president with Esper. Who the hell is he to call the Chinese?

That's now been confirmed by an Axios report today. Josh Rogan is also in agreement with what he is hearing from his sources. His chain of command would be to go to Esper, to have the secretary of defense there when he is having this conversation. And he said that he absolutely, or his office said, did not violate the chain of command when it comes to the nuclear codes.

He said you don't have to worry about me. I'll just be the caretaker, everything will be really smooth, no one will ever have to think about it. He didn't run on fundamentally changing the economic system of the United States, he didn't run on basically beating a hasty retreat out of Afghanistan and leaving Americans behind and green card holders, and then the people that helped us have no help either. In and the polls that you saw, in Quinnipiac poll in particular, the independents are down to, I think, 32 percent approval, and women was then, I think more like 47, 46 -- I'm looking at Jessica she looks at these polls a little bit more closely than I do, but women are really like the bread and butter for the Democratic Party. So, if all those numbers are going down, then you have to look at the durability of the negativity. So, these numbers have been going down for a while, polls take a little bit of time to catch up, the Afghanistan issue has been going on for about 30 days, now you're starting to see that manifest. And even though so many in the media are helping, it doesn't seem to be improving his numbers at all. They are pretty bad. I also think that they are really out of touch. They seem detached. They -- he hasn't gotten out too much. He went to California to campaign for Gavin Newsom, stopped in Idaho to make it an official trip, talking about wildfires. Other than that, I think that they seemed pretty disconnected because people don't want this $3.5 trillion necessarily, but their main concern right now for workers out there is inflation.

But the core thing at least that I'm focused on, is for the midterms, will economy become untethered from the COVID question. Because Biden was able to win in 2020 because the economy was linked to what's going on with COVID. Everyone knew that the economy was shut down because we have this health emergency. So by the midterms, we are largely back to normal, which is my expectation, then will there be a punishment against Democrats for what's going on if inflation continues to grow, et cetera, versus people saying, yes, I may like how we're handling the vaccine mandate and the masking or whatever. And to Dana's point about women, I think it's really valuable one because Democrats have a shifting coalition right now.

Those who remain maskless as they are served, and those who they employ as their servants who must have their faces covered at all times. The pandemic generated a new form of crude cultural segregation, a series of protocols which ensure that maskless elites need not ever cast eyes up on the faces of their servant class.\" Well, that was a very eloquent putdown, Greg."

They wear the masks, you don't, and the masks tell you the power structure, right? You go like, OK, the people not wearing the masks, they are important. They are celebrities. People wearing the masks, they have to do it or they are going to lose their jobs. So, it's like even AOC's dress, I don't even care about that dress. In fact, I might argue that was pretty -- that was really cool for going in there, but the problem is nobody there was made uncomfortable by it because they think, wow. That's so beautiful, yes, we'll pay more taxes because we're like billionaires. So, what would have been more interesting is dresses that say things that would have made them uncomfortable like, you know, I'm against the death penalty unless it's an unborn child.

Clearly, the evidence is there. It is damaging to young girls, what is it, 11 to 13, whatever that age is, because their body images such that it doesn't match what they're seeing, as you know, identified as beautiful. And I think the deliberate decision by people like Facebook that enabled the spread of this kind of thing, and apparently, a whistleblower had to come forward. But here's the problem, Congress is not doing the work and should be doing as it relates to any of these social media companies. They still continue to have protection under 230. I don't know why they have that protection. And then you know, the monitoring of some people and the discarding of other people information and whatever you post, I've had things that were bumped everyone I know, has had things that were bumped.

And so, they would target the magazines and say you need to change things. Even on Section 230, I don't think that actually is an issue here for this particular one because it's more of an issue -- it's a cultural issue. It's a subconscious issue for young girls. And it can lead to really disruptive behavior, of course. I know that in Utah, they're trying to deal with the fact that there had been a lot of, unfortunately, a terrible trend of teen suicide. And one of the things they decided to do was to try to create a three- number suicide hotline so that people would have -- be able to have more immediate access. The one -- but one thing that might be able to help is some of these options like you can limit the amount of time you have available to you on your phone. Like, it could automatically turn off. But then if you have somebody like Britney Spears, an influencer. So, she just got engaged, and she announced to her fans, I'm taking a break from Instagram so that I can celebrate my engagement.

There is no wisdom to be found in a young person. And we were allowing him to indulge themselves in the worst way. If you look at the future of child stars, they're overwhelmingly bad. You have drugs, mental illness, suicide, early death. Essentially, they were indulged without discipline. This is what Instagram is doing. It democratized fame. So, all of these young girls now can get the same effects that were available to other people that were famous. They create their own little famous pool. And that's what happens. To the point about the magazine things, this is a girls problem created by girls. There's no men have anything to do with this. If girls don't want to look at plus-size models on Sports Illustrated, they want to look at beautiful models on the front of glamour or Cosmo, right? They want to go on Instagram and they want to look sexy and hot. So, these are girls indulging girls. The parents need to be there and the parents aren't there anymore.

And that's my -- that's Paul, Joni's husband who is one of my producers. There's absolutely no way to replace somebody like Norm. And if you've never really listened to him, all you got to do is go on YouTube, start with one video. I would just type in Norm and moth joke, and then you'll probably be there for seven hours going through -- because he also did an amazing podcast. He was he might have been the funniest person alive during the time that he was alive. And he was also a very good, very moral, very honest person. He used to watch THE FIVE and used to, you know, say nice things on Twitter whenever he was watching it. He was a fan and just a wonderful person. Rest in peace, Norm."

It's been really incredible. And then this cartoon came, and this was done by John Rasmussen. And he lost his dog jack in 2015. And he has since drawn over 5000 of these cartoons for people. So, that is jack and Jasper there at the -- at the bridge. I also want to thank Leah. She's 7 years old. Leah Bonewald, Jason Bonewald who works at Fox radio. She's 7 years old. She drew this freehand. And she had the marker that match the color exactly. So, anyway, it's given us a lot of comfort and we thank you so much.
