I am Laura Ingraham. We have a sensational show tonight and you are not going to want to miss a minute from start to finish so stay right here. The son of the president, Eric Trump, is here to discuss the big stories making headlines including calls to investigate the Obama administration and the push for new gun control.  Plus, a stunning new revelation on the Florida shooting, an armed deputy quickly arrived on the scene but apparently, he refused to confront the gunman or go inside the building. That's helpful.  And we'll also tell you how an alert security officer in another could have been a horrific situation may have prevented yet another school shooting.  And John Bolton tells us why China is getting even more bold and dangerous on the world stage. But first, to woo Trump and win the 2018 midterms, the left exploits tragedy and demonizes the NRA. That's the focus of tonight's angle.  Last night at a CNN town hall, Florida Senator Marco Rubio walked into the lion's den with a fillet mignon in his back pockets.",

      "sentences": "Again, I cannot stress this enough, the Democrats and their leftist enablers in the media are positively desperate to distract you from all the good news that's happening around us. Think about this a new poll out just this week by Gallup tells us that 45 percent of Americans are satisfied with our standing in the world. That's a 13-year high and it's also a 13-percentage point increase from just a year ago.   Small business confidence is way up, the economy is strong, and so all the Democrats can do in response is to create new boogeyman. Now it's the NRA. For a year, they've tried to peddle contempt for President Donald Trump, but today after all that work by the media and the left his approval numbers are higher than they were when he was elected.  The generic Republican versus Democrat ballot is also tightening. This is incredible. Some in the GOP have the GOP now within three points of the Democrats. The Democrats led by double digits just two months ago. So, I say this, sure, the country still has problems, drug addiction and violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore and the spread of MS-13 and now we know the need to improve the school safety. But generally, things are getting better. They're getting better for more Americans and this is driving Democrats absolutely bonkers. So much so that they're even willing to exploit the pain of the young Stoneman Douglas High School survivors.   Now I'd like to say that I was surprised by this but I'm not. Many on the left, elected officials, professional activists and those who fund them have been doing this doing this kind of thing for decades. In order to create the socialist utopia that they all envision, they have tried to convince the people, our people in this country, the citizens to sacrifice their individual rights, their basic freedoms for the common good. A few more taxes here, a few more regulations there, and now they want to water down the Second Amendment on the false promise that to do so will be an end to all these school killings. We won't have any school killings anymore.   But I say we should be very careful here. The administrative state wants to take away guns using tragedies as excuses because they don't want the private individual to have personal power.  As Ben Franklin once wrote, those who would give us a sense of liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. That is the angle. Joining us now for reaction is someone who knows the president, I'd say extremely well, his son, Eric Trump, who is an executive vice president at the Trump Organization. It's good to see you, Eric. How are you?  First time on \"The Ingraham Angle\" since we started. What's your sense about what's happening out there today? Your dad had this incredible event yesterday at the White House yesterday and the vitriol and vial that he received at the other end of that is tough.",

And unfortunately, I think a lot of the people talking about gun control don't understand what they're talking about because I'm a Republican, I'm a gun owner. I'm a responsible gun owner. When we talk about gun control, it's not about taking away guns from people like me but keeping them out of the hands of the people who should not have them or irresponsible or a threat to society. Last night, when Ted Deutsche kept repeating his mantra that he wants to eliminate any gun that can fire 150 rounds in 6 minutes, that's almost every gun that's out there. So, this supposed assault weapons bans, these other items they are talking about aren't going to accomplish anything along those lines.  So, I agree we need to make some headway and raise the age to buy a rifle, I agree with the president on that, but beyond that a lot of these folks who are yelling gun control, gun control really don't have a great grasp on what they are talking about.",

I am Laura Ingraham. We have a sensational show tonight and you are not going to want to miss a minute from start to finish so stay right here. The son of the president, Eric Trump, is here to discuss the big stories making headlines including calls to investigate the Obama administration and the push for new gun control. Plus, a stunning new revelation on the Florida shooting, an armed deputy quickly arrived on the scene but apparently, he refused to confront the gunman or go inside the building. That's helpful. And we'll also tell you how an alert security officer in another could have been a horrific situation may have prevented yet another school shooting. And John Bolton tells us why China is getting even more bold and dangerous on the world stage. But first, to woo Trump and win the 2018 midterms, the left exploits tragedy and demonizes the NRA. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Last night at a CNN town hall, Florida Senator Marco Rubio walked into the lion's den with a fillet mignon in his back pockets."

If he had no notes, they would have complained that Trump just winged it and he clearly just doesn't care at all about the kids. The anti-gun activists have every right to make their pitch to ban weapons if that's what they really believed. But I'll tell you one thing, they are not entitled to their own facts.

      "utterance": "Again, I cannot stress this enough, the Democrats and their leftist enablers in the media are positively desperate to distract you from all the good news that's happening around us. Think about this a new poll out just this week by Gallup tells us that 45 percent of Americans are satisfied with our standing in the world. That's a 13-year high and it's also a 13-percentage point increase from just a year ago. Small business confidence is way up, the economy is strong, and so all the Democrats can do in response is to create new boogeyman. Now it's the NRA. For a year, they've tried to peddle contempt for President Donald Trump, but today after all that work by the media and the left his approval numbers are higher than they were when he was elected. The generic Republican versus Democrat ballot is also tightening. This is incredible. Some in the GOP have the GOP now within three points of the Democrats. The Democrats led by double digits just two months ago. So, I say this, sure, the country still has problems, drug addiction and violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore and the spread of MS-13 and now we know the need to improve the school safety. But generally, things are getting better. They're getting better for more Americans and this is driving Democrats absolutely bonkers. So much so that they're even willing to exploit the pain of the young Stoneman Douglas High School survivors. Now I'd like to say that I was surprised by this but I'm not. Many on the left, elected officials, professional activists and those who fund them have been doing this doing this kind of thing for decades. In order to create the socialist utopia that they all envision, they have tried to convince the people, our people in this country, the citizens to sacrifice their individual rights, their basic freedoms for the common good. A few more taxes here, a few more regulations there, and now they want to water down the Second Amendment on the false promise that to do so will be an end to all these school killings. We won't have any school killings anymore. But I say we should be very careful here. The administrative state wants to take away guns using tragedies as excuses because they don't want the private individual to have personal power. As Ben Franklin once wrote, those who would give us a sense of liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. That is the angle. Joining us now for reaction is someone who knows the president, I'd say extremely well, his son, Eric Trump, who is an executive vice president at the Trump Organization. It's good to see you, Eric. How are you? First time on \"The Ingraham Angle\" since we started. What's your sense about what's happening out there today? Your dad had this incredible event yesterday at the White House yesterday and the vitriol and vial that he received at the other end of that is tough."

This country is doing great on a relative basis. The economy is through the roof. Unemployment is lower than it's ever been before and African-American unemployment is the lowest it's been and the jobs are coming back. Manufacturing is coming back. The markets are, you know, just raging 401(k)s are up. I mean, there are so many great things. You know, the vets are being helped and military is strong. ISIS is gone. There are so many things that we can celebrate, and I agree that Democrats will use absolutely anything they can to take him down because they're afraid of all the successes. Now I'm not saying something doesn't need to take place over the tragedy that's happened but my heart breaks.

I actually spoke to a CNN producer on Thursday, the day after the shooting, and the producer insinuated to me that they were looking for people who are willing to espouse a certain narrative, which was taking the tragedy and turning it into a policy debate, and I read that as being a gun control debate. And unfortunately, I think a lot of the people talking about gun control don't understand what they're talking about because I'm a Republican, I'm a gun owner. I'm a responsible gun owner. When we talk about gun control, it's not about taking away guns from people like me but keeping them out of the hands of the people who should not have them or irresponsible or a threat to society. Last night, when Ted Deutsche kept repeating his mantra that he wants to eliminate any gun that can fire 150 rounds in 6 minutes, that's almost every gun that's out there. So, this supposed assault weapons bans, these other items they are talking about aren't going to accomplish anything along those lines. So, I agree we need to make some headway and raise the age to buy a rifle, I agree with the president on that, but beyond that a lot of these folks who are yelling gun control, gun control really don't have a great grasp on what they are talking about."

And this is a way of taking advantage of all of that western capital, all of that investment that has come. And I thought David Malpass summed it up exactly right.

He's actually quite good at recreating."

      "utterance": "If there's one thing you can take away from tonight's show, remember what Andrew Klein said, the father of one of the students from Parkland. He said when CNN called him right after the shooting, it was evident to him that CNN was pushing a policy agenda and that's what they were looking for in their guests. Remember that's what he said. It wasn't just one student. Colton Haab has said that. Now the father, Andrew Klein, said the same thing. I'll be speaking tomorrow at CPAC around 9:00 a.m., 9:15, so make sure to tune in.
