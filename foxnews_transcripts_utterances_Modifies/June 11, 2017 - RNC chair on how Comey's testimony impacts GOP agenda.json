London went overwhelmingly for Labour, and so that's a question I've had is whether in some complicated way this was also influenced by hostility towards Trump. But I just want to underscore what to me was the real headline here, which is the comeback of Jeremy Corbyn. She called this election because his poll numbers were in the - were in the garbage. He was down in the 30's. He was thought to be this played out old Marxist and he didn't shy away from any of that ideology. He, in effect, doubled down on it and embarked on this remarkable comeback. I think, you know, the big picture story here may be this researching, not just left, but ultra-left in - in Britain. It hasn't been that way so much on the comment, but the polarization that's gone between the Tories (ph) and this ultra-left Labour party is really remarkable. And there are things - Jeremy Corbyn's no fan of NATO, by the way. Everybody talks about Trump and NATO. Jeremy Corbyn has a long history of rejection of NATO and sympathy for Russia, I might add.

Joining me now, the chair of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel. Ms. McDaniel, the president has been tweeting today, I want to put up one of those tweets. Here it is -- I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very cowardly.

The things that James Comey said with regard to the president, that he's not under investigation, he's never been under investigation, that there's been no obstruction, that there's been no effort to impede the investigation, those are things we've heard across from many witnesses and many other individuals.

We learned that he leaked memos that he put together from conversations he had with the president the president of the United States that were protected under executive privilege and that he leaked them to the press.

You've seen obstruction with things as critical as the Supreme Court nominee that they knew was highly qualified in Neil Gorsuch. And now, it's throw doubt on the administration. Open as many investigations as possible, cloud the administration as much as possible, because they are trying to run out the clock to 2018. That is their playbook, we know it.

Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, is somebody who speaks definitively. He's somebody who when he talks to you, you know what he means. So, again, this is all James Comey's version of events and we've got to look at it that way."

The House has already passed the repeal and replace of Obamacare. We're going to continue to work at that. But this just doesn't quickly happen. And Republicans are doing it the right way. We're going back into our districts. We're talking to constituents. We're having a diverse discussion. We're making sure that when we do it, we do it right, because we recognize the failures of Obamacare -- passing 30,000 pages of legislation quickly, ramming it through, without anybody looking at it. Now look at what it's done across this country, it is failing. You have insurers pulling out of marketplace. You have people whose premiums have doubled.

We're conducting investigation because I think one thing that the president continues to diminish, which I think is unfortunate, is the fact that the Russian government at the highest level deliberately interfered with our election in 2016, and according to all of our experts in the intelligence community, they are coming back with more force in '18 and '20. We have, as a legislative matter, find out what they did, why they did it, how we can prevent it, do we need statutory improvements, do we need to empower our agencies to do something else?

      "utterance": "I've never been directed -- but I think what we saw there was two individuals who are very uncomfortable answering and ultimately when I asked them on -- were you asked, and Senator King repeatedly asked the same question, they refused to answer. And the obvious point that I made was, if you were never asked, it would be very easy and almost reflexive to say, no, I was never asked. They wouldn't do that, they couldn't do that. So, there's a whole series of issues about the president's conduct. Does it constitute a pattern of trying to get pressure relieved off of this investigation? And the president himself, when he met with the Russian foreign minister, declared that, you know, first of all, I got rid of that crazy nut job Mueller, I think -- excuse me, Comey. I think, frankly, Mr. Comey demonstrated he's not a crazy nut job. Second, he said the Russian investigation, the pressure is off now, et cetera. And that's the Russian foreign minister, as well as leaking other classified intelligence information at that meeting. So, the president himself has declared that his purpose was to somehow throttle this investigation into Russian participation. All of these things add up to very serious set of potential charges, perhaps not against the president, but certainly against individuals surrounding him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

      "speaker": "REED",
      "utterance": "Well, first, there's a question on his participation in the firing of Director Comey. He had already recused himself and then, suddenly, he's the one apparently recommending to the president that Comey be fired and the president has indicated, suggested -- not suggested -- declared it was all about the Russian investigation. So, there is a real question of the propriety of the attorney general participating in that in any way, shape or form. Then, there's been allegations publicly of meetings that go beyond the meetings that he's already declared he had with representatives of Russian government. That will come up."
    },

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, let me ask about that, do you have any evidence that he met -- there are two times now that he's on the record as having said he met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Do you have any evidence that he met with him in other times?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REED",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REED",
      "utterance": "Well, I think at this point, he's one of the key figures. He was involved, apparently, from reports that have not been refuted, with contacts with the Russians. The question again, it goes back to why the questioning the president will not be restricted and discrete to the Comey situation. You know, what did General Flynn tell the president? Was he directed by the president to initiate these conversations? Were these appropriate conversations? But I think General Flynn is someone who is the key focus of the investigation now. Not the exclusive focus, but the key focus."

      "utterance": "The key focus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REED",
      "utterance": "Well, I think so, because I think working through General Flynn, that will develop other possible connections, other possible leads. And again, this appears, and I think again, former FBI Director Mueller is probably the best person to do this investigation. He's taking a very broad view. But I think it begins, simply, because in terms of sort of the timing, the dismissal of General Flynn as national security adviser has triggered a lot of this interest, a lot of the investigations. Comey was working to make sure that that investigation was going forward."

I mean nobody on Capitol Hill has been questioning the integrity and the independence of the special counsel and I think it was a - you know, appropriate. I man the - James Comey heard the president say things that were untrue and that were a mischaracterization of their - their meetings and he put out in the public sphere, not classified information, information that he had prepared, and it wasn't a leak, into the public sphere.

He's widely regarded, notwithstanding what we just heard here, by Republicans and Democrats on The Hill as an honest broker in this affair. Secondly, it gives it a channel for all the discussion and all the investigation to go through one pipeline instead of 50 different committees and 50 different leaks. It's - it - it's actually in the Republicans' own - the president's own interest to have it go through this process. But, look, let's look at the big picture here. I'm not in any position to say whether a particular crime or impeachable offense occurred. But what I am and I think we're all in a position to say after this testimony the last week, the president of the United States did something terribly inappropriate. He misused his authority by engaging in that kind of meeting, in that kind of conversation with Jim Comey under those circumstances and backhandedly Paul Ryan is admitting it by saying, in effect, at this is what a person doesn't understand government would do.

Ironically, the French may turn out to be stable in the British may turn out to be unstable. And it was both a bad campaign on their part and I think a big miscalculation because it turned out that the - the United Kingdom independent party voters, once they had Brexit, reverted to being Labour Party voters and went back to their natural party base.

There was a guy who I had been sitting near, he was working in the financial services industry, merely began swearing at older Britons. He said, if we hadn't let those senior buggers vote, we would have won because under 35-year-olds voted overwhelmingly to remain. Well, this time around they had their revenge. The young, particularly those with college degrees, turned out in - in a much higher number and they voted for not conservative in order to thereby soften the - which May had said, I will have a hard exit if you re-elect the conservatives.

London went overwhelmingly for Labour, and so that's a question I've had is whether in some complicated way this was also influenced by hostility towards Trump. But I just want to underscore what to me was the real headline here, which is the comeback of Jeremy Corbyn. She called this election because his poll numbers were in the - were in the garbage. He was down in the 30's. He was thought to be this played out old Marxist and he didn't shy away from any of that ideology. He, in effect, doubled down on it and embarked on this remarkable comeback. I think, you know, the big picture story here may be this researching, not just left, but ultra-left in - in Britain. It hasn't been that way so much on the comment, but the polarization that's gone between the Tories (ph) and this ultra-left Labour party is really remarkable. And there are things - Jeremy Corbyn's no fan of NATO, by the way. Everybody talks about Trump and NATO. Jeremy Corbyn has a long history of rejection of NATO and sympathy for Russia, I might add. So - and he's, right now, on the rise and arguably, if things played out a certain way, could be the next prime minister. He or somebody like him."
