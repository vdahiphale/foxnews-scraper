The good news there is that in the last week, Mexico really has stepped it up for the very first time. They are preventing people from coming in on their own southern border down towards Guatemala and Honduras and they are also accepting more of the folks that cross into the United States back into Mexico.

They want to use it politically while Democrats are fighting in 2020 in a primary against each other, Democrats in Washington, D.C., are trying to get as much information and political ammunition as possible to give to the ultimate nominee. They're doing that through the Mueller report. I just have to say, when it comes to them accusing the White House of not being transparent on the issue of the Mueller report, the White House has not requested to see the Mueller report ahead of time. President Trump has said he is not going to assert any kind of executive privilege, even though he has the right to do so over the information.

They still cannot accept the fact that he won like the election and they will do anything they can to try and either undo that or prevent that from happening again. Go back to the president's State of the Union speech. He said really there's a choice here, you can either choose to work with me or fight against me and it's clear with the Democrats have done. They have no interest in working with this president on the border, on health care, and anything. They want to fight with the president and they will do it every chance they get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Keep in mind, I think that word about waiting a year dealt with drugs. There's a couple of different things he said this week which is we need help right away on the migrant crisis, on illegal immigration, folks coming across the Mexican border. We also have another longer-term issue with Mexico on drugs that I think if you go back and look at his statement, he said we need help within the next year on drugs. The good news there is that in the last week, Mexico really has stepped it up for the very first time. They are preventing people from coming in on their own southern border down towards Guatemala and Honduras and they are also accepting more of the folks that cross into the United States back into Mexico. In fact, I know it's hard to imagine, but again, Nancy Pelosi runs the Democrats in Congress, Mexico has done more in the last week to help our illegal immigration crisis than Nancy Pelosi and Democrats in the House. It's been a pretty good week."

      "utterance": "I think they took him seriously. I think when the president comes out and says, look, if you don't come stop helping us we are serious, we will look at closing the border. We will look at tariffing your automobiles. They recognize that's not -- that's not an empty threat for the president of the United States. The situation on the border is a crisis. We have been talking about that for I guess almost three or four months. Very few people believed us at the outset. I think more and more people now accepting the fact it is a real life, crisis. I think even \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" acknowledged that for the first time this week. It is his number one priority and when he sets out and says, look, Mexico, if you don't help us, we will have no choice but to do these things, I think Mexico pays attention."

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely for the same reason. This is his number one priority. Keep in mind, dealing with health care is nice, dealing with the economy is nice. The president's first responsibility is to defend the integrity and the safety of the nation and we really do believe, and I think again most folks are starting to agree with us now, that the situation on the border is a national security crisis."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "The issue is this, broadly speaking, families arrive here with children. They are willing to turn themselves in. The facilities that house them are overloaded and then they are released into the country. Have the smugglers, Mick, have they beat us at our own policy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "They certainly game the system. They're not stupid. Keep in mind, these are Mexican cartels oftentimes that can reach hundreds, if not tens of hundreds of millions of dollars, moving people. They traffic human beings. The goal has been deeper to what you just said. It's not just about families. If an unaccompanied child crosses the border, DHS can only hold that child -- this is a child already separated from the parents by the choice of the family. Only has to send them to HHS, but if HHS doesn't have room for them, DHS cannot keep them, cannot send them back to the country they came from. There's legally nothing that the DHS can do with the children. That's why we need --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "But the smugglers know the weather is going to get warmer, and now is the time for them to ask. I want to get to a lot of things. Just to cut through on this issue, what is the plan to get out of this current crisis?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Number one, Mexico has to continue to do what they are doing by preventing people from coming into Mexico and then accepting people that we send. Number two, the Northern Triangle countries have to prevent their own people from leaving. And number three, this is a one we don't get a chance to talk about enough, Congress must act. The laws are what is acting as this giant magnet for these illegal immigrants and Congress has to chase those laws -- change those laws. Again, I think for the first time, even Democrats are starting to recognize that."

If they don't get what they want, they'll ask for something else. So, it doesn't surprise anybody. But keep in mind, they knew they are not going to get these taxes. They know what the law is. They know that one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes. They know that. They know the terms under law by which the IRS can give them documents but a political hit job is not one of those reasons."

      "utterance": "Oh, no, never. Nor should they. Keep in mind, that that's an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't and they elected him anyway, which is, of course, what drives the Democrats crazy. But they know they're not going to get this. They just want the attention on the issue because they don't want to talk to us about policy."
    },

      "speaker": "HEMMER",

      "utterance": "You could always allow people to see it, but that's not what's happening here. The Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents and that is not going to happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt by my former colleagues."

    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "We've said from the very beginning that Mr. Barr will make these decisions. There are laws in place that govern how this special investigation is conducted. Keep in mind, got a lot of attention I think in the press about two weeks ago when all 420-odd members of Congress who voted to release the Mueller report to the public. But if you go and look at what they actually voted on, it says voted to release the Mueller report pursuant to law. That is the same thing the White House has been saying. We want Bill Barr to follow the law, period, end of story, and that's what he's going to do."

It should not surprise anybody that Donald Trump decided that, yes, he thinks that all of Obamacare is unconstitutional. We had to fire a brief to that end. That should come as a surprise to no one. What was actually a surprise to us is that when Jeff Sessions was attorney general, he took a different position and said only parts of the law were unconstitutional. So, no, we did the exact right thing. We think the court decided properly. Keep in mind, the U.S. district court has already -- has already found all of the law to be unconstitutional.

Drug pricing is unmistakably part of health care. And drug prices in this country actually came down last year for the first time in 50 years. That's because Donald Trump's president. That's part of what health care is. We spent the time this week and say, OK, what have we done, what can we talk about that's a success, what we need to work on going forward? We talked about the individual marketplace. We talk about how we are protecting Medicare. We're talking about getting drug prices down and I do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly."

When you go back to the threats even during the midterms, the president was suggesting that there was an immediate national security crisis and he sent troops to the border just to try to distract the American people with the gains that we were going to see in the midterms. Then we went into a shutdown and the president took the same deal after 35 days of a shutdown that he couldn't take on day one to prevent that government shutdown. And here we go again with the president doubling down with threats to shutdown the Mexican border, which would have devastated the U.S. economy, devastated the U.S. auto manufacturers, concerns in many other areas including 27,000 workers in Mexico as the Mueller report was coming out. So, again, I think the president continues to use immigration as a distraction as opposed to trying to work together in a bipartisan basis, whether it's immigration reform --"

Look, separating children from their families at the border is not a humane -- it's not with the United States should be doing and we continue to see this administration engage in those policies. All that we are saying as Democrats is, Mr. President, we want to work together on immigration reform, just as you committed to do when you invited all the cameras in and said we could find some common ground. I certainly hope the president was sincere in that offering and that we can find a way to work together as Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate and this administration."

I think the president is threatening to shutdown the border, cut off the money from the Northern Triangle which would only encourage more violence in those countries and encourage more people to flee for their own lives. Think about why these moms are fleeing with their children. They are terrified that they're going to be killed, murdered or raped. What parent wouldn't do everything they could to protect their child? With that being said now, the United States can continue to work when it comes to strong policies in the United States and the way that Democrats let the initiatives with the investments when it came to border security during the shutdown conversation. What Democrats did was make investments when it came to our ports of entry and also provided more dollars associated for border officials, whether it was customs officials at the southern border or the northern border and also with the water ports. We should be talking about homeland security and comprehensively as it pertains to national security in the United States."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",

This past week, \"Politico\" framed it the following way, it wrote the following: In a single day, House Democrats demanded President Trump's tax returns for six years, move to get a decade worth of his financial records and prepared to issue a subpoena for the full Mueller report from the Justice Department. The White House would argue that's harassment. Is that what you're doing?"

      "speaker": "LUJAN",

There are authorities under Section 6103 with the Ways and Means Committee to be able to get their hands and requests the president's tax returns in this case. This as an authority that Republicans used as recently as 2014 and an authority that was used during times with President Nixon, President ford as well. And so, again, no other president in modern times has had to have their tax returns requested under 6103 because they've all voluntarily shared them. Just as President Trump promised as a candidate that he would share his tax returns after he was elected, he promised he would share his taxes to returns with the American people and he's refused to do so."

It was used under President Nixon and President Ford, and all we're saying, Mr. President, is share your tax returns as you promised with the American people and let's make sure that you're following the same rules and laws as everyone else. Again, this is congressional oversight as we are carrying it out."

So, I believe that Chairman Richie Neal and his team have put together what I would say is an ironclad request that has been submitted and is going forward. So again, we just want to work under the laws that we have, under the authorities in this case Section 6103 which gives the chairman of the committee full authority to ask for these tax returns, and for Congress to see them."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "OK. Let me go to the Barr summary here. Maybe we get it this week, maybe we get it in the first few days after that. There was a late Friday court decision that came out that ruled grand jury information must remain private. Now, if that's the case, Democrats who want to make that report public -- and Jerry Nadler has said as much this past week. If that court case stands, the Democrats just lose that fight?"

Do you remember as Mick Mulvaney talked about the vote that took place on the House floor, 420-0. Democrats and Republicans came together to say this report should be made available to the American people. That's all that we are saying here. So, no, I don't believe that the court ruling hampers the ability for this report to be made available not just a congress, but to the American people, and that's something that we have been asking for and quite honestly, the president even said a few weeks ago that he would make the report available, that he supported that to the American people."

There is broad support as well for the special counsel's report to be made available to the American people as well. So, again, what we are talking about here is constitutional oversight that the Congress has a responsibility to carry out and that's all that we are doing here. We should work together in a bipartisan basis in the same way the Republicans did under President Barack Obama. Let's work together.

There's a lot of energy and passion and I think we should unleash that energy as we work to deliver for the American people and while I announce that I am running for the United States Senate, there's a lot of work to do over the next two years, including making sure that we just not continue to deliver for the American people as House Democrats, but that we flip the Senate in the same way that we delivered the House for the American people, and that's something that we're working on doing."

And so, you're going to have some disagreements but you have them as a family. In the end, our values and our principles are the same when we want to talk about how we can deliver for the American people who are still having a hard time even though the economy is doing better. There still our families across the country who if they had a $500 emergency, there wouldn't be able to fit that into the family budget for the month. And as we've also heard from Senator Bennet out of Colorado, most recently, the concerns associated with wage growth in the country has been stagnant.

      "utterance": "Based on the political dynamics of Washington, D.C., Democrats certainly cannot be trusted with seeing all the underlying material. Democrats don't want to see everything because they're interested in transparency. They want to see it so they can then leak information about certain people in Trump's circle who were simply looked at as part of the Mueller investigation but did not have any evidence or were charged with crimes, not indicted as a result of the investigation. And so, no, Jerry Nadler is not entitled to all of the information. They want to use it politically while Democrats are fighting in 2020 in a primary against each other, Democrats in Washington, D.C., are trying to get as much information and political ammunition as possible to give to the ultimate nominee. They're doing that through the Mueller report. I just have to say, when it comes to them accusing the White House of not being transparent on the issue of the Mueller report, the White House has not requested to see the Mueller report ahead of time. President Trump has said he is not going to assert any kind of executive privilege, even though he has the right to do so over the information. And the special counsel is actually working with Barr right now on the redactions. They're working together to redact information that the public should not see in order to preserve due process and protecting people's privacy in this country."

Every page of the confidential report, he put in his statement, provided to Attorney Barr on March 22, was marked may contain material protected under a federal law that protects confidential grand jury information, therefore cannot be publicly released. So we don't know what he releases in the end. But the law allows the AG broad authority on a lot of these matters. MARIE HARF, CO-HOST, \"BENSON AND HARF\": That's true. But I think what we've seen from the other statement Barr made after the letter, when he came out and said, hey, this wasn't intended to be a summary, it sort of seemed like he was doing a little bit of cleanup because his four-page letter came out and then the president and his supporters started claiming full exoneration saying they were -- he was totally cleared on everything, including obstruction, which isn't true. So I get the sense that William Barr was getting a little nervous about how it was being used politically. And the more time that goes between that letter and the full Mueller report coming out, it will appear political and partisan, even if it's not right, even if William Barr is -- is crossing every t and dotting every i. Look, I know Charlie's laughing here, but there are a lot of us who -- who -- look, if the shoe were on the other foot and it was a democratic attorney general summarizing in four pages a 400 page report into a Democratic president, you would not accept that and we need to see the full Mueller, report not for political reasons --"

And, quite frankly, I think Joe Biden knew some of this would be coming. He knows that there are other people, particularly in the Democratic Party, who don't want him to run, who think he's past his prime. He had to be prepared for this. But the bottom line, Bill, is when you look at Democratic voters, or voters in general, there's still a lot of support for Joe Biden in -- in the polls. Democrats know that. They're still a lot of support for the Obama- Biden eight years that he is going to run. That's going to be a key part of his platform if he runs. I was part of his very successful eight years. So, look, I think he did the right thing by threading the needle and saying, everyone should have their personal space respected.

He was -- he was asked if this would change the way he campaigns. He said absolutely it will change the way I campaign. So he's confirming that he's getting into the race. Actually think he didn't handle this very well and this is why. The accusations came out. He did the video, which was fine. But by joking about it during his first public appearance in front of the speech -- the crowd that he was giving, he kind of degraded the sincerity of -- not the apology, but of the explanation of invading people's space. And moreover, it was a huge distraction to what he was actually saying. If you listen to the speech that Joe Biden gave, he talked about blue- collar workers.

He's been part of the Washington problem for decades.
