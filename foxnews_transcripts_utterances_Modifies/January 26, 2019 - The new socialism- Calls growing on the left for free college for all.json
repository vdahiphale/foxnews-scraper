Amid mounting pressure, President Trump Friday announced a short-term deal to reopen the federal government, putting an end to the longest shut down in history. The president and congressional Democrats agreeing to a bill that would fund shuttered agencies for three weeks as lawmakers try to hash out a larger agreement on immigration and border security. Though the deal does not include funding for a border wall, the president warned that he would not give up that fight.",

You saw the consequences of the shutdown really starting to ratchet up, people not showing up for work, airlines being delayed, things not happening.

All she had to do was nothing, essentially, and she would win, and that's what happened. He couldn't move her politically.   DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes. And the question is whether he's going to be able to move her over the next three weeks. I mean, let's go back. The key event here, surely, was nationally televised meeting at the White House between President Trump, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer over this subject at which the president abruptly said that he would shut down the government, take responsibility for it, I'll take the mantel. At that point, there really wasn't anything that Schumer or Pelosi needed to do other than to roll forward and let the president, indeed, take responsibility. And that is what came to pass this week as the government shutdown really began to bite. And I think the key event was the FAA's stop order on the airports of LaGuardia, Newark, Philadelphia. You started to have scenes of people jammed up in the airports. And I think at that point, Paul -- up to a point, the border security, the wall and shutdown had equal political weight in the public mind. But I think the president's wall priority was beginning to really drop down in the public's mind. It was being overwhelmed by the government shutdown.",

But you go back to 2013, when the Republicans shut down the government over Obamacare, it didn't work. It wasn't a successful strategy. You still have those people who go, oh, well, if you held out even longer, it might have. We just had a president hold out for 35 days.  Things were getting worse, not better.

But there's a problem down on the border, for sure, with these caravans, mothers and children coming up. And the White House has not quite made it clear whether the problem is the flow of tens of thousands of people, like these mothers and children, or, as the president keeps saying, crime, drugs and homicidal aliens. They just haven't gotten their message clear. The Democrats aren't proposing much of anything. And I think at some point the public will begin to regard Nancy Pelosi as simply obstinate on this issue if the White House found a way to make a better argument for what they're trying to get. Otherwise, she'll just roll towards that government shutdown which, I think, in three weeks is really unthinkable.  The White House can't possibly believe they could survive another government shutdown.",

If you used average income, it's over $200,000 a year. So here we have a bunch of rich kids or at least moderately middle-class kids going to college.

Amid mounting pressure, President Trump Friday announced a short-term deal to reopen the federal government, putting an end to the longest shut down in history. The president and congressional Democrats agreeing to a bill that would fund shuttered agencies for three weeks as lawmakers try to hash out a larger agreement on immigration and border security. Though the deal does not include funding for a border wall, the president warned that he would not give up that fight."

Now no money for the wall and a temporary government opening.  What caused him to finally give in?"

      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. The pressure just simply hit breaking point. Look, Paul, you looked out there, voters blamed Republicans, blamed him for the shutdown. It was hurting their approval ratings out there in the polls. You had it doing damage, according to the White House's own economists, to the economy. You saw the consequences of the shutdown really starting to ratchet up, people not showing up for work, airlines being delayed, things not happening. And also you had members of the Republican Party who had, up to this point, stuck with this president but were beginning to both publicly and privately express their concerns and urge him to change course."
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Yes. That seems like a pretty comprehensive list to me, Dan. But the president didn't really go into this with a strategy to persuade Nancy Pelosi in the first place. All she had to do was nothing, essentially, and she would win, and that's what happened. He couldn't move her politically. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes. And the question is whether he's going to be able to move her over the next three weeks. I mean, let's go back. The key event here, surely, was nationally televised meeting at the White House between President Trump, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer over this subject at which the president abruptly said that he would shut down the government, take responsibility for it, I'll take the mantel. At that point, there really wasn't anything that Schumer or Pelosi needed to do other than to roll forward and let the president, indeed, take responsibility. And that is what came to pass this week as the government shutdown really began to bite. And I think the key event was the FAA's stop order on the airports of LaGuardia, Newark, Philadelphia. You started to have scenes of people jammed up in the airports. And I think at that point, Paul -- up to a point, the border security, the wall and shutdown had equal political weight in the public mind. But I think the president's wall priority was beginning to really drop down in the public's mind. It was being overwhelmed by the government shutdown."

For years now we've had a number of people on the conservative right say, you know, shutdowns can work if only you are just tough enough, OK? But you go back to 2013, when the Republicans shut down the government over Obamacare, it didn't work. It wasn't a successful strategy. You still have those people who go, oh, well, if you held out even longer, it might have. We just had a president hold out for 35 days.  Things were getting worse, not better. The Democrats weren't moving. And to continue to go ahead would just have brought more pain upon the White House and given them even less room to maneuver."

You're already hearing the Democrats say they're not going to give him money for the wall. That's out. We talk about other things. The president's put extended legal status on the table for the DREAMers, 800,000 of them or so who came here illegally as children and are now young adults, and those with temporary protected status from Central America and elsewhere. Any incentive for the Democrats to do a deal?"

But I think if the White House gets its messaging clearer on what is -- what they want on -- the border security, the wall, I mean, I don't think the wall is really floating anymore. But there's a problem down on the border, for sure, with these caravans, mothers and children coming up. And the White House has not quite made it clear whether the problem is the flow of tens of thousands of people, like these mothers and children, or, as the president keeps saying, crime, drugs and homicidal aliens. They just haven't gotten their message clear. The Democrats aren't proposing much of anything. And I think at some point the public will begin to regard Nancy Pelosi as simply obstinate on this issue if the White House found a way to make a better argument for what they're trying to get. Otherwise, she'll just roll towards that government shutdown which, I think, in three weeks is really unthinkable.  The White House can't possibly believe they could survive another government shutdown."

And this is a long remove from what the original collusion charge was all about, which I think people have to keep in mind. The collusion charge was that Russian intelligence was interfering in the campaign of 2016. Russian intelligence was interfering in a lot of campaigns around the world.

But, actually, these other countries are the ones who have led this since January 4th when they came out and said, without the U.S. as part of the group of Lima, they announced that Maduro is illegitimate.

It's a growing refrain on the political left, with other White House hopefuls and Democrats on Capitol Hill taking up the call. But is it a good idea? Let's ask Richard Vedder, distinguished professor of economics emeritus at Ohio University. Richard, good to see you again. He's also author of the forthcoming book, \"Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America.\" I know it doesn't surprise you that this is a call coming from the Democrats. What's the case against it? RICHARD VEDDER, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMIC EMERITUS, OHIO UNIVERSITY & AUTHOR:  Well, first of all, we, in economics, say there's no free lunches. I would say there's no free college. Someone is paying for college. And it's -- I'm a little surprised in a way at some of the Democrats for pushing free college, particularly if they're talking about four-year colleges."

But even at the, say, flagship state universities this is the case. The university of Virginia, for example, the median family income of people going to UVA is over $150,000 a year. If you used average income, it's over $200,000 a year. So here we have a bunch of rich kids or at least moderately middle-class kids going to college. And Bernie is saying and others are sawing let's give them free tuition. That doesn't sound like a progressive message to me."

Here we have a government that has the better part of a trillion-dollar deficit in a period of 4 percent or less than 4 percent unemployment. Crazy. We've never had anything like this before. Our national debt is over 100 percent, the gross national debt's over 100 percent of our GDP right now.  We're getting up there. We're not at the Greece level yet, but we're kind of moving in that direction. We've got to put some limits on what we do as a nation. And giving away college to rich kids or even to middle-income kids isn't doing any good, and it's not doing some of the kids good. Paul, do you know what the average graduation rate is for most community colleges? Well, it's under 30, 40 percent.

So that's a lot of the reason that most parents when they say to -- when their kids say, you know, I want -- when they're deciding what to do, they'll say go to college, because they know those statistics."

      "speaker": "VEDDER",

Partly -- in fact, I would say mostly, Brian Kaplan, at George Mason, would say almost entirely, it's because they're smarter, they have higher I.Q.s, they work harder, they did better in high school, they're less likely to skip class, etc., etc. They have attributes many of which have nothing to do with what they learn in college that give them an edge. I think we have overrated college. I do think, if we are going to provide federal aid, provide it to vocational schools is a good idea. We probably should. Why don't we give vouchers to low-income kids to learn how to become welders. Send them to a career college for a year, give them $20,000 and let them become welders? I think that would do more good than providing free college to everyone."

      "speaker": "VEDDER",
      "utterance": "Yes. If you give free college, first of all, where are the colleges going to get their money? Right now, they get some of it from student tuition. The presumption here is somehow the government is going to write checks to colleges for whatever tuition fee they set. Well, we know how that's worked over the last 30, 40 years. Since we put in the federal student loan programs, fees have soared. And the evidence is inconvertible on this. The New York Fed, the National Bureau of Economic Research, others have done studies that show there's a very strong correlation between the increases in federal student aid and tuition fees.  It's going to get worse."

And the other reason they became targets is because of social media. Social media immediately causes people to react almost without thinking, and so you have this torrent of published accusations against this kid. And people were taken aback. I mean, most of the country isn't doing this sort of thing every day, and they just looked at it -- when they found out later that nothing had really happened, it became one of the most, perhaps the most embarrassing moments ever for social media."

The gentleman in question, the Native American leader, was not a Vietnam vet, as had been claimed. He -- the boys did not confront him, he walked into their circle. Almost everything was wrong. What's more amazing to me is that even after it's been exposed -- and some people have apologized, and give them credit, they've manned up -- what's amazing to me is a lot of people giving this half apology. Well, you know, yes, we got everything wrong, but, you know, they were wearing MAGA hats. And that's really incredible to me.
