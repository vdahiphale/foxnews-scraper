Yes, she freaks out about the mask, but not that in her own state. Nice priorities, you joke. It's also funny watching people like her and reporters go after Trump for not wearing a mask, as they aren't wearing a mask either. Apparently, their message is more important than the President's. Meanwhile, leftwing writer, Katha Pollitt said this week she would vote for Biden, even if he ate babies. How does one respond? Clearly she's not a vegan, shame on her. But she can get away with saying that because it's not offensive to her peers.   Because she said, baby. She didn't say black baby, gay baby, trans baby. That would have been too far. But the generic baby, that's okay, especially since Planned Parenthood just got 80 million from the Paycheck Protection Plan, which was to aid small businesses during the pandemic. How is America's largest abortion business small? I get it. Their victims are.   So, is the media truly concerned about Trump's health? No, it's just that the media loves knowing things you don't. It validates the superiority necessary for their insecure elite class.  It's why they faint at the thought of taking an anti-malarial pill, but eat shrooms by the pound. It's why they think nuclear power is evil, but crystal healing rules. They need to be first and once something cool becomes popular, they hate it.  The media loves to boast about the hot Broadway play, you can't get tickets to. For a year they tried to out \"Hamilton\" each other. Oh, did you get tickets yet? Yes, they're so expensive. We got ours through a friend of a friend. This special class loves the free stuff, the secret stuff, the stuff they can get illegally, and they'll never share it with you. But Trump is the opposite.  If he likes something, he'll tell you about it. It sounds like he's above you, and that's weird.  Now, the jury's out on this drug. It seems useless at the end stage, but maybe, maybe helpful in the early phase.  It's a line of defense that you assess with your doctor, not with idiots like me. You can't buy it at the GNC. It's prescribed again by a doctor, not a politician. No wonder Nancy is tit.",

And a new Gallup poll shows people are happier more than a month ago. They sense good things, and it ain't a wrinkle cream.

I do not understand why there's so many politicians and journalists arguing back and forth about what drugs someone is or not taking for their health. In my America, that would be your own decision. Whatever drug you want to take your health or whatever drug you even want to take, you know, to alter your perception of the universe recreationally would be fine with me, too. I remember the Russia investigation, right? Everybody was a lawyer. They were all like, you know what, I heard that quid pro quo thing when I watched \"Silence of the Lambs,\" so I totally can be arrogant with my take on this. Now, we've got a bunch of communications majors, all doctors, all right? I don't understand why people are so arrogant and weighing in on this thing. No, I know better. How? You're not a doctor.

They lionized him in part because of these adorable CNN routines. Imagine if I pulled out a giant swab. CNN would condemn my depraved indifference to death. It makes you wonder when you look at Chris or Don Lemon, what are they? News? Commentary? Prop comics? At Fox, you know what we are. I do commentary. Bret Baier does news.

Yes, she freaks out about the mask, but not that in her own state. Nice priorities, you joke. It's also funny watching people like her and reporters go after Trump for not wearing a mask, as they aren't wearing a mask either. Apparently, their message is more important than the President's. Meanwhile, leftwing writer, Katha Pollitt said this week she would vote for Biden, even if he ate babies. How does one respond? Clearly she's not a vegan, shame on her. But she can get away with saying that because it's not offensive to her peers. Because she said, baby. She didn't say black baby, gay baby, trans baby. That would have been too far. But the generic baby, that's okay, especially since Planned Parenthood just got 80 million from the Paycheck Protection Plan, which was to aid small businesses during the pandemic. How is America's largest abortion business small? I get it. Their victims are. So, is the media truly concerned about Trump's health? No, it's just that the media loves knowing things you don't. It validates the superiority necessary for their insecure elite class. It's why they faint at the thought of taking an anti-malarial pill, but eat shrooms by the pound. It's why they think nuclear power is evil, but crystal healing rules. They need to be first and once something cool becomes popular, they hate it. The media loves to boast about the hot Broadway play, you can't get tickets to. For a year they tried to out \"Hamilton\" each other. Oh, did you get tickets yet? Yes, they're so expensive. We got ours through a friend of a friend. This special class loves the free stuff, the secret stuff, the stuff they can get illegally, and they'll never share it with you. But Trump is the opposite. If he likes something, he'll tell you about it. It sounds like he's above you, and that's weird. Now, the jury's out on this drug. It seems useless at the end stage, but maybe, maybe helpful in the early phase. It's a line of defense that you assess with your doctor, not with idiots like me. You can't buy it at the GNC. It's prescribed again by a doctor, not a politician. No wonder Nancy is tit."

The entire press would have to quit both. They'd get nothing done, but the crying. The good news, we believe life is getting good again. Cases are dramatically declining. And a new Gallup poll shows people are happier more than a month ago. They sense good things, and it ain't a wrinkle cream. This perspective diverges from the misery media who see grim horizons beyond their stretched faces. We know we've done great, but we're done hiding and we're done leaving it to the media and their lies. It's time to get up, go outside and get to work. We can do this. We already have. It's pretty simple. Wash your hands a lot. Put on a mask a lot. Don't hug strangers. Protect the elderly and get to work. Unless you're the media, maybe you should sit this one out.

Whatever drug you want to take your health or whatever drug you even want to take, you know, to alter your perception of the universe recreationally would be fine with me, too.

The money will be used for testing, purchasing protective equipment for workers and other virus related expenses. Advocacy groups for nursing home say about $10 billion is actually needed. \"The New York Times\" estimates that at least 28,000 nursing home residents and workers have died from COVID-19. That's about one third of all coronavirus deaths in America. And one business in Brazil is thriving during the pandemic and that's grave diggers. The country is struggling to keep up with the amount of bodies. This, as the Brazilian President calls the coronavirus a, quote, \"little flu.\" The South American country has yet to even hit the peak of the virus, yet adding about 20,000 cases each day.

If you go work out in the gym, there's a chance you might come in contact with the coronavirus, but if you take precautions and you're willing to walk in the door of that facility, then that means you understand what's going on. I think that's what needs to be happening with a lot of these things because you talk about hairstylist and nail salons. They are the ones that have most of the cleaning products. They work very hard to keep their stores clean. Gyms have towels. Everyone wipes down the stuff. If I go to get my nails done, or I go to get my hair done, or I'm going to go get my weight lift on. I know the risks, and I'm choosing to take that, and it's just like swimming in the ocean. There's sharks in the water, things could happen, but I'm willing to take the risk.

And so I fear that when we start cuffing people for doing regular things, it's going to lead to chaos and violence and destruction.

Hey, you know, just completely get -- you know, get away from that need that we have as humans for some interaction with each other at times, right?

      "utterance": "Yes, that's true. What if you are somewhat attracted to people in medical gear? Not saying that I am. But I do love a good mask and gloves. Anyway, I'm going to shut up now. Don't forget about my upcoming book. Oh, you're going to love this. It's called \"The Plus.\" It's a self-help for people who hate self-help. Basically it is how to do positive things if you aren't a positive person like me. In stores July 28th, but you can pre order your copy now. It's available at ggutfeld.com and all major book retailers. Final thoughts, next."
