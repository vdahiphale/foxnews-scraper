      "sentences": "Well good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" As has become the rule lately, there are a couple of big stories unfolding simultaneously tonight. Big news in Mississippi, the polls have just closed in a key runoff election there. You'll get the results right here, maybe during this hour. We'll also bring you the latest on the migrant Caravan and investigate the news coverage of that. Was it accurate now that the facts are in? We can assess that, and we will.  But first tonight, Robert Mueller's investigation. It was created, as you'll remember, to uncover collusion between American citizens and the government of Russia. Two years in, its main achievement, so far, are the financial destruction of several enemies of the political Left and the prosecuting of crimes that did not exist before the investigation was created.  Now in the latest, in the crosshairs of the Mueller investigation at the center of all this, he's refusing to go down meekly, Jerome Corsi. In just 60 seconds, he will join us to tell you about what he has gone through himself.  But first tonight, Trace Gallagher joins us with new information we just learned a short time ago. Trace?",

      "sentences": "Tucker, court documents now show that Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and associate of Trump confidant, Roger Stone, began speaking with Special Counsel prosecutors on September 6th this year where, of course, he was first questioned about, then shown an email in which Roger Stone asked him in July of 2016 to, \"Get to Julian Assange at Ecuadorian Embassy in London and get the pending WikiLeaks emails.\"  Corsi claims he declined the request by Roger Stone, saying that any attempt to contact WikiLeaks could put them in investigators' crosshairs. But Robert Mueller's team believes Corsi lied. And instead of turning down Roger Stone's request, he personally passed it along to someone in London. And eight days later on August 2nd, 2016, Corsi sent an email to Roger Stone saying WikiLeaks possessed information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign and plan to release it in October quoting again, \"Time to let more than John Podesta to be exposed as in bed with enemy if they are not ready to drop Hillary Rodham Clinton. That appears to be the game hackers are now about.\"  WikiLeaks released John Podesta's hacked emails on October 7th, 2016 just hours after the Access Hollywood tape went public where Donald Trump bragged about groping women.   Special Counsel wants to know if there was coordination between Roger Stone and Julian Assange about when to release Podesta's damaging emails. Jerome Corsi says he did not have insider information. Instead, he did his homework, connected the dots and theorized that Assange had Podesta's emails. And Roger Stone just told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" \"None of the emails cited prove I had advance notice of the sources or content of either allegedly hacked or allegedly stolen emails published by WikiLeaks. When did political gossip become a criminal activity?\" Stone also says his friend Jerry Corsi is being harassed by Special Counsel not for lying but for refusing to lie.   Tucker.",

      "sentences": "So, let's boil this down to its essence.   Jerome Corsi is 72 years old. He has a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard. He's written two New York Times bestsellers about politics. Jerome Corsi is the kind of person who could and probably should be happily retired by now. Instead, as you just heard, he is facing potential felony charges from Robert Mueller. How did this happen?  Well, earlier this year, the Independent Counsel subpoenaed Corsi and seized his laptop and personal phone. They have all of his communications. They know exactly what he said and didn't say. In September, Corsi was summoned to an interview with prosecutors. They asked him if he'd ever tried to broker a meeting with Julian Assange in London. Corsi responded no, \"I didn't want anyone to see Assange.\"  So, the prosecutors left the room to confer after Corsi said that. They returned and informed Jerome Corsi that he had just committed a felony. On Corsi's laptop was an email chain from more than two years before in which he had been asked to contact Assange.  As you just heard, Corsi forwarded that email to somebody else. Nothing ever came of any of this. And again, the Independent Counsel would know because they have Corsi's laptop and phone. They know that Corsi never left the United States and never spoke to Julian Assange. Corsi said he forgot all about forwarding the email. For the crime of forgetting that he forwarded that email, he is facing bankruptcy and imprisonment.  So, ask yourself this question. How would any of us fare under this standard? How would Robert Mueller fare under the same standard he set up for Jerome Corsi? Robert Mueller is 74 years old. What if the next Special Prosecutor seized his personal computer and interrogated him about every email he'd ever sent or forwarded going back years?   He probably would be able to remember some of it. But all of it, to the letter? Keep in mind, the slightest mistake would mean prison time. Would that be justice or would it be its opposite? Jerome Corsi would know firsthand and he joins us tonight. Mr. Corsi, thank you very much for coming on.",

Then they told you it's so far away that it's irrelevant. Well, then on Sunday, that irrelevant imaginary migrant Caravan attacked American Border guards. And that may surprise you more still because you were told the Caravan was entirely harmless. And again, if you believe otherwise, you're a bad person. Well, soon, a news story, we don't know what it is, but we can be sure there is one, will come to dominate the headlines, and the migrant Caravan will be mostly forgotten. Even if the border crisis remains unresolved, the press, the public, likely, the President too will have moved on.  But we want to pause just for a moment before that happens that inevitably happens, and look back and consider how this story was handled by the press because we think it matters. Now, the story evolved rapidly and the media's official story evolved just as rapidly. But were their descriptions about what was happening factually on the ground true? Tonight, we want to investigate that. This is not a partisan question, by the way. It's about the future of the country. For a free society to function, the press doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be better than a propaganda outlet. Are they?  Let's break it down with Buck Sexton. He's a former CIA Analyst and host of the Buck Sexton Show, and he joins us tonight. Buck, thanks a lot for coming on. You've been following this really closely. You had really, I thought, incisive breakdown of the coverage. And so, I want to put these questions to you. This is claim number one.

The company still won't say why it banned him in the first place. It now claims it simply temporarily suspended him, though that contradicts their original explanation. They still haven't explained why. We'll try to find out and tell you when we do. And now, Kevin Hart, good news and bad news. The good news is his son turned one last week. That's great. The bad news is Hart made the mistake of having a Cowboys and Indians themed birthday party to celebrate. And you know what that means? He's a secret racist. You wouldn't have guessed it. But Twitter was on the case. One social media user said that by throwing a Western themed party, Hart was \"Celebrating genocide, White supremacy and slavery.\" Doesn't look like a White supremacist.

      "utterance": "Well good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" As has become the rule lately, there are a couple of big stories unfolding simultaneously tonight. Big news in Mississippi, the polls have just closed in a key runoff election there. You'll get the results right here, maybe during this hour. We'll also bring you the latest on the migrant Caravan and investigate the news coverage of that. Was it accurate now that the facts are in? We can assess that, and we will. But first tonight, Robert Mueller's investigation. It was created, as you'll remember, to uncover collusion between American citizens and the government of Russia. Two years in, its main achievement, so far, are the financial destruction of several enemies of the political Left and the prosecuting of crimes that did not exist before the investigation was created. Now in the latest, in the crosshairs of the Mueller investigation at the center of all this, he's refusing to go down meekly, Jerome Corsi. In just 60 seconds, he will join us to tell you about what he has gone through himself. But first tonight, Trace Gallagher joins us with new information we just learned a short time ago. Trace?"

      "utterance": "Tucker, court documents now show that Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and associate of Trump confidant, Roger Stone, began speaking with Special Counsel prosecutors on September 6th this year where, of course, he was first questioned about, then shown an email in which Roger Stone asked him in July of 2016 to, \"Get to Julian Assange at Ecuadorian Embassy in London and get the pending WikiLeaks emails.\" Corsi claims he declined the request by Roger Stone, saying that any attempt to contact WikiLeaks could put them in investigators' crosshairs. But Robert Mueller's team believes Corsi lied. And instead of turning down Roger Stone's request, he personally passed it along to someone in London. And eight days later on August 2nd, 2016, Corsi sent an email to Roger Stone saying WikiLeaks possessed information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign and plan to release it in October quoting again, \"Time to let more than John Podesta to be exposed as in bed with enemy if they are not ready to drop Hillary Rodham Clinton. That appears to be the game hackers are now about.\" WikiLeaks released John Podesta's hacked emails on October 7th, 2016 just hours after the Access Hollywood tape went public where Donald Trump bragged about groping women. Special Counsel wants to know if there was coordination between Roger Stone and Julian Assange about when to release Podesta's damaging emails. Jerome Corsi says he did not have insider information. Instead, he did his homework, connected the dots and theorized that Assange had Podesta's emails. And Roger Stone just told \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" \"None of the emails cited prove I had advance notice of the sources or content of either allegedly hacked or allegedly stolen emails published by WikiLeaks. When did political gossip become a criminal activity?\" Stone also says his friend Jerry Corsi is being harassed by Special Counsel not for lying but for refusing to lie. Tucker."

      "utterance": "So, let's boil this down to its essence. Jerome Corsi is 72 years old. He has a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard. He's written two New York Times bestsellers about politics. Jerome Corsi is the kind of person who could and probably should be happily retired by now. Instead, as you just heard, he is facing potential felony charges from Robert Mueller. How did this happen? Well, earlier this year, the Independent Counsel subpoenaed Corsi and seized his laptop and personal phone. They have all of his communications. They know exactly what he said and didn't say. In September, Corsi was summoned to an interview with prosecutors. They asked him if he'd ever tried to broker a meeting with Julian Assange in London. Corsi responded no, \"I didn't want anyone to see Assange.\" So, the prosecutors left the room to confer after Corsi said that. They returned and informed Jerome Corsi that he had just committed a felony. On Corsi's laptop was an email chain from more than two years before in which he had been asked to contact Assange. As you just heard, Corsi forwarded that email to somebody else. Nothing ever came of any of this. And again, the Independent Counsel would know because they have Corsi's laptop and phone. They know that Corsi never left the United States and never spoke to Julian Assange. Corsi said he forgot all about forwarding the email. For the crime of forgetting that he forwarded that email, he is facing bankruptcy and imprisonment. So, ask yourself this question. How would any of us fare under this standard? How would Robert Mueller fare under the same standard he set up for Jerome Corsi? Robert Mueller is 74 years old. What if the next Special Prosecutor seized his personal computer and interrogated him about every email he'd ever sent or forwarded going back years? He probably would be able to remember some of it. But all of it, to the letter? Keep in mind, the slightest mistake would mean prison time. Would that be justice or would it be its opposite? Jerome Corsi would know firsthand and he joins us tonight. Mr. Corsi, thank you very much for coming on."

I gave them everything they wanted, my Twitter accounts, my - I signed permission and handed all this over. Now, on the first day, when I was interviewed, I didn't remember that email. Now, the Special Counsel came in and blew up and they actually sent me home and gave me an opportunity to review the emails. When I came back, I amended the testimony to say that I now remember the email."

Now suddenly, they forgot they allowed me to amend my testimony, and they're going back to the mistake I made, day one, when I forgot the email. So, it's really, I think, completely fraudulent the charge that they were trying to get me to plead to and I refused to plead to a lie."

I had a time machine on that computer, which recorded everything precisely and kept it in the time machine back through 2015. I - the computer broke in 2018. But I gave them. I kept it. They have - I voluntarily gave them the 17-inch Apple laptop and the time machine. I gave them my cellphone. I signed over permission for all of my emails, gave them the usernames and passwords. I allowed them to see my Twitter. I even helped Quantico download my Twitter and my Google accounts. I signed over Verizon accounts, everything they wanted. I had nothing to hide. I gave them to him immediately. And for having forgotten on day one because I hadn't reviewed the emails, this particular email about Ted Malloch, I'm now being charged with willfully and knowingly giving false information, which is - which is nonsense. I never willingly and falsely gave false information. I intended always to tell the truth. My memory was not perfect."

So, they would know, I think, what your communications were. I've read accounts in the press, I read one in the Washington Monthly, a Liberal magazine, saying that you deserve to go to prison because you've expressed views that they don't like. Do you think that your political views are playing a role in the decision of the Special Counsel to charge you with a felony?"
    },

Because I did not have a contact with Assange but yet had figured out that Assange had Podesta's emails and I figured that out and told Roger Stone and told many people in August and it just happened that I was right. Well the Prosecutor said, \"Dr. Corsi, we're not going to believe that on your 25th Wedding Anniversary day (ph) to Italy with your wife and family, you had divine inspiration and God told you Podesta had Assange's emails.\" Well, I said, I don't know if you want to (ph) put it that crassly but I did figure it out and I connect the dots.

That may be a surprise to you because you've been hearing for weeks and weeks that the Caravan wasn't real. And you'd have to be a Right-wing bigot to think it was. Then they told you it's so far away that it's irrelevant. Well, then on Sunday, that irrelevant imaginary migrant Caravan attacked American Border guards. And that may surprise you more still because you were told the Caravan was entirely harmless. And again, if you believe otherwise, you're a bad person. Well, soon, a news story, we don't know what it is, but we can be sure there is one, will come to dominate the headlines, and the migrant Caravan will be mostly forgotten. Even if the border crisis remains unresolved, the press, the public, likely, the President too will have moved on. But we want to pause just for a moment before that happens that inevitably happens, and look back and consider how this story was handled by the press because we think it matters. Now, the story evolved rapidly and the media's official story evolved just as rapidly. But were their descriptions about what was happening factually on the ground true? Tonight, we want to investigate that. This is not a partisan question, by the way. It's about the future of the country. For a free society to function, the press doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be better than a propaganda outlet. Are they? Let's break it down with Buck Sexton. He's a former CIA Analyst and host of the Buck Sexton Show, and he joins us tonight. Buck, thanks a lot for coming on. You've been following this really closely. You had really, I thought, incisive breakdown of the coverage. And so, I want to put these questions to you. This is claim number one. The migrant Caravan, we were told, is mostly women and children who pose no threat to anybody, here's one example of that claim."

And that was apparent, Tucker. I mean there are the - there are the misreporting that you could expect from people making an honest mistake. And then there's a lot of journalists gathered together because I've been talking to journalists all throughout this Caravan's progression, and there's just been this March of Lies. There've been some people telling the truth. But only if you be (ph) there and you see, it's guys. This is mostly guys. There are some women and children there.

Guess what, Ben? It's in our laws that people are allowed to come to our borders and ask for asylum."

And people know it's a scam based on the percentage of individuals in the past who have come and tried to claim asylum in this way, and the fact that they're being coached to lie. This is actually a form of fraud. When you say that I'm in imminent fear of my life because people along the way have said this is what you have to say to get into the asylum process, you can later be adjudicated, you're lying to people in a vast majority of these cases. And, by the way, if just being from Honduras, for example, means you're in such sort of (ph) violence that you could get asylum then the whole country would qualify for asylum.

By the way, if they were actually refugees, as Obama says, they should claim refugee status in the first country they arrive in, where they are no longer under mortal threat.

So, again, if journalists wanted to know this stuff, Tucker, some of them do, but they just don't get as much air time in places like CNN and MSNBC, they could find out, but they don't want to know.

Chris McDaniel is not going to be on the ballot tonight. It is only going to be Cindy Hyde-Smith versus the Democrat Mike Espy. So, you can easily see how Cindy Smith - or Cindy Hyde-Smith, you know, is going to win the election.

He explained he never received an explanation for why that happened. After coming on this show, he had his account restored by Twitter. The company still won't say why it banned him in the first place. It now claims it simply temporarily suspended him, though that contradicts their original explanation. They still haven't explained why. We'll try to find out and tell you when we do. And now, Kevin Hart, good news and bad news. The good news is his son turned one last week. That's great. The bad news is Hart made the mistake of having a Cowboys and Indians themed birthday party to celebrate. And you know what that means? He's a secret racist. You wouldn't have guessed it. But Twitter was on the case. One social media user said that by throwing a Western themed party, Hart was \"Celebrating genocide, White supremacy and slavery.\" Doesn't look like a White supremacist. But then, neither does Kanye West, and Twitter calls him one, too. Amazing. We'll be back tomorrow, 8 p.m, the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.
