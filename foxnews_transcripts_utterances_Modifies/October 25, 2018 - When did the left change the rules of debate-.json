We still have no suspect or motive in the case of those devices sent to prominent Democrats in the last few days. But that has not stopped some media organizations from what I think is despicable finger pointing, and we have it for you. Plus, we received some very interesting details about these bombs from authorities today, yet some media folks, they just don't want to talk about it. We'll examine. And last night's Florida gubernatorial debate revealed an ugly truth about some Democratic tactics.  Level unfounded charges of racism and then you win the argument. Candace Owens will be here later in the hour to break down the left's new rules. But first, the Democrats convenient case of amnesia, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now at this point, it seems the bomb-like materials sent to prominent Democrats and CNN were not meant to detonate but they were meant to intimidate and sow fear. And predictably the left and their journalist brethren are blaming Trump.",

I don't recall folks like Joe Scarborough asking if Hillary or Maxine's rhetoric led to all these harassment and viciousness. I think the Democrats have just gotten so wrapped around the acts about Trump and all the stuff he has achieved and his numbers are going up, yet, they have adopted a by any means necessary strategy to get him out of power.  And by not strongly and repeating -- repeatedly condemning the groups destructive activities and the message, I think in a way you could argue they have become the party by default of Antifa. And let's stop comparing by the way the Tea Party to Antifa as some on the left have stained to do. I heard that today.  Last time I checked the Tea Party was like dressed up like Betsy Ross and some -- they were gathering and debating about how to stop Obamacare and stop future bailouts, arguing about tarp. The Tea Party was interested in driving people to the polls in 2010, not driving people from the public square.

But the rest of us have to watch every word, every emphasis. But I think the American people are smarter than the Democrats give them credit for. I think they see through attempts like this to limit speech and politicize the acts of a few lunatics. Here is what is really going on.   In the face of Kavanaugh, the caravan and the tightening polls, the Democrats and their press enablers are hoping that the horrific events of the last 480 to 72 hours will in some ways serve to stem the GOP's late surge. The public will suddenly look at them as, look at what you did, look at what you created. And in order to do this, they will need to silence Donald Trump on the stump -- and it rhymes. They want distract voters and keep the great closer, which he is on script, force the president to be more like a conventional politician on the trail and less effective. Well, good luck with that. This cynical ploy will not work. Most Americans know real evil when they see it. And they know what political opportunism is and that it can sometimes spring from that very evil.

I believe in free speech, that there is no connection between James Hodgkinson shooting Steve Scalise necessarily and two years of the type of speech you played. If that's true, then there is no connection between Trump being sort of over the top in some of his rallies and this incident to what extent. But that's not what we are getting. We are getting an asymmetrical idea that when progressives use edgy speech, it has no concrete ramifications. And when a conservative doesn't say nearly as much or as violent rhetoric, it does. I just don't think that's a proposition people can accept. And if it were true, then you would see tomorrow just think of it, Maxine Waters, Joe Biden, Eric Holder, they would just cease all of their violent speech, all of their rhetoric for the next two years because they have made the argument in the case of Trump, that it will lead to something.  But I don't think they will cease it. And if you do think that we need to curb our speech, there are ways to deter it. If you can say, you know what, you cannot imagine, promote, advocate the killing or the assassination of the president, cutting his head off, burning him up, blowing him off. We don't want that. And if -- you might have to take a time out. You have a 90-day cooling off period and no fly list of flights.

But the rest of us have to watch every word, every emphasis. But I think the American people are smarter than the Democrats give them credit for. I think they see through attempts like this to limit speech and politicize the acts of a few lunatics. Here is what is really going on. In the face of Kavanaugh, the caravan and the tightening polls, the Democrats and their press enablers are hoping that the horrific events of the last 480 to 72 hours will in some ways serve to stem the GOP's late surge. The public will suddenly look at them as, look at what you did, look at what you created. And in order to do this, they will need to silence Donald Trump on the stump -- and it rhymes. They want distract voters and keep the great closer, which he is on script, force the president to be more like a conventional politician on the trail and less effective. Well, good luck with that.

It was an outright rage for Republicans to worry about the Democrat's demonization of Trump and Republicans and how could you do that, but in this case the script is flipped, is it?"

When he makes a threat, what sounds like a threat, it has a different kind of potency. But even during the campaign, he urged his supporters at a rally to apply Second Amendment remedies to Hillary Clinton if she was elected. That could only mean shooting her. He also said that she ought to have her Secret Service detail pulled and we should see what happens. Clearly he contemplated some kind of physical danger for her. And now that --"

My old boss, I still like him. I love and respect all of my former colleagues over there and (inaudible) they have been put through hell the last couple of days. I would just say that running these constant chyrons (ph) and everything, blaming the president, inferring that the president was responsible for this. We have no idea who did this. Absolutely no idea whatsoever. And I would just say to them stop, stop, stop. Jeff, for god's sake stop this. What is really dangerous about this, Laura, is Jeff's logic. And I want to read one sentence to you. This is from an Illinois paper. And the sentence -- it was a letter to the editor. And the sentence reads this way, \"One of my favorite TV shows is the \"Rachel Maddow Show\" on MSNBC.\" The guy who wrote that, Laura, is the guy who shot Steve Scalise. Now, words matter Jeff Zucker says and these other folks are saying. If words matter, what they are really saying that MSNBC and Rachel Maddow who are very anti-Trump are responsible for the Scalise shooting. That's just a bunch of hooey. That is very, very dangerous. And I tell you, what is really bad about this is, god forbid that something happens to the president or Sarah Sanders or some member of this administration. This kind of argument will whirl around in a heartbeat and fingers will be pointed at CNN or MSNBC to try and lay the responsibility on them, and that is wrong."

If I was a liberal I would watch Rachel Maddow. But when you have someone like Maxine Waters saying go out and do this. When people repeatedly are calling Trump like Hitler. I mean, people, if they could have stopped Hitler, they would have. So you are saying that that has no connection to anything that would happen to a supporter of the president like Steve Scalise?

      "utterance": "Yes, I think Americans are just tired of this instant virtue signaling and wounded fawn victimization when we don't know any of the facts of this incident. And they want symmetry. There is no rule in the arena. We don't be what the relationship is between violent or edgy speech and violent acts. We have been told -- and I agree with that. I believe in free speech, that there is no connection between James Hodgkinson shooting Steve Scalise necessarily and two years of the type of speech you played. If that's true, then there is no connection between Trump being sort of over the top in some of his rallies and this incident to what extent. But that's not what we are getting. We are getting an asymmetrical idea that when progressives use edgy speech, it has no concrete ramifications. And when a conservative doesn't say nearly as much or as violent rhetoric, it does. I just don't think that's a proposition people can accept. And if it were true, then you would see tomorrow just think of it, Maxine Waters, Joe Biden, Eric Holder, they would just cease all of their violent speech, all of their rhetoric for the next two years because they have made the argument in the case of Trump, that it will lead to something. But I don't think they will cease it. And if you do think that we need to curb our speech, there are ways to deter it. If you can say, you know what, you cannot imagine, promote, advocate the killing or the assassination of the president, cutting his head off, burning him up, blowing him off. We don't want that. And if -- you might have to take a time out. You have a 90-day cooling off period and no fly list of flights. I think that would stop at tomorrow if you believed that was necessary or if you have somebody go to campus and you get physical. These are very elite people. They have trajectory, clear trajectories. They are quite ambitious  Maybe you could charge him with a felony or the people in the streets of Portland, and that would deter it if you wanted to do that. So, we have mechanisms to make the argument between violent edgy speech and violent acts. The problem is are your listeners --"

Barack Obama when he came on the campaign trail, you know, magnetic speaker, you know, historic. This is 2008. I remember this well. This was in Philadelphia June 13th. \"If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun. Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I have seen Eagles fans.\" Now, I know he doesn't really mean bring a gun to a fight, but again, if a conservative says something like that, it's how dare -- you are in the pocket of the NRA, how dare you say that? So like, no one -- everyone is like walking on a tinder hooks if you are on the right.

Joining us now to discuss is Danny Coulson, a former deputy assistant director of the FBI and was the lead agent investigating that horrific Oklahoma City bombing.

And today, when I saw the x-ray that was put out to the media, immediately, people that worked with me every day at Tripwire, we looked at it and said there is no way any form or fashion, the x-ray that we looked at, that that device would function. And then when we looked at the pictures that were put out there of the actual device itself, it looked very -- we term it Mickey Mouse. The device, it was very crude, you know, it's a PVC pipe. It's got a red and black wire. Very Hollywood, indicators like what would be in a Hollywood movie. And then of course the timer, the digital timer that is present there. None of that would be, you know, what a real bomber would want to do if it was a real bomber, Laura, it would be somebody that's going to send a device through the main, that would be a victim actually and when it gets there, a timer is not an effective means of deployment."

And either this guy is the Alfred E. Neuman of bomb makers or he had no intention of these things going off. As you other guest said, this looks like a movie prop. And then you have to get to the point of what then is the purpose? And I tend to believe that the purpose is not to hurt anybody because these things are not capable of injuring people and that's verified by the technician that examined them. So then what is the story? I think it's theatre. I think it's definite theater and it's messaging. And I think that is the distinction here. It's almost a joke. It's not a joke because we take it seriously, but this thing is not a bomb. It doesn't have the components of a bomb. No bomber that makes a bomb out of PVC pipe because it doesn't restrict the explosion, it causes it to accelerate and hurt people. So, it looks really like a movie prop. That whole thing is designed for theater. It's like a firebug that sets a fire so we can see the fire for trucks coming. It's almost like that or it's some kind of messaging.

Is there anyone who wants to do harm, does not construct something at this type of I guess, on of them said it looked like a flashlight connected with, you know, like a little baby alarm clock or something.

Swetnick alleged without any corroborating evidence that Kavanaugh was involved in gang rapes during high school, but then gave varying accounts. Grassley declaring in the criminal referral to the attorney general Jeff Sessions and the FBI director Chris Wray, quote, \"In the heat of partisan moments some do try to knowingly mislead the committee. That's unfair to my colleagues, the nominees, and others providing information who are seeking the truth. It stifles our ability to work on legitimate lines of inquiry.  We can't just brush aside potential violations. I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature, but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future.\" In a brief interview today with Fox, Avenatti lashed out at Grassley, saying this is clearly political.

Now, that's what she submitted under oath, an affidavit. And then later she goes on TV and says, I really don't remember any of that, and thoroughly contradicts her affidavit. So what Grassley says is, listen, you can't submit a sworn statement to my committee and then go on TV and say something that's contradictory to that. That warrants an investigation of perjury and obstruction of justice. And frankly I read it. This is a compelling document. And I think the FBI and the Department of Justice is going to investigate this."

Obviously, the two of them working together, there we go, perhaps with others. There might be even more. This is just the very beginning of what we are seeing here. And I think it's really important that Senator Grassley does this, John, because otherwise any nominee who they want to stop, it will just be, oh, I heard this. No, no, I remember this 25 years ago. And oh, yes -- and it's the worst, more horrible accusations, unsubstantiated. Why not? There is no price to be paid? I would go after this Feinstein leak, too. They should do a full and thorough investigation of Feinstein. And some of my friends were saying even some of the accusers in this case. Did Christine Ford tell the truth? I don't know.

When you submit a sworn affidavit to my committee, I expect it to be truthful. And if it's not then you are going to suffer the penalties under criminal law. The other thing Avenatti refused to do was allow Swetnick to be investigated by the committee, and that very unusual if these allegations had some substance to them. But essentially what Senator Grassley is saying is you can't lie and disrupt corruptly my committee proceedings.

Is an honest debate even still possible? Joining me now with her reaction, Candace Owens who is the communications director for Turning Point USA. Candace, do you see this as a convenient ploy. The left is doing it. Gillum obviously got in a big jam with this potential bribe of a real estate developer. The FBI was clearly surveilling him, and he was willing to take these tickets and other things.  That's the question. It has nothing to do with his race and what color skin he has."

I feel like it really reinforces the bigotry of low expectations for the black community, meaning apparently we can't win based off of our own merit. We can't win a race based off of our own ideas. So what are we going to do? We're going to cry victim. We're going to say that we are being attacked because of the color of our skin. It's nasty and it's negative and it's pointedly wrong. I also think it's a show of weakness from Andrew Gillum."

We have college conservative newspapers, even those have been under assault. What has been the reaction? I know sometimes you get stuff thrown at you, but it's a badge of honor, as long as it's not going to hurt you or anything. But what has been the reaction among especially minorities students when they talk to you, they see you, they meet you. You are nice. You're fun."

They're jumping up and mocking Beto for pretending to be Hispanic. We have a large Hispanic following. So something is working. They're starting to say. Maybe it's because Kanye West put on the MAGA hat and people are starting to pursue different ideas. But this country is changing, I am telling you. And I say this all the time. Black Americans have nothing to fear when Donald Trump said he is going to make America great. We are Americans too."

I might crash your event tomorrow. How do drug cartels operate inside caravans like the one we see approaching the U.S. border? Is it really happening? And what connection do they have to international terrorism? A former head of special ops for the DEA is here next. He has some shocking revelations. Stay there."

There's another one on its way, too. Since drug cartels control the illegal flow of nearly everything moving through Latin America, we want to know how they actually still might be influencing this caravan even though they say there is strength in numbers of people. Joining us is Derek Maltz. He's a former DEA special ops division head. And Derek, we really appreciate you being here. I've been waiting to talk to you. Is a caravan of this size a threat? It's described as this is just a sea of humanity wanting a better life, but what could be embedded in this caravan?"

That's number one.A Drugs are generating $400 billion a year around the world.  And right now we have young kids dying from the poison every single day.  We have about every 11 minutes we have somebody dying from an opioid overdose, right. So we have mass amounts of people coming into our country with disease, with crime, with drugs. And you know what, we have to put it to end it.  Thank God President Trump has stepped up and has sent the troops down there to kind of help us. Now, 11 years ago, we had a case against a very big arms trafficker. This particular guy wanted to get 100 passports for Middle Easterners. That's 11 years ago. These organizations don't just wait. They actually are planning to get people here in this country to do very bad things. That's the bottom line."

When it's 4,000 people, maybe 5,000 people. That's a lot of people. If everybody at one time is approaching a border checkpoint, some of them will go through the regular port of entry, some will just walk across. But they basically get processed and released into the country after their coached, correct?  That's how it happens."

The health implications, I think the media, where is all the investigative reporting on all of these diseases that are just popping up? Kids are being paralyzed for bizarre reasons we don't even know. I am not saying it's immigration. We definitely have a TB problem. We also have Chagas disease, all sorts of other things. Chris Cuomo claimed that the border wall will not stop the cartels. Let's watch."

      "utterance": "I have had the unfortunate pleasure of spending way too much time south of the border covering the drug cartels. You have not. So let me tell you how it works down there largely. Tunnels, OK.  They also use planes. They also use huge cargo containers. So the idea you are a wall away from stopping the drug problem is also untrue."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALTZ",
      "utterance": "My view is that the wall alone is not going to stop the drug cartels. They are a business enterprise that wants to make money. They are going to figure out ways to get the stuff into the country. They have tunnels. Chapo Guzman and Sinaloa Cartel was building tunnels many, many years ago. But if there's a wall that they climb over or can't drive a car over, we are going to be able to prevent them from getting into this country like they are right now. Go talk to the farmers, Chris Cuomo, the border, go talk to the people that are on the border and these people are coming onto their property with weapons. And it's just like a free-for-all on our border. So the wall is definitely going to help but it's not alone going to solve the problem."
