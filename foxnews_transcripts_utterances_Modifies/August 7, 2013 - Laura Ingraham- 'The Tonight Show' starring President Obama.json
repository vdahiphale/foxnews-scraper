And it was Leno whose job again is to entertain not to grill elected officials the President knew he would not be asked about the failed reset with Russia or maybe about why a contractor like Snowden ever had access to information like this in the first place.   If they weren't still so enamored with Mr. Obama, Washington journalists would be kicking up a huge fuss about this. The President has submitted to fewer press conferences than every President since Reagan. In his first term, check this out. George W. Bush had done 89 press conferences, Clinton 133 and Obama, only 79. The fact is, President Obama never stopped being in campaign mode and that was evident last night. It's the only thing he's really done well. So shall we look forward to another slow jam with Jimmy Fallon during the debt ceiling debate? Anything he says in this type of forum, as entertaining as it might be, ends up being trivialized. Part of a nonstop \"celebutaiment\" industry that dumbs-down serious issues and insulates the President from proper journalistic inquiry.   And that's \"The Memo.\"",
