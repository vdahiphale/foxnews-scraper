American momentum is now around winning.  The winning that outsider candidate Donald Trump promised us.  Not the anarchy Democrats, aka demon rats want to impose on us.  The tactics of these demon rats and Trump- hating leftists are backfiring.  Americans are now buying into and choosing results over politically correct losing behavior of other Presidents.   When the \"New York Times,\" Bret Stevens, and the Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan both dug in Trump haters say Senate Democrats not only overplayed their hand, but the Democrats are blowing it, you know they sense what's coming and it's not the blue wave that the genius pundits predicted. They know they lost not just the Kavanaugh fight, but the American people along the way.  Americans don't like lies, injustice, and they certainly don't like vigilante or mob justice.  The insanity that we witness by those suffering from Trump derangement syndrome is both shocking and unprecedented. From being tossed out of restaurants to being directed to harass, intimidate, confront and make a crowd around anyone they don't agree with, they ramped it up even more during the Kavanaugh hearings.  Screaming, interrupting, shouting down senators, blocking them from voting and they are attempting to block them from voting and then in their feigned loser outrage, they claw on the doors of the United States Supreme Court as Kavanaugh is being sworn in.  Americans are fair, and they have had enough.  According to Real Clear Politics, Republican senators in key states have dramatically turned things around -- Cruz, Blackburn, Heller, McSally, and demon rat Cory Booker who is now the laughingstock of the Senate after likening himself to Spartacus fell flat off his chariot.  And they justify their behavior.",

American momentum is now around winning.  The winning that outsider candidate Donald Trump promised us.  Not the anarchy Democrats, aka demon rats want to impose on us.  The tactics of these demon rats and Trump- hating leftists are backfiring.  Americans are now buying into and choosing results over politically correct losing behavior of other Presidents. When the \"New York Times,\" Bret Stevens, and the Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan both dug in Trump haters say Senate Democrats not only overplayed their hand, but the Democrats are blowing it, you know they sense what's coming and it's not the blue wave that the genius pundits predicted. They know they lost not just the Kavanaugh fight, but the American people along the way.  Americans don't like lies, injustice, and they certainly don't like vigilante or mob justice.  The insanity that we witness by those suffering from Trump derangement syndrome is both shocking and unprecedented. From being tossed out of restaurants to being directed to harass, intimidate, confront and make a crowd around anyone they don't agree with, they ramped it up even more during the Kavanaugh hearings.  Screaming, interrupting, shouting down senators, blocking them from voting and they are attempting to block them from voting and then in their feigned loser outrage, they claw on the doors of the United States Supreme Court as Kavanaugh is being sworn in. Americans are fair, and they have had enough.  According to Real Clear Politics, Republican senators in key states have dramatically turned things around -- Cruz, Blackburn, Heller, McSally, and demon rat Cory Booker who is now the laughingstock of the Senate after likening himself to Spartacus fell flat off his chariot.  And they justify their behavior."

Good evening, Hogan, a huge day for the President today.  Pastor Andrew Brunson was taken hostage Obama administration was released, and I can't help but notice that other hostages taken during the Obama administration, Otto Warmbier and Joshua Holt from Venezuela, they were there during Obama, and yet, it takes President Trump to actually get them released.  How is it that those hostages, more than 15 of them as I understand, languished during the Obama administration and President Trump without any ransom is able to get them released?  How does he do this?"

This president has delivered on every front . I was at JBA - Joint Base Andrews when those three people came back from North Korea.  I was in the Oval Office when Joshua Holt was returned and I listened to what the president said.  It was one of the most impactful moments of my time in the White House. I've been there a year now, Judge, and these instances stick out more than almost any other because of what this president is able to do and he's not giving away the store.  He's not selling America down the river.  He is not giving billions of dollars as Barack Obama did to the world's largest state sponsor of terror.  He's getting our people back.  He is putting America in the fore and showing the world we are back.  We mean business, and don't cross this President or he'll make you pay for it."

Instead, he comes in and says America is great.  We will work with other countries.  We have great relationships.  The president has come in and developed incredible relationships with leaders from all over this world. But now they know where this country stands.  He means business.  What he says he does.  The promises he makes are the promises he keeps and you saw that today with the return of Pastor Brunson.  So many people in Congress helped as well.  But this president has turned this country around.  The world has taken notice and that's why you are seeing so many successes on a global scale."

Now, we have two scenarios happening in Turkey.  One is Brunson being released by the Turkish government and the president was very generous in his gratitude to the Turkish President Erdogan, but then we have got another person disappearing in Turkey.  Is there a connection?"

The president has been clear that he wants an open, prompt investigation into this.  We have to find out what happened, so the president is ..."

We have partners and allies all over the globe, and when it's time to work with them on issues, we do.  When it's time to punish if we need to, we do that as well.  This instance is no different."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll tell you, I think he's up to like 19 or 20 Americans that have been held unjustly overseas and he's brought them back.  I don't think any President has done anything even close to that particularly in less than two years.  And so, I think it's another success for the President. I think he really believe - and I think, as he should, that he has got to look out for all Americans and if they are being held in places like North Korea or Venezuela or obviously, here in Turkey, I think he thinks it's his responsibility to kind of get them and he succeed beyond anyone's wildest expectations."

The president is saying the $110 billion arms deal, we'll still going to go through with it.  How do you feel about this?"

But I think the president has figured out a way to have a constructive relationship with them.  But in fact they did this, I mean that's just going to have an impact on our relationship.  I don't think there's any two ways about it.  So let's get the facts on that and see, but it will be a big deal if in fact, they murdered this guy."

We, right now, we're on a razor's edge with Iran, and to throw out realpolitik completely over what would be a horrible, disgusting death would be - could lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands more.  We have to keep this in perspective.  But, this does unquestionably have to be dealt with.  That is an inhumane savage thing to do."

As for what's going on with Saudi Arabia, if they actually did what they are being accused of right now, the United States must go to at United Nations and lead a coalition to put severe sanctions on Saudi Arabia because this should not be tolerated on the world stage by any country. Absolutely, and I want to see him do that."

Dan Bongino, Chris Hahn, thanks for being us tonight.  Now, Jimmy Kimmel stoops to new lows on TV yet again.  Charlie Kirk is next with Kimmel, Alec Baldwin and the left's \"Most Outrageous Statements of the Week.\"  Don't miss it. President Trump's meeting with Kanye West this week causing a freak-out among the liberals.  Just take listen to what Jimmy Kimmel had to say."

      "speaker": "JIMMY KIMMEL, TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Not only was this a crazy conversation for this White House.  This is the kind of conversation that would typically be held between people wearing hospital bracelets.  Donald Trump was sitting across from his own Twitter account come to life."

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "Well, look, first of all with Kimmel's comments in particular, not only is that reprehensible.  But it also trivializes people that do go through mental struggle in their life.  They do go through that, so first of all I think that's totally reprehensible. Secondly, the left is very scared.  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel would not dedicate this kind of time on his show if they did not think this actually demonstrated a real threat to the Democrat monopoly and monolith that they have had over black America for the last 50 years, and as I commonly say, you will not find a population that has been more underserved by the Democratic Party that has voted with such loyalty and allegiance for the last 50 years, Kanye West and his own artistic way challenge that status quo and orthodoxy and you see immediately, what they challenge is mental health."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "That's right.  We spent the afternoon with him after his meeting in the White House.  And look, what I love most of about Kanye West, he's a free thinker.  He did not tell anyone - he actually didn't oppose Democrats.  He even said, I love Hillary.  I love everyone, he said, but why are we not having an honest conversation about how our community has been damaged over the last 50 or 60 years and you can see the media's double standard. They say, \"Oh, we want everyone to think freely.\"  No, they don't.  They went after him in such a pernicious and awful way.  I mean, you saw Don Lemon say things about him that, Judge, if you said that about anyone, you would be pulled off air.  It's unbelievable that they are able to get away with this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And therein lies the difference.  I mean, they accuse him of being mentally unfit and all of that other stuff.  I mean, the guy is a billionaire businessman, but what do I know.  all right, I want to move on to a tweet from Alec Baldwin and it says, \"Ever since I played Trump black people love me.  They love me.  Everywhere I go, black people go crazy.  I think it's because they are most afraid of Trump.\"  What does that mean?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "I find no evidence to that whatsoever.  And if you actually look at black America, Black America today is doing the best it ever has done in the modern era under this President.  Let's look at two statistics.  The lowest ever unemployment rate ever in the history of the modern statistics under this president.  Second, in the last year, we saw a 400% - that's right, 400% increase in black-owned business start-ups under this president that's because of the low regulation, less tax agenda. You're seeing the economy do better and so I don't know what Alec Baldwin is talking about.  He has had a, let's say, mixed history with this sort of statements in the past, towards the LGBT community.  He had a show cancelled so on and so forth, the left is scared and they should be because their monolith over black America is being put into question and there is something new happening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, it really is stunning.  I mean, that all of a sudden, reality is irrelevant and just rumor and mob mentality, not supported by the facts. It seems to be the call for the day.  Anyway, and third, let's talk about Mika from \"Morning Joe\" on Friday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKA BRZEZINSKI, HOST, MSNBC",
      "utterance": "I'm really glad you said that because I do think he's using them as pawns and I feel terrible for what he is doing to these people who are so excited to come to his rallies, to see the President of the United States, and then he uses them like that and makes them look stupid."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, well, people come to the rallies and support Trump are both stupid and pawns."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "I guess we are both rather successful pawns then, Judge.  I mean, I guess, there are 60 million pawns out there, Mika, and look, this is what the left tries to do.  They try to trivialize the success of this administration.  And they say that anyone that comes out in support of the President, they don't know what they are talking about, their mental health must be put in question, they must be bought and paid for. When in reality, middle America and what I mean middle America, that dark space between Malibu and Manhattan that the Democratic party has completely forgotten about, they are with his president.  They see rising wages, better trade deals, ISIS totally destroyed, the Korean war ending and America is back.  So Mika, stay in Manhattan while we win over middle America because you're losing and we're winning."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And President Trump brings a winning message to Kentucky.  The highlights of tonight's huge rally that you haven't seen, next. President Trump gets midterm voters in Kentucky very excited in the town of Richmond tonight.  Take a look at some of the best of tonight's huge rally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "The Democrats have become totally consumed by their chilling lust for power.  What the crazy radical Democrats did to Justice Kavanaugh is a national disgrace.  He stared down the angry left-wing mob, he never blinked and he never looked back and he got up, a man who will be one of our great, great Supreme Court justices."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell - the new platform of the Democratic Party is radical socialism and its open borders.  Democrats want to abolish ICE and they want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Republicans believe our country should be a sanctuary for law- biding Americans, not criminal aliens.  And if you elect Republicans this November, we will pass legislation to end catch and release.  I'll tell you, have you heard the other one?  Right?  Lottery. I don't want a chain.  I want people to come into our country on a merit- based system.  This election is about safety and is about prosperity. Since the last election - and these are numbers the fakers back there, the fake news would never have allowed me to say - they never in a million years, if I ever said this during the campaign, they would have had headlines. We've created over 4.2 million new jobs.  We've added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs.  Remember manufacturing is never going to come back, never going to come back.  Hispanic American and Asian-American unemployment has reached its lowest level in history.  African-American unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded in history. They were all saying he will not do well with women.  Wow, did we do well with women.  Did we do well.  We will.  Fake news.  We also passed Veterans Choice.  Giving our veterans the right to see a private doctor instead of waiting on lines for 12 days, for 24 days, for 38 days.  And together we will make America wealthy again.  We will make America strong again.  We will make America safe again.  And we'll make America great again."

So do you have your copy of the book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals:  The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy?\"  Try to get one before you miss it and remember, you never have to miss \"Justice.\"  If you can't watch, just set your DVR.  Thanks for watching, I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way.  \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" is coming up next and I will see you again next Saturday night.
