Foreign policy has been a disaster unless you're the Taliban, they're doing donuts on a soccer field in a U.S. Army Jeep. As Vice President Joe went to funerals, as president, he causes them. Yes.  It's amazing, this joker has been in politics forever. And the moment that he's put in charge, he wets the Oval Office rug like a nervous puppy.

But of course, the guy who says the buck stops with me, says it's not his fault that the buck is worth a lot less than it was a year ago. You've heard about the homicide numbers. Even cartel members from Tijuana won't visit Baltimore. In Chicago, more people are getting their shots from a Glock than a syringe.  You got a dead domestic agenda. The only thing Joe seems capable of passing is gas from the Gerber's pureed vegetables he had for lunch.  Also, there is more COVID deaths under Joe in just 10 months with three vaccines than all -- than of all of last year. Good luck blaming it on Trump, but, of course, they will. Yes, remember that constant body count that showed up every day like Stelter at Krispy Kreme, gleefully attributing every casualty to Trump, even if the COVID victim was 600 pounds, 9 years old, and had a crowbar through his head.   They hope the list would cost Trump the election. And it did. Biden promised to shut the virus down. Instead, the only thing he is shutting down is the early bird buffet. Now, when Biden wins, the body count disappears, much like CNN's fact- checking department, which they put into cold storage along with their ratings, and Chris Cuomo's career.",

President Biden continues a downward slide to a number not seen since the tough scrutiny of the Trump administration.\"  So, did you notice something there? He says they haven't seen findings like this since the tough scrutiny of the Trump administration. So, what's the difference here? There is no tough scrutiny of the Biden administration at all. The press looks away like they've been shown erotic photos of Joy Behar. This suggests -- this suggests that if the scrutiny were equal, brains would explode. Either Trump would have been the greatest president ever if they treated him fairly, or Joe Biden would be the worst president ever. If they treated them fairly. It's mind-boggling.   With Biden, its parents at school board meetings who are to blame, right? Or the unvaccinated, or Fox News. Joe will be blaming the ghost of Ronald Reagan whom he talks to every night at the White House. Meanwhile, there are no comparisons between Joe and Trump on any variable.   Economy, foreign policy, COVID, crime, the border. And why? Because if you did that, you would see that Trump would destroy Biden, which returns us to two key points.  First, the media didn't care that President Trump improved the country. Why would they? Most of them hate this place anyway. But he had to go. His late-night tweets gave all of them early morning anxiety. And even with all his cash, he still wasn't one of them, he was one of us. Also, he was a Republican. So, he starts off as Hitler. We're on like three Hitlers now. One more Hitler and we have a box set.  Clapping for Hitler. So, they gladly handed the country's keys to some doddering old mess who goes to bed at 4:00 p.m. but doesn't send mean tweets. But this happens almost every time a Democrat is in the White House.  It's like we keep punching ourselves in the face to see if it really hurts as much as we thought it did four or eight years ago. It does. And what happened to that unity pledge? Joe is about as unifying as farting in an elevator.  Just asked, Kat.  So, to protect the media's precious mental health, we screwed our country over. So, what happens when you realize that reassessing Trump only makes Biden look even worse? If Biden is worse than what the media called an existential threat, then, what do you call Biden? A super-duper accidents - - existential threat?  And if the media can't compare Biden to Trump's achievements, then what do you do? You talk about January 6th, and white supremacists. Suddenly, concerned parents become domestic terrorists. And surprise, amazing. The Facebook whistleblower who just miraculously showed up on \"60 Minutes, will now be testifying at the next January 6th hearing. So, once again, the media and the Democrats are in cahoots, which is necessary. With these polling numbers, if Biden got any more underwater, he'd be Aquaman. Let's welcome tonight's guest.",

The study was based on bats and birds. And although previous research, research suggests that women get colder for metabolic reasons. Women's core temperatures are higher than men's, and women have a lower metabolic rate so they experienced the temperatures of their environments differently. But also, decades of meticulous research shows that women just like to complain. But Kat, a sexist wrote that, I'll just have you know. But can we stop messing around with bats, for Pete's sake? Any more research with those winged demons and we'll be wearing masks on our hands and feet.

Parties this year, the CDC recommends using a window fan they're also recommending that friends and family celebrate Christmas on Zoom, unless you're a member of Jeffrey Toobin's family. A new report says the IRS wants to look at your bank account and the plan to review every account with a balance of at least $600. In other words, Michael Loftus is off the hook.

Shatner will spend about 10 minutes, approximately 66 miles in space and then plummet back to the earth surface by parachute. In other words, he's flying Spirit Airlines. Hunter Biden held his first art show this week. Critics agree that as an artist, Hunter is in his blow period. But was, was the art show a scam to peddle political influence? You'd have to ask attendees like L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Musician (INAUDIBLE) who coincidentally are now all our new ambassadors to Aruba. Havana syndrome, a painful unexplained illness plaguing the hearing of American diplomats. The White House insists the screeching groggy noise isn't a hoax. Who needs a punchline?

Even cartel members from Tijuana won't visit Baltimore. In Chicago, more people are getting their shots from a Glock than a syringe. You got a dead domestic agenda. The only thing Joe seems capable of passing is gas from the Gerber's pureed vegetables he had for lunch. Also, there is more COVID deaths under Joe in just 10 months with three vaccines than all -- than of all of last year. Good luck blaming it on Trump, but, of course, they will. Yes, remember that constant body count that showed up every day like Stelter at Krispy Kreme, gleefully attributing every casualty to Trump, even if the COVID victim was 600 pounds, 9 years old, and had a crowbar through his head. They hope the list would cost Trump the election. And it did. Biden promised to shut the virus down. Instead, the only thing he is shutting down is the early bird buffet. Now, when Biden wins, the body count disappears, much like CNN's fact- checking department, which they put into cold storage along with their ratings, and Chris Cuomo's career."

President Biden continues a downward slide to a number not seen since the tough scrutiny of the Trump administration.\" So, did you notice something there? He says they haven't seen findings like this since the tough scrutiny of the Trump administration. So, what's the difference here? There is no tough scrutiny of the Biden administration at all. The press looks away like they've been shown erotic photos of Joy Behar. This suggests -- this suggests that if the scrutiny were equal, brains would explode. Either Trump would have been the greatest president ever if they treated him fairly, or Joe Biden would be the worst president ever. If they treated them fairly. It's mind-boggling. With Biden, its parents at school board meetings who are to blame, right? Or the unvaccinated, or Fox News. Joe will be blaming the ghost of Ronald Reagan whom he talks to every night at the White House. Meanwhile, there are no comparisons between Joe and Trump on any variable. Economy, foreign policy, COVID, crime, the border. And why? Because if you did that, you would see that Trump would destroy Biden, which returns us to two key points. First, the media didn't care that President Trump improved the country. Why would they? Most of them hate this place anyway. But he had to go. His late-night tweets gave all of them early morning anxiety. And even with all his cash, he still wasn't one of them, he was one of us. Also, he was a Republican. So, he starts off as Hitler. We're on like three Hitlers now. One more Hitler and we have a box set. Clapping for Hitler. So, they gladly handed the country's keys to some doddering old mess who goes to bed at 4:00 p.m. but doesn't send mean tweets. But this happens almost every time a Democrat is in the White House. It's like we keep punching ourselves in the face to see if it really hurts as much as we thought it did four or eight years ago. It does. And what happened to that unity pledge? Joe is about as unifying as farting in an elevator. Just asked, Kat. So, to protect the media's precious mental health, we screwed our country over. So, what happens when you realize that reassessing Trump only makes Biden look even worse? If Biden is worse than what the media called an existential threat, then, what do you call Biden? A super-duper accidents - - existential threat? And if the media can't compare Biden to Trump's achievements, then what do you do? You talk about January 6th, and white supremacists. Suddenly, concerned parents become domestic terrorists. And surprise, amazing. The Facebook whistleblower who just miraculously showed up on \"60 Minutes, will now be testifying at the next January 6th hearing. So, once again, the media and the Democrats are in cahoots, which is necessary. With these polling numbers, if Biden got any more underwater, he'd be Aquaman. Let's welcome tonight's guest."

A new study out of Israel suggested that women get colder than men due to evolution. That explains why so many give me the cold shoulder. I would never write that. The study was based on bats and birds. And although previous research, research suggests that women get colder for metabolic reasons. Women's core temperatures are higher than men's, and women have a lower metabolic rate so they experienced the temperatures of their environments differently. But also, decades of meticulous research shows that women just like to complain. But Kat, a sexist wrote that, I'll just have you know. But can we stop messing around with bats, for Pete's sake? Any more research with those winged demons and we'll be wearing masks on our hands and feet. In the meantime, I've teamed up with NASA to create a highly technical device that will eliminate the differences in temperature sensitivity between men and women. Here it is. Called a shawl.

Senator Kyrsten Sinema was berated by activists in a bathroom at an Arizona State, at Arizona State University. I guess the immigrant activist was hoping the two of them could have a sit down. Parties this year, the CDC recommends using a window fan they're also recommending that friends and family celebrate Christmas on Zoom, unless you're a member of Jeffrey Toobin's family. A new report says the IRS wants to look at your bank account and the plan to review every account with a balance of at least $600. In other words, Michael Loftus is off the hook. Facebook has apologized for its recent mass outage. The outage was scary for hours. I had literally no idea what my friend's ugly children were doing. You're ugly. (INAUDIBLE) your children were ugly. You don't have cute kids. You only think they're cute. That's an evolutionary trick. No Facebook for hours. Thankfully, I had already printed and laminated photos of my exes years ago. William Shatner will fly to space next week aboard Jeff Bezos Blue Origin rocket. Usually when Shatner hears the words lift off it means he's having his toupee cleaned. The launch could have arrived tomorrow, but Shatner doesn't have Amazon Prime. Shatner will spend about 10 minutes, approximately 66 miles in space and then plummet back to the earth surface by parachute. In other words, he's flying Spirit Airlines. Hunter Biden held his first art show this week. Critics agree that as an artist, Hunter is in his blow period. But was, was the art show a scam to peddle political influence? You'd have to ask attendees like L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Musician (INAUDIBLE) who coincidentally are now all our new ambassadors to Aruba. Havana syndrome, a painful unexplained illness plaguing the hearing of American diplomats. The White House insists the screeching groggy noise isn't a hoax. Who needs a punchline? It's just the vice president laughing. Officials also tonight -- Havana Syndrome is the name of a stripper Hunter Biden knocked up in Miami. Sometimes scientists claim the noise is actually caused by crickets, specifically those exposed to Michael Loftus' act."
