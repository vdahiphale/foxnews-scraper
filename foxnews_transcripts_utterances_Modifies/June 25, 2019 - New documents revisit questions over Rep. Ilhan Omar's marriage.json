      "sentences": "Konichiwa and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The G20 comes to Japan this week. The President arriving with the rest of the world leaders. We will be interviewing him at the end of the week and we'll bring that to when we do. But first, a remarkable media story we want to bring it tonight. There was joy in newsrooms across America last week when a 75-year-old writer for \"Elle\" magazine called E. Jean Carroll came forward to accuse the President of sexually assaulting her.  Carroll made serious claims but they were confusing. She says that sometime in 1995 or 1996 -- she doesn't remember the year exactly -- Donald Trump groped her in a New York City department store.  Somehow the two wound up together in a dressing room. Carroll decided to model lingerie for Trump, a full lace outfit, she says, and then the assault took place. That's her story.  Carroll says she was devastated by what happened, but she did not report it to law enforcement for some reason, nor did she write about it though she is a writer during Trump's presidential campaign or for the last two and a half years of his presidency. Instead, she waited nearly a quarter century to include the story in a book that is literally entitled \"What Do We Need Men For?\" In that book by the way, Carroll also accuses CBS Head Les Moonves of sexual assault.  She writes that Moonves attacked her in an elevator in Los Angeles after she had finished interviewing him for a piece in \"Esquire\" magazine. And yet, amazingly, she never mentioned the attack in the story that she wrote about Moonves. Both Trump and Les Moonves, by the way deny that any of this ever happened, and there's no corroborating evidence that it did.  And yet according to \"The Atlantic\" and \"Huff Po\" and Stephen Colbert and countless other arbiters of American news, Carroll's allegation against the President which is a felony is quote, \"credible,\" it's a credible accusation.   Harvard graduate, Lawrence O'Donnell was so impressed by it that he gave Carroll half his show.",

I mean, these people have no credibility. Honestly, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon for God's sake. Don Lemon theorized that the Indian Airliner that disappeared over the Indian Ocean was sucked up by a black hole and he is still on the air. Lawrence O'Donnell, I mean, you know, come on -- the woman -- the poor woman, the poor, poor woman. She is a 75-year-old woman. She obviously doesn't quite remember exactly what happened 24 or 25 years ago. She doesn't know exactly what year it was. She knows what department store it was.   I know it's a well-populated department store with a lot of security and a lot of cameras and it seems to me, if there is something happening in Bergdorf's is it probably unlikely, but okay, and as you said, she is selling a book.  She is out making the rounds of the shows after having kept this dark secret for 24 or 25 years. And now she talks about how rape is sexy and rape fantasies and then begins flirting with Anderson Cooper. I think that's going nowhere and it's just getting weirder all the time. And honestly, look, I mean, Tucker, you know the standard in the media for Republicans is the accusation. You look at Brett Kavanaugh, you look at any Republican. The mere accusation is enough to hang you from the tallest tree. But at the same time across the river from where I am now in Washington, in Virginia, there's a Lieutenant Governor, a Democrat, Justin Fairfax, who has twice recently been accused very incredibly by very credible women of raping them.   And the other day -- I wish I was making this up -- he said that his career has experienced a great boost from this, his political fortunes are now greater than ever, and he is thinking about running for Governor. So when you're a Democrat, the media actually says \"Hey, two rape accusations, maybe you should be the next Governor,\" after the guy with the Klan outfit and the blackface. But if you're Republican, a woman falls through the ceiling tiles after 25 years is selling a book, goes on MSNBC and CNN, flirts with the anchor says that rape is sexy talks, about rape fantasies and this is considered to be good enough for prime time, at least at CNN and MSNBC, which is why no one watches this, just by the way.",

Obviously, sexual assault is real. But this case simply does not stand up to any kind of credible investigation.  I think reporters should be asking questions. This was a woman at 52, who by all her own account in a '95 \"Esquire\" article has plenty of experience with men, believe you me, and she agrees to go into a dressing room to try on a piece of see-through lingerie because by her explanation, she thinks she is going to persuade Trump to put it on over his pants and great coat. This is preposterous. This is a woman who now says she wants to live in a world without men. Her book is going around asking women, why do we need men? She got the inspiration because the women writing into her advice column blamed all of their problems on men.

So the press is on board with this. We saw this with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Christine Blasey Ford as you said, Tucker. This is sort of the fumes of Brett Kavanaugh hearings played out again by somebody who aspires by your own book to be the Emma Sulkowicz of her time.

Her Google title is Head of Responsible Innovations in the Global Affairs Department. In that video, Gennai says that Google is working specifically on products to make certain that Donald Trump does not win another election. Quote, \"We're also training our algorithms like if 2016 happened again ... would the outcome be different? People were not putting that line in the sand ... that they were not saying that what's fair and what's equitable, so we're like, well, we're a big company, we're going to say it.\"  In other words, we're going to try and affect the outcome of the 2020 presidential campaign. Gennai goes on to blast Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break Google up into two companies. Why? Check out this reasoning, quote, \"All these smaller companies who don't have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation. It's like a small company cannot do that.\" So using a company's dominance on the internet to sway the outcome of an election. That's their plan. There should be a term for what Gennai is describing. It turns out there is a term, it's a term you've heard constantly from talking heads on television for more than two years. It's called hacking an election. Google wants to hack our election. They're saying that out loud. As we've been told over and over again by CNN and \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" and all the other propagandists. Hacking an election is very bad, at minimum it warrants a multiyear investigation by law enforcement agencies. And yet, it's happening now. The Washington establishment has said they want to prevent election interference. But of course, that's a lie. They just want to make sure they control the elections. That's their only goal. That's what they're not attacking the real source of election interference, which is Silicon Valley. Google Facebook and their ilk, they have far more political power than Russia ever has or ever will have. No serious person doubts that. But the people in charge of our country don't care about any of that. Because when Google meddles in an election, Democrats benefit. By the way, if you want to find that video, you can't access it on YouTube. Google took it down. That's not surprising. You can already be tossed off of YouTube and Facebook if you decide they're using speech they don't, like they'll accuse you of hate speech, whatever that means.  Now they can toss you off their sites just for putting up videos that make you look bad. They probably won't be banning any DNC videos anytime soon, you can be certain of that. Meanwhile, this week, Ravelry, a knitting social networking website with eight million members banned all explicit support for Donald Trump and only for Donald Trump, and they got away with it. And because they have gotten away with it, other platforms almost certainly will do the same thing. All of this is going on flagrantly in public, but most Republicans haven't even responded to it. They haven't reacted at all. As soon as the 2016 election was over, the press and Big Tech openly began plotting on how to control the narrative in 2020, which is another way of saying control the election outcome in 2020, and using the scapegoat of fake news as an excuse to control the public discourse. Republicans were in charge of Congress at the time, they did nothing. The White House commands a vast regulatory apparatus. They've sat motionless and done nothing. The only Republican is seems even interested at all in the subject and keeping Big Tech in check at all is new senator Josh Hawley, he just introduced a bill that would force tech companies to act as genuinely open platforms in order to receive valuable regulatory benefits. That's the deal. They're violating the deal, nobody else seems to care. Passing Hawley's bill does not seem to be a conservative priority, though, no one in Congress is talking about it. That's a big mistake. Successful political parties look out for their supporters and for the public at large and protect them from harm. Republicans, meanwhile, are sitting in a stupefied fog of libertarianism, doing nothing while their ideas are suppressed, and their supporters are silenced.  One day, they'll look up and find they have no supporters at all, who will be the blame for that? Only themselves. Dr. Robert Epstein is not a Republican, but he is the preeminent researcher into the subject. He's a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he is again, the world's great expert on the effect of the tech companies on political discourse. He joins us today. Dr. Epstein, thank you very much for coming on.",

So this is not like I'm some far lefty and I'm not some far righty. I'm a pretty moderate guy. I've tried to build some bridges here.  And even that now is becoming too extreme for what Google and YouTube are allowing to happen. One of the things that I've done that I'm most proud of actually is I've had conservatives on my show like you, like Dennis Prager, Ben Shapiro, et cetera and I've treated you guys with respect and decency. And that really is what the mainstream media and sort of \"The New York Times\" and CNN crew doesn't want people to see. They just want to create a character of all of you guys. So that's sort of why they're coming after me, but I will say this, just moments before we started here, I just got notified that Susan Wojcicki, who is the CEO of YouTube, she actually followed me on Twitter. So I've got over a million subscribers on there and I don't have as much of as an e-mail address of someone at YouTube. But maybe I am starting to make some headway now. And you know, quickly, to your point on where sort of libertarians are at right now, I think there's an interesting moment here where generally small government people, and I think you're sort of in that group too, you know, our limits are being pushed on what small government actually means. And for me, I would always prefer a private answer to this and competition. But maybe there has to be a sort of two-pronged approach where politicians are putting pressure and then public people are putting pressure, and we can maybe make these companies sort of be a little more transparent, be a little more open, which really is all anyone is asking for here.",

But I think this goes to the other natural conversation, a lot of these players want black owners, and there should be, but you've got to put in the work here and I think there's a lot of rich black folks that are willing to buy these seats. Hell, I want to be an owner of an NBA team one day, and I think that's where the conversation needs to go. Not this stupid conversation to suggest that just because you own a brand, which is what the NBA is saying. They own the copyright of the logos, the franchise, and they pay players to go out there because of their talent and ability.

We will be interviewing him at the end of the week and we'll bring that to when we do. But first, a remarkable media story we want to bring it tonight. There was joy in newsrooms across America last week when a 75-year-old writer for \"Elle\" magazine called E. Jean Carroll came forward to accuse the President of sexually assaulting her. Carroll made serious claims but they were confusing. She says that sometime in 1995 or 1996 -- she doesn't remember the year exactly -- Donald Trump groped her in a New York City department store. Somehow the two wound up together in a dressing room. Carroll decided to model lingerie for Trump, a full lace outfit, she says, and then the assault took place. That's her story. Carroll says she was devastated by what happened, but she did not report it to law enforcement for some reason, nor did she write about it though she is a writer during Trump's presidential campaign or for the last two and a half years of his presidency. Instead, she waited nearly a quarter century to include the story in a book that is literally entitled \"What Do We Need Men For?\" In that book by the way, Carroll also accuses CBS Head Les Moonves of sexual assault. She writes that Moonves attacked her in an elevator in Los Angeles after she had finished interviewing him for a piece in \"Esquire\" magazine. And yet, amazingly, she never mentioned the attack in the story that she wrote about Moonves. Both Trump and Les Moonves, by the way deny that any of this ever happened, and there's no corroborating evidence that it did. And yet according to \"The Atlantic\" and \"Huff Po\" and Stephen Colbert and countless other arbiters of American news, Carroll's allegation against the President which is a felony is quote, \"credible,\" it's a credible accusation. Harvard graduate, Lawrence O'Donnell was so impressed by it that he gave Carroll half his show."

I mean, these people have no credibility. Honestly, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon for God's sake. Don Lemon theorized that the Indian Airliner that disappeared over the Indian Ocean was sucked up by a black hole and he is still on the air. Lawrence O'Donnell, I mean, you know, come on -- the woman -- the poor woman, the poor, poor woman. She is a 75-year-old woman. She obviously doesn't quite remember exactly what happened 24 or 25 years ago. She doesn't know exactly what year it was. She knows what department store it was. I know it's a well-populated department store with a lot of security and a lot of cameras and it seems to me, if there is something happening in Bergdorf's is it probably unlikely, but okay, and as you said, she is selling a book. She is out making the rounds of the shows after having kept this dark secret for 24 or 25 years. And now she talks about how rape is sexy and rape fantasies and then begins flirting with Anderson Cooper. I think that's going nowhere and it's just getting weirder all the time. And honestly, look, I mean, Tucker, you know the standard in the media for Republicans is the accusation. You look at Brett Kavanaugh, you look at any Republican. The mere accusation is enough to hang you from the tallest tree. But at the same time across the river from where I am now in Washington, in Virginia, there's a Lieutenant Governor, a Democrat, Justin Fairfax, who has twice recently been accused very incredibly by very credible women of raping them. And the other day -- I wish I was making this up -- he said that his career has experienced a great boost from this, his political fortunes are now greater than ever, and he is thinking about running for Governor. So when you're a Democrat, the media actually says \"Hey, two rape accusations, maybe you should be the next Governor,\" after the guy with the Klan outfit and the blackface. But if you're Republican, a woman falls through the ceiling tiles after 25 years is selling a book, goes on MSNBC and CNN, flirts with the anchor says that rape is sexy talks, about rape fantasies and this is considered to be good enough for prime time, at least at CNN and MSNBC, which is why no one watches this, just by the way."

She says, well, so many women are getting raped at the border as a reason for the police not to look into a rape investigation. We are living, Tucker, in a world of weaponized feminism. Obviously, sexual assault is real. But this case simply does not stand up to any kind of credible investigation. I think reporters should be asking questions. This was a woman at 52, who by all her own account in a '95 \"Esquire\" article has plenty of experience with men, believe you me, and she agrees to go into a dressing room to try on a piece of see-through lingerie because by her explanation, she thinks she is going to persuade Trump to put it on over his pants and great coat. This is preposterous. This is a woman who now says she wants to live in a world without men. Her book is going around asking women, why do we need men? She got the inspiration because the women writing into her advice column blamed all of their problems on men. Imagine if a man blamed all of his problems on women, he would be viewed as a whiner and somebody not really in touch with his own situation."

This is a complete reversal of the principles that have made Western civilization the beacon of success that it is, but the feminists tell us that those principles have to be junked in order to empower women and to destroy the male patriarchy. So the press is on board with this. We saw this with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Christine Blasey Ford as you said, Tucker. This is sort of the fumes of Brett Kavanaugh hearings played out again by somebody who aspires by your own book to be the Emma Sulkowicz of her time. She is jealous of the Columbia students who falsely accused another Columbia student of rape and then carried her mattress around with her.

      "utterance": "It's not just whistleblowers -- excuse me, hidden camera footage obtained by Project Veritas shows a conversation with a woman called Jen Gennai. Her Google title is Head of Responsible Innovations in the Global Affairs Department. In that video, Gennai says that Google is working specifically on products to make certain that Donald Trump does not win another election. Quote, \"We're also training our algorithms like if 2016 happened again ... would the outcome be different? People were not putting that line in the sand ... that they were not saying that what's fair and what's equitable, so we're like, well, we're a big company, we're going to say it.\" In other words, we're going to try and affect the outcome of the 2020 presidential campaign. Gennai goes on to blast Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break Google up into two companies. Why? Check out this reasoning, quote, \"All these smaller companies who don't have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation. It's like a small company cannot do that.\" So using a company's dominance on the internet to sway the outcome of an election. That's their plan. There should be a term for what Gennai is describing. It turns out there is a term, it's a term you've heard constantly from talking heads on television for more than two years. It's called hacking an election. Google wants to hack our election. They're saying that out loud. As we've been told over and over again by CNN and \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" and all the other propagandists. Hacking an election is very bad, at minimum it warrants a multiyear investigation by law enforcement agencies. And yet, it's happening now. The Washington establishment has said they want to prevent election interference. But of course, that's a lie. They just want to make sure they control the elections. That's their only goal. That's what they're not attacking the real source of election interference, which is Silicon Valley. Google Facebook and their ilk, they have far more political power than Russia ever has or ever will have. No serious person doubts that. But the people in charge of our country don't care about any of that. Because when Google meddles in an election, Democrats benefit. By the way, if you want to find that video, you can't access it on YouTube. Google took it down. That's not surprising. You can already be tossed off of YouTube and Facebook if you decide they're using speech they don't, like they'll accuse you of hate speech, whatever that means. Now they can toss you off their sites just for putting up videos that make you look bad. They probably won't be banning any DNC videos anytime soon, you can be certain of that. Meanwhile, this week, Ravelry, a knitting social networking website with eight million members banned all explicit support for Donald Trump and only for Donald Trump, and they got away with it. And because they have gotten away with it, other platforms almost certainly will do the same thing. All of this is going on flagrantly in public, but most Republicans haven't even responded to it. They haven't reacted at all. As soon as the 2016 election was over, the press and Big Tech openly began plotting on how to control the narrative in 2020, which is another way of saying control the election outcome in 2020, and using the scapegoat of fake news as an excuse to control the public discourse. Republicans were in charge of Congress at the time, they did nothing. The White House commands a vast regulatory apparatus. They've sat motionless and done nothing. The only Republican is seems even interested at all in the subject and keeping Big Tech in check at all is new senator Josh Hawley, he just introduced a bill that would force tech companies to act as genuinely open platforms in order to receive valuable regulatory benefits. That's the deal. They're violating the deal, nobody else seems to care. Passing Hawley's bill does not seem to be a conservative priority, though, no one in Congress is talking about it. That's a big mistake. Successful political parties look out for their supporters and for the public at large and protect them from harm. Republicans, meanwhile, are sitting in a stupefied fog of libertarianism, doing nothing while their ideas are suppressed, and their supporters are silenced. One day, they'll look up and find they have no supporters at all, who will be the blame for that? Only themselves. Dr. Robert Epstein is not a Republican, but he is the preeminent researcher into the subject. He's a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he is again, the world's great expert on the effect of the tech companies on political discourse. He joins us today. Dr. Epstein, thank you very much for coming on."

Now in 2020, I'm actually trying right now to raise funds to build a large scale monitoring system to keep an eye on these companies and to catch them in the act, literally catch them, when they are manipulating votes and opinions.

So I'm glad that we've gotten that out there. Look, of course, this is complete nonsense. I mean, we've discussed this many times. I am an old school liberal. So this is not like I'm some far lefty and I'm not some far righty. I'm a pretty moderate guy. I've tried to build some bridges here. And even that now is becoming too extreme for what Google and YouTube are allowing to happen. One of the things that I've done that I'm most proud of actually is I've had conservatives on my show like you, like Dennis Prager, Ben Shapiro, et cetera and I've treated you guys with respect and decency. And that really is what the mainstream media and sort of \"The New York Times\" and CNN crew doesn't want people to see. They just want to create a character of all of you guys. So that's sort of why they're coming after me, but I will say this, just moments before we started here, I just got notified that Susan Wojcicki, who is the CEO of YouTube, she actually followed me on Twitter. So I've got over a million subscribers on there and I don't have as much of as an e-mail address of someone at YouTube. But maybe I am starting to make some headway now. And you know, quickly, to your point on where sort of libertarians are at right now, I think there's an interesting moment here where generally small government people, and I think you're sort of in that group too, you know, our limits are being pushed on what small government actually means. And for me, I would always prefer a private answer to this and competition. But maybe there has to be a sort of two-pronged approach where politicians are putting pressure and then public people are putting pressure, and we can maybe make these companies sort of be a little more transparent, be a little more open, which really is all anyone is asking for here."

Many have sounded the alarm about this, but so far lobbying dollars from energy companies have prevailed. Plants have now been approved to install massive new wind farms along the East Coast of the United States, one near Martha's Vineyard could be the largest in the world. This offshore wind project will take up roughly 1,400 square miles that's larger than the state of Rhode Island."

We welcome anyone representing commercial windfarms to come on the show anytime to explain why they're good for Americans, and by the way why they are good for the environment -- for the fish. Good question. Well, CNN and MSNBC are utterly obsessed with these new and bizarre allegations against the President, why are they ignoring actual allegations -- apparently real ones -- against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis. That's next. Plus, the NBA has announced it is banning the word \"owners.\" We will explain their bizarre reasoning just ahead. Live from Tokyo, Japan. We'll be right back."

If you've been watching the news recently, you've noted that CNN, MSNBC, the network news, all spent the last week aggressively covering salacious, but apparently kind of demented allegations against the President. They have done virtually nothing though on far more believable allegations against Congresswoman Ilan Omar of Minnesota. We are all the way off in Japan and even we were able to cover that. Newly obtained documents have bolstered the theory that Omar's second marriage may have been fraudulent. Scott Johnson has been on the story from day one, doing the most important reporting on it. He is an attorney in Minnesota. He blogs at Power Line. And we're happy to have him join us tonight. Scott, thanks a lot for coming on. So explain this to us and how -- you often mentioned that on any -- not on The \"New York Times\" site, but of Omar and her brother. What is his role in the story?"

But since Omar emerged as a public figure in August of 2016, I and then Priya Shyamsundar and now David Steinberg, have been following a trail of evidence suggesting that Omar entered into a sham marriage in 2009, with Ahmed Elmi, and as I say he may or may not be her brother. Now, I asked her that in in 2016, when she won the DFL primary here to enter the state legislature and what I got back from her was a nonresponse accusation of bigotry. Fast forward three years to last -- the last two weeks. Two weeks ago, the Minnesota State Campaign Finance Board, having investigated her 2016 campaign for over a year issued findings including coincidentally that she filed joint tax returns in 2014 and 2015 with Ahmed Elmi -- I'm sorry with her husband number one whom she never really married with the guy who was not her husband while she was married to Ahmed Elmi. And I say, let that sink in. I have to concentrate when I'm telling you that. She filed a joint tax return in 2014 and 2015 with a guy she was not married to while she was married to another guy, the other guy being Ahmed Elmi, who may or may not be her brother. Now what's happened most recently this past --"

She has refused to produce any papers to anyone. And most recently \"The Star Tribune\" this past Sunday, which did a serious story, not a perfect story, but a serious 3,000 words story into this whole chain of events leading to the Campaign Finance Board investigation and findings that are referred to, to which she refused to sit for an interview. She refused to produce documents. She refused to say word one except a statement issued by her congressional spokesman, accusing \"The Star Tribune\" of colluding with me and Power Line in anti-Muslim bigotry, which is farcical. They have treated her like a hometown hero until last Sunday."

Well, Adam Silver, who is the NBA Commissioner has just announced that from now on the league will no longer use the word \"owner\" to describe those who own NBA franchises. Those companies now can't be owned. They'll be run by Governors, since the concept of owning a team is supposedly disrespectful, because the league has so many black players. Does that make sense? It doesn't matter. Al Sharpton is happy with it. Watch."

      "utterance": "No, it's not going to make this a better country. I think most people -- reasonable people -- will understand that people that put in the lead word, buy shares, and companies become the owner of these companies. I mean, we're talent just like NBA players and we have ownership at Fox News. It's just part of what comes when you know, you work for another company. I would like to quote Tyler Perry, he says, \"Own your own business. Own your own way.\" Many of these players have their own businesses that they call themselves the owners because they put all the money in and they should. But I think this goes to the other natural conversation, a lot of these players want black owners, and there should be, but you've got to put in the work here and I think there's a lot of rich black folks that are willing to buy these seats. Hell, I want to be an owner of an NBA team one day, and I think that's where the conversation needs to go. Not this stupid conversation to suggest that just because you own a brand, which is what the NBA is saying. They own the copyright of the logos, the franchise, and they pay players to go out there because of their talent and ability. And these players exercise great judgment by hiring agents to negotiate hefty contracts as they should. So this this is not a slave term. This is just a basic business term."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, because, again, this just shows you the amount of influence that players have on that. I mean, can you -- can you -- let's just go back historically. Can you imagine a slave having that ability to go tell the masses on the plantation that they couldn't do that? That's how ridiculous their analogy to slavery that it is. These players, again, like I said, they have a lot of influence. They have million-dollar -- millions of dollar contract. And again, the argument is for black ownership, I'm all for it. But that's not the argument here. This is political correctness gone wild."
