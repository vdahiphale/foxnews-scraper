A lot of drama earlier today, when Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on his way to a pre-scheduled meeting at the White House, let slip to some of his colleagues that he was expecting that when he arrived at the White House, he was going to be fired.  Of course, it was nothing of the sort. And President Trump a short time ago, meeting with Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, said he's looking forward to meeting with Rod Rosenstein and having a conversation with him about everything that happened last week on Thursday.

After that story came out in The New York Times last week that Rod Rosenstein allegedly was trying to drum up support for a 25th Amendment removal of the president, even suggesting he might wear a wire when he went to meet with the president, Chief of Staff John Kelly pulled him into the White House, asked him about it. After that meeting on Friday, Rod Rosenstein issued a stronger denial than the statement that he had previously issued. He and Kelly, apparently, according to Jake Gibson, our Department of Justice producer, had a couple of conversations over the weekend, during one of which apparently this idea of resignation was floated. But it looks now like Rod Rosenstein continues as the deputy attorney general, at least until Thursday, when he has an opportunity to sit down and meet with the president. The president said that he spoke with Rosenstein earlier today. So if he hasn't fired him on the spot, there is a chance that Rosenstein might survive.  You heard Trace Gallagher talk about the other big headline of the day. Judge Brett Kavanaugh on his wife, Ashley, will be appearing tonight on \"The Story With Martha MacCallum\" to talk about the allegations, the many allegations now that have been leveled against Kavanaugh.   Kavanaugh earlier today set another letter up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he said, among other things, of these new allegations, all the allegations, in fact -- quote -- \"These are smears, pure and simple, and they debase our public discourse, but they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination, if allowed to succeed, will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.\" So, again, tonight, with Martha MacCallum on \"The Story.\" You know Martha MacCallum be a tough interviewer, so I imagine that she is not going to let Kavanaugh off the hook here, that she will ask some very probative questions -- Neil.",

I'd like to thank our great Vice President Pence for joining us today for the ceremony, and U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer for his incredible efforts. He's worked very, very hard on this. Thank you as well to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Director of National Economic Council Larry Kudlow for their tremendous work. Everybody has worked very, very hard. This is long in coming, many years, actually, I will say, in coming. In a few moments, we will sign a document pledging that our countries will take the additional necessary steps to implement the new United States- Korea trade agreement. I want to express my gratitude to President Moon and his entire team for their dedicated efforts to reach, really, what we would call a historic milestone in trade, something that most people thought was not going to be happening. From day one, I promised the American people that I would renegotiate our trade deals to ensure that our agreements were fair and reciprocal.  For decades, politicians have talked about fixing broken trade deals, only to do absolutely nothing about them. My administration is the first to actually keep our promise and deliver. And in addition to this deal, we have many in the works, and they're fair deals. They're reciprocal deals. And they make a tremendous difference to our workers, our companies, and to the United States as a whole. The new U.S.-Korea agreement includes significant improvements to reduce our trade deficit and to expand opportunities to export American products to South Korea. In other words, we are now going to start sending products to South Korea. These outcomes give the finest American-made automobiles, innovative medicines, and agricultural crops much better access to Korean markets. I think our farmers are going to be extremely happy. It was very limited as to what they could do and what they could send. And now it's a open market, and they're going to be sending a lot more farm products. That makes me feel very good. I love our farmers. As a part of this agreement, we have also secured increased access to America's auto industry. South Korea will double the annual number of American cars sold within. In other words, we used to sell a maximum of 25,000, and we wouldn't even get to that number, and now we're going to 50,000. We're doubling it per manufacturer. And that's a doubling. So it's 50,000 per manufacturer -- cars. And that's each year. So that's a doubling of the cars per manufacturer that can enter its market, meeting U.S. safety standards. So we're going with now a U.S. safety standard. The standard was at a point that you couldn't get cars in. So we're going to the U.S. safety standard. Very important to understand.  This agreement will reduce bureaucracy and increase prosperity in both of our countries. Workers in South Korea and America will find new customers and new opportunities to expand and grow. Our teams will be working hard to ensure that the terms of the deal are fully implemented. President Moon, I just want to tell you we've developed a great relationship on many different fronts. This one is on trade, but we're working very well on North Korea. A lot of very positive things are happening with Chairman Kim of North Korea. And you'll be hearing about that over the coming weeks. But I think some really, really important things are happening. As I said just a little while ago, we have an agreement to work out another summit. And we look forward to doing that. I'm going to be meeting with Chairman Kim in the not-too-distant future. The location is being worked on, the time is being worked on. And we'll be announcing it. As far as these negotiations, our two countries have set an example of friendship and cooperation for trade that rarely you see in this age. And I just want to tell you I'm very honored to be a part of it, and I'm honored to call you a friend. And I'm honored to say that the United States and South Korea have a great friendship together.

This has vastly expanded to include automobiles and like, an agreement he says that is in both countries' interest and levels the playing field. Again, if we hear more on this and the details of this, of course, we will pass it along. All of this at a time tensions have risen, ironically enough, with the Chinese, where we're making no progress there. And, in fact, both sides have implemented tougher tariffs on a number of goods and products that go there from the United States and come here from China. Let's get to read from Montana Republican Senator Steve Daines. Senator, thank you for taking the time.  Do you think this sets the stage or could for a Chinese deal?",

Hours after it was announced that Judge Kavanaugh was President Trump's nominee, Chuck Schumer went to the floor of the U.S. Senate and said, we're going to do everything within our -- within our power to stop this nominee.

It settled around $72 a barrel. We haven't seen this in a while. It seems as if OPEC is signaling that it's going to let the price go up a little bit.

After that story came out in The New York Times last week that Rod Rosenstein allegedly was trying to drum up support for a 25th Amendment removal of the president, even suggesting he might wear a wire when he went to meet with the president, Chief of Staff John Kelly pulled him into the White House, asked him about it. After that meeting on Friday, Rod Rosenstein issued a stronger denial than the statement that he had previously issued. He and Kelly, apparently, according to Jake Gibson, our Department of Justice producer, had a couple of conversations over the weekend, during one of which apparently this idea of resignation was floated. But it looks now like Rod Rosenstein continues as the deputy attorney general, at least until Thursday, when he has an opportunity to sit down and meet with the president. The president said that he spoke with Rosenstein earlier today. So if he hasn't fired him on the spot, there is a chance that Rosenstein might survive. You heard Trace Gallagher talk about the other big headline of the day. Judge Brett Kavanaugh on his wife, Ashley, will be appearing tonight on \"The Story With Martha MacCallum\" to talk about the allegations, the many allegations now that have been leveled against Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh earlier today set another letter up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he said, among other things, of these new allegations, all the allegations, in fact -- quote -- \"These are smears, pure and simple, and they debase our public discourse, but they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination, if allowed to succeed, will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.\" So, again, tonight, with Martha MacCallum on \"The Story.\" You know Martha MacCallum be a tough interviewer, so I imagine that she is not going to let Kavanaugh off the hook here, that she will ask some very probative questions -- Neil."

Certainly, Judge Kavanaugh has said that he is not going to withdraw. They're going to fight this out before the Senate Judiciary Committee. And -- Grassley, rather, said it last week. He said, we will have to be the jury. We will have to listen to the evidence, weigh the evidence and be the jury.

But she didn't say I -- in fact, she went out of her way to say it's not because of Dr. Ford's allegation, because I'm afraid of where he's going to be on so-called dark money. I want a pledge, in essence, she was saying, that he will overturn the Supreme Court decision of Citizens United. So they will find -- they may not vote for them.

And regardless of -- regardless of whether it's justified or not, if the Democrats fail to block him, this will anger some of their base, and they may take it out on some Democrats. But we ought to be thinking about what's right for the country. And the fact of the matter is, we have gone from a time when -- when Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 95 percent of Republicans voted to confirm, 75 percent, 74 percent voted to confirm Steve Breyer. Only 50 percent of Democrats turned around and voted for Judge Roberts -- 10 percent, only 10 percent of Democrats voted for Judge Alito. And then we saw, with Neil Gorsuch, I mean, even though he was an incredibly accomplished individual, almost every Democrat voted against him. So we are in a place that this hyperpartisanship that was engendered first by Ted Kennedy in savaging Robert Bork, and then furthered by Harry Reid in trying to stop a George W. Bush from naming people to the Supreme Court and the appellate courts is not helping our country and is not in the best long-term interest of either political party."

I'd like to thank our great Vice President Pence for joining us today for the ceremony, and U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer for his incredible efforts. He's worked very, very hard on this. Thank you as well to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Director of National Economic Council Larry Kudlow for their tremendous work. Everybody has worked very, very hard. This is long in coming, many years, actually, I will say, in coming. In a few moments, we will sign a document pledging that our countries will take the additional necessary steps to implement the new United States- Korea trade agreement. I want to express my gratitude to President Moon and his entire team for their dedicated efforts to reach, really, what we would call a historic milestone in trade, something that most people thought was not going to be happening. From day one, I promised the American people that I would renegotiate our trade deals to ensure that our agreements were fair and reciprocal. For decades, politicians have talked about fixing broken trade deals, only to do absolutely nothing about them. My administration is the first to actually keep our promise and deliver. And in addition to this deal, we have many in the works, and they're fair deals. They're reciprocal deals. And they make a tremendous difference to our workers, our companies, and to the United States as a whole. The new U.S.-Korea agreement includes significant improvements to reduce our trade deficit and to expand opportunities to export American products to South Korea. In other words, we are now going to start sending products to South Korea. These outcomes give the finest American-made automobiles, innovative medicines, and agricultural crops much better access to Korean markets. I think our farmers are going to be extremely happy. It was very limited as to what they could do and what they could send. And now it's a open market, and they're going to be sending a lot more farm products. That makes me feel very good. I love our farmers. As a part of this agreement, we have also secured increased access to America's auto industry. South Korea will double the annual number of American cars sold within. In other words, we used to sell a maximum of 25,000, and we wouldn't even get to that number, and now we're going to 50,000. We're doubling it per manufacturer. And that's a doubling. So it's 50,000 per manufacturer -- cars. And that's each year. So that's a doubling of the cars per manufacturer that can enter its market, meeting U.S. safety standards. So we're going with now a U.S. safety standard. The standard was at a point that you couldn't get cars in. So we're going to the U.S. safety standard. Very important to understand. This agreement will reduce bureaucracy and increase prosperity in both of our countries. Workers in South Korea and America will find new customers and new opportunities to expand and grow. Our teams will be working hard to ensure that the terms of the deal are fully implemented. President Moon, I just want to tell you we've developed a great relationship on many different fronts. This one is on trade, but we're working very well on North Korea. A lot of very positive things are happening with Chairman Kim of North Korea. And you'll be hearing about that over the coming weeks. But I think some really, really important things are happening. As I said just a little while ago, we have an agreement to work out another summit. And we look forward to doing that. I'm going to be meeting with Chairman Kim in the not-too-distant future. The location is being worked on, the time is being worked on. And we'll be announcing it. As far as these negotiations, our two countries have set an example of friendship and cooperation for trade that rarely you see in this age. And I just want to tell you I'm very honored to be a part of it, and I'm honored to call you a friend. And I'm honored to say that the United States and South Korea have a great friendship together. Thank you very much. Mr. President, thank you very much."

This has vastly expanded to include automobiles and like, an agreement he says that is in both countries' interest and levels the playing field. Again, if we hear more on this and the details of this, of course, we will pass it along. All of this at a time tensions have risen, ironically enough, with the Chinese, where we're making no progress there. And, in fact, both sides have implemented tougher tariffs on a number of goods and products that go there from the United States and come here from China.

Hours after it was announced that Judge Kavanaugh was President Trump's nominee, Chuck Schumer went to the floor of the U.S. Senate and said, we're going to do everything within our -- within our power to stop this nominee. That's exactly what's going on right now. This is a smear campaign against Judge Kavanaugh. Look at these latest allegations The New Yorker put in print here most recently, in the last 24 hours. The New York Times says news that's fit to print, The New York Times wouldn't even carry that story. So, there are -- these are desperation tactics right now.

Ahead of that, let's get the read from GOP pollster Lee Carter, Hadley Heath Manning with the Independent Women's Forum, and former Democratic Congressman Jason Altmire. Congressman, let me end with you, because a lot of the friction we have seen has been very polarizing, the Democrats on one side of this, Republicans on the other side, very, very little overlap here.

On the flip side, it's almost impossible for Judge Kavanaugh to disprove these allegations. That's what's so ugly about our politics. People are retreating to their corners, believing what they want to believe. And as the congressman mentioned, what's wrong with our politics when it comes to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court outstepping its role, overstepping, stepping into policy-making, that's what's brought us here. That's why the confirmation process is so politicized, even to the point of politicizing allegations over something as serious as sexual misconduct."

My hope is that they -- they enter into these conversations with compassion and with understanding, maybe even telling their own stories as they're asking the questions of experience that they have had, whether it's daughters or wives or friends who have come forward to them, because the truth of the matter is, one in three women has experienced some kind of a sexual assault or victimization. And so we all are surrounded by this. And I don't want in any way, shape or form -- the last thing we want to see happen is women become afraid to tell their stories because this goes the very, very wrong way. We don't want -- we want the truth to come out, and I don't want it to become a political game, a political show. And I don't think anybody does. But, right now, what we're seeing out there is a third of Americans have already decided that Kavanaugh's guilty. A third have decided that they already support forward. And there's only a third out there who are waiting to find out what we hear on Thursday. And that's really dangerous. The fact that we're looking at a state of affairs where somebody is presumed innocent until -- the whole notion that you're presumed innocent until otherwise proven guilty is -- is at play here, and we're at odds with that.

Democrats have been saying, we want to make sure we hear from Judge Kavanaugh to respond to these charges, but making it equally clear that they're a no-vote anyway.

Francesca Chambers joins us right now. She's the White House correspondent for The Daily Mail. First time seeing you in person."

      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the fact that we're going to hear directly from Brett Kavanaugh on your colleague's show this evening shows you that the White House is worried. In the past, we have just heard from White House spokespeople denying the allegations. But now we're hearing directly from Brett Kavanaugh. And I think even the president's rhetoric over the past few days on this issue has changed dramatically. First, it was, she deserves to be heard, I believe that he will still be confirmed. Then it was, this is a political attack, this is a smear campaign, this is the left trying to run down my nominee. And I think those two things are very different."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, obviously, they're worried about how close this vote could be. You could make the argument that, for the Democratic support they thought they might get, those senators might have cover now not to vote for him. There's also talk -- I was looking at these protesters outside Jeff Flake's office, the outgoing Republican senator, looked like hundreds of them -- I could be wrong -- but they're obviously trying to tip his vote. All of a sudden, now you're talking over a very, very dicey prospect, where you have 50 Republicans, and that's it. And then you have the vice president in the role of a tiebreaker here. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, you bring up a really important point, Neil. It's not just whether the president still stands behind his nominee. Ultimately, the decision resides with senators as to whether Brett Kavanaugh will get confirmed. And there are just a few that could potentially swing this vote. Most Democrats are going to vote no. Most Republicans are going to vote yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you see any Democrat voting yes, even those -- you always hear about the Manchins and the Donnellys, you know, in states that Trump won big, that they might consider it, but now less so?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "And it's not just the first allegation. It's the fact that there's a second allegation. And then Michael Avenatti seems to have potentially a third allegation. And that gives Democrats a lot of cover at this point to say, I was thinking about it, but this is why I didn't or couldn't vote for him. So it really does then potentially come down to those Republican swing votes, like Jeff Flake, and what they will be doing. And that is who Brett Kavanaugh will be speaking to tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You mentioned these other women who have come forward. Of course, The New York Times said it would have a tough time corroborating the story that was in The New Yorker and that it might be giving people another pause here, especially the one where Avenatti was involved here, where they're saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Could it boomerang on Democrats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, at the same time as you're saying, it's possible that Brett Kavanaugh could come forward, and not just America can hear from him tonight on FOX, but also on Thursday, when both Dr. Ford and Brett Kavanaugh are due to testify, that they could hear what he has to say and believe that he is the one who has the more credible story. But, again, I think that it will take until Thursday, when both of them are in the same -- not the same room at the same time, but back to back."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

You have always heard that, that hurts the person being accused. Do you buy that, that all of a sudden she makes a credible case, whether people believe her or not, it puts him at a disadvantage?"
    },

      "utterance": "Not as far as we know. The president says that he is standing by Brett Kavanaugh. But that is a very real question as to whether or not at this point they're sorting out potential other names if something -- if they did start to get the sense that this is going to go south."

I think that as another point today, we haven't had that many opportunities personally to interact with the president, except for those few bilateral - - bilaterals, like with Moon Jae-in that we saw there. And at a briefing today, we..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Great seeing you again. Francesca Chambers follows this very, very well for The Daily Mail. By the way, an update on the trade front here. No update on the trade front. It is still an outright trade war with the Chinese. They're not bending, even though it looks like the South Koreans were kind of blinking. Why that could be a problem for the markets, not Kavanaugh, not Rosenstein, trade -- I will explain after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, markets abhor uncertainty. And, today, the markets were dealing with a lot of uncertainty, but not have of political variety here, more the trade variety. I'm not saying they're ignoring what could happen to Judge Kavanaugh, if he never becomes Justice Kavanaugh. That would be a worry. And it's not as if they're pushing aside the whole Rod Rosenstein mess and whether he ultimately gets fired and complicates the whole investigation, and you name that. But they don't think either of those are possibilities. What they do worry about is trade quickly turning into an expensive proposition for American consumers, especially during the holiday season, as China and the United States go tit for tat going after each other's goods and hiking up the price of those goods. The read now from financial analyst Heather Zumarraga, Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino and Deirdre Bolton. Deirdre, the argument is, this gets worse before it gets better on the trade front, that we have to brace ourselves for pricier products. Do you buy that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it is possible, Neil. And what we learned over the weekend and today, right, is that China is actually not going to, as of this moment, sit in the same room. Trade talks have been canceled, more or less, right, and China saying it will not negotiate with a gun to its head. And then today also symbolic because 10 percent of tariffs worth of $200 billion on Chinese goods went into effect today. We know that number goes up to 25 percent at a certain point. And then, of course, China retaliated, putting 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods. This on the same day that oil settled. You were talking about the consumer strength, right. It settled around $72 a barrel. We haven't seen this in a while. It seems as if OPEC is signaling that it's going to let the price go up a little bit. So, as we all know, that is the ultimate tax, in addition to tariffs and trade consequences, on American consumers, Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "It does worry me -- $250 billion now worth of goods at a 10 percent tariff, another $200 billion added today out of that 250, does worry me. It worries the markets. Markets are down. For the most part this year, markets have shaken off trade disputes. But I think, as trade tensions escalate with China, this could get -- this could -- this could get worse, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Let me give you the political variable. And that is on politics stuff and the investigations, Charlie Gasparino. Rod Rosenstein is fired, many people don't -- don't seem to think that's going to happen, that the president will keep him on when he meets with him at the White House on Thursday, but explain the fallout there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, the general uncertainty involving Rosenstein goes back to Mueller. And I will tell you, the markets have been trading off on anything negative that Mueller may or may not have on the president or the people around him. And I'm just saying this. Here's where the political stuff, I think, played in today. Yes, China, people -- there's trade fears. There's algorithms that whenever there's a negative China story about trade, the markets trade off. But the overall emphasis is this, that Rosenstein, Mueller, the Brett Kavanaugh brouhaha, that this is all bad for the Republicans. It's going to lead to Democrats taking the House and maybe the Senate. And that will stall the Trump economic agenda. And that's pretty bad. I will say this, though. The trade numbers have not really showed up in GDP just yet. I mean, we haven't seen the latest GDP clip, but they're not really in the numbers. And one of the things is this. I don't think most people, particularly traders, are worried as much about China, because they know China is a perennial bad player."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Actually, backing up what Charlie is saying as well, right, we hit the record highs on Friday for the Dow and S&P 500. So, today is a bit of give-back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "My point is this. I think they're more worried about is sort of an unconcerted effort, sort of an un -- that the Trump administration goes nuts on trade, attacks everybody, and doesn't isolate China. I think that's the worst of all worlds here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, in other words, trade dictates a lot of stuff. Heather, let me ask you something about Kavanaugh, if you don't mind. If he fails at becoming a Supreme Court justice, it just falls a vote or two shy, and he -- and they have to start from scratch, for the markets, would that have any impact at all? This was a conservative judge, of course, with a very big pro-business bent. They like that sort of thing. Or does it move the needle at all? More trade? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "Absolutely it matters. Markets don't like uncertainty, whether it be politics, political uncertainty from the executive branch or uncertainty out of escalating trade tensions with China. And if Democrats take over the House and the Senate, then the markets will go down, because the Trump agenda, including tax -- tax reform and deregulation across the board, which is pro-business -- this is the biggest pro-business president we have had in a very long time, perhaps ever -- then the markets will go down because the Trump agenda is off the table."

And, by the way, Judge Kavanaugh and his wife have spoken to our Martha MacCallum. And if you think they -- they are not going down here without a fight, and promising a fight that will ultimately claim victory, well, you are wrong.
