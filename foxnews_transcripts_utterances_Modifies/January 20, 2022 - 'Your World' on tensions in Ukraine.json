Before he allegedly stabbed Brianna Kupfer and left her to bleed to death, Shawn Laval Smith had been bailed on both coasts, Democrat and Republican prosecutors involved, COVID court delays also playing a role, a perfect storm of circumstances tragically ending with the death of Kupfer, who is being remembered at a vigil today at the store where she worked and where she was murdered. Shawn Smith was arrested after a member of the public spotted him and called 911. He was out on bail following a misdemeanor shoplifting arrest here in California. But his long criminal record began on the East Coast, and the most serious charge against him appears to have been for firing a flare gun into a vehicle in which a young boy and a man were sitting. That was in 2019 in Charleston, South Carolina. It was a charge that could have meant 10 years in prison. But we understand Smith was freed on $50,000 bail, and less than 10 percent of that was paid before it seems Smith took advantage of the March 2020 COVID-related court shutdown in Charleston to skip town, leave the state and head West. In October 2020, he was arrested for stealing from a Home Depot in Covina, California, and was released on $1,000 bail for that misdemeanor charge. Then, a year ago today, just outside San Francisco, he was arrested for vandalizing a car and biting a police officer. He served a little more than four months behind bars, then, at some point, made his way back to L.A. and that fateful day a week ago. We expect Shawn Smith's initial arraignment on murder charges to happen tomorrow, Sandra. His bail, in the meantime, has been set a $2 million -- Sandra.",

FOX News was not called on for a question, but Bragg clarified that controversial charging memo he sent to prosecutors earlier this month. That memo told prosecutors to no longer charge for lower-level crimes like marijuana, subway fare evasion and resisting arrest. And it ordered armed robberies to be charged as a misdemeanor if there is no genuine risk of harm. It also said they would only seek jail time for murders and violent offenses. Today, he reaffirmed that armed robberies with a gun would be prosecuted as felonies and that he's laser-focused on gun violence.

He adopted a couple -- helped adopt a couple of important pieces of legislation, one on COVID relief, another bipartisan infrastructure reform bill.

And one is to stay on message, to have a unified, consistent, very clear message that if he does make this terrible mistake that the consequences will be devastating, one, with regard to sanctions. And the president has talked about that in the past. He talked about it again today, as he cleaned up his remarks. It's important that we make it clear that this is not going to be the normal sanctions that Russia has figured out a way to get around, but it's going to be something that hits their economy and particular their energy sector hard and individuals within the country who are responsible for making these decisions. Second, the military buildup is really important, because the Russians seem to know that, if they try this, that they will have a dear cost to pay. And that will be a Ukrainian military that is far better trained than they were in 2014, has much better equipment, and are willing to fight. So my hope is that these things will keep this from happening by providing a deterrence. The talks are fine. I know they're ongoing. But the Russian talks, their goals in these talks are just not realistic at all. To say that NATO cannot accept new members, particularly Ukraine, runs against everything that we know about NATO. They have an open door policy. It's not our decision. It's the decision of the people of Ukraine and it's the decision of NATO. I also will tell you, I'm concerned about keeping countries in the region together and on message. And I worry particularly about Germany, and their unwillingness to say publicly that, of course, they would stop this new pipeline, Nord Stream 2 pipeline, should there be an invasion, and also not providing other countries with the ability to provide arms because they are NATO members. So, we got to be sure that everybody's on board here to avoid the bloodshed, to avoid this terrible mistake from happening.",

Look, as if we didn't have enough energy issues pushing these oil prices up, President Biden's press conference yesterday added another reason that the market is worried. The comments that he made about Russia invading Ukraine, essentially sanctioning a small invasion, has the market pricing in instability in the region. He also downplayed the hold that Russia has on European oil, but remember that they supply about 35 percent of Europe's energy. If Russia invades Ukraine and a conflict ensues, there will be no doubt that there will be disruptions in the energy market and that could spill over here to the United States. It's all connected. Let's review for a moment the other reasons that oil is rising. Of course, you have Biden's ban on drilling on federal land. Then you have got his strong push to incentivize alternative energy. And then, of course, you have post-pandemic demand returning without adequate supply. Now, yesterday, Biden was Bragging that he convinced other oil producers to up their production, that he tapped the SPR and gas prices came down that whopping 12 cents. Well, of course, we are seeing that gas prices are up once again. And that's something that people have to think about. The bottom line here, of course, is that analysts have been calling for over $100-a-barrel oil this year. We are not far off that mark now. Geopolitical instability and also tensions with Russia not going to help the situation, not in any way - - Sandra.",

He passes the buck to the Fed. He passes the buck to businesses, Sandra. You heard him go after meat producers and grocery stores.

Bob Nardelli, former CEO of Home Depot and Chrysler, is joining us now. Bob, it is great to see you. I was just thinking, I haven't had the chance to talk to you in quite some time. So allow me to pick your brain, because we all feel this inflation from a consumer standpoint, but talk about the challenges being the head of a major company. I shouldn't say major. I should say a company big or small. As you try to navigate inflation and the spiking energy and food prices, no matter where you look, prices are going up. What is that like to navigate if you own or are in charge of a company in this country?"

And I don't think I have ever seen such a challenging environment for anyone to run a company. And you're exactly right. I'm heavily involved in a lot of smaller private equity groups and also large corporations. And I have never seen it, as I said, more challenging. And we have an administration that made a lot of promises during the campaign. And to their credit, they implemented them immediately. The only problem is, it's had a tremendously negative impact on our economy, and our stature within the world today, within business communities. So, if you think about it, what was one of the first things, Sandra? We surrendered our position as being energy-independent."

Supply chain, you were talking about it earlier. Supply chain is having a direct impact. It's inseparably linked on inflation today. We stopped building the fence. Immigration is coming in. Our debt is spiraling. Crime rates. So the level of complexity for a CEO today is like nothing I have ever seen. And I'm not talking about decades."

Before he allegedly stabbed Brianna Kupfer and left her to bleed to death, Shawn Laval Smith had been bailed on both coasts, Democrat and Republican prosecutors involved, COVID court delays also playing a role, a perfect storm of circumstances tragically ending with the death of Kupfer, who is being remembered at a vigil today at the store where she worked and where she was murdered. Shawn Smith was arrested after a member of the public spotted him and called 911. He was out on bail following a misdemeanor shoplifting arrest here in California. But his long criminal record began on the East Coast, and the most serious charge against him appears to have been for firing a flare gun into a vehicle in which a young boy and a man were sitting. That was in 2019 in Charleston, South Carolina. It was a charge that could have meant 10 years in prison. But we understand Smith was freed on $50,000 bail, and less than 10 percent of that was paid before it seems Smith took advantage of the March 2020 COVID-related court shutdown in Charleston to skip town, leave the state and head West. In October 2020, he was arrested for stealing from a Home Depot in Covina, California, and was released on $1,000 bail for that misdemeanor charge. Then, a year ago today, just outside San Francisco, he was arrested for vandalizing a car and biting a police officer. He served a little more than four months behind bars, then, at some point, made his way back to L.A. and that fateful day a week ago. We expect Shawn Smith's initial arraignment on murder charges to happen tomorrow, Sandra. His bail, in the meantime, has been set a $2 million -- Sandra."

FOX News was not called on for a question, but Bragg clarified that controversial charging memo he sent to prosecutors earlier this month. That memo told prosecutors to no longer charge for lower-level crimes like marijuana, subway fare evasion and resisting arrest. And it ordered armed robberies to be charged as a misdemeanor if there is no genuine risk of harm. It also said they would only seek jail time for murders and violent offenses. Today, he reaffirmed that armed robberies with a gun would be prosecuted as felonies and that he's laser-focused on gun violence.

Police say a man fired a small-caliber gun twice while chasing another man. No arrests have been made. New York City Mayor Eric Adams called this shooting a wakeup call and said district attorneys need to step up. The question is, how is DA Bragg's policies to lower the incarceration rate, how that will square with efforts by Adams to put more police on patrol.

Bragg is trying to walk back the fact that he was caught red-handed by issuing that memo, which basically stated exactly how he feels. And that is that we're just not going to prosecute as many people as possible. And Gascon, of course, when I say -- when I call them Trojan horse prosecutors and district attorneys, what I'm referring to is, they were let into the gates, right, they were let into the gates of the city by the voters, which -- which is astounding, even though the reality is that they have been -- they have been funded through the..."

It might have hurt him a little because of some of the misstatements, particularly the one where he seemed to be distinguishing between a Russian invasion of Ukraine and a Russian incursion of Ukraine, which doesn't make any sense at all. And he clarified that today, but it was an unfortunate mistake. Time will tell. I mean, he's got to perform. I don't think he's outperformed in this first year of his administration. And that's disappointing to a lot of us who supported him last year. I think he's performed some. He adopted a couple -- helped adopt a couple of important pieces of legislation, one on COVID relief, another bipartisan infrastructure reform bill. But, honestly, then he went on to overreach for the Build Back Better bill and this federal control of voting rights, and set himself up for a defeat that is more in the minds of people in the country than the victories he had. And, of course, the big disaster, I think, in foreign policy was the terribly mistaken and chaotically executed retreat from Afghanistan, which really has unsettled our allies around the world and emboldened our enemies. I think, in part, that's why Putin is now banging at the door of Ukraine and why the Iranians are being so arrogant in the negotiations and unreasonable in our negotiations over the nuclear agreement in Vienna."

And he opened himself to exactly that kind of criticism. Well, of course, Bernie was out there applauding him for doing that.

      "utterance": "Greg Palkot, thank you. So, what are the stakes for the U.S. in this fight? Let's bring in Senate Foreign Relations Committee member and Ohio Senator Rob Portman, just back from visiting Ukraine. Senator, thank you very much for your time. I will get to the -- to what exactly is at stake here in just a moment. But having just returned from there, how would you assess the likelihood that Putin will invade Ukraine? Is it going to happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH)",
      "utterance": "Well, Sandra, nobody knows. But I think it's much less likely if we do the right things. And one is to stay on message, to have a unified, consistent, very clear message that if he does make this terrible mistake that the consequences will be devastating, one, with regard to sanctions. And the president has talked about that in the past. He talked about it again today, as he cleaned up his remarks. It's important that we make it clear that this is not going to be the normal sanctions that Russia has figured out a way to get around, but it's going to be something that hits their economy and particular their energy sector hard and individuals within the country who are responsible for making these decisions. Second, the military buildup is really important, because the Russians seem to know that, if they try this, that they will have a dear cost to pay. And that will be a Ukrainian military that is far better trained than they were in 2014, has much better equipment, and are willing to fight. So my hope is that these things will keep this from happening by providing a deterrence. The talks are fine. I know they're ongoing. But the Russian talks, their goals in these talks are just not realistic at all. To say that NATO cannot accept new members, particularly Ukraine, runs against everything that we know about NATO. They have an open door policy. It's not our decision. It's the decision of the people of Ukraine and it's the decision of NATO. I also will tell you, I'm concerned about keeping countries in the region together and on message. And I worry particularly about Germany, and their unwillingness to say publicly that, of course, they would stop this new pipeline, Nord Stream 2 pipeline, should there be an invasion, and also not providing other countries with the ability to provide arms because they are NATO members. So, we got to be sure that everybody's on board here to avoid the bloodshed, to avoid this terrible mistake from happening."

Jacqui Heinrich, our White House reporter, just had an exchange, and I believe we have got the pool tape now, where she asked the president a question specifically as it pertains to the possible invasion of Ukraine. And the answer is something. Watch."

      "speaker": "PORTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I hope what he means by that is that we are making moves, in terms of providing unprecedented amount of military assistance, defensive military assistance to Ukraine. We certainly should be. And the president has just authorized another $200 million, which is good, and, then, second, that we are doing other things in the region to prepare for this possibility. One thing that has been very clear is that the cyberattacks last week were based from Russia. And, clearly, this is part of the Russian hybrid warfare, as they call it. So that's another area where we can help quite a bit. We have a Cyber Command. We have the ability to do a lot more in terms of cyber. I hope we're doing that. We're pushing for that, and then, finally, letting the Russians know and Vladimir Putin know that, if something should happen, we're going to build up our defenses, not just in Ukraine, of course..."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, drivers may need to start bracing for even more pain at the pump. A potential move by Russia into Ukraine is threatening to send gas prices even higher. FOX Business' Jackie DeAngelis has the details. Jackie, aren't gas prices already up a buck year over year?"

    {
      "speaker": "JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "They are. Sandra, good afternoon. Look, as if we didn't have enough energy issues pushing these oil prices up, President Biden's press conference yesterday added another reason that the market is worried. The comments that he made about Russia invading Ukraine, essentially sanctioning a small invasion, has the market pricing in instability in the region. He also downplayed the hold that Russia has on European oil, but remember that they supply about 35 percent of Europe's energy. If Russia invades Ukraine and a conflict ensues, there will be no doubt that there will be disruptions in the energy market and that could spill over here to the United States. It's all connected. Let's review for a moment the other reasons that oil is rising. Of course, you have Biden's ban on drilling on federal land. Then you have got his strong push to incentivize alternative energy. And then, of course, you have post-pandemic demand returning without adequate supply. Now, yesterday, Biden was Bragging that he convinced other oil producers to up their production, that he tapped the SPR and gas prices came down that whopping 12 cents. Well, of course, we are seeing that gas prices are up once again. And that's something that people have to think about. The bottom line here, of course, is that analysts have been calling for over $100-a-barrel oil this year. We are not far off that mark now. Geopolitical instability and also tensions with Russia not going to help the situation, not in any way - - Sandra."

And that's a big deal because more Americans now identify themselves as an independent than a Democrat or a Republican. Joining us now is the reporter asking that question, McClatchy White House correspondent Francesca Chambers, along with GOP pollster Lee Carter. Great to see you both. Happy to end this hour with you. So, Francesca, I will start with you first and get your reaction to the president's comment on that. He doesn't believe the polls."

And whether the White House either believes the polls or is just listening to Democratic strategists and allies of the White House who are saying that he needed to change his approach, the White House is saying that he will be doing things a little bit differently this year. He will be spending more time on the road and relying more on his legislative team, rather than brokering deals himself on things like Build Back Better."

      "utterance": "Hmm. Lee?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he better listen to the polls. I mean, the drop among independents, I think, is the steepest drop I have ever seen. He's lost more than 23 points among independents since the day he took office in just one year. And he's lost on issues that are really important to American voters, issues like the economy, issues like handling of COVID, issues like foreign policy. Across the board, people are having a really hard time finding one thing that they can point to that says he is the right guy for the job. Five out of six Americans are saying they're worse off today than they were a year ago. So, he might not want to hear the polls. And that's -- that's certainly a great coping mechanism for him. But he better. And I would and I would recommend all Democrats really listen to the polls, because it's not looking good for them in the midterms either. And so the people are speaking. And they're saying they're scared. They're saying they're anxious. They're saying they're frustrated. And they're saying that they want real leadership, and they're not getting it today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's approval on the economy. It's approval on foreign affairs. It's approval on a lot that has just continued to fall. Most Americans disapprove than approve of how he's handling his job as president, 56 percent to 43 percent. And what is so notable is not ebbs and flows. This is a sharp drop over the course of the first year of his presidency. Francesca, I will ask you, finally, should Democrats be worried as we enter into February we're quickly approaching, and we are in a midterm election year? Final thought?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, the Democrats I'm hearing from are concerned. And that's why they were providing that advice to the president and his political team that they needed to shake up their approach here. When they're looking at the polls, it's not just his drop among independents. It's his drop among -- in support among the Democratic Party base..."
