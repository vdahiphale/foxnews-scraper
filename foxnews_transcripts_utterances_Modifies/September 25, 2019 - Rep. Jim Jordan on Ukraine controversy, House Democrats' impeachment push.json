This is just a pretext for them to do what they've always wanted to do.  Remember, they've been investigating, going after this president since July 31st, 2016, and they are looking for anything they can hang their hat on because, Bret, remember, the Michael Cohen hearing was a flop. The John Dean hearing was a flop. The Bob Mueller hearing was a flop. The Mueller report was a flop. The Lewandowski hearing was a flop. So they're trying to figure out, maybe this transcript. But even they have said there was no quid pro quo. The Democrat chairman themselves have said there was no quid pro quo here, there was no talk about holding up foreign aid from the president. Zelensky, the president of the Ukraine, said he wasn't pushed.  So this is just the Democrats out to get the guy we elected president, plain and simple.",

The director of national intelligence says there's nothing there. So what does the inspector general do?
