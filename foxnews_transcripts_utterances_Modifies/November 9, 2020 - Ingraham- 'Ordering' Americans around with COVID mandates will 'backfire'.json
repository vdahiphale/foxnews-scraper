Attorney General Bill Barr you might have heard it has just authorized DOJ lawyers to probe substantial allegations of voting irregularities. A poll worker who witnessed just that is here exclusively tonight and do you hear the pandemic? It's over. If you saw the crowds celebrating Joe Biden and the media subsequent eon, well, you might think that. Ari Fleischer tells us why the Left's political capital on COVID restrictions is gone and Raymond Arroyo brings us the most pathetic yes, there were tears reactions to this past weekend's Biden news.  Seen and Unseen unpacks it all. But first, mandate for defeat. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now during the campaign Joe Biden and his handlers refused to be transparent about basic policy questions including their specific plan for handling COVID. Now on top of that they lied about Joe's opposition of fracking, his true timeline for destroying the oil and gas industry and they knew in their heart of hearts that the nation wasn't nearly as radical as their party had become.  So they sold Biden as sort of a - kind of moderate, amiable grandfatherly figure. He would help heal a nation's divide and even conquer the virus itself with science and compassion.",

      "sentences": "Wait a minute. Wearing a mask is a good way to start pulling the country together? What does pulling the country together have to do with science or health? Get it? The more you hear these guys talk about COVID, the more it sounds as though their perspectives are truly political, entirely political. Americans are happy to cooperate on health measures including mask. That will truly benefit our health. But they're not going to give up their traditional liberties as part of a political effort to start pulling the country together. They've been tearing the country apart for the last three years, four years, five years.   In short the key lesson from today is that Biden's COVID plans are not driven by science, they aren't altered by the development of a vaccine and they appear to have no relation to the actual facts. Certainly they ignore the overwhelming evidence that Western Europe has tried similar policies which have ended in disaster.  Lockdowns, masks, none of it seemed to stem the virus. Meanwhile in America our economy is roaring back so long as Biden and company don't get their hands on it. Look, it's too early to tell how this - the election is ultimately going to come out but I can tell you this. Joe Biden and the Democrats do not have a mandate from the voters to wreck the economy or take away your civil liberties, my civil liberties in the name of COVID. Over 71 million patriots voted for President Trump. Assuming they can win in Georgia in January, Republicans will hold the Senate. Republicans gained seats in the House. The American people didn't vote to lock themselves down and I believe they will resist any such effort.  I've interviewed Governor DeSantis and lots of other Republican officials and I do not think that you will see states governed by Republicans destroying themselves, destroying small businesses, restaurants everything, due to the fear of COVID.  And I don't think a Congress with a Republican Senate will make them do so. So if Biden and his puppeteers try to force us into unnecessary lockdowns, they'll find themselves taken to court and they'll lose. I know that the Democrats spent most of the weekend celebrating.  No COVID there but it's important that they understand the truth. Whatever happens in this presidential election, you will not have the power to rewrite our constitution denier liberties and The truth. Whatever happens in this presidential election you will not have the power to rewrite our constitution deny our liberties and lockdown our economy and if you try any of these things, we will fight you day and night and we will win. The American people have spoken and they've made clear that COVID or no COVID the Democrats must seek cooperation, not submission from us. For months now I've made it clear that COVID is a national tragedy that should have been something that brought us all together. Instead Democrats used it as a political weapon. It was effectively Joe Biden's running mate.   Now the election's over. A vaccine is on the way and they're still using it. What was Biden's phrase? Start pulling the country together?  Sorry Democrats. You don't have that kind of power. If you want to pull the country together, I suggest you start treating the rest of us as free and equal citizens. Ordering us around or trying to will only backfire and that's the Angle. Joining me now is Dr. William Grace, oncologist and hematologist and Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologists extraordinare and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology.   All right, Dr. Oskoui, Biden's entire COVID plan seems to hinge on mandates and a lot of these people on the task force were all for the lockdown. What does this sign say?",

Well, in fact they have 2.5 times as much influenza in Japan so I think that what we're seeing and Japan's a good example this, Taiwan's done well too but we don't have that kind of granular data is that lockdowns may actually harm not just the economy but the health of the country that's locked down.",

They all vote one way and those who are in private practice and those who are trying to care for patients who actually pay their salaries, they were all pretty much on the side of Trump but I think when you look at Biden's program, the scary part of it is not the scientific part. What they've done is taken all the successful programs of Trump and out sort of the new age academic cliches on it to call them something different such as a safe vaccine as opposed to an unsafe vaccine, to have basically next generation testing compared to the testing that's being done now over now about fourth generation testing.  And then they have you know evidence based care as if all the care in the country's not been evidence based and then they're going to have a pandemic dashboard. We already have one in Johns Hopkins. That's not the scary part. The scary part is the social political part where they're going to have a program to address the food insecurity. During an obesity epidemic, they're going to have a task force to address the food insecurity of COVID-19 and the effect of COVID-19 on our affordable housing because you take a look at New York, COVID had a great effect on affordable housing. Everybody's leaving so there'll be plenty of affordable housing. Then you take a look at what they're going to do with a diversity health force like the space force. A diversity health force because as you know only diverse people can care for COVID-19 because the people are caring for them now are not diverse enough.  And then we're going to have a Women's Caregiving force and this Women's Caregiving Force is going to take care of all those COVID patients because only one sex can actually be empathetic enough for COVID patients. It's crazy. The last and terrifying thing is that they're going to go after presumably conservers who are going after the Asians because these xenophobic conservatives are going after Asians because the virus came out of Asia which is going to be news to Governor Cuomo because he thinks it came out of Italy.",

So how is this going to affect American workers having this guy so close to the White House?",

A poll worker who witnessed just that is here exclusively tonight and do you hear the pandemic? It's over. If you saw the crowds celebrating Joe Biden and the media subsequent eon, well, you might think that. Ari Fleischer tells us why the Left's political capital on COVID restrictions is gone and Raymond Arroyo brings us the most pathetic yes, there were tears reactions to this past weekend's Biden news. Seen and Unseen unpacks it all. But first, mandate for defeat. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now during the campaign Joe Biden and his handlers refused to be transparent about basic policy questions including their specific plan for handling COVID. Now on top of that they lied about Joe's opposition of fracking, his true timeline for destroying the oil and gas industry and they knew in their heart of hearts that the nation wasn't nearly as radical as their party had become. So they sold Biden as sort of a - kind of moderate, amiable grandfatherly figure. He would help heal a nation's divide and even conquer the virus itself with science and compassion."

Also on the task force is former HHS whistleblower Rick, not so bright, who filed the frivolous whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration. Now putting him on the task force, it's just a vindictive gratuitous purely political move and if you think Biden's virus panel will offer any optimism or hope, hope of returning to normal anytime soon, guess again.

For those of you who thought this was about the science well guess again, this is about power my friends. It's about social control.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Wait a minute. Wearing a mask is a good way to start pulling the country together? What does pulling the country together have to do with science or health? Get it? The more you hear these guys talk about COVID, the more it sounds as though their perspectives are truly political, entirely political. Americans are happy to cooperate on health measures including mask. That will truly benefit our health. But they're not going to give up their traditional liberties as part of a political effort to start pulling the country together. They've been tearing the country apart for the last three years, four years, five years. In short the key lesson from today is that Biden's COVID plans are not driven by science, they aren't altered by the development of a vaccine and they appear to have no relation to the actual facts. Certainly they ignore the overwhelming evidence that Western Europe has tried similar policies which have ended in disaster. Lockdowns, masks, none of it seemed to stem the virus. Meanwhile in America our economy is roaring back so long as Biden and company don't get their hands on it. Look, it's too early to tell how this - the election is ultimately going to come out but I can tell you this. Joe Biden and the Democrats do not have a mandate from the voters to wreck the economy or take away your civil liberties, my civil liberties in the name of COVID. Over 71 million patriots voted for President Trump. Assuming they can win in Georgia in January, Republicans will hold the Senate. Republicans gained seats in the House. The American people didn't vote to lock themselves down and I believe they will resist any such effort. I've interviewed Governor DeSantis and lots of other Republican officials and I do not think that you will see states governed by Republicans destroying themselves, destroying small businesses, restaurants everything, due to the fear of COVID. And I don't think a Congress with a Republican Senate will make them do so. So if Biden and his puppeteers try to force us into unnecessary lockdowns, they'll find themselves taken to court and they'll lose. I know that the Democrats spent most of the weekend celebrating. No COVID there but it's important that they understand the truth. Whatever happens in this presidential election, you will not have the power to rewrite our constitution denier liberties and The truth. Whatever happens in this presidential election you will not have the power to rewrite our constitution deny our liberties and lockdown our economy and if you try any of these things, we will fight you day and night and we will win. The American people have spoken and they've made clear that COVID or no COVID the Democrats must seek cooperation, not submission from us. For months now I've made it clear that COVID is a national tragedy that should have been something that brought us all together. Instead Democrats used it as a political weapon. It was effectively Joe Biden's running mate. Now the election's over. A vaccine is on the way and they're still using it. What was Biden's phrase? Start pulling the country together? Sorry Democrats. You don't have that kind of power. If you want to pull the country together, I suggest you start treating the rest of us as free and equal citizens. Ordering us around or trying to will only backfire and that's the Angle. Joining me now is Dr. William Grace, oncologist and hematologist and Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologists extraordinare and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. All right, Dr. Oskoui, Biden's entire COVID plan seems to hinge on mandates and a lot of these people on the task force were all for the lockdown. What does this sign say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the science actually says that lockdowns may actually delay herd immunity and may delay countries coming back. I think another example putting aside Sweden is Japan. We have data out of Japan where half of Tokyo has antibodies to COVID and one might say well they mask, don't they in Japan? Well, in fact they have 2.5 times as much influenza in Japan so I think that what we're seeing and Japan's a good example this, Taiwan's done well too but we don't have that kind of granular data is that lockdowns may actually harm not just the economy but the health of the country that's locked down."

      "utterance": "Well, it certainly an academia what they did. They all vote one way and those who are in private practice and those who are trying to care for patients who actually pay their salaries, they were all pretty much on the side of Trump but I think when you look at Biden's program, the scary part of it is not the scientific part. What they've done is taken all the successful programs of Trump and out sort of the new age academic cliches on it to call them something different such as a safe vaccine as opposed to an unsafe vaccine, to have basically next generation testing compared to the testing that's being done now over now about fourth generation testing. And then they have you know evidence based care as if all the care in the country's not been evidence based and then they're going to have a pandemic dashboard. We already have one in Johns Hopkins. That's not the scary part. The scary part is the social political part where they're going to have a program to address the food insecurity. During an obesity epidemic, they're going to have a task force to address the food insecurity of COVID-19 and the effect of COVID-19 on our affordable housing because you take a look at New York, COVID had a great effect on affordable housing. Everybody's leaving so there'll be plenty of affordable housing. Then you take a look at what they're going to do with a diversity health force like the space force. A diversity health force because as you know only diverse people can care for COVID-19 because the people are caring for them now are not diverse enough. And then we're going to have a Women's Caregiving force and this Women's Caregiving Force is going to take care of all those COVID patients because only one sex can actually be empathetic enough for COVID patients. It's crazy. The last and terrifying thing is that they're going to go after presumably conservers who are going after the Asians because these xenophobic conservatives are going after Asians because the virus came out of Asia which is going to be news to Governor Cuomo because he thinks it came out of Italy."

All right, Dr. Oskoui question about the timing of this vaccine announcement. Pfizer had this data some people wondering about the data but should we be curious about the timing because the president obviously in his tweets today is certainly concerned about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "I think the timing makes perfect sense. You've got a president to put in an executive order for most favored nation status on drug pricing that was going to markedly reduce Pfizer's profits in the coming years. You've got another president who's proposed next to nothing in terms of reining in drug prices. Why would you release that to potentially help the president that's going to hurt you financially. I think the CEO had a fiduciary responsibility to his stockholders and I'm sure he'll get a bonus commensurate with his work on their behalf."

Gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see both of you. And if you want to see the clearest distillation of how the media used COVID as a weapon? Well, just a week ago, this is how they referred to Trump campaign rallies and White House events. BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This last night on his COVID spreader tour.

Ari, the hypocrisy is so obvious that it's almost boring but it does beg the question, how much political capital will Biden really have to try to you know enforce lockdowns in early part of the year, given the fact that his task force members, a number of them have been very open to reinstituting them?"

If you're a liberal, if you're pro-Biden, COVID bounces off of you. If you're a conservative, COVID gets you. That's what we know from these street rallies. As for the mandate, look, Joe Biden I do think he has a legitimate mandate to do two things. One is to wear a mask, he ran on that and he's right, we should all wear masks. Two, is to tweet less. That's the extent of his mandate. If there was a mandate on any ideological grounds, the Democrats would have gained seats in the House. They would have taken back the Senate, they would have won governorships and statehouses. None of that happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well also Ari, I disagree with you on the mask thing and the reason why is because in these crowds of people as you noted, I mean there is a lot of people wearing masks but they're pulling their mask down, they're touching - we've watched all the YouTube videos, touching them, moving them, taking them off, putting them on and they're right up next to each other. At Trump events and rallies when there were groups of people with mask, that wasn't good enough so if - I don't buy any of it. I think all of it is you know for them the mask represents you know still the threat, you got to go grow government as Dr. Grace said all the task force for health security and food security and diversity in medicine. That all stems from COVID so when COVID is dealt with perhaps with a vaccine, it becomes harder to make all these cases that they want to make the case for."

You know when you look back the last four years on how they treated the President Trump, they're now asking for healing, what did they do for four years. They resisted the election. They want to overturn the Electoral College. They boycotted the inaugural. They surveiled Trump people.

My experience in Detroit, Republicans were denied meaningful access to observing the ballot counting process. We were told that the hall was full only to learn that a large group of union members were allowed to gain access to the hall. Once we were able to gain access inside, following them, it was clear that Detroit city election workers were scanning and counting ballots for voters whose names did not appear in the voter rolls and when we tried to challenge those, our challenges were largely ignored."

And we've got to make sure that every legal vote is counted. I'll tell you, Laura, I stood in line for an hour and 15 minutes on Election Day because, by the way, I believe in the institution of Election Day. I believe that the voters ought to have all of the facts before they go to the polls and vote. I stood in line for an hour and 15 minutes at a precinct, by the way, that we did not win. But everybody there was happy to be there, they were proud to be there. They were exercising their rights as Americans. And they went and they made the choice that they wanted to make on Election Day. Every single one of them had to show their photo I.D. to prove that they were who they said they were, that they were actually on the voter rolls. And there's no way to do that with mail-in voting.

      "utterance": "I don't think anyone expected a Biden administration to punish social media giants for censoring President Trump and his allies during the campaign, but now it looks like big tech will actually be rewarded for its election meddling. According to \"The Financial Times,\" Biden hired Jessica Hertz, former associate general counsel at Facebook, and Cynthia Hogan, former Apple vice president for government affairs for his transition team. And Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO, may have some role in a Biden White House. Joining me now, Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator whose film \"Trump Card\" is now available on demand. Dinesh, it looks like donating lavishly to Biden, attacking his political opponents, censoring, is about to pay off. DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER, \"TRUMP CARD\":  Yes, the censorship is very profitable for Biden, so it's no surprise that he recognizes these digital censors to be on his team. These aren't just philistines or goons who are arbitrarily shutting people down. This censorship all cuts in one direction. Interestingly, it's not censorship by the government per se, but by these quasi-private monopolies. But these monopolies came to power on false pretenses. They basically assured the American people, gee, we are kind of a neutral platform like the phone company, we're going to allow people to connect with their old friends and engage in robust debates. And the moment that they got this monopolistic power, they turned and they basically decided we're going to start censoring you. Imagine if the phone company were to say, listen, we're going to be restricting hate speech on the phone. We're going to be listening to what you say. We're going to be limiting your privileges. Even though you pay your bill, we reserve the right to cut you off. If AT&T did that, there would be a public revolt and they would shut the company down.

The Democrats and Silicon Valley, marriage made in heaven, and without Trump in the White House, heaven forbid, they are just going to get more powerful and more censorious, Dinesh."

And just to give an innocuous example, a couple of weeks ago I quoted Biden from the debate on Facebook, saying that Antifa was merely an idea. Immediately Facebook says we are demonetizing you. We're putting a warning label, and the warning label very revealing said \"lacking context.\" Think about it, lacking context? What context am I expected to provide? And what makes the whole thing so Kafkaesque it that there is no one to call. It's not like if United cancels your reservation, you call them up and go, gee, you shouldn't have canceled my reservation. In this case, there is dead silence. This is all done behind closed doors. There's no form of appeal. Essentially, you're living in the Twilight Zone."

But again, it always seems to cut one way with Silicon Valley. It's never cut against the Democrats. They could have a decapitated head in their hands, a mock, violent depiction of the president, and it's no problem. And we just told you, by the way, Dinesh, about Eric Schmidt, a former Google CEO, possibly having a role in the Biden White House. \"Vox\" reported today that Schmidt is finally looking to, I guess, become a citizen of Cyprus. The new passport gives him the ability to travel to the E.U., along with potentially favorable a favorable personal tax situations. Individuals who claim Cyprus citizenship can be attracted by a reduction in their tax burden, especially if they are willing to renounce their U.S. citizenship. Dinesh, maybe he was doing that when he thought Trump was -- no, that wouldn't make sense, because his taxes wouldn't go up under Trump. So how is this going to affect American workers having this guy so close to the White House?"
