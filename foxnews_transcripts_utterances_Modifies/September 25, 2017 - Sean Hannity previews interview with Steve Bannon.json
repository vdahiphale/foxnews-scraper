They're kneeling. They're standing. They're locking arms. What's next, downward dog? Some players kneeled for the anthem in England, but stood for God Save the Queen, yeah, because the British Empire was so amazing it sent three millions Africans into slavery. The players stood for the most imperialist empire of all time. I am officially outraged. I now protest the protesters. See how easy that was? Some Redskins took a knee. So they're fine with what's on their helmet but not the flag. Maybe because this issue has only one extra ingredient: Trump. How about those Raiders? Their emblem is a pirate. I'm not sure, but I bet pirates weren't community organizers.  So kneeling is now a protest against racism. Others say it disrespects the flag. Others see it as a time to stretch their quads. That's LeSean McCoy, stretching during the anthem. He got 21 yards on 14 carries. So keep stretching, champ.  Now this all started with Colin. Nancy, can you help me with his last name?",

You run a restaurant and a waiter starts chanting, \"meat is murder,\" you're going to fire him. That's how bosses think. Believe me, I know.   So you notice a trend here? What do the NFL, ESPN, the Emmys, the college campuses, the Democratic Party all had in common? They're all crippled by identity politics. This politics of separation replaces patriotism -- here, literally -- and wraps around your brain like a warm suffocating blanket, so goodbye football. Bow down to the new national pastime, identity politics. The worst team sport ever because we all lose. All right, Juan. How awesome is this?

They're kneeling. They're standing. They're locking arms. What's next, downward dog? Some players kneeled for the anthem in England, but stood for God Save the Queen, yeah, because the British Empire was so amazing it sent three millions Africans into slavery. The players stood for the most imperialist empire of all time. I am officially outraged. I now protest the protesters. See how easy that was? Some Redskins took a knee. So they're fine with what's on their helmet but not the flag. Maybe because this issue has only one extra ingredient: Trump. How about those Raiders? Their emblem is a pirate. I'm not sure, but I bet pirates weren't community organizers. So kneeling is now a protest against racism. Others say it disrespects the flag. Others see it as a time to stretch their quads. That's LeSean McCoy, stretching during the anthem. He got 21 yards on 14 carries. So keep stretching, champ. Now this all started with Colin. Nancy, can you help me with his last name?"

You run a restaurant and a waiter starts chanting, \"meat is murder,\" you're going to fire him. That's how bosses think. Believe me, I know. So you notice a trend here? What do the NFL, ESPN, the Emmys, the college campuses, the Democratic Party all had in common? They're all crippled by identity politics. This politics of separation replaces patriotism -- here, literally -- and wraps around your brain like a warm suffocating blanket, so goodbye football. Bow down to the new national pastime, identity politics. The worst team sport ever because we all lose. All right, Juan. How awesome is this?

You know, they want to keep this thing going. He's going to be himself. He's not going to go through some magic transformation because he became president. His personality, the way he is and focus as a businessman, that's where he comes from in his center is talking about that, what's practical. OK. Well, this is my business and this is what people are doing. This is what I would do. So he's giving, sort of, unsolicited advice. Does it have an impact? Sure. But is now people want to react and say, OK, we're not going to stand for the national anthem.

It's disrespectful. It's not your platform to do it. You can't do whatever you want at work. You have the right to do it, but the boss has a right to fire you.

Now, if you were to ask, why are you protesting? Well, I'm protesting because he called my mother -- he insulted my mother when he said SOB. I'm protesting because he insulted the franchise.

The people that are upset with him now I guess they're kneeling because they're upset. They don't support, you know, President Trump. I don't know. Again, let's talk about coming together as a country and about what unites us that makes this country so special, and accepting an open and inviting to so many people from all over the world that have made families here and careers and established, you know, for generations to be able to live and thrive here. So this is the wealthy, strong, powerful country, a loyal country that can help others in times of need like we've seen. That's the kind of country that I think we should be focusing on. And people are just letting -- they're kind of like -- I think their own inner insecure or upset about the ideology overshadow the purpose of the anthem, and that to me is sad that it's getting lost and sort of misused in this fashion."

And it's when you make promises in life and you give your word, you show a sense of urgency. My biggest complaint about all of government, Republicans and Democrats, is they're not serving the 50 million Americans in poverty, on Food Stamps, out of the labor force, 51-year low home ownership rates. These are real Americans. They're really suffering, and government is failing them at a spectacular level.

The issue is every time he does detonate a bomb or launch a missile, his scientists gain enough knowledge to be able to ultimately create the capability to put a nuke on an ICBM, and then we're living under a nuclear blackmail situation.

The difference is -- the difference is the progress. We have China and we have even the U.N., and we have Russia, to some extent, playing our game. That's new.

ALS is Lou Gehrig's disease. Remember, that's why everybody was dumping buckets of water over their head. Now we know what that's about. I was given an award there for some of my work. It was actually kind of like a wrestling belt. If you can see it right there. Kind of an unorthodox thing. I'm holding it up like a champion.
