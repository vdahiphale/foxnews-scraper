      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lecturing us about the weather again. Flash floods in D.C. on Monday, she said, \"What an act of God.\" No, they were the fault of Republicans for not passing her Green New Deal and giving her full power over the American economy. Just one problem with that though, actual scientists disagree with her read on that. We will talk to one just ahead. But first tonight quick. Here's a quiz for you. How many foreign nationals are living in the United States right now? Just kidding. It's a trick question. Nobody knows the answer. It could be 10 million, it could be 50 million. We'd just be guessing.  Pretty embarrassing for a supposedly advanced country not to know who lives within its borders. But honestly, we have no idea. For the last two years, the Trump administration has been trying to fix that by including a simple citizenship question on the 2020 census. Democrats hate the idea, of course.  If voters actually knew how many noncitizens lived in the United States, they might be less enthusiastic about giving free healthcare to illegal aliens.  So last month, liberals on the Supreme Court threw up roadblocks to adding the citizenship question to the census. The Attorney General though this week seem confident it's going to happen anyway.

Ten previous censuses in the United States have asked about citizenship, by the way, including the long form census in 2000, back when Bill Clinton was President. That was less than 20 years ago. Nobody at the time claimed it was unconstitutional to ask about citizenship, because it was not unconstitutional, and it still is not. The Constitution hasn't changed. What has changed is the Democratic Party. Suddenly, they're telling us it's illegal for the government to ask if you're a citizen or not. Why? You know why.

Of course, they have no idea it is 11 million. Nobody has counted the actual number of illegal immigrants in this country and Democrats want to make it illegal to try 11 million.  We'll be hearing that when your grandkids are old. Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joins us tonight. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. First, just a larger question. Democrats are claiming that this is racist, everything is racist. But the rhetoric on this citizenship question is particularly acidic and biting. Nancy Pelosi make America white again. What happens to the social fabric of our country when trusted leaders like Nancy Pelosi make grotesque and untrue race-based claims like that?

So white is just a construct. Many people crossing the border are whiter than I am. And so this artificial binary is masking the problem. And that is, the Democratic Party wants to change the demography of the United States because they feel that their message doesn't resonate with the existing population. So one of the strange things Tucker, it's not just that the analytic show there's more than 11 million people, we know that from a recent MIT and Yale study where it suggested the high number might be as high as 22 million and up, then that could be up to seven or eight to nine percent of the population.   But the Democrats know that because in 2006 to 2008, if you and I collated what Barack Obama said, what John Kerry said, what Hillary Clinton said, we would see that they were pretty much on record that they wanted legal, only immigration. So what changed from then until now? And what changes that they understand the numbers are so huge now that they see a potential constituency or actually an actual constituency. So we shouldn't listen to what they say, but how they act and they pander to the illegal alien community, because they know the numbers in truth are huge.",

Or if I use a fake identity or a fake social security number, I'm done at the Hoover Institution, that's a felony. If I am in a community and I say Federal law does not apply to me on matters of hand gun registration or EPA, that's impossible. But with sanctuary cities and open borders, we've actually given the legal exemption to residents over citizens. And that's why there's this pushback. And I think the Democrats are, as your guest said, they're terrified that the actual number which they know to be true, if that gets out, people are going to say, \"Wow, we've got a huge number of people.\" Twenty seven percent in California, current residents are not native born. That's over one in four Californian, and people say we know what happened to California. That's what's behind this, flipping red states into blue states.  So it's pretty cynical when you look all around that the Mexican government that wants the $60 billion along with the Central American governments in remittances. The employers want cheap labor, the ethnic industry wants a constituency to fuel their agendas. The Democratic Party wants a new blue state Electoral College, it's pretty cynical.

Since 1994, the United States has lost roughly four million manufacturing jobs. Tens of thousands of factories have closed since then. In 1992, our country had a $5 billion trade surplus with Mexico; today, it's $80 billion. Once again, Perot was right. When NAFTA was being debated, supporters argued that it would fix illegal immigration over the U.S.-Mexico border, Perot called that a myth. He predicted that illegal immigration would rise maybe dramatically. And once again, he was absolutely right. Washington was absolutely wrong. More likely they were just lying. In so many ways, America is a weaker, poorer, more divided, and more fractured country than it was when Perot first ran for President in 1992. We can't say Perot would have been a great President. Who knows? But if we'd listen to him a little more and not dismissed him, we'd probably be a stronger country today. Ross Perot, rest in peace. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller will be testifying before the Congress next week on his final report on the Russia investigation. But if Mueller's testimony tries to sway congressional Democrats toward impeachment, it will have to overcome the words of his team's own 400-page report. Aaron Mate is a journalist with \"The Nation\" magazine. He just wrote a piece arguing that the Mueller report substance, in fact, undercuts its own claims about Russian interference in the 2016 election. Aaron Mate joins us tonight. Aaron, thanks a lot for coming on. So you're arguing in this piece that the claims that the Mueller report makes about Russian interference are not substantiated by the report itself?

Now, when you've got that kind of power, I'm just wondering why they're allowing women on the offices at all. Right? How is it -- and then here's the other issue, if they're that powerful, Tucker, they're making too cold for women in the summer, but they're not doing it in the winter. And I'm wondering wouldn't that be the best time to freeze women out of the office place? So it all -- it's very -- I'm very confused, because I'm just a simple woman. And it's embarrassing, of course. Now we heard this first you'll recall, when Cynthia Nixon, the actress was running to be the Governor of New York. Wasn't that what she was running for and she obviously didn't win. But she brought it up that it was the most sexiest thing in the world. And it's because look, women do dress differently than men. But there's a solution to this. First of all, it's not a plot, right? It's not some weird conspiracy plot that they keep, you know, accusing Republicans of and conservatives. It would require maybe putting on a cardigan. And I'm thinking maybe that's why they don't get cold in the winter because they're wearing maybe heavier clothes. But the sexist thing here is this presumption, is this argument like this young woman made from \"The Atlantic,\" that it's because she gets sick, and it just highlights how the left and especially if you're immersed in identity politics, you don't think of anybody but yourself, because air conditioning makes life worth living. Charles Cooke over at \"National Review\" reminded us in 2003, the summer of 2003, almost 15,000 French people died because of the heat. And it affects, of course, the elderly, the infirm and here in America, the poor, of course, the Southern poor relying on air conditioning in order to actually live. But that young woman because I guess, she didn't want to tell anybody to replace the filters in the air conditioning, maybe she wouldn't get sick. And God forbid, should we have to on occasion, wear a blazer so that we don't get nailed by the air conditioning. It is worth thinking beyond ourselves when you're in a large office, not everyone is going to be happy. You're going to have to adapt and compromise sometimes, God forbid. But I think we can -- and this sexist argument though and behavior is in this presumption that you're a child, and everybody has got to listen to you and you've got to have everything exactly perfect for you. That's the sexist behavior. And maybe some of these young women will realize that that being independent and taking care of your environment and adapting gives you more power and more control over your environment in the long run.

      "sentences": "The Democratic candidates for President are on the road this week telling voters that the United States is an awful country. \"America's institutions are built on white supremacy,\" squeaked Beto O'Rourke in an event yesterday. Of all the lies these people tell -- and there are many -- this is the most absurd. In fact, the United States is the kindest, most open-minded place on the planet. The U.S. has done more for other people and received less in return than any nation in history by far. Americans like to help. It makes us feel good. Some of our deepest satisfaction as a country comes from watching penniless immigrants arrive on our shores, buy into our values and thrive. We call it the American dream and nothing makes us prouder. It was in that spirit that in 1992, the United States welcomed 10-year-old Ilhan Omar and her family. Omar was born in Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries. It was then ruled by a Marxist military dictatorship. When Omar was six, she and her parents and their six siblings fled a worsening Civil War and wound up in a refugee camp in Kenya. They spent four years there until America offered the family asylum here and let them settle in Minneapolis. Omar's father drove a taxi at first then got a job at the Post Office working for the government. Omar, meanwhile, grew up free in the world's richest country with all the bounty that that implies. She became a citizen, then went to work for the State University. A few years later, she became a Member of Congress elected by voters who are proud to see an immigrant succeed. Omar is now at the age of only 36, one of the most powerful women in America. It's an amazing story really. Only in this country could it have happened. Ilhan Omar has an awful lot to be grateful for, but she isn't grateful. Not at all. After everything America has done for Omar and for her family, she hates this country more than ever. In a recent piece in \"The Washington Post,\" the reporter put it this way, quote, \"In Omar's version, America isn't the big hearted country that saved her from a brutal war and a bleak refugee camp. It wasn't a meritocracy that helped her attend college or vaulted her into Congress. Instead, it was the country that had failed to live up to its founding ideals, a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants, refugees and minorities like her,\" end quote. If anything, that's an understatement. Omar isn't disappointed in America, she is enraged by it. Virtually every public statement she makes accuses Americans of bigotry and racism. \"This is an immoral country,\" she says. She has undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people. That should worry you and not just because Omar is now a sitting Member of Congress. Ilhan Omar is living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country. A system designed to strengthen America is instead undermining it. Some of the very people we try hardest to help have come to hate us passionately. Maybe that's our fault for asking too little of our immigrants. We aren't self-confident enough to make them assimilate so they never feel fully American. Or maybe the problem is deeper than that. Maybe we're importing people from places whose values are simply in antithetical to ours. Who knows what the problem is, but there is a problem and whatever the cause, this cannot continue. It's not sustainable. No country can import large numbers of people who hate it and expect to survive. The Romans were the last to try that with predictable results. So be grateful for Ilhan Omar, annoying as she is. She's a living fire alarm, a warning to the rest of us we better change our immigration system immediately. Or else. We want to end tonight with some good news. Last night we told you about Ed Henry and his decision to save his sister, Colleen's life by donating some of his liver. Tonight we're happy to report -- thrilled to report -- that the surgery has taken place. It was a success. They are both now recovering. Godspeed to both of them. Ed and his sister, Colleen will be grateful when he's back here at Fox. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. The show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Have a great night. Sean Hannity is next.

Just one problem with that though, actual scientists disagree with her read on that. We will talk to one just ahead. But first tonight quick. Here's a quiz for you. How many foreign nationals are living in the United States right now? Just kidding. It's a trick question. Nobody knows the answer. It could be 10 million, it could be 50 million. We'd just be guessing. Pretty embarrassing for a supposedly advanced country not to know who lives within its borders. But honestly, we have no idea. For the last two years, the Trump administration has been trying to fix that by including a simple citizenship question on the 2020 census. Democrats hate the idea, of course. If voters actually knew how many noncitizens lived in the United States, they might be less enthusiastic about giving free healthcare to illegal aliens. So last month, liberals on the Supreme Court threw up roadblocks to adding the citizenship question to the census. The Attorney General though this week seem confident it's going to happen anyway.

What has changed is the Democratic Party. Suddenly, they're telling us it's illegal for the government to ask if you're a citizen or not. Why? You know why. The same reason they give for objecting to everything. It's racist."

Whenever everyone on television, particularly on the left is repeating the same factoid, it is almost by definition, totally untrue. And this is no exception. How do they know it is 11 million? Of course, they have no idea it is 11 million. Nobody has counted the actual number of illegal immigrants in this country and Democrats want to make it illegal to try 11 million. We'll be hearing that when your grandkids are old. Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joins us tonight. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. First, just a larger question. Democrats are claiming that this is racist, everything is racist. But the rhetoric on this citizenship question is particularly acidic and biting. Nancy Pelosi make America white again. What happens to the social fabric of our country when trusted leaders like Nancy Pelosi make grotesque and untrue race-based claims like that? How badly does it hurt this country?"

So white is just a construct. Many people crossing the border are whiter than I am. And so this artificial binary is masking the problem. And that is, the Democratic Party wants to change the demography of the United States because they feel that their message doesn't resonate with the existing population. So one of the strange things Tucker, it's not just that the analytic show there's more than 11 million people, we know that from a recent MIT and Yale study where it suggested the high number might be as high as 22 million and up, then that could be up to seven or eight to nine percent of the population. But the Democrats know that because in 2006 to 2008, if you and I collated what Barack Obama said, what John Kerry said, what Hillary Clinton said, we would see that they were pretty much on record that they wanted legal, only immigration. So what changed from then until now? And what changes that they understand the numbers are so huge now that they see a potential constituency or actually an actual constituency. So we shouldn't listen to what they say, but how they act and they pander to the illegal alien community, because they know the numbers in truth are huge."
    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "It is. And it is part of a -- I think it's even a Western globalized phenomenon that citizenship doesn't mean much anymore. That residency is all you need, that we blur the distinction. So we have local elections in which illegal aliens vote. But if you come into the airport, or one of our viewers does without a passport, Tucker, he's in real trouble. Or if I use a fake identity or a fake social security number, I'm done at the Hoover Institution, that's a felony. If I am in a community and I say Federal law does not apply to me on matters of hand gun registration or EPA, that's impossible. But with sanctuary cities and open borders, we've actually given the legal exemption to residents over citizens. And that's why there's this pushback. And I think the Democrats are, as your guest said, they're terrified that the actual number which they know to be true, if that gets out, people are going to say, \"Wow, we've got a huge number of people.\" Twenty seven percent in California, current residents are not native born. That's over one in four Californian, and people say we know what happened to California. That's what's behind this, flipping red states into blue states. So it's pretty cynical when you look all around that the Mexican government that wants the $60 billion along with the Central American governments in remittances. The employers want cheap labor, the ethnic industry wants a constituency to fuel their agendas. The Democratic Party wants a new blue state Electoral College, it's pretty cynical. And the only person that has no constituency is your average American middle class voter."

We've also spent more than $5 trillion on wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia while continuing to provide free defense for Europe. We are not a lot safer for all of that money.

Since 1994, the United States has lost roughly four million manufacturing jobs. Tens of thousands of factories have closed since then. In 1992, our country had a $5 billion trade surplus with Mexico; today, it's $80 billion. Once again, Perot was right. When NAFTA was being debated, supporters argued that it would fix illegal immigration over the U.S.-Mexico border, Perot called that a myth. He predicted that illegal immigration would rise maybe dramatically. And once again, he was absolutely right. Washington was absolutely wrong. More likely they were just lying. In so many ways, America is a weaker, poorer, more divided, and more fractured country than it was when Perot first ran for President in 1992. We can't say Perot would have been a great President. Who knows? But if we'd listen to him a little more and not dismissed him, we'd probably be a stronger country today. Ross Perot, rest in peace.

The second aspect of that being this troll farm being shown to be -- have nothing to do with the Russian government. And there are many more sort of disingenuous examples and glaring holes like that.

According to Mueller account, Assange would have announced that he had received those stolen e-mails from Guccifer 2.0 before Assange ever communicated with Guccifer 2.0 and well before those e-mails were supposedly transferred to him by Guccifer 2.0, which Robert Mueller can't even assert as for sure happened, so there's a lot of holes in his entire account."

And we have students at this school who are black Americans, who are Native American descent, who are Mesoamerican, and they see that every day when you walk into school to be in their face that this is who you are, you're a slave, you are to be murdered because you are standing up against, well, the Americans taking over your territory, that's Indian affairs."

I don't know what that has to do with any of this actually. But that's not what the mural says. The mural is not celebrating the murder of anyone actually, it was painted by, as you know, a communist who later move back to the Soviet Union, who was trying to highlight the downside, you know, the other side of Washington's legacy. So he is trying to be historically accurate, which I think no one would dispute that it is. But the broader question is, it's art. It's being destroyed, because the left doesn't like the message.

When she fell the straw pierced her eye and went into her brain. The coroner in the case said the straw was a danger because it was fixed in place and being metal had no flexibility. He told \"The Sun\" newspaper quote, \"It seems the main problem here is if the lid hadn't been in place, the straw would have moved away.\" Falling on the things is of course not an uncommon cause of death or injury.

In fact, sometimes Tucker, I think they took that and after they burned the book, they decided well, let's just double down on weaponizing this. Every single event is being used like this is going to continue to be used and I'll tell you why. Because people don't know what happened before and the weather. If you don't know what happened before, you know they all say, you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything. You'll fall for this stuff and a lot of people say, \"This is the worst thing I've ever seen.\" Now, she is talking about that particular situation in Washington, D.C. and she is probably unaware of July 4th, 1969 in Northeast Ohio; July 1977 with the Johnstown flood in Pennsylvania; and this is going on across the board, and it's going to continue, we're going into hurricane season, right?

Maybe that's part of the design here that there's more food, people's prosperity is going up, you know, life expectancy is going up. Climate deaths are going down. I just don't understand -- and look, I tell folks all the time, don't believe me, go look for yourself. I don't know what's happened to curiosity today. All right. There are a lot of honest people on the other side of the issue that I know. I see what they're looking at. I believe that they over attribute to CO2.

So they want to set up things that are going to make sure that you know, the general problems that are existential threats, and then you know, the economic and wage divide. Those things have to remain, Tucker. And it's because of the politics of few people, they view us as expendable.

Now, when you've got that kind of power, I'm just wondering why they're allowing women on the offices at all. Right? How is it -- and then here's the other issue, if they're that powerful, Tucker, they're making too cold for women in the summer, but they're not doing it in the winter. And I'm wondering wouldn't that be the best time to freeze women out of the office place? So it all -- it's very -- I'm very confused, because I'm just a simple woman. And it's embarrassing, of course. Now we heard this first you'll recall, when Cynthia Nixon, the actress was running to be the Governor of New York. Wasn't that what she was running for and she obviously didn't win. But she brought it up that it was the most sexiest thing in the world. And it's because look, women do dress differently than men. But there's a solution to this. First of all, it's not a plot, right? It's not some weird conspiracy plot that they keep, you know, accusing Republicans of and conservatives. It would require maybe putting on a cardigan. And I'm thinking maybe that's why they don't get cold in the winter because they're wearing maybe heavier clothes. But the sexist thing here is this presumption, is this argument like this young woman made from \"The Atlantic,\" that it's because she gets sick, and it just highlights how the left and especially if you're immersed in identity politics, you don't think of anybody but yourself, because air conditioning makes life worth living. Charles Cooke over at \"National Review\" reminded us in 2003, the summer of 2003, almost 15,000 French people died because of the heat. And it affects, of course, the elderly, the infirm and here in America, the poor, of course, the Southern poor relying on air conditioning in order to actually live. But that young woman because I guess, she didn't want to tell anybody to replace the filters in the air conditioning, maybe she wouldn't get sick. And God forbid, should we have to on occasion, wear a blazer so that we don't get nailed by the air conditioning. It is worth thinking beyond ourselves when you're in a large office, not everyone is going to be happy. You're going to have to adapt and compromise sometimes, God forbid. But I think we can -- and this sexist argument though and behavior is in this presumption that you're a child, and everybody has got to listen to you and you've got to have everything exactly perfect for you. That's the sexist behavior. And maybe some of these young women will realize that that being independent and taking care of your environment and adapting gives you more power and more control over your environment in the long run.

      "utterance": "The Democratic candidates for President are on the road this week telling voters that the United States is an awful country. \"America's institutions are built on white supremacy,\" squeaked Beto O'Rourke in an event yesterday. Of all the lies these people tell -- and there are many -- this is the most absurd. In fact, the United States is the kindest, most open-minded place on the planet. The U.S. has done more for other people and received less in return than any nation in history by far. Americans like to help. It makes us feel good. Some of our deepest satisfaction as a country comes from watching penniless immigrants arrive on our shores, buy into our values and thrive. We call it the American dream and nothing makes us prouder. It was in that spirit that in 1992, the United States welcomed 10-year-old Ilhan Omar and her family. Omar was born in Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries. It was then ruled by a Marxist military dictatorship. When Omar was six, she and her parents and their six siblings fled a worsening Civil War and wound up in a refugee camp in Kenya. They spent four years there until America offered the family asylum here and let them settle in Minneapolis. Omar's father drove a taxi at first then got a job at the Post Office working for the government. Omar, meanwhile, grew up free in the world's richest country with all the bounty that that implies. She became a citizen, then went to work for the State University. A few years later, she became a Member of Congress elected by voters who are proud to see an immigrant succeed. Omar is now at the age of only 36, one of the most powerful women in America. It's an amazing story really. Only in this country could it have happened. Ilhan Omar has an awful lot to be grateful for, but she isn't grateful. Not at all. After everything America has done for Omar and for her family, she hates this country more than ever. In a recent piece in \"The Washington Post,\" the reporter put it this way, quote, \"In Omar's version, America isn't the big hearted country that saved her from a brutal war and a bleak refugee camp. It wasn't a meritocracy that helped her attend college or vaulted her into Congress. Instead, it was the country that had failed to live up to its founding ideals, a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants, refugees and minorities like her,\" end quote. If anything, that's an understatement. Omar isn't disappointed in America, she is enraged by it. Virtually every public statement she makes accuses Americans of bigotry and racism. \"This is an immoral country,\" she says. She has undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people. That should worry you and not just because Omar is now a sitting Member of Congress. Ilhan Omar is living proof that the way we practice immigration has become dangerous to this country. A system designed to strengthen America is instead undermining it. Some of the very people we try hardest to help have come to hate us passionately. Maybe that's our fault for asking too little of our immigrants. We aren't self-confident enough to make them assimilate so they never feel fully American. Or maybe the problem is deeper than that. Maybe we're importing people from places whose values are simply in antithetical to ours. Who knows what the problem is, but there is a problem and whatever the cause, this cannot continue. It's not sustainable. No country can import large numbers of people who hate it and expect to survive. The Romans were the last to try that with predictable results. So be grateful for Ilhan Omar, annoying as she is. She's a living fire alarm, a warning to the rest of us we better change our immigration system immediately. Or else. We want to end tonight with some good news. Last night we told you about Ed Henry and his decision to save his sister, Colleen's life by donating some of his liver. Tonight we're happy to report -- thrilled to report -- that the surgery has taken place. It was a success. They are both now recovering. Godspeed to both of them. Ed and his sister, Colleen will be grateful when he's back here at Fox. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. The show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Have a great night. Sean Hannity is next.
