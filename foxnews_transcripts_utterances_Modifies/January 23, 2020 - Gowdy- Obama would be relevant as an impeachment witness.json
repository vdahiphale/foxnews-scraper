      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We begin tonight, a Fox News alert. We begin with major breaking news. We were right yet again.  Look at this. In a letter to the FISA court, the Department of Justice admitted that at least two of their applications against Trump campaign associate Carter Page lacked probable cause and that its surveillance of Page should not have continued. A stunning admission of guilt that FISA abuse occurred, illicit spying occurred, and the rights of not only an innocent American were trampled, but that means all of the spying on a candidate, transition team and president -- yes, that was happening too.  But, we, first, will have all the details coming up. At this hour, yes, the liar from California is continuing to hoist himself on \"We, the American people\". Here it is. 9:00 p.m. in the D.C. swamp, 6:00 p.m. out on the West Coast, and the Schumer-Schiff sham show is still going on.  After hours -- I mean, this is so painful -- and hours and hours of mindless, endless repetition, babbling, here's what we learned today: Nothing. We've learned absolutely nothing. Zero new revelations. None. No new arguments. Zero. No new developments whatsoever.  It's the exact same Schumer-Schiff sham show over, and, ba, ba, ba, ba -- and over and over. Now, here's what's getting interesting. It's actually, in a weird way, and we'll do all the watching for you so you don't have to suffer and remind you every night. But what's remarkable about this is now they're running out of things to say.  So, what do they do? After repeating themselves endlessly, because there's nothing new to add, well, then they went back. Remember they had hearsay witnesses and opinion witnesses? They brought back some of the old testimony from the opinion witnesses like the Harvard law professor. That guy.   He once wrote that President Trump should be impeached for tweeting out the phrase \"fake news\". He was brought back today. They rehashed old statements from all of the hearsay opinions, non-fact, non-relevant witnesses, all that hate Trump or have political disagreements. They got so desperate today to fill the time. They even went back and read from the Mueller report, the one that vindicated President Trump. Now, I've been in talk radio for 31 years. I love my home, my Fox home year, my 24th year.   All these years, I was a kid listening -- grew up listening to the pioneers of talk radio -- Barry Farber, John Sawyer, Barry Gray, Gene Burns, Jerry Williams, David Brudnoy, all these amazing people. Anyway, and I -- I would listen constantly. My parents yelling at me all the time, turn the radio off. And I'd just say, OK, they go back in their room, I'd turn it back on again. And when a new host, for example, you can hear this, but you're compelled to listen, like you'll hear hosts like, all of a sudden, OK, well, we have one open line, and what, and here's the number, and in three seconds later, here's the number -- there are no calls and they're struggling. And I'd hear it and it's painful to listen to. I've heard it many times.  As a matter of fact, it actually happened to one guy that we don't like on the show, Alec Baldwin. This turns out to be the greatest radio tape, not on purpose. He was trying out, he's tried out twice for a radio show, he walked out of one show when it was me and Mark Levin tag-teaming him, and he walked out.   Then he went to our -- my affiliate in Philadelphia, WPHT, and we have the tape. This is all real. We're not making this up -- the best radio in the history of radio. Listen.",

But, of course, of course, Vladimir knows about the compromising material. That's almost as good the Baldwin tape. It's a toss up, right? Without a doubt, the congenital liar, compromised, corrupt Adam Schiff is like the perfect mascot for just how ugly radical dishonest this do-nothing Democratic Party is coming, 285 days, you're the final juror. Oh thank goodness, the American people get to weigh in on this. You get to shock the world again, I hope you do. His elaborate publicity stunt in the Senate, it's a disaster. How do we know? Well, thankfully, to all of you, we mean this everyday, you made us number one in cable news by far again last night. Thank you. We can't do it without you. The TV ratings are horrific. ABC, CBS, NBC, ABC and CBS and NBC -- 1.2 million total viewers. That is an unmitigated disaster, with less than 300,000 in the, quote, key demo. But they're sticking with their regularly scheduled programs during primetime, of course, they don't want to lose any more money.  And earlier, CBS News, they cut their impeachment coverage short to run the soap operas. Let's get back to making money. American people tuning out loudly. They're not even watching fake news CNN and conspiracy TV MS you know Rachel Maddow's Area 51 conspiracy channel. They're not watching it the way you would think, oh my gosh, it's impeachment. Most people know how this ends, that's why. So lawmakers are witnessing the Schumer Schiff sham show on Capitol Hill. According to reports, senators are struggling to stay awake. It's the best part of all this. Elizabeth Warren spotted playing a game on a piece of paper. Dianne Feinstein left the trial over an hour early. Area 51 conspiracy theorist Roswell Rachel Maddow and her well panel of conspiracy theorists, they're angry. They're pleading now, begging the Democrats, their friends in the Senate, please pay attention, fake it, fake enthusiasm for the sake of the country, fake it. Wow. After all, she's been lying to her viewers for three years, just like the congenital liar. First, those Russia collusion, the hoax. Now, she's filling her viewers heads with these far-fetched fantasies about Trump in Ukraine -- more lies, more propaganda, more false hope, and the viewers are about to be let down spectacularly all over again. Now, unlike MSDNC, fake news CNN, they're obsessed -- by the way, there are some guys on fake news CNN, Humpty-Dumpty and his -- I don't know Humpty Dumpty and want to be some guy named Oliver, they stalked us. They should focus on their own failing network and their own failing shows. We have been right every step of the way. They should report that. Tonight, I could easily cut through all the B.S. and tell you the truth, now I'm getting serious, because this is hurting the country. Funny but serious.  We know how this ends. We know the president will be acquitted. They are helping him. At this hour, 45 Republicans are ready to dismiss all these stupid charges by doing some pretty basic math. That means there are not anywhere near the 67 votes that would be required to convict, with just five more votes, this charade will immediately come to an end. And now, the Democrats, they have managed to offend at least one of those swing votes and that would be Senator Lisa Murkowski. Yes, I think Donald Trump helped Alaska and with opening up oil there helps her state. She's angry, rightfully so, the House impeachment managers accuse the Senate of a cover-up. Now, you have representatives, you have senators. There's a few weak Republican senators that are probably still wavering. You need to let your senator know how you feel about you -- their decision here, that they should not be validating what has been a corrupt, unconstitutional crisis that they are putting this country to, an ordeal, it is hurting the country. This article of impeachment is a farce. It's all politics. They have hated Donald Trump and that's all they've done every second, minute, hour of every hour day for three long years. And by the way, no crimes, no misdemeanor, there's no bribery, no reason. The House didn't even bother to subpoena the so-called witnesses that they're saying the Senate must subpoena. If you make a crime out of going to the courts when there's a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch and you go to the judicial branch, and you say, oh, we're invoking executive privilege which can be traced back to George Washington, you'd be destroying the power of the presidency and spitting on the Constitution. That's serious. And it's clear that the Schumer Schiff sham show is nothing more than partisan hackery and revenge. They have been dreaming about impeachment since 2016. If I had time, I'd run the tape again.  \"Washington Post\" announced that the campaign to impeach Donald Trump began 19 minutes after his inauguration. Tonight, this insane, concocted political stunt. They put this country through for three years is long enough. How about working for the people of this country. You're supposed to be public servants. Do something to make us more safe, more secure, more prosperous, more jobs, do something. This has got to end. The American people, the ultimate jurors, you get to shock the world in 285 days. You will be the ultimate jury. I hope you shocked the world again and you don't reward what they've done to this country for three years, because as we speak we are watching a tale of two Americas here. You got the president racking up and the last week and a half, one major accomplishment after another. Look at these accomplishments, record breaking, new trade deals, $220 billion with China, farmers, manufacturers, auto workers, energy sector, service sector, Japan, Europe, Mexico, Canada. Next week is expected to release a huge new plan in the Middle East. You had a great couple of days in Davos, envy of the world, our economy, record low unemployment, lowest since '69, every American benefiting, every demographic. What have the Democrats done to improve the lives of anybody? Nothing, not a single solitary thing at all. They have not done a thing, years of psychotic, non-stop rage, hate. Here's now is the author \"Guilt by Accusation\", Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Trump legal team member, Attorney Robert Ray. All right. Mr. Ray, we'll start with you tonight. We give a lot of time to our professor friend, don't diss on him. You're both part of the president's team. The part of this that makes me angry is they're hurting the country. The other part of it to be honest, it's just pure entertainment. I could have a lot of fun with this every night if it keeps going. But it's not good for the country.

They allow three solid days of un-objected to, hearsay and very often just political matters that have no bearing, even on the unconstitutional charges of obstruction and abuse.

Here now, the author of the number one New York Times bestseller, \"Unfreedom of the Press\", he hosts a number one show on Sunday nights, 8:00, \"Life, Liberty, & Levin\" right here on the Fox News Channel, actually syndicated radio host. I call him the great one. I don't even have to ask you a question. Just go. Whatever you brought with you, go. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY, & LEVIN\":  Here's what I brought with me. You don't need 24 hours and three days to make a case if you have a case. You know Potter Stewart was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and they had ruled on this issue of pornography and he was asked, what's the definition of pornography? And he said, I don't know it, but I know it when I see it. Well, abuse of power, what's the definition of abuse of power? No standards, it's whatever the Democrats say. It's their pornography, and Adam Smith -- Adam Schiff is the pornographer. Abuse of power, it just means whatever the Democrats say it means. There's no standard. There's no definition. In all these hours, all this talk, they have not explained -- forget about Trump, what's the definition of abuse of power? Because every president has theoretically abused power -- Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson -- look, the Louisiana Purchase was done without authorized funding, abuse of power. We can go and add -- John Adams put people in prison under the Sedition Act, abuse of power. FDR used the IRS. FDR, the internment of Japanese- Americans. JFK used the IRS and the FBI. LBJ, same thing in the CIA. Go down the list, all these great Democrats. Woodrow Wilson resegregated the civil service, abuse of power, abuse of power. That's ridiculous. It's pornography in the hands of the Democrats. It's whatever they think it is, and not once have they explained the standard for abuse of power. Obstructing Congress, you know what obstructing Congress is to these Democrats? Separation of powers, that's not obstructing Congress. Here's my question. Where's the smoking gun? All this bull that's been going on day in and day -- the testimony where's the witness under penalty of perjury who said the president of the United States committed treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors, the president of the United States quid pro quo, the president United States committed a crime? They said the opposite and they called all the witnesses over there in the House of Representatives. Where's the smoking gun document? All the talk about no documents, they had hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. They don't have one that incriminates the president United States, not one. That's why they're spewing for 24 hours and three days. Now, we want to talk about interfering in an election. They say Donald Trump interfere in an election. First of all, don't we have a right to know if Joe Biden and his son are as corrupt as hell, that Joe Biden as vice president, they've been corrupt, that Joe Biden, if he's elected president, God forbid, could be blackmailed? Don't we want to know this? Why is he the bubble band? Donald Trump's been investigated from day one by committees, by prosecutors, by reporters, they don't worry about that. Let's talk about interfering in the 2020 election. What did Schiff -- what did Schiff and the other mobsters say on the floor of the Senate? What did they say? We don't want Trump to get elected president again. We must stop him. In other words, they want to interfere in the 2020 election and prevent the Republican Party from nominating their president for a second term as president of the United States. It's right out there. They're interfering in the election and senators, they're interfering in your election. Schumer has been collaborating with these guys. He's calling all these votes for the purpose of taking over the majority. Why do you think Nadler, low I.Q. Nadler was on the floor the Senate the other day saying you're involved in obstruction, you're not upholding the Constitution, because they want to take the majority. This is about also not only defeating Trump in 2020, but defeating the Senate. Now, here's mostly what's going on, when you hear their arguments, when you hear their argument, they're projecting motives. They're not arguing evidence. They're projecting motives. The president must have meant. This must have meant that. When he did -- he must have done that. I had the damn phone call right here the transcript. The president United States talking to the president of Ukraine. He knows there's at least people listening it. You think he's going to sit there and commit an impeachable offense with 12 people listening in? In this phone call, there's no interference in any campaign, there's no threats of withholding military aid in exchange for anything. There's no campaign of pressure. Campaign of pressure they say -- the only one who doesn't aware of it was the president of the Ukraine and the foreign minister of Ukraine. There's never been any campaign of pressure. Let me just say this, America -- these Democrats have destroyed the Constitution, the impeachment clause, they're trying to destroy separation of powers. They're trying to choose the Republican nominee for president in 2020. They're trying to take over the Senate. That's what's going on. The Senate has a responsibility to protect the American people from the House, from the Democrats. That's their constitutional responsibility. This president hasn't violated the Constitution, not once. He hasn't violated any federal statute, not once. He's complied with every federal court order, every one. He's not committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the pornographers over there in the House -- abuse of power, obstruction of Congress, they're the ones.

In a letter to the FISA court, the Department of Justice admitted that at least two of their applications against Trump campaign associate Carter Page lacked probable cause and that its surveillance of Page should not have continued. A stunning admission of guilt that FISA abuse occurred, illicit spying occurred, and the rights of not only an innocent American were trampled, but that means all of the spying on a candidate, transition team and president -- yes, that was happening too. But, we, first, will have all the details coming up. At this hour, yes, the liar from California is continuing to hoist himself on \"We, the American people\".

It's actually, in a weird way, and we'll do all the watching for you so you don't have to suffer and remind you every night. But what's remarkable about this is now they're running out of things to say. So, what do they do? After repeating themselves endlessly, because there's nothing new to add, well, then they went back. Remember they had hearsay witnesses and opinion witnesses? They brought back some of the old testimony from the opinion witnesses like the Harvard law professor. That guy. He once wrote that President Trump should be impeached for tweeting out the phrase \"fake news\". He was brought back today. They rehashed old statements from all of the hearsay opinions, non-fact, non-relevant witnesses, all that hate Trump or have political disagreements. They got so desperate today to fill the time. They even went back and read from the Mueller report, the one that vindicated President Trump. Now, I've been in talk radio for 31 years. I love my home, my Fox home year, my 24th year. All these years, I was a kid listening -- grew up listening to the pioneers of talk radio -- Barry Farber, John Sawyer, Barry Gray, Gene Burns, Jerry Williams, David Brudnoy, all these amazing people. Anyway, and I -- I would listen constantly. My parents yelling at me all the time, turn the radio off. And I'd just say, OK, they go back in their room, I'd turn it back on again. And when a new host, for example, you can hear this, but you're compelled to listen, like you'll hear hosts like, all of a sudden, OK, well, we have one open line, and what, and here's the number, and in three seconds later, here's the number -- there are no calls and they're struggling. And I'd hear it and it's painful to listen to. I've heard it many times. As a matter of fact, it actually happened to one guy that we don't like on the show, Alec Baldwin. This turns out to be the greatest radio tape, not on purpose. He was trying out, he's tried out twice for a radio show, he walked out of one show when it was me and Mark Levin tag-teaming him, and he walked out. Then he went to our -- my affiliate in Philadelphia, WPHT, and we have the tape. This is all real. We're not making this up -- the best radio in the history of radio. Listen."

Without a doubt, the congenital liar, compromised, corrupt Adam Schiff is like the perfect mascot for just how ugly radical dishonest this do-nothing Democratic Party is coming, 285 days, you're the final juror. Oh thank goodness, the American people get to weigh in on this. You get to shock the world again, I hope you do. His elaborate publicity stunt in the Senate, it's a disaster. How do we know? Well, thankfully, to all of you, we mean this everyday, you made us number one in cable news by far again last night. Thank you. We can't do it without you. The TV ratings are horrific. ABC, CBS, NBC, ABC and CBS and NBC -- 1.2 million total viewers. That is an unmitigated disaster, with less than 300,000 in the, quote, key demo. But they're sticking with their regularly scheduled programs during primetime, of course, they don't want to lose any more money. And earlier, CBS News, they cut their impeachment coverage short to run the soap operas. Let's get back to making money. American people tuning out loudly. They're not even watching fake news CNN and conspiracy TV MS you know Rachel Maddow's Area 51 conspiracy channel. They're not watching it the way you would think, oh my gosh, it's impeachment. Most people know how this ends, that's why. So lawmakers are witnessing the Schumer Schiff sham show on Capitol Hill. According to reports, senators are struggling to stay awake. It's the best part of all this. Elizabeth Warren spotted playing a game on a piece of paper. Dianne Feinstein left the trial over an hour early. Area 51 conspiracy theorist Roswell Rachel Maddow and her well panel of conspiracy theorists, they're angry. They're pleading now, begging the Democrats, their friends in the Senate, please pay attention, fake it, fake enthusiasm for the sake of the country, fake it. Wow. After all, she's been lying to her viewers for three years, just like the congenital liar. First, those Russia collusion, the hoax. Now, she's filling her viewers heads with these far-fetched fantasies about Trump in Ukraine -- more lies, more propaganda, more false hope, and the viewers are about to be let down spectacularly all over again. Now, unlike MSDNC, fake news CNN, they're obsessed -- by the way, there are some guys on fake news CNN, Humpty-Dumpty and his -- I don't know Humpty Dumpty and want to be some guy named Oliver, they stalked us. They should focus on their own failing network and their own failing shows. We have been right every step of the way. They should report that. Tonight, I could easily cut through all the B.S. and tell you the truth, now I'm getting serious, because this is hurting the country. Funny but serious. We know how this ends. We know the president will be acquitted. They are helping him. At this hour, 45 Republicans are ready to dismiss all these stupid charges by doing some pretty basic math. That means there are not anywhere near the 67 votes that would be required to convict, with just five more votes, this charade will immediately come to an end. And now, the Democrats, they have managed to offend at least one of those swing votes and that would be Senator Lisa Murkowski. Yes, I think Donald Trump helped Alaska and with opening up oil there helps her state. She's angry, rightfully so, the House impeachment managers accuse the Senate of a cover-up. Now, you have representatives, you have senators. There's a few weak Republican senators that are probably still wavering. You need to let your senator know how you feel about you -- their decision here, that they should not be validating what has been a corrupt, unconstitutional crisis that they are putting this country to, an ordeal, it is hurting the country. This article of impeachment is a farce. It's all politics. They have hated Donald Trump and that's all they've done every second, minute, hour of every hour day for three long years. And by the way, no crimes, no misdemeanor, there's no bribery, no reason. The House didn't even bother to subpoena the so-called witnesses that they're saying the Senate must subpoena. If you make a crime out of going to the courts when there's a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch and you go to the judicial branch, and you say, oh, we're invoking executive privilege which can be traced back to George Washington, you'd be destroying the power of the presidency and spitting on the Constitution. That's serious. And it's clear that the Schumer Schiff sham show is nothing more than partisan hackery and revenge. They have been dreaming about impeachment since 2016. If I had time, I'd run the tape again. \"Washington Post\" announced that the campaign to impeach Donald Trump began 19 minutes after his inauguration. Tonight, this insane, concocted political stunt. They put this country through for three years is long enough. How about working for the people of this country. You're supposed to be public servants. Do something to make us more safe, more secure, more prosperous, more jobs, do something. This has got to end. The American people, the ultimate jurors, you get to shock the world in 285 days. You will be the ultimate jury. I hope you shocked the world again and you don't reward what they've done to this country for three years, because as we speak we are watching a tale of two Americas here. You got the president racking up and the last week and a half, one major accomplishment after another. Look at these accomplishments, record breaking, new trade deals, $220 billion with China, farmers, manufacturers, auto workers, energy sector, service sector, Japan, Europe, Mexico, Canada. Next week is expected to release a huge new plan in the Middle East. You had a great couple of days in Davos, envy of the world, our economy, record low unemployment, lowest since '69, every American benefiting, every demographic. What have the Democrats done to improve the lives of anybody? Nothing, not a single solitary thing at all. They have not done a thing, years of psychotic, non-stop rage, hate.

They allow three solid days of un-objected to, hearsay and very often just political matters that have no bearing, even on the unconstitutional charges of obstruction and abuse. But the defense has to sit there quietly and just listen without objection. People say all the time, oh, in a real trial -- in a real trial, there'd be objections and 90 percent of what was on television today was never be allowed in by a judge."

By the way, it's the -- it's the second anniversary today. I've got to say congratulations to quid pro quo Joe. Second anniversary of him admitting that he leveraged and shook down the country of Ukraine with a billion taxpayer dollars to get a prosecutor he knew investigating his son in Ukraine fired for paying his zero experience Hunter millions of dollars.

So, if the vice president can make that assertion, then he is relevant as a witness, but so too is President Obama because I would want to know whether or not he had the authority of the president at the time he made that that pronouncement that there'll be no loan guarantees unless the prosecutor is fired.

Wow, Jim Comey sound one of the -- signed one of those. Now, what does that mean? Premeditated fraud on FISA court, not only did they use Carter Page and take away his constitutional rights, but that gave them the backdoor to spying a presidential candidate, transition team and deep into the Trump presidency. This news comes from a newly declassified order from the court that handles FISA applications. This means the final two FISA warrants at least to spy and deny the rights of a U.S. citizen, the civil liberties tied to the Trump campaign for the spying that took place there -- spying, yes, the right word -- well, should never have happened. Joining us with the reaction, they've been a big part of our investigative team, our ensemble cast, FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter.

What we know is that the last two FISA applications signed by Rod Rosenstein, Director Comey and Andrew McCabe have now -- they've come out and said the DOJ, as well as the FISA court, these were not legitimate, they should have never been done. But it doesn't excuse the first two applications it says, they are continuing to investigate the first two applications and that would be going all the way back to September 2016 when they began to spy on Carter Page. And remember, Kevin Clinesmith, the attorney for the FBI, basically omitted significant information that Carter Page was actually working in supplying information to the CIA. He omitted that from those applications. He also altered the application.

They deceived the court, not just 17 major deceptions and omissions and errors, 51 of them all against Donald Trump.

Here now, the author of the number one New York Times bestseller, \"Unfreedom of the Press\", he hosts a number one show on Sunday nights, 8:00, \"Life, Liberty, & Levin\" right here on the Fox News Channel, actually syndicated radio host. I call him the great one. I don't even have to ask you a question. Just go. Whatever you brought with you, go. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY, & LEVIN\":  Here's what I brought with me. You don't need 24 hours and three days to make a case if you have a case. You know Potter Stewart was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and they had ruled on this issue of pornography and he was asked, what's the definition of pornography? And he said, I don't know it, but I know it when I see it. Well, abuse of power, what's the definition of abuse of power? No standards, it's whatever the Democrats say. It's their pornography, and Adam Smith -- Adam Schiff is the pornographer. Abuse of power, it just means whatever the Democrats say it means. There's no standard. There's no definition. In all these hours, all this talk, they have not explained -- forget about Trump, what's the definition of abuse of power? Because every president has theoretically abused power -- Lincoln, Washington, Jefferson -- look, the Louisiana Purchase was done without authorized funding, abuse of power. We can go and add -- John Adams put people in prison under the Sedition Act, abuse of power. FDR used the IRS. FDR, the internment of Japanese- Americans. JFK used the IRS and the FBI. LBJ, same thing in the CIA. Go down the list, all these great Democrats. Woodrow Wilson resegregated the civil service, abuse of power, abuse of power. That's ridiculous. It's pornography in the hands of the Democrats. It's whatever they think it is, and not once have they explained the standard for abuse of power. Obstructing Congress, you know what obstructing Congress is to these Democrats? Separation of powers, that's not obstructing Congress. Here's my question. Where's the smoking gun? All this bull that's been going on day in and day -- the testimony where's the witness under penalty of perjury who said the president of the United States committed treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors, the president of the United States quid pro quo, the president United States committed a crime? They said the opposite and they called all the witnesses over there in the House of Representatives. Where's the smoking gun document? All the talk about no documents, they had hundreds of thousands of pages of documents. They don't have one that incriminates the president United States, not one. That's why they're spewing for 24 hours and three days. Now, we want to talk about interfering in an election. They say Donald Trump interfere in an election. First of all, don't we have a right to know if Joe Biden and his son are as corrupt as hell, that Joe Biden as vice president, they've been corrupt, that Joe Biden, if he's elected president, God forbid, could be blackmailed? Don't we want to know this? Why is he the bubble band? Donald Trump's been investigated from day one by committees, by prosecutors, by reporters, they don't worry about that. Let's talk about interfering in the 2020 election. What did Schiff -- what did Schiff and the other mobsters say on the floor of the Senate? What did they say? We don't want Trump to get elected president again. We must stop him. In other words, they want to interfere in the 2020 election and prevent the Republican Party from nominating their president for a second term as president of the United States. It's right out there. They're interfering in the election and senators, they're interfering in your election. Schumer has been collaborating with these guys. He's calling all these votes for the purpose of taking over the majority. Why do you think Nadler, low I.Q. Nadler was on the floor the Senate the other day saying you're involved in obstruction, you're not upholding the Constitution, because they want to take the majority. This is about also not only defeating Trump in 2020, but defeating the Senate. Now, here's mostly what's going on, when you hear their arguments, when you hear their argument, they're projecting motives. They're not arguing evidence. They're projecting motives. The president must have meant. This must have meant that. When he did -- he must have done that. I had the damn phone call right here the transcript. The president United States talking to the president of Ukraine. He knows there's at least people listening it. You think he's going to sit there and commit an impeachable offense with 12 people listening in? In this phone call, there's no interference in any campaign, there's no threats of withholding military aid in exchange for anything. There's no campaign of pressure. Campaign of pressure they say -- the only one who doesn't aware of it was the president of the Ukraine and the foreign minister of Ukraine. There's never been any campaign of pressure. Let me just say this, America -- these Democrats have destroyed the Constitution, the impeachment clause, they're trying to destroy separation of powers. They're trying to choose the Republican nominee for president in 2020. They're trying to take over the Senate. That's what's going on. The Senate has a responsibility to protect the American people from the House, from the Democrats. That's their constitutional responsibility. This president hasn't violated the Constitution, not once. He hasn't violated any federal statute, not once. He's complied with every federal court order, every one. He's not committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. But the pornographers over there in the House -- abuse of power, obstruction of Congress, they're the ones. Maybe they ought to be expelled. Maybe we ought to start thinking about that. That's it."

The media got it wrong. They mocked him. Just like they laughed at the idea he could be president. All right. We're always be fair and balanced. We're not the hate-Trump media mob. We always seek the truth. And set your DVRs every night. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura, you got to look at that tweet. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
