The future of the country is at stake, nothing that big, 63 days, it's all in your hands, a decision that could not be any more stark. America is at a crossroads right now, we'll explain all of this tonight. Do we continue the path of economic success, peace through strength, the empowerment of the forgotten men and women? Or is your future going to be decided by a bunch of extreme far left Democrats that once socialism and there comes back and raise your taxes and observe the bureaucratic status quo, oh, yes, and impeach your president? The one you voted for.  Don't take my word for it, coming up tonight, we have exclusive video of Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saying that the Democrats want to impeach Trump in 2019.  Plus, we'll show you how other Senate Democrats -- they absolutely were unhinged today at the Kavanaugh hearing and they turned it into a circus. We'll also bring your breaking new developments, you will not get anywhere, Bruce Ohr, Christopher Steele, and yes, a connection to Robert Mueller and Robert Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. In other words, it's like one big, long, incestuous chain of connections.  And later, we have a story that will make your blood boil. Infamous social justice warrior Colin Kaepernick is now the brand-new face of a Nike ad campaign. So, sit tight, buckle up. It is time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue.",

And Senate hearings for Judge Kavanaugh are now underway. He is a strong, constitutional candidate, an originalist, a long, serious intellectual track record as a federal judge. He deserves a deliberate to robust hearing, but sadly, as we predicted on the show, Senate Democrats -- they are making a mockery out of what has been a very important process. In what is a coordinated show, a political grandstanding, Democrats tried and failed to stall the hearing just seconds into the Senate Judiciary Chairman Grassley's opening statement.

Let's see, Oprah Winfrey, Georgi Stephanopoulos, Katie Couric, Joyless Behar, and so many others.  Not a single, smelly Walmart Trump supporter or an irredeemable deplorable or somebody who clings to their god, gun, bibles and religion. Nobody in sight. How else do you celebrate a holiday for American workers out in the Hamptons with your favorite actors and so-called news hosts? I guess my invitation got lost in the mail. But in all seriousness, it just shows how incestuous members of the mainstream media, Hollywood, the Democrats really are, and let it be a clear warning, Democrats do not have any positive agenda to improve the lives for you, the American people, we smelly Walmart people.  In less than two years, President Trump has ushered in a new era of success. Look at the side of your screen. Four million new jobs, four million people off of food stamps. Thousands of new manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands, jobs Obama said would never come back. Unemployment claims a 50-year low. But Pelosi, Schumer, every Democrat running for office in November, they want to risk it all because of their overwhelming hatred of the president and their desire for power. This obsessive desire to see Trump fail shared by so many of their friends in news in the mainstream media, clearly acting as a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party.

Tonight, the plot thickens around Bruce Ohr and his efforts to spread Christopher Steele's Clinton bought and paid for phony, dirty, Russian dossier throughout the entire highest levels of our government and lying to you, the American people. Catherine Herridge not only reporting that the Ohr remained a close relationship with Steele, but he also fed Steele's dossier, let's see, to Andrew Weissmann. Remember, Weissmann is Robert Mueller's top deputy. \"The New York Times\" called him Robert Mueller's pit bull if you recall.  And in a case against Andersen Accounting, remember Weissmann's aggressive prosecution tactics, tens of thousands of your fellow Americans lost their jobs, a conviction overturned 9-0. It's hard to lose 9-0 in a Supreme Court. Weissmann responsible for the imprisonment of four Merrill Lynch executives for a year. Oh, that was overturned, too, by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He was excoriated by a judge for withholding exculpatory evidence. And you have Bruce Ohr, once the fourth highest ranking official in the DOJ, feeding the dirty Russian dossier to the man that would then go on to be Mueller's pit bull. And remember the exchanges between Steele and Ohr. Oh, I'm afraid. What if we're exposed? I hope the firewalls hold. Oh, and yes, did the special counsel get your messages? So, was Andrew Weissmann colluding? Was he conspiring? Why didn't Robert Mueller tell the American people about the context with Ohr and Christopher Steele, and why do we have to figure it out? Catherine Herridge did. And we also know that and unearthed handwritten note from Ohr after the election, let's see, listed Peter Strzok, and Lisa Page, and other FBI agent. The note reads, no prosecution yet, push the case ahead on M, which is Manafort, go back to Chris, which is Steele. And that's what they believe all of this means, Manafort is M, Christopher Steele is Christopher Steele. At the center of the entire government case against what is what we're unfolding here. Well, of course, taxes and et cetera. Finally tonight, there is one sign the Mueller investigation could be drawing to a right. We'll talk to Jay Sekulow. According to a report from The New York Times, the special counsel will accept written answers from President Trump to some questions surrounding the Russia probe. We're going to ask President Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, about that in a few moments. But, first, joining us now, it is now the number one best-selling book in the country, \"The Russian Hoax: The Elicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Welcome both of you. I want to get to the Mueller issue, let's start with the latest news.

Colin Kaepernick is back in the news, now he didn't make the roster of any pro team. He had three bad years before that. Nike is now making him the face of a new ad campaign, that is the subject of tonight's mini monologue. All right. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is not new to controversy. As a player, he frequently used the NFL as a public platform to protest what he called police brutality and what he perceive as America's ongoing oppression against minorities in the country. He famously refused to stand for the national anthem during games, leading others in on the field to do the same. Look at the socks he wore with police officers depicted as pigs. He wore it in practice. Even done a t- shirt featuring Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro during a press conference ahead of a game against the Miami Dolphins. Nike is now using Kaepernick to headline their new ad campaign and the words you see on your screen read, quote, \"believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.\" I would like to take a moment to remind Nike executives sacrificing everything looks like it's not a multimillionaire social justice warrior whose greatest feat of bravery kneeling on a football field and wearing those socks against our police officers. Instead, those who sacrifice everything can be found on the ground in Afghanistan as we speak. U.S. soldiers fighting and dying to keep this country safe. Fighting for a cause bigger than themselves. They can be found in the bravery and the courage of men and women that protect and serve police, firemen, first responders that run towards danger when we all run away. And they can also be found in graveyards all around the world from Normandy, to the Pacific, from Vietnam to Korea. All across the United States, there are millions of men and women who have really sacrificed everything for strangers they didn't even know. So the world, this country, could be a better safer freer place. There are plenty of heroes in this country that Nike could feature, but Castro, loving America, let's see. Cop hating, ex three year backup quarterback is not one of them. This week and we sent Tomi Lahren out to see what Californians thought about Nike's new ad, take a look.",

The future of the country is at stake, nothing that big, 63 days, it's all in your hands, a decision that could not be any more stark. America is at a crossroads right now, we'll explain all of this tonight. Do we continue the path of economic success, peace through strength, the empowerment of the forgotten men and women? Or is your future going to be decided by a bunch of extreme far left Democrats that once socialism and there comes back and raise your taxes and observe the bureaucratic status quo, oh, yes, and impeach your president? The one you voted for. Don't take my word for it, coming up tonight, we have exclusive video of Democratic leader Chuck Schumer saying that the Democrats want to impeach Trump in 2019. Plus, we'll show you how other Senate Democrats -- they absolutely were unhinged today at the Kavanaugh hearing and they turned it into a circus. We'll also bring your breaking new developments, you will not get anywhere, Bruce Ohr, Christopher Steele, and yes, a connection to Robert Mueller and Robert Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. In other words, it's like one big, long, incestuous chain of connections. And later, we have a story that will make your blood boil. Infamous social justice warrior Colin Kaepernick is now the brand-new face of a Nike ad campaign. So, sit tight, buckle up. It is time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

This was all orchestrated. Now, we have warned you many times obstructing the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is only one part of their agenda.

He wasn't calling for Trump's impeachment he wasn't doing that on the streets of New York, well, let's see, he was with Nancy Pelosi. And according to \"Politico\", oh, they were having a fancy soiree in the beautiful Hamptons of Long Island, spotted with many in the Hollywood and media elite. Let's see, Oprah Winfrey, Georgi Stephanopoulos, Katie Couric, Joyless Behar, and so many others. Not a single, smelly Walmart Trump supporter or an irredeemable deplorable or somebody who clings to their god, gun, bibles and religion. Nobody in sight. How else do you celebrate a holiday for American workers out in the Hamptons with your favorite actors and so-called news hosts? I guess my invitation got lost in the mail. But in all seriousness, it just shows how incestuous members of the mainstream media, Hollywood, the Democrats really are, and let it be a clear warning, Democrats do not have any positive agenda to improve the lives for you, the American people, we smelly Walmart people. In less than two years, President Trump has ushered in a new era of success. Look at the side of your screen. Four million new jobs, four million people off of food stamps. Thousands of new manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands, jobs Obama said would never come back. Unemployment claims a 50-year low. But Pelosi, Schumer, every Democrat running for office in November, they want to risk it all because of their overwhelming hatred of the president and their desire for power. This obsessive desire to see Trump fail shared by so many of their friends in news in the mainstream media, clearly acting as a propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. We have shown you for months the media goes from crisis to crisis to crisis, and what is their effort to take down the president a you all elected. That is succeeding. You might remember some of these moments. Take a look."

Tonight, the plot thickens around Bruce Ohr and his efforts to spread Christopher Steele's Clinton bought and paid for phony, dirty, Russian dossier throughout the entire highest levels of our government and lying to you, the American people. Catherine Herridge not only reporting that the Ohr remained a close relationship with Steele, but he also fed Steele's dossier, let's see, to Andrew Weissmann. Remember, Weissmann is Robert Mueller's top deputy. \"The New York Times\" called him Robert Mueller's pit bull if you recall. And in a case against Andersen Accounting, remember Weissmann's aggressive prosecution tactics, tens of thousands of your fellow Americans lost their jobs, a conviction overturned 9-0. It's hard to lose 9-0 in a Supreme Court. Weissmann responsible for the imprisonment of four Merrill Lynch executives for a year. Oh, that was overturned, too, by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He was excoriated by a judge for withholding exculpatory evidence. And you have Bruce Ohr, once the fourth highest ranking official in the DOJ, feeding the dirty Russian dossier to the man that would then go on to be Mueller's pit bull. And remember the exchanges between Steele and Ohr. Oh, I'm afraid. What if we're exposed? I hope the firewalls hold. Oh, and yes, did the special counsel get your messages? So, was Andrew Weissmann colluding? Was he conspiring? Why didn't Robert Mueller tell the American people about the context with Ohr and Christopher Steele, and why do we have to figure it out? Catherine Herridge did. And we also know that and unearthed handwritten note from Ohr after the election, let's see, listed Peter Strzok, and Lisa Page, and other FBI agent. The note reads, no prosecution yet, push the case ahead on M, which is Manafort, go back to Chris, which is Steele. And that's what they believe all of this means, Manafort is M, Christopher Steele is Christopher Steele. At the center of the entire government case against what is what we're unfolding here. Well, of course, taxes and et cetera. Finally tonight, there is one sign the Mueller investigation could be drawing to a right. We'll talk to Jay Sekulow. According to a report from The New York Times, the special counsel will accept written answers from President Trump to some questions surrounding the Russia probe. We're going to ask President Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, about that in a few moments. But, first, joining us now, it is now the number one best-selling book in the country, \"The Russian Hoax: The Elicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Welcome both of you. I want to get to the Mueller issue, let's start with the latest news. So, Christopher Steele and Bruce Ohr are communicating some 70 communications, Sara, between the two of them."

And remember, that was all a day before the AP broke their big story on Manafort. And because of that meeting, the FBI actually reported, reported that problem to the DOJ, and said that Andrew Weissmann set up a meeting with the AP to share information against our wishes and we are afraid that he is going to tear down our case. Now, the AP said they never shared anything with Weissmann and that Weissmann denies sharing anything with the AP. But now, it makes sense. He was being fed information by Bruce Ohr the whole time and he was moving Steele's information, possibly to Mueller. I mean, we don't know that yet, it's alleged.

There's no legal justification for asking them questions about a non-crime called collusion. So I think that Mueller finally concluded the obvious, that if I slap him with a subpoena, the president is going to file a motion to quash, and I, Robert Mueller, will lose in the federal courts.

It depends on the nature of the case, but I got to tell you something, the president has made two great picks, Neil Gorsuch, tremendous judge, now justice. Brett Kavanaugh who I have known for a long time is brilliant. He has been a great judge. If you want to know anything about Brett Kavanaugh, read his 312 opinions. That may be a good way to start. So, you saw theatrics today in the Senate, but at the end of the day, guess what happens? Judge Kavanaugh becomes Justice Kavanaugh as confirmed for the Supreme Court of the United States and the president gave a great selection with both of these justices.

There has been 30 other witnesses that the White House put forward to testify, there's been over 1.4 million pages of documents that have gone forward. So the idea that the special counsel has not been given access to information I think they would be readily admit that this has been a transparent investigation in a transparent inquiry. There is all of this media's been going on about what was said or what wasn't said, but let me tell you this. The president of the United States authorized his legal team, both his White House counsel and his private lawyers to engage this in a transparent basis. And that's has been done. This does need to come to an end. I mean, I think everybody in the country wants it to come to an end. I don't give dates and times. It needs to happen sooner rather than later. But look, at the end of the day, as I said, it's a process of negotiation, it's ongoing. I'm not going to disclose the nature of that. But there's been a lot of speculation in the media today. I will tell you this much look at what has happened so far and what the number of documents and the number of witnesses that have gone forward."

And John said that that was not correct. That it did not happen. It did not happen. With regard to the other issues that you brought up, the irregularities in this inquiry from the outset including the beginning of it which is the dossier issue which starts the whole thing, of course that's an issue.

He is going to be answering, yes, no, I don't remember, and lawyer like answers, that seems like a perfectly reasonable resolution, but if they ask him even in writing, what was your motive when he fired Comey?

That is even if you say something that is absolutely the truth and you pass a lie detector test and you get some sleazy flip witness who has been threatened with his family going to jail unless he composes or sings, nonetheless, you can be charged with lying if they have one witness who contradicts what you said. And that's why when he said the truth isn't the truth, that is essentially what he meant. And every criminal defense lawyer and prosecutor who is honest and experienced will tell you the same thing. That's why people don't go and speak to prosecutors. Ask Martha Stewart what happened when she did."

I have FBI friends of mine that say they never talk to the FBI. And I'm like, why not. I want to help them. That would be my natural instinct. If you ever do and you say something that turns out to be wrong, bad recollection, look at General Flynn, look at Papadopoulos. It's like, Professor Dershowitz has always said, we are criminalizing political differences. Sometimes you don't honestly remember something and you can now be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI. So my friends in the FBI tell me never talk to the FBI.

You should have to swear under oath on a bible before you can be charged with perjury. Because the vast majority of Americans don't know that. Don't know that if you tell a traffic cop in some states, I was speeding because my wife is pregnant, or I was taking kid back from the soccer game and it isn't true, you have committed a crime.

      "utterance": "All right. Opening weekend NFL is right around the corner, but Saturday is kind of my football day. Colin Kaepernick is back in the news, now he didn't make the roster of any pro team. He had three bad years before that. Nike is now making him the face of a new ad campaign, that is the subject of tonight's mini monologue. All right. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is not new to controversy. As a player, he frequently used the NFL as a public platform to protest what he called police brutality and what he perceive as America's ongoing oppression against minorities in the country. He famously refused to stand for the national anthem during games, leading others in on the field to do the same. Look at the socks he wore with police officers depicted as pigs. He wore it in practice. Even done a t- shirt featuring Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro during a press conference ahead of a game against the Miami Dolphins. Nike is now using Kaepernick to headline their new ad campaign and the words you see on your screen read, quote, \"believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.\" I would like to take a moment to remind Nike executives sacrificing everything looks like it's not a multimillionaire social justice warrior whose greatest feat of bravery kneeling on a football field and wearing those socks against our police officers. Instead, those who sacrifice everything can be found on the ground in Afghanistan as we speak. U.S. soldiers fighting and dying to keep this country safe. Fighting for a cause bigger than themselves. They can be found in the bravery and the courage of men and women that protect and serve police, firemen, first responders that run towards danger when we all run away. And they can also be found in graveyards all around the world from Normandy, to the Pacific, from Vietnam to Korea. All across the United States, there are millions of men and women who have really sacrificed everything for strangers they didn't even know. So the world, this country, could be a better safer freer place. There are plenty of heroes in this country that Nike could feature, but Castro, loving America, let's see. Cop hating, ex three year backup quarterback is not one of them. This week and we sent Tomi Lahren out to see what Californians thought about Nike's new ad, take a look."
