It's beyond infuriating that Biden and Jen Psaki began the week on vacation as the Taliban took over the country. We didn't even hear from Joe until Monday. And at that point, he was too scared to take questions. Biden's ABC interview only raised more questions about his and his team's decision making skills. In fact, it wasn't until late this morning that the President's team apparently realized that maybe he shouldn't head to his Delaware beach house today. He'll reportedly go tomorrow instead. You know, who wants to stay in the White House during a crisis anyway.  After hearing his disaster of a news conference today, we can confidently conclude that the Biden White House and cabinet are simply members of a gang that can't shoot or talk straight. They are a basket case teeming with contradictions and incompetence. After a week of mixed messages and fumbles, Biden's team still isn't even on the same page.",

So much for rebuilding NATO. Another three years of Biden and we're going to be lucky if we have a single ally left. Now, joining me now is the man you know is Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker, Fox News contributor. Mr. Speaker, you've been in government long time, you know the world, you've experienced many things, many of us have. I really - it is a remarkable. There's so many layers to this. It is shocking. It is disturbing. It's dangerous. It's frightening. What are your thoughts about what has unfolded in this past week?",

But we're drifting into what (inaudible) called a crisis of crises across our entire system. Things don't work. And what you just saw, let's focus narrowly on the P   entagon and the intelligence community, you have in the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, two people who are focused on creating a woke military. Well, we just learned that the greatest 21st century woke military can't defeat a seven century group of warriors who are willing to die for their cause. Now, that should sober us. And it should make us think about China, Russia, and Iran, and other countries who are watching this whole process.  I mean, Biden either has been kept deliberately ignorant, or has such deep cognitive difficulties, he just doesn't get it. But we have reports, for example, the 23 members of the embassy, wrote a letter of descent, which is, by the way, in the State Department terms, a very big deal. And then you're putting your career on the line to sign a letter like that. They sent it to the Secretary of State. We don't know if the Secretary of State Blinken took it to Biden or not. We don't know if Biden understood it or not. But that letter night by people who are in Kabul said, this is going to be a disaster. The President's press conference today, he just kept - I started to say he's kept lying. But the truth is, I don't know if he knows what the facts are. So it's not fair to challenge somebody who maybe has significant cognitive problem with lying if, in fact, he just doesn't get it. He doesn't understand what's going on around him.",

You had to have the British and the French go after their people to motivate our president to actually go and do something. And I blame the president for that. In the press conferences I've heard with Mark Milley, he said this the other day, that's a policy decision and we were ready to execute. That basically tells me that he wants to do it. He wants to act. But he needs approval from the commander in chief. And this commander in chief has lost complete touch with reality.  You've pointed out many contradictions that are directly from Joe Biden himself. Now, granted, State Department, they have utterly failed. I've got tons of friends in the military.

According to a new morning consult survey, 43 percent of Americans say Biden bears a great deal of responsibility for the disastrous withdrawal. You know, it's because we're not hiding in a basement. That's nearly double the number who blame Trump for the current crisis.  Here to break it all down is Tom Bevan, co-founder and president of RealClearPolitics, a website that we use and is important in all times, but especially during crises. Tom, Biden's been trying to pass blame on to Trump, well, all the Democrats have for this debacle. But it would seem like with numbers like that, the Americans aren't buying it. I mean, we're pretty flexible when it comes to how we might view things. And yet, it's like it seems obvious on its face who's responsible for this disaster. TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Yes. The administration has tried to deflect blame back to Trump onto the Afghans themselves. But clearly, the polling numbers are showing that that's not working. In addition to the numbers that you mentioned, Tammy, there have been a couple of major polls out this week showing that Biden's handling when asked whether people approve of his handling of Afghanistan, it's in the low 30s, 31 percent. And over - between 50 and 55 percent disapprove with the way he's handling it. So clearly, the public is watching what they're seeing on their television screens. They're watching what Joe Biden is telling them in these press conferences and statements that he's making. And they are not buying what he's selling at this point. They believe that he is - has botched the withdrawal. And he's fully responsible for it.",

We have leaks coming out of various parts of the government suggesting that he was warned about this ahead of time.

It's beyond infuriating that Biden and Jen Psaki began the week on vacation as the Taliban took over the country. We didn't even hear from Joe until Monday. And at that point, he was too scared to take questions. Biden's ABC interview only raised more questions about his and his team's decision making skills. In fact, it wasn't until late this morning that the President's team apparently realized that maybe he shouldn't head to his Delaware beach house today. He'll reportedly go tomorrow instead. You know, who wants to stay in the White House during a crisis anyway. After hearing his disaster of a news conference today, we can confidently conclude that the Biden White House and cabinet are simply members of a gang that can't shoot or talk straight. They are a basket case teeming with contradictions and incompetence. After a week of mixed messages and fumbles, Biden's team still isn't even on the same page."

So much for rebuilding NATO. Another three years of Biden and we're going to be lucky if we have a single ally left. Now, joining me now is the man you know is Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker, Fox News contributor. Mr. Speaker, you've been in government long time, you know the world, you've experienced many things, many of us have. I really - it is a remarkable. There's so many layers to this. It is shocking. It is disturbing. It's dangerous. It's frightening. What are your thoughts about what has unfolded in this past week?"

      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think first of all, you'd need to see Afghanistan as sort of a warning sign, not just focused on Afghanistan. But we're drifting into what (inaudible) called a crisis of crises across our entire system. Things don't work. And what you just saw, let's focus narrowly on the P entagon and the intelligence community, you have in the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, two people who are focused on creating a woke military. Well, we just learned that the greatest 21st century woke military can't defeat a seven century group of warriors who are willing to die for their cause. Now, that should sober us. And it should make us think about China, Russia, and Iran, and other countries who are watching this whole process. I mean, Biden either has been kept deliberately ignorant, or has such deep cognitive difficulties, he just doesn't get it. But we have reports, for example, the 23 members of the embassy, wrote a letter of descent, which is, by the way, in the State Department terms, a very big deal. And then you're putting your career on the line to sign a letter like that. They sent it to the Secretary of State. We don't know if the Secretary of State Blinken took it to Biden or not. We don't know if Biden understood it or not. But that letter night by people who are in Kabul said, this is going to be a disaster. The President's press conference today, he just kept - I started to say he's kept lying. But the truth is, I don't know if he knows what the facts are. So it's not fair to challenge somebody who maybe has significant cognitive problem with lying if, in fact, he just doesn't get it. He doesn't understand what's going on around him."

First of all, it was Secretary Blinken's job to make sure that the President understood how big a deal 23 professionals risking their career to sign a letter like that, a descending cable in the state department is a big deal. It's not that happens very seldom. So either Blinken didn't do his job, or, Biden just didn't get it. I mean, I can imagine him sitting there and thinking, why is Blinken telling me all this weird stuff. I've already made my mind up. I don't need to learn anything. The same thing happening, though, with Milley and with Austin. How could they possibly as professionals, allow Bagram to be lost?"

It is not just a bunch of mistakes. And when we think about who's in charge, we hear about people should resign, about impeachment, about a whole host of other things. What do you think should happen? What should the American people look for? And what should we demand?"

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",

And so what you have is groupthink. You have Austin, the Secretary of Defense; you have Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; you have the President of the United States; you have the Secretary of State. And apparently, none of the four of them have a clue about the real world. Now, if that doesn't scare you, then listen to the Chinese Communist talking about Taiwan and that Taiwan you better realize that Joe Biden can't possibly protect him, or listen to the Europeans, when the President today either lied to the country, or is so totally uninformed that it's scary. But our NATO allies are enraged for him to say, oh, nobody's really angry at us. You have to wonder, I mean, how - what is he processing?"

This is a disaster of monumental proportions. Sir, thank you very much for joining us tonight. Appreciate your insight. Now, Biden's ineptitude has put thousands of Americans at the mercy of bloodthirsty Taliban savages. We've all seen the shocking footage of the Taliban thugs terrorizing crowds outside the Kabul airport. Heck, even CNN said they had trouble getting in.

Then Biden was contradicted by his own defense secretary Lloyd Austin, telling Congress today that some people, including Americans have been harassed and even beaten by the Taliban on their way to the airport. Now, here now is Tennessee congressman Mark Green, former Army Special Forces operator and Foreign Affairs Committee member. Also here is Florida Congresswoman Kat Cammack, creating a bit of a stir on Twitter earlier today. Congresswoman, we'll get to you in one second here. Congressman Green, obviously, this is embarrassing. We clearly see that important people, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary Defense, State Department seem to not be communicating. It's being contradicted by its own people pretty much in real time, like within an hour. Tell me your thoughts on this within your position and certainly your experience with Afghanistan."

We have 10,000 Americans who are stranded on the other side of the wire. They're in Kabul. And for days, they've implied they wouldn't even go after them. You had to have the British and the French go after their people to motivate our president to actually go and do something. And I blame the president for that. In the press conferences I've heard with Mark Milley, he said this the other day, that's a policy decision and we were ready to execute. That basically tells me that he wants to do it. He wants to act. But he needs approval from the commander in chief. And this commander in chief has lost complete touch with reality. You've pointed out many contradictions that are directly from Joe Biden himself. Now, granted, State Department, they have utterly failed. I've got tons of friends in the military. They're telling me they've been executing the missions that the commander has given them. But the State Department has been asleep at the wheel."

And the first question when they open it up to members of Congress went to Speaker Pelosi.

They are emailing (inaudible) This is insane. This is the Speaker of the House. When you talk about a failure of leadership, again, the boots on the ground, they're getting it right.

This is just who they are. They can't name the enemy. And the Taliban killed my friends. The Taliban killed hundreds of Americans. Our allies have died and they can't call them an enemy.

I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, Mark Green. These people are the enemy. There is no legitimacy in their government. This is something that we cannot stand for. They enslave little girls, they traffic in humans. This cannot stand. And I have to tell you, the women and girls that have grown up under the last 20 years, they're in for a horrific future. We need to get very serious about getting our people out.

According to a new morning consult survey, 43 percent of Americans say Biden bears a great deal of responsibility for the disastrous withdrawal. You know, it's because we're not hiding in a basement. That's nearly double the number who blame Trump for the current crisis. Here to break it all down is Tom Bevan, co-founder and president of RealClearPolitics, a website that we use and is important in all times, but especially during crises. Tom, Biden's been trying to pass blame on to Trump, well, all the Democrats have for this debacle. But it would seem like with numbers like that, the Americans aren't buying it. I mean, we're pretty flexible when it comes to how we might view things. And yet, it's like it seems obvious on its face who's responsible for this disaster. TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Yes. The administration has tried to deflect blame back to Trump onto the Afghans themselves. But clearly, the polling numbers are showing that that's not working. In addition to the numbers that you mentioned, Tammy, there have been a couple of major polls out this week showing that Biden's handling when asked whether people approve of his handling of Afghanistan, it's in the low 30s, 31 percent. And over - between 50 and 55 percent disapprove with the way he's handling it. So clearly, the public is watching what they're seeing on their television screens. They're watching what Joe Biden is telling them in these press conferences and statements that he's making. And they are not buying what he's selling at this point. They believe that he is - has botched the withdrawal. And he's fully responsible for it."

As though they were hoping and desperate for a pandemic to come save them, because that's what they want to talk about, because that's what helps them. But it's - I guess you could have done that maybe 30 years ago, when there was like three networks and there was no internet and people didn't have additional information. It seems very strange that that their team thinks that all of what's happened has been ok. And that part of the report is, Tom, that they believe the American people will get bored, and that we'll lose interest. Is that something that's a reasonable thought to have when it comes to what's transpiring here?"

The problem with that theory is that in addition to just the logistical nightmare and the incompetence that we're seeing is that Joe Biden's now facing - he has a credibility issue. I mean, he's telling the nation things that have been contradicted by reports on the ground by his own staff. We have leaks coming out of various parts of the government suggesting that he was warned about this ahead of time. He promised that he would always tell us the truth that he would always level with us, good, bad or otherwise. And yet now he's telling us that this - the chaos was priced in. They knew it was going to happen. But he never mentioned it ahead of time. He never prepared the American people for this. And now he's telling us that it was always inevitable that they've done a great job that they couldn't have done anything better. And I don't think that is passing muster with the American people."

Horace, Twitter, it's funny, they keep talking about Taliban. Other people are saying, well, they don't break any of the tech rules. And whether or not, of course, Twitter saying they don't know if they're really a violent organization. It seems like everyone has missed their medication at this point. We know what the Taliban has done. How can you explain this double standard that keeps slapping all of us in the face every day? HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: Well, if it wasn't for double standards, Twitter wouldn't have standards at all. It is unbelievable that the President of the United States, the sitting President of the United States is considered a danger in some way. Because we don't like \"mean tweets\". Meanwhile, an evil vicious ideology that targets little children, six years old and younger, for marriage, that beheads people and believes that if you're born female that somehow that means that you're supposed to be subjugated for life.

      "utterance": "Well, none of that was true. To the surprise of no one, though, that was all a lie. Today, Reuters reported that the FBI found scant evidence that the U.S. Capitol attack was coordinated, \"Ninety to ninety- five percent of these are one-off cases said a former senior law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation.\" There was no grand scheme of these people to storm the capital and take hostages. Charlie, we also watch the Capitol be fenced in four months, the National Guard, all of this narrative, and none of that -- the FBI, which is not entirely going to always be straight with us is saying yes, yes, this is not a coordinated thing by anybody. Is this more proof of the depth of the problem we have and what some people are willing to do to the country? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\":  I think without a doubt. And this is how you wind up with 600 Americans rotting in prison, and most of them have been charged with like trespassing or disorderly conduct. And I'm not defending the riotous behavior on January 6th. I thought it was appalling at the time, and I think that they should pay a price for it, but this is absurd. And the reason it's become so politicized, I think, and the reason they're not going to cease is because this is the only way that Democrats turn attention away from the actual crime that is going on in people's neighborhoods, in people's cities today as we speak, horrible crimes the Democrats don't want to talk about. And that's why they are going to keep going back to January 6th and just talk about that."

And then we still have the January 6th commission, I don't know what they're going to do. Hardest hit, maybe Liz Cheney. God forbid should you not have a reason to call fellow Americans terrorists. God forbid should you not be able to have that in your pocket. I think Afghanistan has told us all what the real priorities are that all of this transcends partisanship, and that this is where we recognized that we have all been taken for a ride for a very long time. Gentlemen, thank you very much for being here tonight. Now, as blue state tyrants mandate vaccines for kids, the FDA is reportedly looking into whether or not the risks to youngsters are in fact higher than initially thought. Dr. Janette Nesheiwat is here."

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is mandating high school athletes in so-called high-risk sports like football in even bowling, they need to be vaccinated. And over in southern California, the Culver City school district is forcing all students 12 and up to get the jab. But are they ignoring the risks? According to \"The Washington Post,\" the FDA is delaying approval of vaccines for adolescents based on disturbing new data out of Canada. It suggests the Moderna vaccine may carry a higher risk of heart inflammation for young people than the Pfizer vaccine. So joining us now is FOX News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Janette, we love your analysis, and I really appreciate what you do. And I notice that most of us, we know that we've been part of a trial. I'm a vaccine advocate, I've had it, and we know we are part of a trial. This has not really been approved yet. And part of trials are in fact to see what the side effects are and what might happen. And yet, with adults you can make your own mind up, but this mandating to children of this in this certain, particular time, isn't this a problem at this stage since we've got maybe this delay coming up?"

We need to know is there a higher risk in myocarditis in children, in adolescents with the specifically the Moderna vaccine. Why are we getting this information from an anonymous source? Why isn't the FDA and CDC bringing forth this information? That is so important that we have all the facts so that we can make the best decisions for ourselves and for our children. Because even though myocarditis is rare, it's just a fancy word for inflammation in the tissue of the heart. It's rare. It's easily treated with medicines like ibuprofen. We still need to be informed. That is part of our right as an American. We need the facts, we need the data, and then we move forward for there."

On another dynamic when we're dealing with mandates, very serious for children, but if you've gone into a restaurant lately, of course, anywhere, even your salons, we've got these plastic barriers. And all of us have thought that that was a joke because we know that, of course, a virus can maybe go up and go around a plastic barrier. But now they are saying that in fact that this may worsen the spread. This is from \"The New York Times.\" \"Scientists who study aerosols, airflow, and ventilations say that much of the time the barriers don't help and probably give people a false sense of security. A barrier protecting a clerk behind a checkout counter may redirect the germs to another customer or another worker.\" Dr. Janette, your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NESHEIWAT",
      "utterance": "Yes, so what's happening with these plastic barriers, you are actually impeding natural airflow and ventilation. You're funneling and redirecting the germs, those viral particles and aerosols, to another person, to down the hall, and to what we call dead zones where the viral particles accumulate and could therefore make it more infectious, more dangerous. So the best thing is ensuring great ventilation. And if you're in a crowded indoor areas, be careful, especially if you're not vaccinated. You want to protect yourself."

And in fact, he is going to Wilmington tomorrow, so he's done that every weekend. And remember, he was at Camp David. So why are they celebrating this? Is this a little bit of desperation on their part? ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, \"RELATABLE\" PODCAST HOST:  It's very much desperation. There's a very low bar. Even if he were staying at the White House this weekend, that wouldn't be enough to make up for the chaos that I think was unnecessarily wrought because of his lack of leadership. And we saw that today in his speech. Unfortunately, sadly, and I say that sincerely, he can really barely string a sentence together. And all of this is a strawman, this whole argument that he is building, that the media is building, that hey, this is war, this is chaotic, this is how it goes, and he's just doing the best he can. Most people aren't arguing that at some point we had to get out, it's not even to get into all of that. But it's the how, and it's how he lacked communication, he lacked leadership, he lacks confidence and competence. That's what people are upset about, and he has yet to address that."

KIRA DAVIS, \"JUST LISTEN TO YOURSELF\" PODCAST:  It's a little bit of both. But you can imagine how painful it was for the liberal media to watch Joe Biden today and to watch the news cycle this week. I happened to be watching CNN today during the press conference, and they were just apoplectic. I couldn't look away. And they were, it was almost like watching night in 2016. They were just apoplectic. What happened was they pivoted to save the narrative, and that's I think what was happening in the clips that you played for us. They're trying to pipit. They've got to salvage something because they know that this is a disaster, but they can't let this president go down. They pledge their loyalty. So I think it's like a silver lining to a very, very dark cloud for them."

If this was the only thing that was the problem, OK, fine, whatever. But this is just one of so many things. And the fact that Anderson Cooper was making so much hullabaloo out of it, it was like, are you desperate much?
