      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up. We have a big announcement coming tonight.  And, by the way, we also want you to call all your Democratic friends right now, ask them to learn the real, ugly truth about Joe Biden. Joe Biden hit a new low today and also confusing moments again. We will expose the entire truth that the mob will never tell you.  Joe, it's time we give America a history lesson about you. That's coming tonight.  But first, we start with the carnage in Chicago, chaos in Portland, violent crime surging in nearly every major city in America. Democratic mayors, Democratic governors, they have failed in their most basic duty, and that is the most basic responsibility, to maintain law and order. They have failed and people are dying and being shot as a result. They have failed to keep their neighborhood safe. They have failed to prevent violent crime. As a result, men, women and children are dying. Our fellow Americans are dying.  These mayors are literally twiddling their thumbs and playing politics. Philadelphia's top prosecutor is now vowing to arrest any federal law enforcement agents that are sent to the city. But President Trump is taking action. Today in a major press conference, he announced the expansion of what's called Operation LeGend. That's a federal program. It started in Kansas City and was named after a 4-year-old boy who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his own bed.  Well, they'll now send more than 100 federal officers to Chicago, 35 to Albuquerque without having a problem in order to help take violent criminals off of the streets. The mayors aren't doing it. The governors aren't doing it.   Listen to the president.",

Every American, no matter their income, race, or their zip code, should be able to walk the city streets free from violence and free from fear. For this reason today, I am announcing the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime.",

Bashing President Trump, tweeting: Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents. She clearly hates the president more than she cares about innocent men, women and children in her city. Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel, he didn't do anything either. Barack Obama's president, barely mentioned Chicago, 1,000 shot, 1,000 died. Biden did nothing.   At that point, when will these liberal mayors and governors, when do we hold them accountable for not protecting innocent people? Hundreds of people shot every week in Chicago and a lot of the cities. Six small children have been killed in July alone.  Last night, a 3-year-old little girl was shot in the head, but the mayor is worried about troops terrorizing her city. Really? Now, what has she done to stop the violence? What has she done to save lives? Lightfoot who is a lightweight on protecting citizens seems more worried about optics and politics than the men, women and children that she is supposed to protect and serve. It's a national disgrace. She is not the only Democrat putting politics before human life. In Portland, we see the same thing. Democrats there, they're apoplectic. The federal agents were trying to protect federal buildings from being burned to the ground. That is their right and their job.   Portland's mayor calling the federal officers, literally, the officers, not the anarchist, not the people involved in the violence, calling the officers un-American. Oregon's stupid governor floating an insane conspiracy theory that they were abducting people. Pelosi, get this, comparing agents, law enforcement agents who put their lives on the line to protect and serve \"stormtroopers\".   Congressman Clyburn, the leadership in the Democratic Party, referring to them as Nazi Gestapo.  Meanwhile, corrupt and confused Joe Biden, he's not said a single positive word about law enforcement, the 99th percent, since running for president. He accused federal agents of, quote, brutally attacking peaceful protesters. Now, we have also heard him say that police have become the enemy and he supports the defund effort or as he calls it, we will reallocate sources. He likes that word better.  Let's be clear -- anarchist, vandals, have been writing nearly two straight months in downtown Portland. They firebombed the federal courthouse twice. They possibly, permanently blinded federal officers with lasers. Dozens of buildings have been vandalized, lit ablaze. Businesses, they're shutdown. People don't feel safe. These are not peaceful protests, Joe.  And here's just a small example of what law enforcement is facing. Take a look.",

See what's happening? Biden doesn't have a plan to stop violence, make America cities safer to protect innocent people so he just trashes Donald Trump. Now, he's even deploying one of the old Democratic Party favorite tactics. He is now playing the race card. I pointed out and I've done this history so many times come, every two years, every four years, like clockwork. Republicans, they are racist, sexists, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air and water. They want grandma and grandpa to eat dog food, cat food, before Paul Ryan or a Republican Trump look-alike throws granny over a cliff in a wheelchair.

Here's Joe Biden's history. It was Donald Trump, not Joe and not Barack who passed criminal justice reform and prison reform. It was Donald Trump, it wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack. It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that.   As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the ‘70s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.

So, you need to ask yourself the question, what was Biden doing during his 50-plus year career in the swamp for African-Americans, other minorities? Here is where it gets interesting. All -- tell all your Democratic friends, we know he was very close and spoke so highly of the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, yes, former Klan leader. Biden called the Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, a close friend of mine and a mentor. That man filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that, well, Lyndon Johnson needed 80 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate to get past and most Democrats are opposing it. During a speech, Joe Biden in 1973 praised Democrats in a two-party system in the South that is called, well I'm a good for the -- I won't use the word. Around the same time, Biden was actively working with the segregationists. He didn't want immigration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, he led the charge on an initiative to keep black students away from the black students away from white students. That is his record. In ‘77, Biden worried his children, his children, if integration -- would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle if integration is not done in an orderly way, whatever the hell that means. 1993, referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets as he coauthored the most aggressive crime bill that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes specifically targeting in the end minority Americans. In 2006, telling a crowd, well, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work out at 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts. I'm not kidding he said.  2006, he bragged his state was a slave state. 2007, yes, he actually said this about Barack Obama: the first, OK, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, clean, that story book, man. Wow. Last year, he said, poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, you ain't black if you don't support Donald Trump. Joe decides that? Joe Biden shouldn't throw stones from that glass house. That mob in the media will never tell you. Better yet, he could just stop saying racist things altogether. Joe, take a look in the mirror. When is anybody in the mob and the media going to ask him about any of these things? Because that's the truth, that's the history. And, by the way, actually knows if Joe Biden can even form a answer to any of these questions. We're going to play his very latest struggles in a moment. It's not good.

Well, that's called the CARES Act and it has over 800, nearly $900 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses. We need to make certain nobody, he says, who has COVID, gets -- has to pay for it.

Well, that person is already in place. It is a general who is the head of the Army military command -- materials command and President Trump appointed him May 15th to do exactly that job.

If they need more they're going to get more from Congress. But, I mean, here it is, he's given a great opportunity to tell us what you would do differently and all seven things that he lays out are things that the administration has exactly done.

Joe Biden hit a new low today and also confusing moments again. We will expose the entire truth that the mob will never tell you. Joe, it's time we give America a history lesson about you. That's coming tonight. But first, we start with the carnage in Chicago, chaos in Portland, violent crime surging in nearly every major city in America. Democratic mayors, Democratic governors, they have failed in their most basic duty, and that is the most basic responsibility, to maintain law and order. They have failed and people are dying and being shot as a result. They have failed to keep their neighborhood safe. They have failed to prevent violent crime. As a result, men, women and children are dying. Our fellow Americans are dying. These mayors are literally twiddling their thumbs and playing politics. Philadelphia's top prosecutor is now vowing to arrest any federal law enforcement agents that are sent to the city. But President Trump is taking action. Today in a major press conference, he announced the expansion of what's called Operation LeGend. That's a federal program. It started in Kansas City and was named after a 4-year-old boy who was killed by gunfire while asleep in his own bed. Well, they'll now send more than 100 federal officers to Chicago, 35 to Albuquerque without having a problem in order to help take violent criminals off of the streets. The mayors aren't doing it. The governors aren't doing it. Listen to the president."

No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city. Every American, no matter their income, race, or their zip code, should be able to walk the city streets free from violence and free from fear. For this reason today, I am announcing the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime."

We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children, and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce -- every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting. But opportunity cannot thrive where there's violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there's bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity. That is what Operation Legend is all about."

They can protect, well, federal property, they can help in investigations, they can get to underlying groups that are fomenting this violence. But unless and until these reckless, irresponsible Democratic mayors and governors do their job and/or allow the help they are being offered, they are allowing innocent people to die. That is all on them. New York, Chicago, Philly, Baltimore, you name the city, Seattle, Portland, it's all on them. Especially true in Chicago. Shootings were up 47 percent over last year, homicides up by a whopping 51 percent, 70 shot last weekend, 63 the weekend before, even children dying every single week. The violence reaches catastrophic levels. By the way, last night, we reported on that horrific mass shooting in the south side of Chicago. Fifteen people seriously wounded outside of a funeral home in what appears to be a gun-related incident. At least 60 shell casings recovered from the scene, caught on camera by nearby surveillance system. Take a look."

Bashing President Trump, tweeting: Under no circumstances will I allow Donald Trump's troops to come to Chicago and terrorize our residents. She clearly hates the president more than she cares about innocent men, women and children in her city. Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel, he didn't do anything either. Barack Obama's president, barely mentioned Chicago, 1,000 shot, 1,000 died. Biden did nothing. At that point, when will these liberal mayors and governors, when do we hold them accountable for not protecting innocent people? Hundreds of people shot every week in Chicago and a lot of the cities. Six small children have been killed in July alone. Last night, a 3-year-old little girl was shot in the head, but the mayor is worried about troops terrorizing her city. Really? Now, what has she done to stop the violence? What has she done to save lives? Lightfoot who is a lightweight on protecting citizens seems more worried about optics and politics than the men, women and children that she is supposed to protect and serve. It's a national disgrace. She is not the only Democrat putting politics before human life. In Portland, we see the same thing. Democrats there, they're apoplectic. The federal agents were trying to protect federal buildings from being burned to the ground. That is their right and their job. Portland's mayor calling the federal officers, literally, the officers, not the anarchist, not the people involved in the violence, calling the officers un-American. Oregon's stupid governor floating an insane conspiracy theory that they were abducting people. Pelosi, get this, comparing agents, law enforcement agents who put their lives on the line to protect and serve \"stormtroopers\". Congressman Clyburn, the leadership in the Democratic Party, referring to them as Nazi Gestapo. Meanwhile, corrupt and confused Joe Biden, he's not said a single positive word about law enforcement, the 99th percent, since running for president. He accused federal agents of, quote, brutally attacking peaceful protesters. Now, we have also heard him say that police have become the enemy and he supports the defund effort or as he calls it, we will reallocate sources. He likes that word better. Let's be clear -- anarchist, vandals, have been writing nearly two straight months in downtown Portland. They firebombed the federal courthouse twice. They possibly, permanently blinded federal officers with lasers. Dozens of buildings have been vandalized, lit ablaze. Businesses, they're shutdown. People don't feel safe. These are not peaceful protests, Joe. And here's just a small example of what law enforcement is facing. Take a look."

See what's happening? Biden doesn't have a plan to stop violence, make America cities safer to protect innocent people so he just trashes Donald Trump. Now, he's even deploying one of the old Democratic Party favorite tactics. He is now playing the race card. I pointed out and I've done this history so many times come, every two years, every four years, like clockwork.

Here's Joe Biden's history. It was Donald Trump, not Joe and not Barack who passed criminal justice reform and prison reform. It was Donald Trump, it wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack. It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that. As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the ‘70s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.

So, you need to ask yourself the question, what was Biden doing during his 50-plus year career in the swamp for African-Americans, other minorities? Here is where it gets interesting. All -- tell all your Democratic friends, we know he was very close and spoke so highly of the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, yes, former Klan leader. Biden called the Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, a close friend of mine and a mentor. That man filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that, well, Lyndon Johnson needed 80 percent of Republicans in the House and Senate to get past and most Democrats are opposing it. During a speech, Joe Biden in 1973 praised Democrats in a two-party system in the South that is called, well I'm a good for the -- I won't use the word. Around the same time, Biden was actively working with the segregationists. He didn't want immigration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, he led the charge on an initiative to keep black students away from the black students away from white students. That is his record. In ‘77, Biden worried his children, his children, if integration -- would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle if integration is not done in an orderly way, whatever the hell that means. 1993, referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets as he coauthored the most aggressive crime bill that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes specifically targeting in the end minority Americans. In 2006, telling a crowd, well, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work out at 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts. I'm not kidding he said. 2006, he bragged his state was a slave state. 2007, yes, he actually said this about Barack Obama: the first, OK, the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, clean, that story book, man. Wow. Last year, he said, poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, you ain't black if you don't support Donald Trump. Joe decides that? Joe Biden shouldn't throw stones from that glass house. That mob in the media will never tell you. Better yet, he could just stop saying racist things altogether. Joe, take a look in the mirror. When is anybody in the mob and the media going to ask him about any of these things? Because that's the truth, that's the history. And, by the way, actually knows if Joe Biden can even form a answer to any of these questions. We're going to play his very latest struggles in a moment. It's not good.

One of the -- the great stories about what is going on, not just in Portland but about the protest in general is the malpractice how these people are portrayed, how people view them in the media. They're saying it's all kumbaya, brother. They are just sitting there having a great time, and they're cooking out, and they've got people singing and dancing. And the reality is, you have hundreds of people attacked this federal building. I mean attacked. I mean, they had hammers, and steel pipes and were setting fires to burn the building down, and all the old people in it.

And I had nurse at the -- nurses at the Walter Reed Hospital who would been down and whisper in my ear to go home and get me pillows. They would make sure they'd actually probably never anything taught in -- you can't do it during the COVID time, but they would actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move. Wearing a mask now, this is a political statement? This is more patriotic. Why do you wear the mask? So you don't make somebody else sick. Sick."

Anyway, beyond Biden's blunders, the constant -- the contrast between the president, his vision, his anima, strength, his mental alertness and his passion for American prosperity versus quid pro quo Joe's -- well, his vision, pleas to the enemy, Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie's economic plans, AOC, yeah, her New Green Deal plan, Beto Bozo O'Rourke's compensation of guns plan, and Pelosi and Schumer. Wow, a vote for Biden is a vote for Bernie and every extreme radical socialist agenda item ever proposed. Law, order, peace, prosperity, security, safety, it's all on the ballot in just 104 days where you become the ultimate jury. Joining us now to break it all down, FOX News contributor, we call him the architect, Karl Rove. All right, Karl, I need an interpreter. Can you interpret what that is? And they just fade to black now. Joe's losing it, sorry. We are out of time. Beep. You are out."

      "utterance": "Yes, mystifying. I was taken this week with his appearance on Joy Reid's new MSNBC program. He was her inaugural guest. She immediately gives him a chance, says, what do you think of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus? He begins to pummel him for a few moments. So, she then -- which she lets him go, that's what she wants him to do, and then she turns to him and says, well, look, you know, if you're elected, then the pandemics probably is still raging. So walk us through, she says, walk us what you would do differently next year. He then makes seven statements. Every one of the recommendations that he is going to do next year is already being done. He says, I've been talking about the Defense Production Act. Well, President Trump used that in March. He says, we need to have everybody wear masks. Well, the CDC and the White House Coronavirus Task Force recommended that months ago. He said, you know, we need to make sure the businesses continue to be able to stay alive. Well, that's called the CARES Act and it has over 800, nearly $900 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses. We need to make certain nobody, he says, who has COVID, gets -- has to pay for it. Well, the president already did that months ago. And he says, we need to have somebody in command right now in order to oversee the production and distribution of the vaccine. Well, that person is already in place. It is a general who is the head of the Army military command -- materials command and President Trump appointed him May 15th to do exactly that job. He says, and we need to spend $25 billion to do it. Well, Congress appropriated $10 million and the Department of Human and Health Services has found billions more and they're spending it. If they need more they're going to get more from Congress. But, I mean, here it is, he's given a great opportunity to tell us what you would do differently and all seven things that he lays out are things that the administration has exactly done. Can't the guy come up with one new idea, one -- just one, just one new idea? That'd be all we'd ask for."

Countless, hundreds of thousands of Americans did not attract the virus because of it. It gave us time to kill the PPE that we needed and the ventilators. And Donald Trump did all that and he did it against the recommendations of many. Those three decisions right there he was against. And they saved lives."

We have had an emergency in our town and somebody says, you know, if I had been in charge, here is what I would have done. Or a big controversy, you know, if I had been the guy in charge, let me tell you, I would do it differently. And they can't do it. Just go look at and better yet read my column tomorrow morning where I lay it out what he says and what was already done. It's just amazing to me. Is this the best the guy can do? I mean, I think what is happening in the basement is he's gotten lazy, mentally lazy. And so, he thinks he can get away with this because he goes on places like Joy Reid and he doesn't get challenged. Let him get in front of a real journalist and see how he handles it. What if somebody said wait a minute, those things that have been done, I ask you, what differently you would do? You haven't suggested anything different. And let's see how he'd answer that. But he's getting away with murder right now, and it is getting to be a mistake for him because he can't keep this up for the 104 days up in the campaign."

The American people expect him to show up for three debates. The president -- you know, the president has got to be careful because Biden did take care of Paul Ryan and took care of Sarah Palin and the vice presidential debate in '08 and '12. But he's got to show up for ‘em, and that's going to be a real -- I think the climactic moment of this campaign. The debates are more important than they've ever been since at least 1980."

You've been very outspoken on this. Look, the fact that after all of these years that we had people 30 and 40 years ago hacking into government agencies. If we don't fix this, it annoys the living daylights out of me. At what point is that our problem and our fault?"

I don't want a cold war with China. China says -- the communist party in China says it wants respect. You have to earn respect. Respect is not a participation trophy. They have to show that they are willing to be posted stakeholders in a stable law and order. And vernacular, that means they have to agree to stop cheating."
