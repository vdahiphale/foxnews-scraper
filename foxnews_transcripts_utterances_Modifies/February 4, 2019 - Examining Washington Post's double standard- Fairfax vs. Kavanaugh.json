We are going to bring you all of the crazy controversies surrounding both the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor in that state, what does that say about the current political climate. Plus, lawyers representing Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann - we're not dropping this, my friends - prepare for a possible defamation case, a libel case. We're going to tell you what media figures, politicians, and entertainers are going to be feeling the heat.  And it was a game worth forgetting, as Sean and I were saying. Why the Super Bowl was among the lowest rated ever and how can it be avoided next year? Raymond Arroyo has big answers. And the big winner from Super Bowl LIII.  But first, the rise of the PC puritans. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now, rather than offering their own positive, pro-growth agenda for America, the Democrats have gone really negative and really nasty. They casually hurled charges of racism at conservative targets, of course, including at the President himself.",

Way beyond blackface, many costumes are now racist. But now liberals are in a huge pickle. How do they maintain the racial bona fides when one of their own governors cut loose during a med school Halloween party dressed like this?

So, now, everybody is walking on egg shells everywhere to avoid being called out for white privilege or gender privilege, without the privilege of knowing what this new orthodoxy even requires. Ralph Northam's fate will ultimately be decided by Democrats in the commonwealth, and Republicans would do well to avoid joining the PC puritans of the left.

Avoid the identity politics and the PC puritans. Stick to the facts and to the issues. We win on those. Democrats are vulnerable on those.  Most Americans are unaware, for instance, that when Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed that law and got the standing ovation, expanding abortion in New York last week, he simultaneously removed abortion from the state's criminal code. So now New York permits the abortion of a child beyond 24 weeks for essentially any reason. And infanticide is no longer illegal. Let the Democrats continue their witch hunts. The stocks in the town square will surely be full.  Republicans should keep connecting with the rest of America who fear that come 2020, we could be heading off the rails of prosperity and toward socialism. And that's the Angle. Joining me now, Candace Owens, Communications Director for Turning Point USA, and Howard Franklin, current consultant to former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who's slated to give the Democratic response to tomorrow night's State of the Union.

Why the Super Bowl was among the lowest rated ever and how can it be avoided next year? Raymond Arroyo has big answers. And the big winner from Super Bowl LIII. But first, the rise of the PC puritans. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.

Dissatisfied, they're nutbag base, Democrats have set themselves up as these PC puritans, a band of politically correct enforcers who traverse the culture, stamping out any and all who violate their ever-shifting ethical codes. So, now, everybody is walking on egg shells everywhere to avoid being called out for white privilege or gender privilege, without the privilege of knowing what this new orthodoxy even requires. Ralph Northam's fate will ultimately be decided by Democrats in the commonwealth, and Republicans would do well to avoid joining the PC puritans of the left. Because the Democrats, they're tripping all over themselves to prove how enlightened they are by throwing even their own under the PC express. I find it richly ironic that Joe Biden was one of the first to tweet out, \"There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately.\" Well, the Democrat front-runner in a new Iowa poll, of course, Biden has a lot of nerve.

I think you all get the point. This is going in a bad direction for the Democrats and probably for the rest of us as well. But each time the Dems highlight the evolving purity of their party and reach into the past to convict someone today, they end up distancing themselves from America. Now, yesterday, it was MAGA hats that were racist. But today, anyone who ever impersonated Michael Jackson at a dance party might as well have burned a cross on someone's lawn.

This whole effort is in fact a smoke screen, my friends. It's a party-wide effort to distract from the Democrats reliability. I think their atrocious policies are what we should be focusing on. So everyone is locked on Northam's KKK costume mess, and it's a mess. Let's not forget how he came to national prominence last week. It was his abhorrent defense of the Democrats' abortion on-demand at all stages agenda."

The exposure of the grisly reality that the Democrats desire abortion even after birth has startled voters across the political spectrum, and it should. But suddenly, we are talking about 30-year old pictures instead of a murderous policy that imperils the lives of thousands of children today? Republicans should not fall into this trap. Avoid the identity politics and the PC puritans. Stick to the facts and to the issues. We win on those. Democrats are vulnerable on those. Most Americans are unaware, for instance, that when Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed that law and got the standing ovation, expanding abortion in New York last week, he simultaneously removed abortion from the state's criminal code. So now New York permits the abortion of a child beyond 24 weeks for essentially any reason. And infanticide is no longer illegal. Let the Democrats continue their witch hunts. The stocks in the town square will surely be full. Republicans should keep connecting with the rest of America who fear that come 2020, we could be heading off the rails of prosperity and toward socialism. And that's the Angle. Joining me now, Candace Owens, Communications Director for Turning Point USA, and Howard Franklin, current consultant to former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who's slated to give the Democratic response to tomorrow night's State of the Union. It's great to have both of you on. Candace, Northam is kind of just the latest case, isn't he? This constant racial rush to judgment, Joe Lieberman was talking about today as well and yesterday, will surely come back to bite the Democrats again and again."

I mean, I actually didn't find their response to be enough. I'm sure, it's nice they called for him to resign, but where are the mobs? Where are the protests? Right? Whenever the left feels upset about something, no matter how disingenuous that thing is, they seem to be able to assemble a mob overnight like they did for Brett Kavanaugh, like when Antifa knocks on the door of Tucker Carlson.

They wrote, The Washington Post, in phone calls to people who knew Fairfax from college, law school and through political circles, found no similar complaints of sexual misconduct against him. Without that, or the ability to corroborate the woman's account, in part because she had not told anyone what happened, The Washington Post did not run a story.\" Well, I - yes, I totally agree.

They've got nice walls. Gentlemen, thank you so much. And when President Trump reopened the government, he also called for by bipartisan committee to attempt to hash out some border compromise, Jon was talking about it, before February 16th. So why haven't we heard about any progress? Here now remember that committee, Republican Representative Tom Graves of Georgia. All right, Congressman, any progress whatsoever, and if not -- don't be partisan about this -- what can we do now to make some progress before the 16th."

But I have to say, living on the border, you have to let the local border patrol chief have the say so and let the local communities be involved so they can come up with maybe some sort of enhanced barrier."

I always think a while you can't see through, but we're going to have it see-through. So it's kind of already and enhanced barrier. It seems like there's a semantic problem in part, correct?"

We don't have a border crisis. This is what they continue to repeat. Stay there, and thank you so much, Congressman, for joining us. Up next, Nick Sandmann, the teen at the center of that Covington Catholic controversy, along with his lawyers, have sent letters now to multiple media outlets.

More than 50 media organizations, celebrities, and politicians ranging from Elizabeth Warren to NBC's Chuck Todd, actors Alyssa Milano, Jim Carrey, were sent letters from lawyers representing Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann. The student had his reputation destroyed after a rabid Trump hating press jumped on an edited clip of his interaction with a Native American activist, Nathan Phillips. The preservation letters are considered the first step in a possible libel and defamation lawsuit, so the teen's legal team, also with those letters requesting to preserve documents, released a 15 minute video that say -- that shows the truth, excuse me, about his interactions at last month's March for Life. Here's some of that video. Watch."

Libby, this is really an interesting approach. The family decided to produce their own narrative, which, the power of video.  I had never seen that before. I thought I had seen everything. That was wild. How seriously should the celebrities, and we're going to get into their names, Alyssa Milano, Jim Carrey, and others, how seriously should they take this preservation of all your documents letter they will receive?"

I think this is a brilliant optics move, P.R.  move, on behalf of the Sandmann family and Nick himself in order to produce this video. This video shows clearly how false the media got it, how false the claims were that that the media first rushed and published. And, look, the letters, the preservation letters that Lin Wood sent out, I think these celebrities and the media types who rushed to judgment and published this stuff, I think they have a lot of concerns, they should have a lot of concern, because Lin knows what he's doing. If you recall, Lin Wood was the lawyer who represented Richard Jewell who was proclaimed by the same mainstream media as being the Olympic Park bomber. Lin went, media outlet by media outlet, and got Richard Jewell's reputation back. He was falsely accused. It was the same rush to judgment these outlets who are really far out there and saying these false and defamatory things about Richard Jewell. And I think Lin is going to take the exact same approach here with the Sandmann family. And so I think there's a lot to be concerned about on the part of these media outlets."

Without white boys being able to emphasize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself.\" That's an example, I would say if I were defending this, of a general opinion. The things they are going to center on aren't things like that, frankly. They're going to be specifically targeted at him, I think.  Correct? Because there are a lot of people with red hats there that you could say, well, I think one of the Indian activists also had a red hat on in one of those shots. So it has to be specifically targeted at this young man."

There is the Milkovich case which says even if there are facts that are embedded within what is otherwise a statement of opinion or implicit facts as part of that opinion, it is still actionable.  So here there's no get-out-of-jail-free card for something that they proclaim to be opinion.

Raymond Arroyo, Fox News contributor, New York Times bestselling author of the upcoming book \"Will Wilder, The Amulet of Power.\" Raymond, as you know, I was at the game."

When you don't have the match up that fans actually wanted and you have a dynasty team that runs everybody over like the Patriots in this game for the six time, interest kind of wanes. But aside from the low-scoring game, the big winner of the night was clearly in my mind Gladys Knight, who at 74 delivered one of the best National Anthems maybe ever."

Part of the reason it worked was Knight dismissed the politically correct Kaepernick sideshow that threatened to dominate the whole Super Bowl. A red line really has been drawn around these big stages for most of these acts. And Kaepernick and his supporters created one around the Super Bowl, basically saying that any performer --"

But Gladys Knight said in a statement after her performance, \"I understand Mr. Kaepernick is protesting to things, and they are police violence and injustice. It is unfortunate that our National Anthem has been dragged into the debate when the distinctive sense is that the National Anthem and fighting for justice should each stand alone.\" She is a class act.

We were like why are you crying? He said my father -- his father is in the military, Army, and his mother was born in Germany. They met there when he was deployed. And he said I just love -- I love this country. We have a great blank-blank country. And he's crying. And I'm telling you, 74 years old, she belted out. You hear that high note, Raymond, at the end."

And Laura, he was singing a song, \"Moves like Jagger.\" He moved more like Manilow. This is the whitest singer ever at a Super Bowl. They need to get Bruno Mars and Pharrell to work on acts. They could fill the room."

You stripped down, see your tattoos. We don't need to see the whole geography of the whole country on your body. My son looked at it and was like what is that? Everyone around me, by the way, nobody around me knew any of the songs. We were all -- we were reminiscing about U2 at the Super Bowl years ago."

Laura, it was the lowest rated Super Bowl in 10 years. Here in New Orleans where I am tonight, it was 26.2 percent of the households that tuned in.  That is the lowest ever. But something beautiful happened here. Thousands of people turned into the streets for what they call the boycott bowl. It ended up being a celebration of the Saints and the Who Dat nation. And though Adam Levine tried to apparently underscore this message with one love, what New Orleans showed accidentally is what one love looks like.  They came together as a people, white and black and Hispanic. It was unbelievable. And it was a show of unity and a show of love for their team. And that's what the NFL was striving for. I hope they got that message."
