We got these cigars before the embargo was put up. So that's open to interpretation. The video was incredible because I actually thought it was convincing until he shows videos and pictures of Obama hugging hurricane victims and George H.W. Bush hugging Katrina victims. The line is you can hug or kiss on the cheek. He was grabbing you know what and kissing on the mouth. That is unacceptable. So he says New Yorkers aren't naive and they're not going to go for this and they know it is political. And you know what, maybe it's an Italian thing, right?

If I were advising Governor Cuomo, being paid to advise him or if I were his brother who is an anchor at another network, I would advise him not to resign. I would say the Democratic Party has made mistakes on this before. Al Franken is one of them. Bill Clinton went on after the '90s to be a star of the Democratic Party, made a lot of, you know, people famous. He had a lot of endorsements, made a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation. And when it comes to state legislature because of the report is not a criminal indictment and the attorney general of New York said that today that she can't pursue criminal charges, that other charges can be pursued it's up to the legislature to do this. And that comes down to Cuomo Democrats being loyal to him and the left in New York who is thirsty to get Cuomo out because they are on the side of the attorney general, and that's where it does get very political. So, in terms of whether he will hold on or not is to be foreseen, but based on other scandals that Democrats have been through and survived, I would say he can survive.",

And he's just saying, I'm going to ride this thing out. Unless he borrows a black face from Governor Northam, he might end up sticking around. I love the montage. The logic makes no sense.

So great, we love the fact that you're tackling discrimination even though that's already against the law and that you're talking about gender equity and all of that stuff, but it sounds to me and to a lot of people like we don't have a government.

And I think we're losing confidence because we don't know where to put it. The government is all over the map. The scientists don't know what is going on half of the time and it's not a blame game. It's just because things change, but we've lost so much trust in our institutions. I also find it interesting that, you know, when they were talking about the unvaccinated and the vaccinated, the topic of race has totally disappeared to. We live at a time where -- and that's all the media does, is inject race into everything. But they now know that the statistics about the non- vaccinated, there's ethnic data in there and they don't want to touch it. So, it was more fun making fun of, you know, the rednecks, I guess. But you can't do that now, so what do you do? You don't have a message. You don't have a plan.",

But when it comes to this, they don't want to be held accountable for the state or the government forcing black and brown people to take a vaccine that they maybe have legitimate questions about that the CDC has been confusing about, that the president has been unclear about. And yet now they are saying that your livelihood is going to go away if you don't submit to this mandate by the government. And when he talks about, you know, creating a subclass and that you'll have a better life if you do take this, meaning the opposite is what your life is going to be miserable if you don't, I think that that's a big problem for the long term outside of COVID considering all the things the government has said they have the power to do over the last year, whether it's shutting down churches, taking away other constitutional rights that you have. That's a larger issue moving forward. But on the issue of Ron DeSantis real quickly, there is this new thing called DeSantis derangement syndrome. He was the one who was able to protect the seniors, get them vaccinated when the vaccine came out and keep his economy open in Florida. And the White House is looking at him for 2024, which is why they bring it up every single day in the briefing room to attack him.

So, you had a piece on The Hill newspaper, I believe it was last Thursday, in which they quoted somebody who was an ally to the White House and an ally to Kamala Harris personally, in which he said, or she said, nobody could point to anything she is doing well. If you would have said she's doing great, you would have to say, on what. Now, that's not a Republican saying that, that's not a conservative saying that, and that is actually on the merits of what is she doing well, not about who she is or what gender she is or what color she is. In addition to that on these COVID numbers, as they start to come down and people start to connect the dots, you'll see that the immigration issue again, starts to pull them down even further. In this $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that they want to do, there's a path to citizenship for 22 million Americans. So, you could legalize an additional 22 million without even touching the border issue, which apparently is the root cause. And gain, polls show that that one is really bad as well. And it puts all of those people -- again, you might on the merits say that they deserve a path to citizenship, but what about all the people that are already in line and trying to do it legally and waiting for the State Department to catch up?",

Now, this report was written by an A.G. who has aspirations politically. And it said all these women were uncomfortable, scared, humiliated, and offended. And the A.G. found his responses contrived and lacking credibility. And then he just denied everything and said that it was interpreted or even accuse some of the women of initiating the physical contact. Some of the stuff was interesting. It could be like obvious misinterpretation. So he brings some woman into his office and he shows the woman a humidor that President Clinton had given as a gift."

Now, he counters that he shows people that come into his office gifts from all types of people. And one of the things he says that inside the humidor here we have legal Cuban cigars. We got these cigars before the embargo was put up. So that's open to interpretation. The video was incredible because I actually thought it was convincing until he shows videos and pictures of Obama hugging hurricane victims and George H.W. Bush hugging Katrina victims. The line is you can hug or kiss on the cheek. He was grabbing you know what and kissing on the mouth. That is unacceptable. So he says New Yorkers aren't naive and they're not going to go for this and they know it is political. And you know what, maybe it's an Italian thing, right?

I mean, the news that was just made right before the show is that Joe Biden stood by what he had said back in I think March or April, in which he said that if he's found to be guilty, he should be resign. And that he might even be prosecuted. So, President Biden though, Katie, just now in his press conference, he doesn't answer the question by saying Andrew Cuomo should resign. He just says yes, yes, so that you don't actually have the words, but the meaning is there. He is calling on the governor to resign. Does Cuomo survive this part?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, back in March, Joe Biden walked himself into a corner by answering a hypothetical because the question was if these things turn out to be true, will you ask him to resign or should he resign. He said yes. So today, he had the option of going back on his word or saying that he should resign by simply answering the question yes. If I were advising Governor Cuomo, being paid to advise him or if I were his brother who is an anchor at another network, I would advise him not to resign. I would say the Democratic Party has made mistakes on this before. Al Franken is one of them. Bill Clinton went on after the '90s to be a star of the Democratic Party, made a lot of, you know, people famous. He had a lot of endorsements, made a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation. And when it comes to state legislature because of the report is not a criminal indictment and the attorney general of New York said that today that she can't pursue criminal charges, that other charges can be pursued it's up to the legislature to do this. And that comes down to Cuomo Democrats being loyal to him and the left in New York who is thirsty to get Cuomo out because they are on the side of the attorney general, and that's where it does get very political. So, in terms of whether he will hold on or not is to be foreseen, but based on other scandals that Democrats have been through and survived, I would say he can survive."

But, I mean, at this point, he has more accusers than supporters, but he also -- we are like watching two stories at the same time. The actual story itself and will the media have the attention span and not get exhausted by the story before we do, before we should. So he is counting on that because he understands how the cycle works. We report, report, report and then we watch our ratings dip and we move on to something else. And he's just saying, I'm going to ride this thing out. Unless he borrows a black face from Governor Northam, he might end up sticking around. I love the montage. The logic makes no sense. Imagine if Dana showed people pictures of Jasper and Jasper's on your lap and you're kissing Jasper and then you (inaudible). But I do it with my dog. I do it with my dog, you know?"

That is a political document. A document put together by the furthest left politician in elective office in this far left state. Letitia James, I've known her forever. She is absolutely furiously longing for Andrew Cuomo's job. I'm not saying that the allegations are false so I make no judgment about that. I just want people to know this is not proof. This is politics. Now comes the legal process. He has due process rights just like anybody else, and I would urge him as Katie did, to tough it out, make your case, prove that you, you know, well you don't have to prove your innocence, but prove that these allegations against you are false. You know, your father weathered his own storms, different type storms. One for Mayor Mario Cuomo. You know, this very public family, Matilda, the mother, still alive, wonderful lady. I think that -- I'd give him at least 50/50 maybe --"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, I would like to step back and talk about why America is losing confidence in the fight against COVID if we have seen that polling. And I think it has to do with everything we just heard here. A lot of things about the press briefings in general that you see, a lot of efforts are focused on virtue signaling, which I hate to use these days, but social messaging that have no impact on American confidence, right? So great, we love the fact that you're tackling discrimination even though that's already against the law and that you're talking about gender equity and all of that stuff, but it sounds to me and to a lot of people like we don't have a government. We have a junior college administration, right? Where no one learns anything but damn it, the brochure is as colorful and wonderful as a Benetton ad. It's like that's how it is. And I think we're losing confidence because we don't know where to put it. The government is all over the map. The scientists don't know what is going on half of the time and it's not a blame game. It's just because things change, but we've lost so much trust in our institutions. I also find it interesting that, you know, when they were talking about the unvaccinated and the vaccinated, the topic of race has totally disappeared to. We live at a time where -- and that's all the media does, is inject race into everything. But they now know that the statistics about the non- vaccinated, there's ethnic data in there and they don't want to touch it. So, it was more fun making fun of, you know, the rednecks, I guess. But you can't do that now, so what do you do? You don't have a message. You don't have a plan."

Just now, the president said, he's talked to constitutional scholars. Some say it passes mustard, some say it doesn't. So what are they going to do? They're going to have the CDC issue yet another moratorium. It will likely be seen as unconstitutional but not for three or four months. So then what have you done?

Conveniently, the left uses race as a political weapon all the time. But when it comes to this, they don't want to be held accountable for the state or the government forcing black and brown people to take a vaccine that they maybe have legitimate questions about that the CDC has been confusing about, that the president has been unclear about. And yet now they are saying that your livelihood is going to go away if you don't submit to this mandate by the government. And when he talks about, you know, creating a subclass and that you'll have a better life if you do take this, meaning the opposite is what your life is going to be miserable if you don't, I think that that's a big problem for the long term outside of COVID considering all the things the government has said they have the power to do over the last year, whether it's shutting down churches, taking away other constitutional rights that you have. That's a larger issue moving forward. But on the issue of Ron DeSantis real quickly, there is this new thing called DeSantis derangement syndrome. He was the one who was able to protect the seniors, get them vaccinated when the vaccine came out and keep his economy open in Florida. And the White House is looking at him for 2024, which is why they bring it up every single day in the briefing room to attack him. And if you want to talk about rising cases, yes, in a free society, which are now the red states, there is risk. People will get sick from things, not everybody but this idea that nobody is ever going to get sick again is absolutely ridiculous. It's not going to happen."

It would teach me that a cop could sue someone who hurt him, particularly -- him or her -- particularly if it was adjudicated. If the protester was tried and convicted of assault, then the cop certainly could have access to the civil courts for damages. I like the message though, Katie. I like the fact that we're saying that, you know, cops are people too. How dare you? That cop is representing a lot of other people. And they were way out of line in those riots and the looting.

If you would have said she's doing great, you would have to say, on what. Now, that's not a Republican saying that, that's not a conservative saying that, and that is actually on the merits of what is she doing well, not about who she is or what gender she is or what color she is. In addition to that on these COVID numbers, as they start to come down and people start to connect the dots, you'll see that the immigration issue again, starts to pull them down even further. In this $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that they want to do, there's a path to citizenship for 22 million Americans. So, you could legalize an additional 22 million without even touching the border issue, which apparently is the root cause. And gain, polls show that that one is really bad as well.
