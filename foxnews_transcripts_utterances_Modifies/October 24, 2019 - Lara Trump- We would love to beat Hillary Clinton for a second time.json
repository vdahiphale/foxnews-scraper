Today, he called out what he sees as a shameful double standard in the impeachment process.  Also, the new Peter Strzok e-mail exchange that was uncovered tonight where he predicts that there will be quote, a crescendo of leaks that will come out in defense of James Comey right after he was fired by President Trump.  And just moments ago, the Inspector General Michael Horowitz has broken his week's long silence on the status of his highly anticipated report on FISA abuse. We'll tell you about that.  Gregg Jarrett is going to be here as well. Also, he will join us on the subject of the meetings that Attorney General Barr has been having overseas, and some of the feedback on what's going on there. So, good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.”",

They're interviewing people behind closed doors, the president can't confront his accusers and Democrats are selectively leaking out information to drive down his poll numbers.   This is a sham. This is -- this -- that every American should be bothered about what they're doing to President Trump. And my resolution today calls on the House to embrace the process that was given to President Clinton. The ability to call witnesses on your behalf and to ask questions of your accusers. And by the way, who the hell is the whistleblower and when we going to know and what's their bias?

Today, he called out what he sees as a shameful double standard in the impeachment process. Also, the new Peter Strzok e-mail exchange that was uncovered tonight where he predicts that there will be quote, a crescendo of leaks that will come out in defense of James Comey right after he was fired by President Trump. And just moments ago, the Inspector General Michael Horowitz has broken his week's long silence on the status of his highly anticipated report on FISA abuse. We'll tell you about that. Gregg Jarrett is going to be here as well. Also, he will join us on the subject of the meetings that Attorney General Barr has been having overseas, and some of the feedback on what's going on there.

      "utterance": "This is still America, I hope. You know, everybody in America deserves due process including Donald Trump. What's happening in the House should worry every American about the future of the presidency. They had an impeachment inquiry vote and it failed. A 130 something Democrats voted against an impeachment inquiry. So they started this behind-closed-doors process. It's not going through the Judiciary Committee; it's in the Intel Committee. They're interviewing people behind closed doors, the president can't confront his accusers and Democrats are selectively leaking out information to drive down his poll numbers. This is a sham. This is -- this -- that every American should be bothered about what they're doing to President Trump. And my resolution today calls on the House to embrace the process that was given to President Clinton. The ability to call witnesses on your behalf and to ask questions of your accusers. And by the way, who the hell is the whistleblower and when we going to know and what's their bias? So, yes, I was fired up because whether you like President Trump or not, what they're doing to him is basically un-American."

And going back to then, you said the depositions I think will determine whether or not we go forward with the hearings and I think that that's a very smart thing to do. So, the question is, you know, what's the difference? How is the process different now?"
    },

We did have depositions, but President Clinton was included completely. The bottom line is you can have depositions outside of public, but the entire impeachment process was in public. Ken Starr spent five years investigating Bill Clinton. He testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee before the whole country was asked questions under oath. President Clinton was given the ability to call witnesses on his behalf."

They give you a 15-page opening statement, but they don't share with you questions like, have you ever met President Trump? Do you know personally there was a quid pro quo?

All I'm asking is to give President Trump the same rights at Nixon and Clinton had -- the ability to defend yourself. How would you like to be accused of something that could destroy your presidency and they won't even tell you who the witness is? The whistleblower is still anonymous to this day.

Anybody who thinks that a senator is going to call a congressman to testify doesn't understand our constitutional democracy. He may be a fact witness but so is President Trump. Do you really want to call President Trump as a fact witness? We've got a process in place in the Senate where the Intel committees looking the whistleblower complaint. What I can promise your audience is I'm going to do everything I can to shed light on -- light scrutiny on the House process. Every Republican should be behind my resolution, and hopefully, some Democrats condemning what I think is a kangaroo court in the House. What does it matter, if we can get enough senators to say, we don't believe the process in the House is legitimate, I will move to dismiss any article for impeachment that comes out of this sham process. That's why this is important."

    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

The president of Ukraine has said he was not threatened by President Trump regarding conducting an investigation tied to accepting military aid. At the time of the phone call, they didn't even know that the aid was suspended. So, I don't care what Bolton says, I don't care what Taylor says, you can't have a crime unless you have a victim. There is no victim here. We can talk about this that the cow has come home. Mueller went enough, they're trying to destroy this guy's presidency, it's always something, and this is a bunch of B.S.

I know you got time, but president was very together today. General Milley presented a plan to protect us against the rise of ISIS, keep the oil fields out of the hands of ISIS and Iran -- there's like $45 million a month. Secure those oil fields so the money won't go to our enemies, make sure it goes to our allies like the Kurds. The president has a plan in place, I'm very encouraged about what I see.

You traveled to Italy and meet in a secure room at the embassy to review the videotape deposition of Joseph Mifsud, you had reason to believe that something bad had been going on. And there is some evidence and you've talked to George Papadopoulos, that Mifsud was part of this operation, this organization to feed disinformation into the Trump campaign so the FBI could use it as a pretext to launch their investigation of Trump. We don't know the answers to that, but it seems Bill Barr wants the answer."

He can only rely on his intelligence agents who are all about secrecy, and you know, they don't always tell the truth. So he's not exactly a reliable source of information.

And Page says, did you see this story? He says, No, I hadn't seen it, but thank you for sending it. I think there will be a crescendo of leaks and articles leading up to Thursday.

That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean she won't do it in the future but she has no plans. And here's something really interesting with, about her. That crowd was largely establishment, right, middle -- moderate Democrats and a lot of conservatives, and they loved her. The -- she -- I mean, listen, she has a name recognition problem, you know, running for a national office but when she gets in front of people, from what I understand, she offers -- she offers sort of commentary and positions that transcend the liberal conservative sort of dynamic.

They work day in and day out under intense scrutiny from everyone. And you know what, I think Jared has shown that some of the things that he's working on right now, some of the folks he's met with, and again, I don't work in the White House, but I know that he's gotten farther than a lot of folks in the past with the pedigree that I think Joe Biden has probably referring to. But, you know, it's a little ridiculous to hear Joe Biden claimed that the president or somehow our family isn't working wholeheartedly for the American people. Donald Trump gave up an incredible business career, spent millions of dollars of his own money to run for president in -- whenever he became president, the Trump family got out of international business, much different than the Biden family who, whenever Joe Biden became vice president, you saw that Hunter Biden got into international business."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

We're not sure what they wanted, but I mean, it's very puculiar that this dad is the vice president and somehow with absolutely zero experience he gets paid that money to work for a company which he has no background whatsoever. Jared and Ivanka, I think are very different. Listen, they are worldly people, they've traveled the world, they know a lot of different groups of people. They have a lot of different friends, and whenever you put them in a position like Jared and Ivanka have put themselves in. Again, with no pay, Martha. They are not taking any money to do these jobs, you know. I think they get criticized nonstop. I don't think it's fair. You look at the incredible stuff that Ivanka particularly has done with women, with doubling the child tax credit, with so many of the things that this administration has done, and yet, she gets no credit for it, instead, they always get criticized.

They are using real pain, the suffering of children in Africa, for instance, to dramatize what is really a kind of millennial narcissism of feeling that the world is not pampering them enough. This is not what the job is.
