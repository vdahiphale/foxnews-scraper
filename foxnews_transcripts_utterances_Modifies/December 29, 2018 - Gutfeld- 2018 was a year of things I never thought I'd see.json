Rodman first showed a knack for international diplomacy in 1997, teaming up with the muscles from Brussels, Jean-Claude Van Damme for the groundbreaking film \"Double Team.\" A year later, he married Carmen Elektra, who quickly divorced him because he was too devoted to bringing about world peace. Soon after, he finished his pro career with 11,954 rebounds.  For comparison, the 2007 Nobel Prize winner Al Gore had zero career rebounds. Was he always a dreamer? Was he always a fighter? When people wanted to wear brightly dyed hair in public, Rodman was there. When \"Celebrity Apprentice\" needed a boost, Rodman was there. And he didn't quit.  When the world needed to solve the problem of North Korea, Rodman was there to save our planet from nuclear annihilation. Dennis Rodman, the clear choice for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize.",

Life as we know it, done.\" \"\"Oxygen cut off at 6:00 a.m. Water is depleted.\" I just enjoy that \"Morning Joe\" falling apart. Like I wouldn't - I didn't have to watch the actual shows because that would have been sick. But - I'm not sick in a sense like they don't - they're not newsworthy, it's just they are so upset and it's kind of like when you're being - and I've been mean before and like you're winning an argument and you see the person you're arguing was getting upset. You know, \"Are you going to cry? You're going to cry?\" You know what I am saying? And you would - and you want them to cry. You need them to cry and with Don Lemon, I didn't have to say, \"You're going to cry?\" I'm just waiting on the screen. He's going to cry. He is going to cry. He is going to cry. Over something that literally doesn't affect him at all. You know, like it just kills me how much the President of the United States affected everyone's daily life.

Why? Because he was duped and robbed by his own party. So regardless of his age - I think, age, we've got to watch that because if he's - you can't really - I mean, President Trump is older, too. I think, he's got his faculties together and he's in 70s you know, whatever. But I think the Democrats are going to be a situation like with John McCain, they kind of felt like that he got snubbed and he the way he was treated when he ran against Bush, so they kind of like, yes, we'll let him run.

Rodman first showed a knack for international diplomacy in 1997, teaming up with the muscles from Brussels, Jean-Claude Van Damme for the groundbreaking film \"Double Team.\" A year later, he married Carmen Elektra, who quickly divorced him because he was too devoted to bringing about world peace. Soon after, he finished his pro career with 11,954 rebounds. For comparison, the 2007 Nobel Prize winner Al Gore had zero career rebounds. Was he always a dreamer? Was he always a fighter? When people wanted to wear brightly dyed hair in public, Rodman was there. When \"Celebrity Apprentice\" needed a boost, Rodman was there. And he didn't quit. When the world needed to solve the problem of North Korea, Rodman was there to save our planet from nuclear annihilation. Dennis Rodman, the clear choice for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize."

Life as we know it, done.\" \"\"Oxygen cut off at 6:00 a.m. Water is depleted.\" I just enjoy that \"Morning Joe\" falling apart. Like I wouldn't - I didn't have to watch the actual shows because that would have been sick. But - I'm not sick in a sense like they don't - they're not newsworthy, it's just they are so upset and it's kind of like when you're being - and I've been mean before and like you're winning an argument and you see the person you're arguing was getting upset. You know, \"Are you going to cry? You're going to cry?\" You know what I am saying? And you would - and you want them to cry. You need them to cry and with Don Lemon, I didn't have to say, \"You're going to cry?\" I'm just waiting on the screen. He's going to cry. He is going to cry. He is going to cry. Over something that literally doesn't affect him at all. You know, like it just kills me how much the President of the United States affected everyone's daily life. So not much, but they really, really, really acted like you can smell the fire because literally Satan is coming behind him. Like he is, \"This is last broadcast.

I am really not concerned with who's in a poll now. Have we not learned anything about polls? Literally? No one - anyone here answer their home phone anymore? No, exactly. And if someone calls you and says \"Hi, you've got a minute to talk about,\" \"Click.\" I mean. So the people who are actually answering these polls have a lot of time on their hands and chances are, they're not who we would want telling us who's going to run. Bernie gets a lot of sympathy. Why? Because he was duped and robbed by his own party. So regardless of his age - I think, age, we've got to watch that because if he's - you can't really - I mean, President Trump is older, too. I think, he's got his faculties together and he's in 70s you know, whatever. But I think the Democrats are going to be a situation like with John McCain, they kind of felt like that he got snubbed and he the way he was treated when he ran against Bush, so they kind of like, yes, we'll let him run. Honestly also, I don't think any Democrat with a brain is going to want to run against President Trump because the chances are just - you're going to waste it. So why not give it to somebody that like, \"I like Bernie.\" It's his turn. It's his due. Let him have it. If he wins, great; because I think most of the real players of the Democratic Party can probably wait - wait it out."

It would be a different conversation and probably a lot of you right here. I can't breathe. Didn't ask you. Like it's -- I am just -- I don't like holidays. I can't stand them. So I try to be the worst guy in the room that nobody bothers where they whisper like, \"Just leave him alone.\" Like, \"You know how he is.\""

Maybe a special guest, we don't know, but working on that, but yes, so New Year's Eve come hang out with me while we judge everybody and complain about, \"Wow, ball dropping. So awesome. The world is changing. It's amazing.\" We'll do some scavenger hunts. We'll do some fun stuff and hang out with people who aren't wearing their pants because they won't give up their spots so they pee on themselves."
