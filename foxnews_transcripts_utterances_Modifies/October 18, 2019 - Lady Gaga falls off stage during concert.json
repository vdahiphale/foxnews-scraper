All the way back to 2015 oh boy, Corey Lewandowski, Chris Hahn. They're here in moments to debate the fall out over the explosive new reporting today. Plus, we may have our first hint of exactly who special prosecutor John Durham is looking at in his inquiry into the start of the Trump, Russia probe. George Papadopoulos saying he lived through this spite story and is here tonight with his new insight on it.  Plus, Hillary Clinton's unhinged attack have you seen these and Tulsi Gabbard, some witch is planning to curse President Trump on Halloween and Witch Pop Star suffered an unfortunate stage fall. Raymond Arroyo has it all in Friday follies.  But first, I want to break down a telling headline that caught my attention today from AXIOS. American diplomacy is crumbling under Trump very understated \"Some of America's most seasoned diplomats are warning that President Trump is wounded American diplomacy so severely that it could take generations to heal\" Generations to heal?  How long will it take to heal from the diplomatic missteps and forever wars that have now become the go to policy apparently of the elite in both parties? Well, you see the permanent bureaucratic class now pretending that they are the experts in all the things they've screwed up for years. And how couldn't they? Well, come on, some of them have been through multiple administrations. This is their bread and butter. Presidents come and go they say, but the diplomatic core in the lifetime civil servants, come on, they remain.  How do you know that they think they're better, just listen to the dramatic language they use to describe an administration that has decided to do things a bit differently.",

We don't need diplomats who work for the European Union or the UN or the Democratic Party. We need diplomats who will serve the American people instead of lecturing them.   So who are some of these folks? Let me introduce you to current Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor.

Lee, thank you so much, great to see you. And we are learning more and more about Hunter Biden's troubling ties to Ukraine. First, a source telling Fox News that a top career State Department Official testified in Congress this week that he sounded the alarm on Hunter's Ukraine dealings back in 2015. It was ignored. He was turned away by members of Joe Biden's team. That is not all.  It turns out the younger Biden was not paid $50,000 a month. So we were wrong about that by the Ukrainian Natural Gas Company. He was paid more! Two sources telling Reuters tonight \"Records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were made to Rosemont for consulting services\".  The two sources said that one of those monthly payments was intended for Biden. That adds up to $1.5 million over 18 months all while his father was overseeing Ukraine policy and for a guy that has zero experience in the industry. Here now is Corey Lewandowski Former Trump Campaign Manager. Chris Hahn, Former Aide to Senator Chuck Schummer and a Host of the \"Aggressive Progressive\" podcast. All right, Corey, this keeps getting - it gets worse and worse for poor old Joe. What do you think about this testimony this week about the 2015 warnings that were disregarded?  COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, the deputy - Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent made this alarm to the Vice President's Office, what we are now hearing he has testified to this week and the Vice President's Office responded, Joe Biden's office said \"We are too busy to deal with this. This is not a priority that his son is selling influence to the Biden/Obama Administration\". That is really what this is about. When it's the Democrats doing this they turn a blind eye to it. This is the first we are hearing about this, but we haven't seen any of the mainstream media covering this because this is an attack on Joe Biden. The liberal left is rallying around Joe Biden and the truth is we know what Hunter Biden has now said.   If his father gets elected President he won't join any foreign boards. He won't try to influence his father. That is like me saying if I'm in the NBA I'll stop slam-dunking on top of people. It's just not going to happen and we know that. These are false promises.",

CNN covered the fact that he claims that Rudy Giuliani was pushing for the prosecutor and his visa. He might have been involved with that. So they picked something that they thought would be negative to the President about some of the testimony this week, but this wasn't really covered anywhere else. Is it at all important to you? CHRIS HAHN, \"AGGRESSIVE PROGRESSIVE\" PODCAST: Yes, I think it's very important to me. I think that Biden's mishandled this and I am for any direct member of a family of a President or Vice President having no foreign entanglements whatsoever. In fact, I hope Corey would join me right now to encourage Congress to pass a law tomorrow that would ban Presidents and their immediate families and Vice Presidents and their immediate family from having any foreign investments, overseas that are not managed by a blind trust. I think we can all agree that we should get away from this because even the appearance of a conflict is a bad thing when you are President or a Vice President in this country. Unfortunately the President right now has conflicts of interest all over the world including 100 investments in Turkey that should be in a blind trust and not influencing his decision- making as President of United States.",

He is the mysterious Maltese professor who sparked the entire Russia probe. On hearing the news my next guest remarked, I lived to this spice story. And boy, does he want to know what's on those black berries.  Joining me now George Papadopoulos Author of the book \"Deep state target\".

What did you mean by that very ominous line, and hearing that these Mifsud Blackberries have been taken by the U.S. government? GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, AUTHOR OF \"DEEP STATE TARGET\": Thanks lot for having me Laura. Basically how I would summarize this. The grand statesman under Rome Cicero, do you know what he said? He said that a nation can survive the ambitious and the fools but it can't survive treason from within. What I think happened in 2016 and all the events surrounding the 2016 campaign and the spying that took place on me and Michael Flynn and others was tantamount to treason.  What happened was there was an intelligence agency with an axe to grind against both candidates Trump and obviously President Trump where we see the Russia hoax now evolving into Ukraine gates. This is not going to stop. I predicted that Joseph Mifsud, an individual who was - both his Blackberries are now in the hands of the DOJ was a western intelligence agent, I wrote about it in my book. Exactly how I came into contact with this person who introduced me to him and what he wanted? Something I did not know and what something that actually surprised me very much is that Joseph Mifsud was also spying on Michael Flynn just two months before he started his encounters with me.

All the way back to 2015 oh boy, Corey Lewandowski, Chris Hahn. They're here in moments to debate the fall out over the explosive new reporting today. Plus, we may have our first hint of exactly who special prosecutor John Durham is looking at in his inquiry into the start of the Trump, Russia probe. George Papadopoulos saying he lived through this spite story and is here tonight with his new insight on it. Plus, Hillary Clinton's unhinged attack have you seen these and Tulsi Gabbard, some witch is planning to curse President Trump on Halloween and Witch Pop Star suffered an unfortunate stage fall. Raymond Arroyo has it all in Friday follies. But first, I want to break down a telling headline that caught my attention today from AXIOS. American diplomacy is crumbling under Trump very understated \"Some of America's most seasoned diplomats are warning that President Trump is wounded American diplomacy so severely that it could take generations to heal\" Generations to heal? How long will it take to heal from the diplomatic missteps and forever wars that have now become the go to policy apparently of the elite in both parties? Well, you see the permanent bureaucratic class now pretending that they are the experts in all the things they've screwed up for years. And how couldn't they? Well, come on, some of them have been through multiple administrations. This is their bread and butter. Presidents come and go they say, but the diplomatic core in the lifetime civil servants, come on, they remain. How do you know that they think they're better, just listen to the dramatic language they use to describe an administration that has decided to do things a bit differently."

The real danger to America diplomacy is from the career officials who think it's a good idea to side with one party to overthrow a President supported by another party. I think the real danger to American diplomacy is from career officials who presided over years of failure and decline and are somehow never held responsible for their failure. We don't need diplomats who work for the European Union or the UN or the Democratic Party. We need diplomats who will serve the American people instead of lecturing them. So who are some of these folks? Let me introduce you to current Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor.

Belanger served as A Senior Official in President George W. Bush's Administration including stints at the National Security Council and - the State Department's top lawyer. That's not all. He was also one of a number of prominent never Trump Republicans. It's the revenge always isn't it and the foreign policy establishment who publicly opposed Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016. Does u see where I'm going here? It's all becoming a little more clear to you. Joining me now is someone who knows all about this stuff, better than most. Lee Smith, Investigative Journalist and Author of the upcoming book, \"The Plot Against the President.\" Lee, the one thing that all these bureaucrats have in common is their deep disdain.

A lot of this has to do with Ukraine. State Department Officials, Former State Department Officials, many senior officials in the Obama Administration got involved in some very bad things during the Obama years. I think that one of the - one of the reasons they are responding loudly is because what Joe Biden and his son did in Ukraine is just the tip of the iceberg. There are some very bad things that went on at the State Department and the President and Rudy Giuliani are correct to look at Ukraine. Not a coincidence that is happening."

Lee, thank you so much, great to see you. And we are learning more and more about Hunter Biden's troubling ties to Ukraine. First, a source telling Fox News that a top career State Department Official testified in Congress this week that he sounded the alarm on Hunter's Ukraine dealings back in 2015. It was ignored. He was turned away by members of Joe Biden's team. That is not all. It turns out the younger Biden was not paid $50,000 a month. So we were wrong about that by the Ukrainian Natural Gas Company. He was paid more! Two sources telling Reuters tonight \"Records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were made to Rosemont for consulting services\". The two sources said that one of those monthly payments was intended for Biden. That adds up to $1.5 million over 18 months all while his father was overseeing Ukraine policy and for a guy that has zero experience in the industry. Here now is Corey Lewandowski Former Trump Campaign Manager. Chris Hahn, Former Aide to Senator Chuck Schummer and a Host of the \"Aggressive Progressive\" podcast. All right, Corey, this keeps getting - it gets worse and worse for poor old Joe. What do you think about this testimony this week about the 2015 warnings that were disregarded? COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, the deputy - Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent made this alarm to the Vice President's Office, what we are now hearing he has testified to this week and the Vice President's Office responded, Joe Biden's office said \"We are too busy to deal with this. This is not a priority that his son is selling influence to the Biden/Obama Administration\". That is really what this is about. When it's the Democrats doing this they turn a blind eye to it. This is the first we are hearing about this, but we haven't seen any of the mainstream media covering this because this is an attack on Joe Biden. The liberal left is rallying around Joe Biden and the truth is we know what Hunter Biden has now said. If his father gets elected President he won't join any foreign boards. He won't try to influence his father. That is like me saying if I'm in the NBA I'll stop slam-dunking on top of people. It's just not going to happen and we know that. These are false promises."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All right, well, Chris, your response here. There was some coverage of this George Kent testimony. CNN covered the fact that he claims that Rudy Giuliani was pushing for the prosecutor and his visa. He might have been involved with that. So they picked something that they thought would be negative to the President about some of the testimony this week, but this wasn't really covered anywhere else. Is it at all important to you? CHRIS HAHN, \"AGGRESSIVE PROGRESSIVE\" PODCAST: Yes, I think it's very important to me. I think that Biden's mishandled this and I am for any direct member of a family of a President or Vice President having no foreign entanglements whatsoever. In fact, I hope Corey would join me right now to encourage Congress to pass a law tomorrow that would ban Presidents and their immediate families and Vice Presidents and their immediate family from having any foreign investments, overseas that are not managed by a blind trust. I think we can all agree that we should get away from this because even the appearance of a conflict is a bad thing when you are President or a Vice President in this country. Unfortunately the President right now has conflicts of interest all over the world including 100 investments in Turkey that should be in a blind trust and not influencing his decision- making as President of United States."

You are not there as part of a permanent opposition grouping. That is not how our country works. If the Democrats want to go down this road is going to be a very ugly road and other administrations and I don't think they want that. I don't think they want that. Okay, guys, we have got to go. I have to go. I love how it goes down, the volume goes down. All this brings us back to where we began. The probe, Trump/Russia collusion now remember in the course of this investigation John Durham the U.S. attorney has reportedly obtained - we learn this just today two Blackberry phones that were used by Joseph Mifsud. He is the mysterious Maltese professor who sparked the entire Russia probe. On hearing the news my next guest remarked, I lived to this spice story. And boy, does he want to know what's on those black berries. Joining me now George Papadopoulos Author of the book \"Deep state target\". George, you just heard the previous conversation and you can comment on that if you want. What did you mean by that very ominous line, and hearing that these Mifsud Blackberries have been taken by the U.S. government? GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, AUTHOR OF \"DEEP STATE TARGET\": Thanks lot for having me Laura. Basically how I would summarize this. The grand statesman under Rome Cicero, do you know what he said? He said that a nation can survive the ambitious and the fools but it can't survive treason from within. What I think happened in 2016 and all the events surrounding the 2016 campaign and the spying that took place on me and Michael Flynn and others was tantamount to treason. What happened was there was an intelligence agency with an axe to grind against both candidates Trump and obviously President Trump where we see the Russia hoax now evolving into Ukraine gates. This is not going to stop. I predicted that Joseph Mifsud, an individual who was - both his Blackberries are now in the hands of the DOJ was a western intelligence agent, I wrote about it in my book. Exactly how I came into contact with this person who introduced me to him and what he wanted? Something I did not know and what something that actually surprised me very much is that Joseph Mifsud was also spying on Michael Flynn just two months before he started his encounters with me. We are going to get to the bottom of exactly how both Michael Flynn and my fates have intertwined in this very bizarre story."

And as soon as I joined that campaign I had various State Department Officials at London and other Capitals around the world probing me and asking me all about Ben Carson and what he was up to and what the campaign's platform was all about? As soon as I leave that campaign and I joined the Donald Trump Campaign in March of 2016 before \"The Washington Post\" or the American media knew that I was joining this campaign I had Joseph Mifsud and other intelligence agencies knowing all about me and what I was doing? And what Donald Trump's campaign was all about? So the notion, that this investigation cross fire hurricane started spontaneously on July 31st, 2016 is absurd. I think John Durham and William Barr - it's completely absurd. And what we are going to finally realize is we're going to understand how soon do these intelligence agencies that had vested interests in the Clinton Presidency by the way. People forget that in 2016 the reason I'm being sued apparently now by the Italian Prime Minister is because the guy in 2016 - the Socialist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and David Cameron in 2016 and Morrison I think or whoever the leader was in Australia in 2016. These people detested Donald Trump's America First platform while American First might've been music to the ears of Americans and it was a ritual."

White guilt, Shelby Steele for many years has written about the phenomenon of white guilt to explain Affirmative Action and diversity programs, and so forth. But what of this? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: It's really ripping us apart. Here's the problem. America has come together with the Civil Rights Act, with the Voting Rights Act, with the Fair Housing Act, trillions of dollars in assistance to black, whites, and brown. We even tried a failed experiment with Affirmative Action. We've elected twice a black man to be president of United States. What can the American people do to demonstrate that they genuinely are concerned, they care, and they really want to embrace Martin Luther King's vision of a color-blind society? These people are saying we need to throw all of that out the window and start over with a new neo- segregation."

What do you think accounts for that?"

Because they don't want to go back to the days that Horace was talking about. They are upset with Trump. Let me finish. They're with Trump. They're saying, Laura, we don't care about our economic benefits under the Trump policy. He has made a racial divide in this country, and white Americans don't want that in this country anymore. They don't want it because it was part of our ugly past."

More importantly, and when Horace talks about Dr. King, Dr. King was alive when the Civil Rights Act passed and the Voting Rights Act passed, and Horace and I benefited from those acts. But the bottom is simply this, Laura, is that people are saying that Trump has created a racial divide, and white Americans, liberal white Americans are saying we are not going to have that."

The country described itself as more racially divided after eight years with the first African-American president that it had been before. Why was that? What was accounting for that? We had, of course, the Michael Brown case, we have Trayvon Martin, the situation at Harvard University where the president got involved in that break-in that wasn't a break in. But it wasn't after eight years of Obama where things calmed down. Eight years after Obama people seemed more hyped up on this issue. That's according to Gallup, by the way."

I'm saying, if Obama was the great racial healer, I'll accept that proposition if it were borne out in any of the studies or any of the polls, and it turns out it wasn't. We had all this racial strife, in Baltimore, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, all during the Obama years. All during his time. So what gives?"

I think that is -- it's not everything, but it equalizes some things, and it gives people hope that there's more economic opportunity. And I don't care if Obama did it or Trump did it. But this happened to have occurred under the Trump administration when everyone thought it wasn't going to happen. That's a good thing, and Democrats should admit that that is a good thing. That is my point. They should admit that's a good thing."

And when I realized he wasn't going to be there, I was like, man, do you want me to take the huddle? He was yes, man, get them hyped. But I knew the magnitude of it. I knew the magnitude of it because I've been in a lot of huddles. The ones that Drew leads that you hear at the Saints, that huddle is sacred."

So that that's focusing on the whole week of work, watching film, lifting weights, getting ready to study your opponent. So the prowl is where you study your opponent right before you go get him. Then the kill, that's where we go out and execute. Animals don't hunt for fun. They don't just go around and hunt. They hunt to survive. And so the only way that we eat, the only way that we survive, the only way that we all do good and everybody is rewarded is if we go out here and get this victory."
