Glenn Beck is here tonight. He's going to weigh in on the dire dangers of socialism and how it's real.  But we begin with the presidential campaign season in the Democratic Party.  It is now off to a disastrous, pathetic start. Socialism, oppressive taxes, open borders -- oh, and during and post birth abortions, advocated by some. They have now become hot issues in a party that has become even more radical.  And per usual, the mainstream media, they are providing the cover, the support to these candidates, their extreme ideas, very shady paths every step of the way. We'll investigate all of this. And that is the subject of tonight's Hannity Watch on the radical socialist 2020 Democrats. Right now at this hour, over a dozen presidential hopefuls have already thrown their hats in the ring. Many more are expected to declare before the year's end.  And late last week, former failed senatorial candidate Robert Francis O'Rourke, otherwise known as Beto \"Bozo\" O'Rourke, he announced his candidacy. The mainstream media, they do what they always do. They fell in love with Beto -- Robert Francis. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Thrills up the leg and everything.  Now, this love affair persisted for eight long years and beyond, and it was so bad, this program was one of the very few only shows to actually do the real vetting of future president of the United States, Barack Obama.  Remember, on this program, we show you Obama's ties to the radical, unrepentant Weather Underground domestic terrorists, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn? It was right here on this show, we revealed the true nature of Obama's longtime pastor, 20-plus years, Jeremiah Wright, and the church of GD America, rooted in black liberation theology which we explained to you -- and Frank Marshall Davis, and ACORN, and Alinsky, and community organizing.   And now, it is, once again, I guess up to us to vet the 2020 candidates, which we promise will be doing nightly and our predictions of a failed Obama presidency rooted in these radical views turned out to be more accurate than we would've wished for, for our country. If the media had done their job, America might have avoided that disaster.  They were Obama's cheerleaders every single day, even on the ridiculous hundred $50 billion Iranian deal.  Well, we can see history is not repeating. They, for example, the latest controversy surrounding \"Reuters\" and Robert Francis O'Rourke. On Friday, we learned that one of their reporters, \"Reuters?, sat for almost two years on an embarrassing story about O'Rourke's time as a renegade on linebacker until after his hotly contested race with Ted Cruz. In fact, a reporter name Joseph Menn entered into an agreement with Beto Bozo to delay his damning story, so long as O'Rourke granted him the interview.  Now, if it seems like the mainstream media and Democrats work together to win elections as one team? That is because they actually do. So-called journalists like Joseph Menn shielding Democrats from embarrassment by spiking or delaying certain reports, all while sticking it to President Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day, the matter how shaky the story, how weak the sourcing, if any sourcing. Take for example BuzzFeed's latest fake news embarrassment. Naturally, now that Bozo is running in the Democratic primary, not against a Republican, Senator Cruz, well, Menn's report in \"Reuters\" has been published. And its contents are downright shocking. As we continue to vet our candidates on our Hannity watch, according to multiple outlets, as a teenager O'Rourke helped found one of America's oldest hacking groups called \"the Cult of the Dead Cow.\" During his time in the hacking community, old Beto and his online friends install video games, stole long distance phone service for his dial-up modem, and engage in various other hacking efforts in the 1980s.   He had the name \"Psychedelic Warlord,\" and Bozo also frequently posted unusual, bizarre, strange, frightening writings on group message boards, including classifying certain women, quote, \"sluts,\" ultra trendies are usually the scene sluts that many menfolk admire so. And O'Rourke, aka Psychedelic Warlord, wrote the best way to deal with these girls was tell them that they are ugly. And O'Rourke also posted a violent, bizarre murder fantasy, writing, quote: One day as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street and as I neared the young ones, I put all of my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of two children on the hood and the sharp cry of pain from one of the two.  Pretty sick, ugly, twisted, dark story. It goes from there -- to be fair, Robert Francis was much younger at the time of this disturbing publication. But I ask this question:  I wonder if the media, the left, I wonder if they'll follow the Kavanaugh standard for Beto O'Rourke. Remember when they poured through Justice Kavanaugh's high school yearbook, all in an attempt to disqualify him from the Supreme Court? And that's not going to happen with Beto, or Bozo in that case.  That is just their standard for conservatives -- one standard for liberals, one standard for conservatives. In fact, this report about Beto has barely made a dent in the traditional news cycle.  Over the weekend, O'Rourke offered this heartfelt apology. Take a look.",

And referred to Barack Obama as, wow, storybooks, he's clean and articulate. Whether or not gaffe-prone Biden actually runs for president, he's using his public status much like the Clinton's to rake in millions. From six- figure speaking gigs to seven-figure book deals, Crazy Uncle Joe is turning his humble public service into a gold mine. If he runs, Biden would be just the latest Democrat to engage in class warfare politics, all while sitting on top of a mound of cash and the worst record of any political team, him and Obama, that we've seen in our lifetime.  Now, we are going to have a lot more on 2020 politics throughout the show and all through the year. But first, we must turn our attention to our important Hannity watch on the deep state tonight. We have brand-new information. We saw it with a brand-new \"USA Today\"/Suffolk University poll. One half of Americans now believe that President Trump is in fact a victim of a witch hunt being carried out by Robert Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors.  Now, it doesn't take a genius team of investigators to realize that collusion is a hoax. In fact, according to disgrace one time lead FBI investor Peter Strzok and his former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, they both said there was no evidence of collusion when the special counsel was elected, that's after they investigated for nine straight months before the appointment of Mueller. Here we are 670 days after the Mueller intensive probe, and as intense as it's been, still no collusion. None. Zero. Nothing. Yes, it's a witch hunt.  And meanwhile, thanks to the newly released deposition from Ohr, and Page, and Strzok, and Steele, and McCain associate David Kramer, we have shocking new evidence tonight detailing how a small group of high-ranking bureaucrats, how they're trying to use Hillary Clinton's phony, bought and paid for Russian dossier to take down Donald Trump. We now know tonight that Christopher Steele gave the dirty dossier with Russian lies to McCain associate David Kramer.  We know tonight that Kramer sometimes at the direction of Steele himself who hated Donald Trump literally spread the dossier's unverified, uncorroborated contents to 12 journalists at nine different news outlets.  Two state to prevent officials, including one connected to John Kerry.  Now, why? To use the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies to influence you, we, the people, before the elections, to influence the outcome of that election and worse. And here's the bottom line, according to Bruce Ohr, Christopher Steele hated Donald Trump, was desperate to malign him, as was Hillary Clinton, as was the popular echelon at the FBI, DOJ, not rank-and-file, as well as the corrupt news media in this country that just ran with these lies, never verified a thing. It was unverifiable because it wasn't true. And even though they all knew, all were told that this is unverified, uncorroborated, Hillary paid for it, and Steele hated Trump, a pack of lies, they tried to get a salacious contents, and they did out to the general public. Purposely lying, propagandizing, you, we, the American people.  We have top DOJ and FBI officials, those are the same people that saved Hillary Clinton from being indicted, something that would've happened to all of us. They worked on her behalf, used her lies to commit fraud on FISA courts, spy on the Trump campaign, before the election and after the election, and it's all becoming crystal clear tonight. But this is only the beginning. What we now have is the beginning of a cascade of information and materials that will be corroborating everything we have been telling you over the last two years. So, tonight, I can tell you, expect more damning revelations about how the dossier was written, where it's information was derived, and how high-ranking officials inside our federal government abused their power to help Hillary get elected and then later to take down Donald Trump. Now, we are on the cusp of what is an avalanche of new developments. Joining us now, the author of the number one bestseller, he nailed it in his book, \"The Russia Hoax\", Gregg Jarrett. Also joining us, FOX News investigative reporter, Sara Carter. Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows.   You know, Congressman, this got started with Sara and John, and thereafter with Gregg, very soon thereafter, and all throughout this process, we would have you on as a guest, at different times, radio and TV. And I'd always asked the same question: Am I wrong? Is there anything that you hear that I'm saying it wrong? I ask you, am I over the target?  And you said, you didn't see one thing that we reported that was wrong.  Now it's all being corroborated.",

In fact, it's a coordinated effort to make sure that they do it, to bring him down.  Here's the other interesting fact. You know, when you talk about Robert Mueller and Andrew McCabe and names that actually you've made household names, what we forget is, those are two individuals who actually wanted a job with this president and the minute they didn't get it, they started investigating him.

Let me explain this to you.  This is what happens in other countries with intelligent agencies do in other countries when they're targeting somebody in the government. So -- but instead, what happened is the FBI and the DOJ, the Justice Department, high-level officials within those departments who have the power, the access, and the authority, targeted the president of the United States. And they also targeted the Trump campaign. I don't understand how this cannot be one of the biggest stories in modern political history, and how Robert Mueller did not include that in his mandate is beyond me. But the most important thing is that William Barr, the new attorney general, and others inside the DOJ, have to launch a full- fledged investigation, and if not, open up a second special counsel to investigate everyone. This is probably one of the biggest stories, political stories, of our lifetime. And when we look at what they did and how they spread that information -- I mean, that's why they went to McCain's guy, right? David Kramer. They wanted to solidify that information.  So, once they got that to him and they moved it -- a lot of people didn't even want to report on this. I heard about this. A lot of reporters had heard about this dossier. But remember, it wasn't until Brennan and James Clapper actually briefed President Trump about this that BuzzFeed then published the entire dossier and CNN just shortly after wrote the story.  They wanted to make it real.

Remember, Al Gore claimed in 2006 that Mount Kilimanjaro would be snow-free within a decade and warned in 2007 the Arctic could be ice-free within five years. It's not just Al Gore. Remember the acid rain scare of the '70s and the '80s, warnings about the destruction of our forests turned out to be fueled by panic, bad science, yes, and a political agenda. Don't forget about the AP article from 1989 warning that we only have 10 years to save the planet. Well, now we're starting a new cycle, 12 years. Now, let me be clear, we should all be good stewards of our environment, we all want clean air and water and want healthy lives and to preserve mother nature. But pushing alarmism, fears about the world ending in 12 years to advance the most radical political agenda, it's not about any of that. It's designed to scare you, designed to make you sign on to a massive government takeover of your life where you'll be told where you can go to a doctor or what kind of car you can drive, where you're allowed to eat meat or not, just as Comrade Bill de Blasio, meat-free Mondays for kids in New York. Even eliminate planes, oil, gas, cows, and the combustion engine, all while the Green New Deal may have fresh faces like Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, it is full of the same old Democratic rhetoric and tricks. You know, keep your doctor plan and save money. Here now for reaction, author of the book, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change, publisher of climatedepot.com, Marc Morano, and along with Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Chris Horner. Chris, we start with you. Explain the nexus of the political agenda. First it's global, the ice age is coming, then it's warming, and then just general climate change. Because they got it wrong the other two times. CHRISTOPHER HORNER, COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW Well, it's very much in human nature to blame our neighbor for the weather. It led to an awful lot of witch burnings during the cooling, as you recall, and then the medieval warming previously called the climate optimum occurred. And then it got cold again. And then it began to warm. And Thomas Jefferson wrote about it right here in Charlottesville. People have seized upon this to push their agenda. The crops failed, the babies died, the witch next door did it. This isn't new. There was a brief period that ended around the time of Jimmy Carter disco. I'm not sure who to blame, where we stop blaming our neighbor. And then suddenly, as you pointed out, we had the cooling catastrophism. It's not about the climate. Just remember that. This terribly painful, costly, futile gesture is also a cruel one, but it's the noble lie. There's - none of these schemes, the Green New Deal, the Paris Treaty, would detectably impact the climate. Nobody claims they would. So it's about something. And you should know it by the company he keeps or you can read Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, and you'll see it extends an awful lot beyond pretending that the government can gently administer to the climate. It moves into the larger agenda, which it's always been about. It's not about the climate.",

In the 1960s and '70s, the environmental movement became radicalized. And you can go back. In the 1970s, John Holdren, Obama's former science czar, was out there promoting redistribution of wealth in order to fight what he saw as the greatest environmental, the existential threat of the time over populations, which those fears have now collapsed. And then, moving forward, you had other professors, 1974, 1970s, warning that we needed global government in order to fight environmental degradation and other issues. So if you go forward in the '70s and '80s, you had all these other scares.

Glenn Beck is here tonight. He's going to weigh in on the dire dangers of socialism and how it's real. But we begin with the presidential campaign season in the Democratic Party.  It is now off to a disastrous, pathetic start. Socialism, oppressive taxes, open borders -- oh, and during and post birth abortions, advocated by some. They have now become hot issues in a party that has become even more radical. And per usual, the mainstream media, they are providing the cover, the support to these candidates, their extreme ideas, very shady paths every step of the way. We'll investigate all of this. And that is the subject of tonight's Hannity Watch on the radical socialist 2020 Democrats. Right now at this hour, over a dozen presidential hopefuls have already thrown their hats in the ring. Many more are expected to declare before the year's end. And late last week, former failed senatorial candidate Robert Francis O'Rourke, otherwise known as Beto \"Bozo\" O'Rourke, he announced his candidacy. The mainstream media, they do what they always do. They fell in love with Beto -- Robert Francis. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Thrills up the leg and everything. Now, this love affair persisted for eight long years and beyond, and it was so bad, this program was one of the very few only shows to actually do the real vetting of future president of the United States, Barack Obama.  Remember, on this program, we show you Obama's ties to the radical, unrepentant Weather Underground domestic terrorists, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn? It was right here on this show, we revealed the true nature of Obama's longtime pastor, 20-plus years, Jeremiah Wright, and the church of GD America, rooted in black liberation theology which we explained to you -- and Frank Marshall Davis, and ACORN, and Alinsky, and community organizing. And now, it is, once again, I guess up to us to vet the 2020 candidates, which we promise will be doing nightly and our predictions of a failed Obama presidency rooted in these radical views turned out to be more accurate than we would've wished for, for our country. If the media had done their job, America might have avoided that disaster.  They were Obama's cheerleaders every single day, even on the ridiculous hundred $50 billion Iranian deal. Well, we can see history is not repeating. They, for example, the latest controversy surrounding \"Reuters\" and Robert Francis O'Rourke. On Friday, we learned that one of their reporters, \"Reuters?, sat for almost two years on an embarrassing story about O'Rourke's time as a renegade on linebacker until after his hotly contested race with Ted Cruz. In fact, a reporter name Joseph Menn entered into an agreement with Beto Bozo to delay his damning story, so long as O'Rourke granted him the interview. Now, if it seems like the mainstream media and Democrats work together to win elections as one team? That is because they actually do. So-called journalists like Joseph Menn shielding Democrats from embarrassment by spiking or delaying certain reports, all while sticking it to President Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day, the matter how shaky the story, how weak the sourcing, if any sourcing. Take for example BuzzFeed's latest fake news embarrassment. Naturally, now that Bozo is running in the Democratic primary, not against a Republican, Senator Cruz, well, Menn's report in \"Reuters\" has been published. And its contents are downright shocking. As we continue to vet our candidates on our Hannity watch, according to multiple outlets, as a teenager O'Rourke helped found one of America's oldest hacking groups called \"the Cult of the Dead Cow.\" During his time in the hacking community, old Beto and his online friends install video games, stole long distance phone service for his dial-up modem, and engage in various other hacking efforts in the 1980s. He had the name \"Psychedelic Warlord,\" and Bozo also frequently posted unusual, bizarre, strange, frightening writings on group message boards, including classifying certain women, quote, \"sluts,\" ultra trendies are usually the scene sluts that many menfolk admire so. And O'Rourke, aka Psychedelic Warlord, wrote the best way to deal with these girls was tell them that they are ugly. And O'Rourke also posted a violent, bizarre murder fantasy, writing, quote: One day as I was driving home from work, I noticed two children crossing the street and as I neared the young ones, I put all of my weight on my right foot, keeping the accelerator pedal on the floor until I heard the crashing of two children on the hood and the sharp cry of pain from one of the two. Pretty sick, ugly, twisted, dark story. It goes from there -- to be fair, Robert Francis was much younger at the time of this disturbing publication."

That is just their standard for conservatives -- one standard for liberals, one standard for conservatives. In fact, this report about Beto has barely made a dent in the traditional news cycle.

Whether or not gaffe-prone Biden actually runs for president, he's using his public status much like the Clinton's to rake in millions. From six- figure speaking gigs to seven-figure book deals, Crazy Uncle Joe is turning his humble public service into a gold mine. If he runs, Biden would be just the latest Democrat to engage in class warfare politics, all while sitting on top of a mound of cash and the worst record of any political team, him and Obama, that we've seen in our lifetime. Now, we are going to have a lot more on 2020 politics throughout the show and all through the year. But first, we must turn our attention to our important Hannity watch on the deep state tonight. We have brand-new information. We saw it with a brand-new \"USA Today\"/Suffolk University poll. One half of Americans now believe that President Trump is in fact a victim of a witch hunt being carried out by Robert Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors.  Now, it doesn't take a genius team of investigators to realize that collusion is a hoax. In fact, according to disgrace one time lead FBI investor Peter Strzok and his former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, they both said there was no evidence of collusion when the special counsel was elected, that's after they investigated for nine straight months before the appointment of Mueller. Here we are 670 days after the Mueller intensive probe, and as intense as it's been, still no collusion. None. Zero. Nothing. Yes, it's a witch hunt. And meanwhile, thanks to the newly released deposition from Ohr, and Page, and Strzok, and Steele, and McCain associate David Kramer, we have shocking new evidence tonight detailing how a small group of high-ranking bureaucrats, how they're trying to use Hillary Clinton's phony, bought and paid for Russian dossier to take down Donald Trump. We now know tonight that Christopher Steele gave the dirty dossier with Russian lies to McCain associate David Kramer. We know tonight that Kramer sometimes at the direction of Steele himself who hated Donald Trump literally spread the dossier's unverified, uncorroborated contents to 12 journalists at nine different news outlets.  Two state to prevent officials, including one connected to John Kerry.  Now, why? To use the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies to influence you, we, the people, before the elections, to influence the outcome of that election and worse. And here's the bottom line, according to Bruce Ohr, Christopher Steele hated Donald Trump, was desperate to malign him, as was Hillary Clinton, as was the popular echelon at the FBI, DOJ, not rank-and-file, as well as the corrupt news media in this country that just ran with these lies, never verified a thing. It was unverifiable because it wasn't true. And even though they all knew, all were told that this is unverified, uncorroborated, Hillary paid for it, and Steele hated Trump, a pack of lies, they tried to get a salacious contents, and they did out to the general public. Purposely lying, propagandizing, you, we, the American people. We have top DOJ and FBI officials, those are the same people that saved Hillary Clinton from being indicted, something that would've happened to all of us. They worked on her behalf, used her lies to commit fraud on FISA courts, spy on the Trump campaign, before the election and after the election, and it's all becoming crystal clear tonight. But this is only the beginning. What we now have is the beginning of a cascade of information and materials that will be corroborating everything we have been telling you over the last two years. So, tonight, I can tell you, expect more damning revelations about how the dossier was written, where it's information was derived, and how high-ranking officials inside our federal government abused their power to help Hillary get elected and then later to take down Donald Trump. Now, we are on the cusp of what is an avalanche of new developments. Joining us now, the author of the number one bestseller, he nailed it in his book, \"The Russia Hoax\", Gregg Jarrett. Also joining us, FOX News investigative reporter, Sara Carter. Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows. You know, Congressman, this got started with Sara and John, and thereafter with Gregg, very soon thereafter, and all throughout this process, we would have you on as a guest, at different times, radio and TV."

In fact, it's a coordinated effort to make sure that they do it, to bring him down. Here's the other interesting fact. You know, when you talk about Robert Mueller and Andrew McCabe and names that actually you've made household names, what we forget is, those are two individuals who actually wanted a job with this president and the minute they didn't get it, they started investigating him. You know, it's time that we hold people accountable in Washington, D.C."

      "utterance": "Well, it absolutely should fit the wheelhouse. Sean, this was a classic disinformation intelligence operation. Let me explain this to you.  This is what happens in other countries with intelligent agencies do in other countries when they're targeting somebody in the government. So -- but instead, what happened is the FBI and the DOJ, the Justice Department, high-level officials within those departments who have the power, the access, and the authority, targeted the president of the United States. And they also targeted the Trump campaign. I don't understand how this cannot be one of the biggest stories in modern political history, and how Robert Mueller did not include that in his mandate is beyond me. But the most important thing is that William Barr, the new attorney general, and others inside the DOJ, have to launch a full- fledged investigation, and if not, open up a second special counsel to investigate everyone. This is probably one of the biggest stories, political stories, of our lifetime. And when we look at what they did and how they spread that information -- I mean, that's why they went to McCain's guy, right? David Kramer. They wanted to solidify that information. So, once they got that to him and they moved it -- a lot of people didn't even want to report on this. I heard about this. A lot of reporters had heard about this dossier. But remember, it wasn't until Brennan and James Clapper actually briefed President Trump about this that BuzzFeed then published the entire dossier and CNN just shortly after wrote the story.  They wanted to make it real. They wanted to make lies real."

And the very same people involved in that, the use her bought and paid for Russian lies, they disseminated it like the former Soviet Union, great propaganda, why, to influence an election with her Russian lies. And then they use it to actually spy on the Trump campaign before and after the election and to bludgeon and destroy as sitting, duly elected president. The story is now irrefutable at this point, and I'll ask Congressman Meadows in a second, more is coming."

So, I agree with Sarah. And I'm sure the Congressman does as well.

We talk about the deep state. There are players now, even ambassadors, that are sitting ambassadors that were involved in part of this with the FBI and DOJ. And so, as we look at this, it's time to show that we show the American people what's out there, declassify some of those documents. I think when the American people see what I've seen, they will judge for themselves and know that it's all been a hoax."

So, you have the Palestinian Council, you have Hamas over here, they're sister organizations, and the Palestinian Council needed a P.R. firm, if you will, for propaganda here in the United States, and that's why CAIR was started. And it's all very well-documented. That's who we have in. You also now have the Democratic socialists, and you remember this, Sean, if you said anyone was a Democratic socialist, you are called a racist. Well, race doesn't seem to be playing a role with socialists. It seems, as \"Newsweek\" said when I first said this on FOX and now \"The New York Times\" magazine has said this, we are all socialists now. When did everyone become a socialist?

Twitter is declining comment tonight, but here to talk about this lawsuit and much more, California Congressman Devin Nunes. You do have a high bar. We all need that, because if you are a public figure, you need actual malice and what's known as a reckless disregard for the truth, or else I would sue people every hour of every day.

So if you look at the lawsuit, I think tonight people can go and look at our own Fox News. It's all there. But what we're - the case we're basically making is, this was an orchestrated effort. So people were targeting me. There were anonymous accounts that were developed. And look, there is not supposed to be - these accounts aren't supposed to exist. Twitter says that they don't have accounts that do this. So, like I said, this is the first of many lawsuits that are coming, but there were several fake news accounts, whether it was regard to the Russian investigation or to me, and we have to hold all of these people accountable, because if we don't, our First Amendment rights are at stake here. This isn't 20 years ago, Sean. What's happening is that Twitter becomes the gas lighting for all the news. And when they're regulating us, they're regulating what people can see on my tweets, which they've done, and then they're proliferating out things that they agree with with the algorithms that they developed. They need to come clean. They're not a public square. They are content developers."

They can call it whatever they want to call it. But the fact of the matter is people could not see my tweets. OK So now - but if you move forward, if you get emails from Twitter, it's constantly left-wing stuff, it's constantly fake news stuff. So I think if Twitter wants to be in the public square and they don't want to be a content developer. They should come clean, give us all your algorithms. How is it possible that I can be attacked relentlessly hundreds of times a day by fake accounts that they claim in their terms of service should not be there. So I guarantee you if I put something out that was sexually explicit or attacked someone personally, they would stop it. They would say this is a sensitive tweet. They never did that to any other people that were coming after me or other conservatives. So - and this is more about - this is more than just conservatives. Every American should care about this if they care about the First Amendment because the press has definitely changed. You've said it numerous times. The press is dead. And that's why if we don't go and clean this up, and I've been - I actually said this on your show a few weeks ago. This is part of the continuing Russia investigation. We're not going to just let all these fake news stories that were written about this investigation, about this hoax that were lies, we're going to challenge every single one of them in court.

The new - as the former House Intel Committee Chair, it's been frustrating as somebody who has been trying to get to the bottom of this whole Hillary getting a pass, FISA abuse, and attempt to undo a duly-elected President, bludgeoning him with false Russian lies, et cetera, now that we had Ohr, Page, Strzok, the McCain aide, and this new information about Christopher Steele, and now that we know that everybody was warned in August long before they leaked this information knowingly to the American people and then used it as, to quote your memo, the Grassley- Graham memo, is the bulk of information in the FISA applications, how much more is coming Because I'm told this is only the beginning of what will be an avalanche of information that it has been hard to get out, but it's now coming."

There is also the information that is still classified that we would like to be declassified and that is primarily 20 pages of the last FISA, the Bruce Ohr 302s, the FBI reports that Bruce Ohr was involved in.

When we come back, we need you to stay with us because coming up next, we're going to explain, a mini monologue, how this global warming, climate change, global cooling, every instance is nothing but hysteria to literally advance the political agenda of socialism.

The far left continues their push with the New Green Deal and the green agenda by pretending that it's about saving the planet, we only have 12 years left. Truth is, it's just an excuse to force their socialist vision on you, we, the American people. Climate change, global warming, global cooling, it's all - all of them rooted in advancing socialism, the belief that capitalism is inherently unjust and evil. Here's how - here's what we know. It's a 93, $94 trillion plan or up to that amount that will send our markets into the red. It will destroy the lifeblood of our economy, oil and gas. We will immediately go from the richest country with the most opportunity to probably a very poor country very quickly and roll back all the progress of the Trump and the Trump agenda, energy independence, goodbye, and rising wage growth, goodbye. Democrats don't seem to care. Rather than propose solutions to grow the economy, build a better future, they're retreating to belittling anyone who dares to question them. Listen to Al Gore, crazy Al Gore. AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES & FOUNDER, THE CLIMATE PROJECT: I don't think that there are - obviously, there's no basis for doubting what the Mother Nature is telling us now. It's beyond the consensus of 99 percent of the scientists. Just listen to Mother Nature and the climate-related extreme weather events have quadrupled in recent years. The old strategy of trying to fool people into disbelieving the evidence in front of their own eyes is failing."

Remember, Al Gore claimed in 2006 that Mount Kilimanjaro would be snow-free within a decade and warned in 2007 the Arctic could be ice-free within five years. It's not just Al Gore. Remember the acid rain scare of the '70s and the '80s, warnings about the destruction of our forests turned out to be fueled by panic, bad science, yes, and a political agenda. Don't forget about the AP article from 1989 warning that we only have 10 years to save the planet. Well, now we're starting a new cycle, 12 years. Now, let me be clear, we should all be good stewards of our environment, we all want clean air and water and want healthy lives and to preserve mother nature. But pushing alarmism, fears about the world ending in 12 years to advance the most radical political agenda, it's not about any of that. It's designed to scare you, designed to make you sign on to a massive government takeover of your life where you'll be told where you can go to a doctor or what kind of car you can drive, where you're allowed to eat meat or not, just as Comrade Bill de Blasio, meat-free Mondays for kids in New York. Even eliminate planes, oil, gas, cows, and the combustion engine, all while the Green New Deal may have fresh faces like Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, it is full of the same old Democratic rhetoric and tricks. You know, keep your doctor plan and save money. Here now for reaction, author of the book, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change, publisher of climatedepot.com, Marc Morano, and along with Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Chris Horner. Chris, we start with you. Explain the nexus of the political agenda. First it's global, the ice age is coming, then it's warming, and then just general climate change. Because they got it wrong the other two times. CHRISTOPHER HORNER, COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW Well, it's very much in human nature to blame our neighbor for the weather. It led to an awful lot of witch burnings during the cooling, as you recall, and then the medieval warming previously called the climate optimum occurred. And then it got cold again. And then it began to warm. And Thomas Jefferson wrote about it right here in Charlottesville. People have seized upon this to push their agenda. The crops failed, the babies died, the witch next door did it. This isn't new. There was a brief period that ended around the time of Jimmy Carter disco. I'm not sure who to blame, where we stop blaming our neighbor. And then suddenly, as you pointed out, we had the cooling catastrophism. It's not about the climate. Just remember that. This terribly painful, costly, futile gesture is also a cruel one, but it's the noble lie. There's - none of these schemes, the Green New Deal, the Paris Treaty, would detectably impact the climate. Nobody claims they would. So it's about something. And you should know it by the company he keeps or you can read Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, and you'll see it extends an awful lot beyond pretending that the government can gently administer to the climate. It moves into the larger agenda, which it's always been about. It's not about the climate."

In the 1960s and '70s, the environmental movement became radicalized. And you can go back. In the 1970s, John Holdren, Obama's former science czar, was out there promoting redistribution of wealth in order to fight what he saw as the greatest environmental, the existential threat of the time over populations, which those fears have now collapsed. And then, moving forward, you had other professors, 1974, 1970s, warning that we needed global government in order to fight environmental degradation and other issues. So if you go forward in the '70s and '80s, you had all these other scares. All they've done is replace global warming or now climate change with what used to be resource scarcity and overpopulation, the Amazon rain forest. It's always a different environmental scare--"

We have a very disturbing story to share. Human rights lawyer, according to reports, was now in Iran, sentenced to 38 years in jail, 148 lashings, just for standing up for fundamental rights of women. And in this case, how they want to dress. Iran claims she was spying and spreading propaganda and insulted the ayatollah. This should transcend politics. This is an issue that should unite all Americans. This is fundamental to what we believe. This is why we are so against, oh, let's see, Obama's tens of billions of dollars that he paid to the Mullahs in Iran, why we were so against Hillary Clinton taking money from countries that similarly abuse human rights. We'll continue to follow this story. It is happening in our time. And we'll bring you updates as we get them. Before we go tonight, we want to share viewer responses. John makes a point about climate change, alarmist Al Gore, he says, \"Every time this guy opens his mouth, he's polluting.\" All right. That's the commentary of the night.
