And in - in poll after poll and person after person that I've talked to, you know, I'm good friends with Mike DeWine who luckily eked out a win in the Ohio Governor's race, the - the consistent theme is that that Republican healthcare bill actually put a little bit of a millstone around Republicans running in the industrial Midwest.

And we're seeing Congress take up that issue. But what's interesting is you have to look at what's driving this. So, there was a study done by Global Strategy Group that says 81 percent of Americans expect corporations to take action on political issues within 24 hours. That's not a lot of time. You also have to look at what Millennials and the factor they play in this in social media. There are tons of viral social media campaigns with hashtags, urging companies to take a stand on issues, blacklisting companies if they don't. So, 46 percent of Millennials actively research what political stances companies have before they decide to give them their business. But there are critics who look at this and say, \"Where are we headed? Is this a sustainable thing to do?\"",

The second takeaway is that the single most unpopular piece of Republican legislation in the past couple of years wasn't Donald Trump's brainchild, and if you trust the media reports, Donald Trump wasn't even a huge fan of it, and that was the healthcare bill that came out of the House Republican leadership. And in - in poll after poll and person after person that I've talked to, you know, I'm good friends with Mike DeWine who luckily eked out a win in the Ohio Governor's race, the - the consistent theme is that that Republican healthcare bill actually put a little bit of a millstone around Republicans running in the industrial Midwest. It was not a popular piece of legislation. And, in some ways, I think it's almost better that it didn't pass and that it didn't go into effect causing even more damage down the road."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

I think that a lot of folks, especially, the Wall Street wing of the Republican Party don't like to admit, and don't like to appreciate the fact that the party has definitely shifted in this direction. You've got more and more working-class voters voting for Republicans, like I said, more and more wealthy Suburbanites voting for Democrats. And - and to me, what - what's ultimately causing that is that those voters are incredibly socially progressive, meaning those wealthy Suburbanites are socially progressive. And what you hear consistently from Republican elites is that we need to moderate on the social issues and - and chart a really libertarian course on the economic issues. And if you actually listen to Republican voters, what they're saying is something like the opposite. They're socially conservative."

And Google said, \"Absolutely not. These results are organic.\" We now know the Federal Trade Commission, the European Union, and Academics at Harvard said, \"That's wrong. You were manipulating the algorithm.\" Their defense now is the same when it comes to political speech. The problem is that there's been numerous peer-reviewed studies done by Robert Epstein and others that clearly demonstrates they are suppressing news stories. And, in fact, in the 2016 election, they found in all 10 search results from one through 10, Google was suppressing negative stories about Hillary Clinton and pushing positive stories about and - and - and pushing negative stories about Donald Trump. This, by a researcher, by the way, who was a Hillary Clinton supporter, not a Trump supporter."

So, the question is if China killed 30,000 Americans through bombing campaigns or by invading, of course, we might respond differently.

And we know where it's coming in through, and that's the United States Postal Service, the government agency. So, what we have done over the past three years, we've researched it. We've investigated it. We put together legislation. It took us too long to get it done because there was some pushback, particularly from the post office. In fact, there still is. But all we're asking them to do is to screen packages so that our law enforcement can at least stop some of this poison coming into our communities and raise the price of this incredibly powerful deadly drug on the streets of our cities, of our communities, and also reduce the cost."

One, that they have made some of the precursors, in other words, the chemicals that go into making Fentanyl illegal. They have, in effect, scheduled them under, you know, the way we would do it here. And that they've begun, they say, secondly, to crack down on some of these chemical companies that are producing it. But what they have done is not been effective. I mean it continues to come in. Our investigation indicated that if you send something by the Postal Service from China that it's guaranteed delivery. If you send it through one of the other carriers, say, FedEx or UPS or DHL, a private carrier, it's not guaranteed. Why? Because after 9/11, we required all the private carriers to provide advanced electronic data to law enforcement to be able to identify suspect packages and to be able to stop this stuff coming in. We didn't do it for the Post Office. We said you ought to study it, come back to us with the report, they never have."

      "utterance": "Well Hillary Vaughn joins us now. Great job. You know, this is - with everything going on in the world, in the elections and everything, this kind of stuff continues more kind of under the radar. But when it comes to the banks, they've historically used, sometimes, their power to effect, really to implement discriminatory policies, when it comes to lending. The government has stepped in to stop that kind of dynamic. And yet, now, there are even Republicans suggesting that it's the free market that is causing this. With your investigation, do you agree that this is a normal free market event that's occurring?"

      "utterance": "Well what I can tell you is that Congress is weighing a crackdown on companies that are going beyond what they see to be someone's constitutional rights or beyond the scope of federal law. So, when you see these companies taking their own policy or making their own policy, that runs counter to federal law, that's probably going to get them in a little bit of trouble. And we're seeing Congress take up that issue. But what's interesting is you have to look at what's driving this. So, there was a study done by Global Strategy Group that says 81 percent of Americans expect corporations to take action on political issues within 24 hours. That's not a lot of time. You also have to look at what Millennials and the factor they play in this in social media. There are tons of viral social media campaigns with hashtags, urging companies to take a stand on issues, blacklisting companies if they don't. So, 46 percent of Millennials actively research what political stances companies have before they decide to give them their business. But there are critics who look at this and say, \"Where are we headed? Is this a sustainable thing to do?\""

But then you're dealing with the banks, as you've noted in your piece, that get taxpayer dollars that are propped up, especially after the - the mini (ph) crash in 2007 and 2008, as they're going against a civil right, right, against the - a constitutionally protected right, is an entirely different dynamic - dynamic. If you don't like the Second Amendment, you know, engage politically, right? This is something very different and, yes, is extremely worrisome. Great job. And thanks for reminding everyone of all the other kinds of things that are going on out there that we need to keep an eye on. Yes."

There's going to be deals everywhere all the time. Let's just be nice to one another. And then, again, on Monday, you've got Cyber Monday, so that's going to be fabulous as well. So, good luck out there and be kind to each other because we can be. We're Americans. That's it tonight, you guys, for our Inside the Issues special of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" The regular show resumes on Monday, and Tucker will be back. Tune in each night at 8:00 to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Also, don't forget to DVR the show if you haven't already set that up.
