      "utterance": "Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Dana Perino, and Greg. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" The Democrats' impeachment spectacle returning to Capitol Hill. You're looking live as the House Rules Committee continues to set guidelines for a debate and full House vote expected tomorrow. But the real fireworks are going down in the Senate. Majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer are waging war over potential witnesses."

We're not entitled to, we're not entitled to witnesses, we're not entitled to anything in the House. It's a total sham. I've never seen the Republican party so united. We've got -- on our last vote, as you know, we got a hundred percent of the vote. I believe the Senate is equally as well united. I watched Mitch McConnell this morning. I watched numerous people last night, senators, and I think we're equally well united."

If you are looking at the polls either the national ones or in the battleground states, I think that if you, as the prosecution, the Democrats, have the burden of proof, right, and you have not moved the needle at all, then I think the Republicans have actually done very well so far. One of the things that is a big complaint right now, as they figure out the rules, is that the Senate is looking at the House, saying, \"But you didn't even call these witnesses before, so why should we call them now?\""

      "utterance": "Any fair process would be consulting the White House because it's the president who's the defendant, and due process would guarantee him -- or fairness, certainly, would guarantee him certain rights. It seems to me that no good case has been made for witnesses. We ought to be doing, instead of this, is doing what the American people want us to do, which is, make the schools better and preserve social security and rein in the HMOs."

He's saying, in one breath, \"We built a strong case, but we need more witnesses.\" If you have a strong case, you don't need anymore witnesses. But also, the whole idea of expecting the Senate to call witnesses is hilarious. If you've already won the case, which Trump has. There's no way he's going to be impeached. We already know this. Again, it's like we already -- we've already seen this movie. Why call more witnesses to expand with more stuff to be looked at? If you were -- if you are about to win a discrimination case, do you call more witnesses on your behalf? No, you don't. You don't have to do that. There's no chance of him being impeached in the Senate so you don't want to give them more free swings of the bat. Last, the idea of Schumer talking about fairness, nothing is fair in politics. And it's a pointless argument because you will always see your side, right or left, as being the disadvantage. No one ever comes to you, you know, \"Dana, you know, I think I'm really getting the better end of this deal.\" No one has ever said that in the history of anything."

We don't believe that your vote counts, and now we're going to make a decision to impeach the president.\" And in that letter today to Nancy Pelosi, President Trump wasn't just talking to Pelosi. He was defending himself, putting himself on the historical record. And also, he mentions the voters, and he's talking about how the Democrats are attacking millions of people around the country with this charade that they've done.

She got all messed up on this question about this. She initially said that she was going to defend the idea of giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants but then within the same answer, she said she was against it and when pressed by the moderator, the late Tim Russert, she attacked the moderator. And I think it's partly because the issue like if you go to the state and state governors, like in California and New York, they'll say that they need this.

That is a direct creates a direct problem for the people living in their cities who are paying their property taxes, who are paying their taxes in general.

See, Trump's rise coincides with De Niro's decline and the person who knows it most is De Niro. He's a fine example of how not to turn loss into bitterness. There are plenty of people who don't like Trump but don't let it work their minds or their ability to speak aloud among grownups or \"The View.\" But the Schiff's and De Niro's of the world are emotionally damaged by politics to a point where they can't even assess their own emotions. Being an actor is tough, but how does one handle real life without a script. Not equipped to think analytically, you're left powerless when observing your own predictions about life turn out wrong. It's not supposed to be this way, De Niro thinks, only the cool guys get to win. Sorry, Bob, that's only in the movies. But at least you'll always have Joy. You know when dislike is so emotional, Katie? I always think it means something else. Like he's actually thought about this, like you know, it's like it's in his head.

So, when he attacks the Trump kids as saying that he would disown them but doesn't really give as to why, you know -- Ivanka Trump, for example, went into the administration, got rid of her own business after being a successful businesswoman and started this global women's development project that allows for women to get into the workforce. She's been able to change the law in a number of countries now that allow women to own property, making a real impact on people's lives. But yet he's here saying that, if they were his children, he would disown them.

But this is one of the reasons why conservatives don't watch these shows. You don't want to see this old, angry guy try to just take the president's head off and have Joy help him out doing that and then sell TV ads off that. It's just cheap, and people tune out.

And I'll tell you what, other presidents in the future -- unless they do something about this, other presidents are going to have to live with this.

They're going to -- Trump's going to win in 2020. He might actually win bigger than he won last time. And I think they're going to lose the House over this. Remember, I think it was 2009, was the first time Obama had just got in there. They went way, way over the line on Obamacare, way over the line on cap in trade, and it was just a landslide, big overreaction, big course correction when the Democrats go far left like this.
