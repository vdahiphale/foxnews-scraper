Remember, it's 1:00 a.m. in the morning in Saudi Arabia, strange time to be releasing this. But it has just broken on Saudi State T.V., and they're quoting the Saudi State prosecutor. As you pointed out, they are saying that 18 people have now been arrested, 15 of those people were the same suspects pictured by the Turkish CCTV, flying in Istanbul, arriving at the consulate, shortly before Khashoggi, leaving, shortly afterwards. And now what they are saying about what happened inside the consulate. I will read you their statement. They say that a discussion between Khashoggi and the people who met him while at the consulate, led to a fight and a clash with hands, resulting in his death. And remember, we've had so many reports of a bone saw, fingers being torn off, and torture. That this, clearly, one way of Saudi Arabia trying to pull back from that. They are very much claiming this was an accident.  But the big question again, one of many big questions, why were 15 of them, even there, in the first place to question him? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of the 18, two are high-ranking officials. And these are the two had they pinned the blame on. One of them is a name we've heard for some time, a few days at least, his name is General Asiri, he was a Vice President of Saudi Intelligence. He was Former Spokesman for the Saudi-led Coalition in Yemen. He was educated in the U.S. and the U.K. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While he has now been arrested, and his post has been taken away. And the other man is Mohammad bin Salih Ramai, a minister and a consultant to the royal court. But that's as far as the connection with the royal court comes -- goes. And they are very clear that the royal court and the royal family had nothing to do with this. That they are learning about this just as much and as soon as everyone else. In fact, we are hearing that King Salman himself, reached out to President Erdogan, just a couple of hours ago, to let him know the results of this investigation. That he said we hope the relationships between the two countries can remain strong, because that relationship has been severely fractured, over the last couple of weeks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, that's what we are hearing from now. We are also hearing that Saudi intelligence is going to go through a complete restructuring. But again, we had heard for some time, that the line from Saudi Arabia would be (INAUDIBLE) it was an interrogation gone wrong. That it was sanctioned at a relatively high level, but not to the royal family. That's exactly what we are now hearing. And now, the bug question, what has happened to Khashoggi's body? What happened in there? What have they done afterwards? How will the White House respond? But 17 days after Khashoggi went missing; we have finally got the Saudi version of events. Martha?",

Joining me now is Shannon Bream, host of \"Fox News @ Night\" and our resident Supreme Court expert. Shannon, good to see you tonight. This is an interesting case.

Now the fourth circuit, the next level down from the Supreme Court said essentially, they thought this did amount to the government sort of endorsing a religion. They said this cross that was put up to recognize a number of young men who were lost in World War I by the gold star mothers and also the American legion. They said by using the cross it looks like an endorsement of Christianity. So there has been this fight back and forth that is now finally on the calendar for the Supreme Court to vote on it.

You mention other places. Let's talk about Arlington National Cemetery here in Washington just outside D.C. There are two large Latin crosses much like this one in Maryland so people are very worried about this. Potentially if you take down the one in Maryland does every cross inside a place like Arlington have to go? So, there are much bigger questions. It takes four votes for the court to hear the case.

The first is that, that has been a suspicion relay to me by U.S. government officials.  Second, it's the suspicion that's been relay to me by Honduran officials.  And third, it is a model that we have seen play out across the world.  Judicial Watch, actually just issued a report about how U.S. backed NGOs can commingle with C4s and other nonprofits established by leftist people like George Soros. And in the Balkans actually, this resulted in political activity that was commingled with U.S. funds and the political agenda of George Soros. So, those three things let me to believe that you made mention of the value of what was being handed out. I think that reporting needs to be double-checked. Again, the Honduran ambassador who was in my office a couple of hours ago found it suspicious that he believed Honduran currency was being handed out inside of Guatemala. That would seem to push back against the theory that these are Guatemalan merchants that are willingly giving up of this money. It is true that there are some cartels that in a compulsory way, force local businesses to give up cash and other resources to facilitate the caravan."

And I think that there are those on the Left who would like nothing more, than to see Republicans struggle with women and children at the border, and the heart-wrenching images that, that creates. It's odd to me, Martha that they had women and children separated from men when it came to giving out this cash and while there is sort of a Robin Hood element of a lot of these cartels that dates back to the Medellin Cartel. These two particular individuals wearing the white shirts in the video that you played earlier from my tweet, they -- according to intelligence officials in Central America are associated with the Bally, Bally Cartel, and that they act in concert with the Sinaloa Cartel."

      "utterance": "Well, but also this thing's change, right? The game changes, it -- the issue sets change, the candidate in a lot of these cases. When we were talking about the possibility, maybe think about it this way. It's maybe a one in five chance that the Republicans can hold the House. Let's say 20 percent that they can buy the skin of their teeth, dig their heels in and win in very difficult places like New Jersey 11, is a great example. They have to find a way in difficult blue states and districts that voted for Hillary, to dig in hard and win. They need to do that. So, holding on the House that's maybe one in five. But the other thing that's one in five, which is Democrats storming with the 60-seat victory of the kind that Republicans had in 2010. That means that they'd have to win and seats like Pete Sessions down in Texas, which is still Texas. Regardless of what else is going on and however many Beto O'Rourke yard signs there are, Texas remains Texas, we checked. It will be very hard for them to get to that point. And that's why people are sort of cooling down or calming down and they're looking at the races in specific. And what you see is what we've known for a while. Democrats have a strong structural advantage. The most likely outcome, yes, is in that 30 to 40 seat space in between, which is enough to give the Democrats a majority. But now, people are finally realizing that doesn't mean that there's zeroed. It's not a zero percent chance that Republicans' win. It's actually pretty considerable, it's a one in five."

Look, those issues work well in some places and will help Republicans who are running in red districts. Intensify the base, get them out and in places like that Pete Sessions district in suburban Dallas, these things will help him. But in other districts, note John Culberson, the congressman also from Texas who has a more difficult district than Sessions. He's not going to appear with the president, and he's got a Houston area seat. He's not going to appear with the president when the president comes to Houston next week because it's not a good fit for him.

Benjamin Hall is live in Istanbul, where he has been covering the story since it broke, and these new details have come in. Ben, explain to us what we know, what we are learning at this hour, tonight."

      "utterance": "Martha, this is the statement we've been waiting for, for 17 long days, the Saudi's version of events. And today, they are laying it out in fair amount of detail. Remember, it's 1:00 a.m. in the morning in Saudi Arabia, strange time to be releasing this. But it has just broken on Saudi State T.V., and they're quoting the Saudi State prosecutor. As you pointed out, they are saying that 18 people have now been arrested, 15 of those people were the same suspects pictured by the Turkish CCTV, flying in Istanbul, arriving at the consulate, shortly before Khashoggi, leaving, shortly afterwards. And now what they are saying about what happened inside the consulate. I will read you their statement. They say that a discussion between Khashoggi and the people who met him while at the consulate, led to a fight and a clash with hands, resulting in his death. And remember, we've had so many reports of a bone saw, fingers being torn off, and torture. That this, clearly, one way of Saudi Arabia trying to pull back from that. They are very much claiming this was an accident.  But the big question again, one of many big questions, why were 15 of them, even there, in the first place to question him? Of the 18, two are high-ranking officials. And these are the two had they pinned the blame on. One of them is a name we've heard for some time, a few days at least, his name is General Asiri, he was a Vice President of Saudi Intelligence. He was Former Spokesman for the Saudi-led Coalition in Yemen. He was educated in the U.S. and the U.K. While he has now been arrested, and his post has been taken away. And the other man is Mohammad bin Salih Ramai, a minister and a consultant to the royal court. But that's as far as the connection with the royal court comes -- goes. And they are very clear that the royal court and the royal family had nothing to do with this. That they are learning about this just as much and as soon as everyone else. In fact, we are hearing that King Salman himself, reached out to President Erdogan, just a couple of hours ago, to let him know the results of this investigation. That he said we hope the relationships between the two countries can remain strong, because that relationship has been severely fractured, over the last couple of weeks. So, that's what we are hearing from now. We are also hearing that Saudi intelligence is going to go through a complete restructuring. But again, we had heard for some time, that the line from Saudi Arabia would be (INAUDIBLE) it was an interrogation gone wrong. That it was sanctioned at a relatively high level, but not to the royal family. That's exactly what we are now hearing. And now, the bug question, what has happened to Khashoggi's body? What happened in there? What have they done afterwards? How will the White House respond? But 17 days after Khashoggi went missing; we have finally got the Saudi version of events. Martha?"

He says to say that I'm skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi, is an understatement. Joining us now on the phone, Judith Miller, Pulitzer Prize Winning Reporter, a FOX News Contributor and a friend of Jamal Khashoggi, Judith, good to have you with us, tonight, what's your reaction to this, tonight?"

I mean, what were those 15 members of the hit team doing in the consulate? What was the goal of their meeting with Jamal Khashoggi? What happened to the body? All of the major questions remain. This announcement made in the dead of night, in Riyadh, the middle of the morning there, suggests panic. And that's what I think is going on. And I don't think it's going to wash. It's a start of an explanation. It is not a convincing one."

And the body, you know, you would say, this went horribly wrong. There was a fight. And, you know, something happened, and there was a struggle, and he was -- he was killed as a result of it. That is one of the big questions, of course. And, you know, I mean, all of these just smacks of the removal of responsibility by the royal family.

Even before that, Congress nearly severed the weapon sales to the Kingdom. And now, you have people calling for a complete re-examination of the relationship with the Saudis. You know, I think, this will be, once again, a test of Donald Trump's ability to get what he wants done, with the Congress.

We will continue to closely follow the international investigations into this tragic incident and advocate for justice that is timely, transparent, and in accordance with all due process.

I, you know -- the hope is that, if this blows over, then we move to the midterms and the country has lots of other challenges. That Jamal Khashoggi saves the outrage phase, but ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, what kind of country are we doing business with? What kind of future king would Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman be? What does this episode show us about the way they do business? And can we trust them? There's so much at stake that we can overlook, incidents like this, or tragic incidents, as the White House calls them. I think that's what the country has to decide.

This is a refrain that people have heard over the years, and it's silly. People didn't want her to run for senate. She did. She won.  People didn't want her to be Secretary of State. She did. She did a great job. People didn't want her to run and be president, she was the nominee. It's just silly. It's very inside baseball. For someone who got 65 million votes, more than anyone, except Barack Obama, I'm going to guess that more than a few still like her. And this notion of go away, there's some sexism to it, too. I mean, you don't hear anyone saying McCain should go away after 2008 or Mitt Romney or John Kerry. It's just a woman that is supposed to be quiet and go away."

Now the fourth circuit, the next level down from the Supreme Court said essentially, they thought this did amount to the government sort of endorsing a religion. They said this cross that was put up to recognize a number of young men who were lost in World War I by the gold star mothers and also the American legion. They said by using the cross it looks like an endorsement of Christianity. So there has been this fight back and forth that is now finally on the calendar for the Supreme Court to vote on it. And now Justice Kavanaugh on the bench, people think this could be one of the cases he might be a yes vote to hear."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "They are looking at whether the government is endorsing this idea of any specific religion over another. And so, people have argued for years with a number of these memorials that listen, these were to the war dead. And many of them are this large Latin cross that was understood decades ago to be a memorial. Not necessarily saying everyone who perished here was Christian but this is for our war dead. You mention other places. Let's talk about Arlington National Cemetery here in Washington just outside D.C. There are two large Latin crosses much like this one in Maryland so people are very worried about this. Potentially if you take down the one in Maryland does every cross inside a place like Arlington have to go? So, there are much bigger questions. It takes four votes for the court to hear the case. So, we'll watch. This is on the conference list for October 26 they vote behind closed doors. If four of the justices say we are ready to answer this question, they'll vote yet to put this on the calendar."

      "utterance": "He is very much been viewed as somebody who is very supportive of religious liberty issues. And some of these cases involving the HHS contraceptive mandate where religious employers and others were going to be forced to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives they said they had a religious objection to, because they viewed some of them as triggering what they believed were abortions. He was supportive of the idea of religious freedom in those cases so a lot of people think he would be someone to be an advocate in this case. We'll have to see. He has a bit of a record on religious liberty but not specifically with one of these big memorials because they're all over the country."

So, speaking of art, and movies, a lot of attention this week to these Disney princess characters because a couple of celebrities have said that they don't think that they set the best example for their children. Here's Kristen Bell talking to it, talking about this. She says \"Don't you think that it's weird\" - in Snow White she is talking about - \"that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission?

Steep in the folklore that I grow up with. So, I love her. The point I would make about this is it's important to have these cultural references. \"Snow White\" written in 1812.
