      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein goes before lawmakers three days from now amid the fallout from his comments about recording the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Growing bipartisan calls for action after Saudi Arabia confirms a columnist and U.S. resident died in their consulate after what the kingdom describes as a fistfight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what are the issues that matter most to voters with the midterms now just two weeks away? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" After the threat of being subpoenaed, Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein will face four leading congressmen on Capitol Hill this upcoming week during a closed-door meeting in a classified setting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is one of those lawmakers who will be asking Rosenstein whether he was serious about secretly recording the president to help remove him from office. We will hear first what the chairman is looking for in my exclusive interview this morning moments from now. President Trump wants more answers from Saudi Arabia following the kingdom's admission that a Washington Post columnist died in its custody, as questions loom about the outrage over Jamal Khashoggi's death and what it means for the U.S.' relationships with a key partner in the Middle East and a counter to Iran. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will join me in an exclusive interview coming up, and how he has been tapped by President Trump to hit the campaign trail to help drive Republicans to the polls, with now just 16 days away from the midterm elections. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, our panel weighs in on some key races, as we look ahead this morning on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And begin with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, set to give lawmakers a long-awaited interview on Wednesday. He's expected to face tough questions on his reported suggestion to secretly record President Trump. Asking the questions will be the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, along with two ranking Democrats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining me right now, one of those lawmakers, Virginia Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

That's the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That is an extraordinary acknowledgement of how much abuse went on in this case. And I think that the only question that really presents is, why is Rod Rosenstein being allowed to hide behind a closed door and answer these questions, when most of the information they're going to talk about this week is not classified? There's no reason he can't answer the question in public. Did you suggest wearing a wire on the president? Did you consider invoking the 25th Amendment? Did you read the FISA warrant? None of that is classified. And I think this session has been created the lessen the embarrassment for the deputy attorney general. But don't forget the chairman's mind-set, that he now believes there may be abuses here.",

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein goes before lawmakers three days from now amid the fallout from his comments about recording the president. Growing bipartisan calls for action after Saudi Arabia confirms a columnist and U.S. resident died in their consulate after what the kingdom describes as a fistfight. And what are the issues that matter most to voters with the midterms now just two weeks away? Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" After the threat of being subpoenaed, Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein will face four leading congressmen on Capitol Hill this upcoming week during a closed-door meeting in a classified setting. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is one of those lawmakers who will be asking Rosenstein whether he was serious about secretly recording the president to help remove him from office. We will hear first what the chairman is looking for in my exclusive interview this morning moments from now. President Trump wants more answers from Saudi Arabia following the kingdom's admission that a Washington Post columnist died in its custody, as questions loom about the outrage over Jamal Khashoggi's death and what it means for the U.S.' relationships with a key partner in the Middle East and a counter to Iran. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will join me in an exclusive interview coming up, and how he has been tapped by President Trump to hit the campaign trail to help drive Republicans to the polls, with now just 16 days away from the midterm elections. Plus, our panel weighs in on some key races, as we look ahead this morning on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And begin with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, set to give lawmakers a long-awaited interview on Wednesday. He's expected to face tough questions on his reported suggestion to secretly record President Trump. Asking the questions will be the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, along with two ranking Democrats. Joining me right now, one of those lawmakers, Virginia Congressman Bob Goodlatte. He is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for being here this morning."

That's why it will be limited to the people who will be in the room and to -- and that it will be in a classified setting. We will have a court reporter president who has a security clearance, and we will have transcripts of that interview. And then we will turn that over to the intelligence community to make sure that there are no things that cannot be released the public. When we have that, we will make that public. In the meantime, other members of Congress will also be able to see the interview in its classified format, the transcript. We want to know in particular about the new developments that we have been made aware of about Mr. Rosenstein meeting with a group of other DOJ and FBI employees and talking about the possibility of wearing a wire when he meets with the president of the United States, the -- his boss, the chief executive officer of our country, and the possibility of pulling together Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would be a mechanism to declare the president disabled and therefore have somebody else, the vice president, presumably, serving in his place. These are very, very serious allegations. We have all of this based upon a newspaper report, and we have third-party testimony that we have heard in our investigation. We know he's met with President Trump. President Trump has been satisfied and said that he wants him to continue on as his number two at the Department of Justice."

You said it's going to be open, and you're going to be able to report back to your colleagues.

And we will be asking those same questions.  We don't know -- because it wasn't open to the media, it wasn't open to anyone, we don't know what the conversation with the president was.

He came into this matter at the later end, but he was involved with the approval of the third renewal of the FISA warrant application, which is basically requesting a court, in secret, to approve a wiretap on an individual who's a United States citizen. And this went on for a full year, the last three months of which Mr. Rosenstein was involved in the approval of that.

So this is just one more thing that would point toward the need for the appointment of a special counsel to look into all of these matters. In addition, after the election, we're going to -- we're going to proceed with an interim report of our findings. And that will be true whether Republicans or Democrats are in the majority in the House. I think the Republicans will. And, if so, the new chairman can continue that work in January. However, you also have a Senate Judiciary Committee perfectly capable of conducting these investigations. You have an inspector general who has been looking into the FISA warrant abuse allegations.

He was clearly murdered in a consulate.  Things like that don't happen in Saudi Arabia without people at the top knowing. We will find out more. I like the president's measured response.

I would like to punish those involved. The Global Magnitsky Act would put punishment, sanctions on the individuals that had a hand in this. And I find it impossible to believe that the crown prince wasn't involved.  So, go after him and his inner circle. Save the alliance.

I introduced him when he was in Washington. But he imprisoned a Lebanese prime minister. He embargoed the country of Qatar without telling us. And I see a heavy hand inside of Saudi Arabia. And I believe he is responsible for the killing of Mr. Khashoggi in the most brutal way. I think his behavior is way outside of civilized norms. And I will never go back as long as he's there. You will never convince me that he didn't do this. And our values ought to mean something. And I think they do.  And I look forward to working with the president to find a solution to this. But I'm not going to look the other way. Every time you look the other way in the Middle East, from the Taliban to Iran, you regret it. So there's no looking away from me."

We have got plenty of people in the world who will cut up -- Saudi Arabia is an ally, but this behavior is outside the norm, to the point that the people involved need to be removed, in my view. Saudi Arabia is a country. MBS is a person. And I'm willing to try to separate the two. But I am not going to accept this. If we accept this, every other person who could do this will. And the next thing you know, our enemies are going to lose respect for us, and we will lose our moral voice. And that's a voice that cannot afford to be lost."

I don't want to ignore and appease the Saudi Arabians, because the Mideast needs to change. I like being tough on Russia.

We have a dialogue with North Korea that is hopeful. It's due to President Trump being strong. I think the North Koreans believe that President Trump would use military force if he had to. I'm hoping we can get a deal where they give up their nuclear program, they have security and prosperity. China needs to help us.

The bottom line here is that China requires a Chinese business partner for you to do business in China. They steal your intellectual property. It's time for somebody to push back against China's cheating in the trade arena.  And Trump is doing it. I don't like tariffs, but they are a tool to get China to change. China's economy is weaker than ours. So I appreciate President Trump doing multiple -- multiple things at the same time, against Iran, trying to get a better deal with North Korea, taking China on, on trade, working with them on North Korea, standing up to Russia. And I hope he will come down hard on Saudi Arabia. We need a strong leader in this world. We had eight years of weak with Obama. I'm tired of weak.  I like strong. Keep being strong, Mr. President.

We need the right WTO rules that recognize China's a developed nation, not a developing nation. At the end of the day, Mike Pence is right. When we stand up for our values, and when we stand up to our enemies, we're a lot better off than when we ignore the problem. I have had eight years of ignoring the problem under Barack Obama.

We want to make the middle-class tax cuts permanent. We want to rebuild the military. We want to keep our enemies on the run. And we're going to ask our friends to respect our values. And if you can't respect our values, you're really not our friend. So I like where the country is headed. Here's the question November the 6th. Do you want to change directions from where we're going and turn over power to the people who would destroy Brett Kavanaugh's life and turn our country into a group of mob -- mob rule people? Not me."

You know, we got a country to run here. I like what President Trump has done here at home and abroad. I do not like what my Democratic colleagues were willing to do to Kavanaugh.

I promise you we're going to get to the bottom of how they used a dossier, prepared by a foreign agent, paid for by the Democratic Party, to get a warrant against an American citizen.

I want you to know as much as you can know about FBI agents colluding with the Department of Justice to undercut Trump and to help Clinton.

Earlier, we heard from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, one of the top lawmakers set to question Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein on Capitol Hill this week. Rosenstein will face tough questions for those alleged remarks where he reportedly suggested secretly recording the president to remove him from office. Rosenstein is strongly denying the claims. Of course, this all comes with the backdrop of the midterm elections now 16 days away from today. We bring in our panel right now. Investigative journalist John Solomon is with us, who's been breaking some news on this subject. Former New York Senator and Fox News contributor Al D'Amato is here, and GOPAC Chairman David Avella. Great to see you, gentlemen. Thanks so much for joining us."

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Well, Maria, I was really struck by the interview with Chairman Goodlatte. He said for the first time at least that I have heard that there is strong evidence to support Congressman Ratcliffe's contention that the FISA court was misled, and that exculpatory information had been withheld from the judges. That's the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That is an extraordinary acknowledgement of how much abuse went on in this case. And I think that the only question that really presents is, why is Rod Rosenstein being allowed to hide behind a closed door and answer these questions, when most of the information they're going to talk about this week is not classified? There's no reason he can't answer the question in public. Did you suggest wearing a wire on the president? Did you consider invoking the 25th Amendment? Did you read the FISA warrant? None of that is classified. And I think this session has been created the lessen the embarrassment for the deputy attorney general. But don't forget the chairman's mind-set, that he now believes there may be abuses here."

I mean, the whole narrative of coming up with this story that Donald Trump had anything to do with the -- with the Russia meddling, and then having a strategy around it, leak it to the media, get informants in there to lure Trump campaign people, it really is extraordinary, which it just shocks me that the mainstream media is not -- is not focused on this story at all, because it's really about America and the rule of law. Very quickly, John, you think we're going to see any accountability as a result of all of this?"

If we lose the House, where -- there's going to be no reform. And just look at the caravan that is coming up here. My gosh. Once they cross the border, it's catch and release of people.

And the reality is, Democrats are pushing what they call Medicare for all.  We all know it as a government-run health care system. And the Democrats talk about how much money they're raising. They can raise all the money they want. A state like Texas, where Beto O'Rourke is praised for how much money he raised, they're not going to elect a Democrat who is for open borders, for higher taxes, and for Medicare for all."

So, go through some of the important races that we need to focus on going into the midterms. And you're saying that the money issue is not an issue for Republicans?"
