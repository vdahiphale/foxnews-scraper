This country is going to hell in a handbasket and you know it. America today is a land of total chaos and confusion. Career criminals roam freely among us, maniacs burn down Christmas trees, flash-and-grab mob looters steal with impunity and random unprovoked acts of madness are the new norm. This, my friends, is all the result of left-wing progressive Marxist idiotic Democrats who lie about what we can see with our own eyes and who have at the helm a confused and senile Commander-in-Chief who has no idea how to command.",

And as Secretary of Sadness in 2021, she gives her acceptance speech five years later. Take a look at the cash grab she is trying to make off the speech that thankfully she never gave on election night, 2016.

I guess you forgot to include the fact that you put a ban on trying juveniles as adults, which juveniles continue to pose their allegiance to their gangs on social media while they're in custody. Example, a 40-year-old man whose car broke down in the wrong neighborhood in South LA, an area controlled by that same gang. While the man was waiting for help from AAA, a vehicle full of four Crips gang members spots him, pulls up and shoots him at least 36 times. As per DA Gascon's policy, they will not be tried as adults, but instead tried as juveniles, which means they get out of jail at 21, and of course, Gascon will not seek enhanced criminal punishment under California law that allows it under gang membership. This DA Gascon, he needs to be gone. He and his fellow progressive DA's around the nation funded by George Soros who seek to undermine the American justice system, they need to be recalled and removed from office, and if not, it's just a question of time before your life is impacted if it hasn't been already by the lawlessness enveloping this country.

I was one of the first people to call that one like within a day or two of the incident just being like, hey, guys, like does anyone actually believe this story? They tried to cancel me. I was spreading conspiracy theories. I was a terrible human being, but I was right, because it was so obvious. If all of America takes that position and pushes back against this nonsense Democratic narrative, I think we actually have a chance of maintaining the freedoms, our free speech, and all of the things that made America the greatest country in the world.

There were so many amazing stories that even I didn't know as an insider and he is telling me these stories as we're going through some of these pictures and I just said, you know, we have to put this in a book and we made this book called, \"Our Journey Together.\" A picture says a thousand words, Jeanine. It is the old saying, and you can see the accomplishment. You can see America first. You can see American greatness in this book. And when you compare that to what is going on in the last you know 10 to 11 months under the Democrat regime of Joe Biden, you realize what we had and what we're missing. And I guess, I honestly -- I'm even seeing it in the reporting. Even the mainstream media is having a hard time putting a positive spin on the lunacy that we are seeing on a daily basis. And so, this book, which you can get in, you know 45books.com and elsewhere, it's just a view of the Trump presidency. All of the things and all of the accomplishments that the media would never show you because they were too busy making up lies, they were too busy pushing Russia collusion, too busy doing anything possible to undermine the first President in a long time who has actually put America and the American people first.

The police worked hard at solving the case. The Judge worked hard at moving the case. The jury worked hard at deliberations and the nation was divided because of Jussie Smollett's hoax. This is what I would say at the sentencing if I were the sentencing Judge. Mr. Smollett, I want you to think long and hard for the next 10 minutes of your life. As an African-American you were born with dark skin, you were also born a gay man. Sadly in our society, both of those demographics have been marginalized by bigots and ignorant people. You, sir, were a member of both groups and I have no idea how that impacted your life. You have on the other hand been blessed with a wonderful appearance and substantial acting skills. You have many supporters. They say the crimes you have been charged with and convicted of could never have been perpetrated by you. But, Mr. Smollett, the evidence against you was not only substantial, it was overwhelming. Right now, right here, I'm giving you a choice. Contrition is good for the soul. You tell the world right now these words \"I'm sorry and I will treat you accordingly.\" You will be vilified for a month in social media, but then you'll be praised as someone who came clean, who succumbed to the pressure of being in a world where publicity and victimization were important. But you were a man who righted that wrong and apologized and asked for forgiveness and I, and the public will forgive you, but if you decline and choose to continue this charade, I will sentence you commensurate with the pain you caused, the money that was wasted when police should have been investigating real crimes, and the lives you have altered. Your choice, sir. Choose wisely. FOX Nation host, Tomi Lahren and FOX News contributor, Leo Terrell are here to react. All right, Leo talk to me.",

Some other things that are difficult to find are cheesecake, chicken nuggets, bacon, Doritos, chocolate, and even canned cat food. FOX Nation host, Tyrus is joining me now to break down all the latest food shortages in the supply chain. All right, Tyrus, what's going on in your family? Are you missing cream cheese and chicken nuggets? GEORGE \"TYRUS\" MURDOCH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Unfortunately, no, because I'm gluten free and I'm not allowed to have those things. So, I have to say that I -- those are first world problems. You know, we should - - we could figure some other stuff out if we had to. Judge, what I'm really concerned about is the cause and effect and one of the things that we're not talking about is how this inflation on top of supply and demand has really hurt the consumer, especially middle class Americans like perfect example, if you wanted to buy a new car today, let's say your typical car was like $30,000.00 for a small family car, that car is going to be $75,000.00. A suburban is $70,000.00, it's $140,000.00. So you make the thing, you sign the dotted line, you take the loan. Now as soon as you drive off that lot, that $30,000.00 car is now worth $15,000.00, but over your head is $75,000.00. You can't even trade that car in, not to mention how much it's going to cost us to put gas in it. So forget the fact we can't have cream cheese on our bagels. Our entire economy is in danger because one, we can't get goods; two, inflation is so high and businesses drive everything up, mom and pop shops in America are on red alert right now.

This country is going to hell in a handbasket and you know it. America today is a land of total chaos and confusion. Career criminals roam freely among us, maniacs burn down Christmas trees, flash-and-grab mob looters steal with impunity and random unprovoked acts of madness are the new norm. This, my friends, is all the result of left-wing progressive Marxist idiotic Democrats who lie about what we can see with our own eyes and who have at the helm a confused and senile Commander-in-Chief who has no idea how to command."

And then coming up with no less than a thousand reasons why she was stopped. I tell you, stopped from being coronated queen on high. To make matters worse, this loser is now teaching a master class on the power of resilience. She ought to know, she keeps popping up and won't go away no matter how hard the Democrats try. And as Secretary of Sadness in 2021, she gives her acceptance speech five years later. Take a look at the cash grab she is trying to make off the speech that thankfully she never gave on election night, 2016.

Mr. Gascon, you're a rogue prosecutor intent on undermining the rule of law and endangering the rest of us. I guess you forgot to include the fact that you put a ban on trying juveniles as adults, which juveniles continue to pose their allegiance to their gangs on social media while they're in custody. Example, a 40-year-old man whose car broke down in the wrong neighborhood in South LA, an area controlled by that same gang. While the man was waiting for help from AAA, a vehicle full of four Crips gang members spots him, pulls up and shoots him at least 36 times. As per DA Gascon's policy, they will not be tried as adults, but instead tried as juveniles, which means they get out of jail at 21, and of course, Gascon will not seek enhanced criminal punishment under California law that allows it under gang membership. This DA Gascon, he needs to be gone. He and his fellow progressive DA's around the nation funded by George Soros who seek to undermine the American justice system, they need to be recalled and removed from office, and if not, it's just a question of time before your life is impacted if it hasn't been already by the lawlessness enveloping this country. And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter #JudgeJeanine. And here with reaction to my open and much more, Executive Vice President of the Trump organization, Donald Trump Jr. joins me now.

These people, George Soros-funded, they're all over the country and right now George Gascon is a rogue prosecutor obviously, but he's seeking to undermine the rule of law and make Los Angeles more dangerous, and police are now coming out, Don, and saying, you know, you might want to rethink coming to LA, because we may not be able to keep you safe. And even if we can arrest you -- arrest the individual who assaults or maims or causes a problem, he is going to be walking before we finish our paperwork."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the problem, Jeanine. I mean, the Democratic Party has fallen so far. They are literally at this point defending pedophiles and calling them heroes. You know, that's just one example of many. You saw the outrage over Jussie Smollett. I was one of the first people to call that one like within a day or two of the incident just being like, hey, guys, like does anyone actually believe this story? They tried to cancel me. I was spreading conspiracy theories. I was a terrible human being, but I was right, because it was so obvious. If all of America takes that position and pushes back against this nonsense Democratic narrative, I think we actually have a chance of maintaining the freedoms, our free speech, and all of the things that made America the greatest country in the world. But the Democrats don't care about that anymore. They are literally pushing lawlessness. They are trying to turn us into the proverbial, let's call it, s-hole country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, there is no question that you know, the 12 cities in America with the highest increase in homicides, the highest homicide rates have one common denominator and that is of course a Democrat mayor. The mayor who gets to decide whether or not police are going to stand down, the mayor decides who the police chief is going to be. I mean, we're really in a lot of trouble, but I want to talk about a new book and it's called \"Our Journey Together\" and we talked about your father. And this book, tell me about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP JR.",
      "utterance": "Well listen, it's a great book. It started off with my father and I talking about some of the great achievements, talking about and contrasting them to the disaster that's gone on, right? When you have the media as your marketing department, the Democrats have this sort of great head start and this advantage. There were so many amazing stories that even I didn't know as an insider and he is telling me these stories as we're going through some of these pictures and I just said, you know, we have to put this in a book and we made this book called, \"Our Journey Together.\" A picture says a thousand words, Jeanine. It is the old saying, and you can see the accomplishment. You can see America first. You can see American greatness in this book. And when you compare that to what is going on in the last you know 10 to 11 months under the Democrat regime of Joe Biden, you realize what we had and what we're missing. And I guess, I honestly -- I'm even seeing it in the reporting. Even the mainstream media is having a hard time putting a positive spin on the lunacy that we are seeing on a daily basis. And so, this book, which you can get in, you know 45books.com and elsewhere, it's just a view of the Trump presidency. All of the things and all of the accomplishments that the media would never show you because they were too busy making up lies, they were too busy pushing Russia collusion, too busy doing anything possible to undermine the first President in a long time who has actually put America and the American people first. And me, as an American patriot, I miss that America."

And here with more on the left's radical agenda putting America last, former acting Director of National Intelligence, Ric Grenell. All right, Ric, you heard my open. It's just crazy. We've got cities across America, some of the biggest cities across America suffering the highest homicide rates in years and this is intentional. I'm not even going to ask you if you think it's intentional, it's intentional. When you defund police, when you tell police to stand down, when you tell police, if you touch an individual that you're about to arrest the wrong way, you know we're going to arrest you. Then you know, there is no motivation to try to have police do their jobs. Talk to me."

It has created chaos at the border. No one in America thinks that it is good to have an open border."

They are really upping every regulation possible and of course what happens, the price increases. It is pretty basic, but that radical policy of what they're doing in Washington is creating high gas prices. I could go through on inflation, on Ukraine and foreign policy. You know, what we have to understand is that when you elect a politician with radical policies like Gascon here in Los Angeles, you actually then have to deal with the implications of those radical policies."

My job was to lift up the crime victim. But you know, I want to talk about the fact that Biden and this whole administration is putting climate change ahead of blue-collar jobs and now inflation has gone up again. Last week, it was the highest in 30 years, this week, inflation is the highest in 39 years, and they come on television and lie to us and tell us don't believe your lying eyes. I mean, that's where we are now. They lie about everything."

Now what we have is a whole bunch of people and we all know this, they are working for the ruling party in D.C., and look I think that it's time we stop asking reporters to somehow be balanced. They are never going to be balanced. This is who they are."

It didn't matter what the facts were. To them it was about this is our guy and even if he is lying to the police, which a jury has found, unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt, we're with Jussie. I mean, this is America."

      "speaker": "GRENELL",

They own all of those decisions and when something like Jussie Smollett, which they pushed and manipulated on the public, when the decision comes down that Jussie Smollett is guilty and everyone at MSNBC at night ignores the story, Americans need to wake up. This isn't a news network, it is working for one political party. We have to be very clear about this and we have to start pushing back. If you're sitting out there and you're watching this, get up from your couch, you've got to get involved. You're losing your country."

Fairfax County Public Schools is just one of the latest examples reinstating two controversial books, \"Gender Queer\" and \"Lawn Boy\" to the library shelves that had been condemned by parents as obscene and pedophilic. My next guest has been visiting college campuses across the country, discussing the dangers of CRT and other controversial content being taught in schools. Turning Point U.S.A. founder and President, Charlie Kirk joins me now. All right, Charlie, what we've got here is we're back in Loudoun County in Virginia. We had the School Board and they are calling parents domestic terrorists, with the Attorney General following up and siccing law enforcement on them, parents apparently had condemned these two books and now, we find out that they're back on the shelves. Tell us about that."

One of the books has a passage that has a very graphic description of a relationship between a boy and a man. Why do people high school and in grade school need to be exposed to this? And what's most disappointing about this, Judge, is that parents sent a political message with the election of Youngkin in Virginia that they were sick of this nonsense happening in public schools and yet, now you see the public schools doubling down after that political message was sent. And I think this is defying the needs, wants, and interests of what parents are demanding in local schools and I hope that the new Governor of Virginia, Governor Youngkin will do something about this with whatever authority that he has at his disposal. And now, this is beyond just CRT and the wokeism that we've talked about. This is just very basic morality, which is what -- how does this create better people? How does this develop the character of the next generation? Parents are right to be outraged about this. We're seeing this every single day at Turning Point U.S.A. with the work we're doing at School Boards and college campuses. I wish they were listened to."

They were condemned and they were removed. \"Gender Queer\" and \"Lawn Boy,\" and so they were banned following the parents outcry. They were condemned by parents as obscene and pedophilic. And now the school board has returned them back to the library where the kids can access these books and it's not just about a relationship between a boy and a man, a 10-year-old. It is a pedophilic sexual relationship with images as you can see on the screen. I mean this is outrageous. It's as though they don't care what we say in our elections and what do you think Governor Youngkin is going to do about this?"

I mean, this probably would be something, okay, you know pedophilia has no place in our schools, just remove the book. But instead, they are doubling down on this. Why? What sort of constituency are they serving here? How does this create better citizens? How does this create people that are more likely to go into the world and understand right from wrong? This is disgusting. It's reprehensible, it's appalling this being a family-friendly show, I don't want to go into the exact details of what the words say in these books because it --"

We have America Fest. We'll have over 8,000 students from across the country. If people are interested, they could check it out at amfest.com. In fact, Judge, if they use promo code JUDGE, they can get 25 percent off, but we're seeing something so amazing happening where young people are starting to take ownership of their future.

The twisters killing dozens of people and leaving miles-long paths of destruction, President Biden has approved an emergency disaster declaration for Kentucky where Governor Andy Beshear says he is quote, 'Certain more than 70 people died.\" The powerful storms leveled homes and destroyed buildings including in Mayfield where the roof collapsed on a candle factory trapping more than 100 workers inside. In neighboring, Illinois, at least six people are dead after a tornado struck an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, that's northeast of St. Louis. Several workers are still missing, but the Fire Chief says rescue operations have now shifted to recovery operations. In Arkansas, a suspected tornado destroyed a nursing home in the City of Monett killing at least one person. I'm Ashley Strohmier, now back to JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE."

The police worked hard at solving the case. The Judge worked hard at moving the case. The jury worked hard at deliberations and the nation was divided because of Jussie Smollett's hoax. This is what I would say at the sentencing if I were the sentencing Judge. Mr. Smollett, I want you to think long and hard for the next 10 minutes of your life. As an African-American you were born with dark skin, you were also born a gay man. Sadly in our society, both of those demographics have been marginalized by bigots and ignorant people. You, sir, were a member of both groups and I have no idea how that impacted your life. You have on the other hand been blessed with a wonderful appearance and substantial acting skills. You have many supporters. They say the crimes you have been charged with and convicted of could never have been perpetrated by you. But, Mr. Smollett, the evidence against you was not only substantial, it was overwhelming. Right now, right here, I'm giving you a choice. Contrition is good for the soul. You tell the world right now these words \"I'm sorry and I will treat you accordingly.\" You will be vilified for a month in social media, but then you'll be praised as someone who came clean, who succumbed to the pressure of being in a world where publicity and victimization were important. But you were a man who righted that wrong and apologized and asked for forgiveness and I, and the public will forgive you, but if you decline and choose to continue this charade, I will sentence you commensurate with the pain you caused, the money that was wasted when police should have been investigating real crimes, and the lives you have altered. Your choice, sir. Choose wisely. FOX Nation host, Tomi Lahren and FOX News contributor, Leo Terrell are here to react. All right, Leo talk to me."

People died to make sure that people were treated equally and fairly, and he used that -- he used his race, his sexual orientation to exploit those laws and you know what? Besides Smollett, Robin Roberts, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, \"Good Morning, America,\" Don Lemon -- they're all guilty, because they promoted the Big Lie. And thank goodness, our jury system worked.

This goes to the core of how profitable victimhood has become in this country. He, you know paid folks to stage a hate crime against him, what was it -- nearly four grand -- that's how much he was willing to pay to get his name in the headlines and to be a victim. Victimhood is so celebrated in this country that people are willing to go to this lengths for a little bit of publicity and a few headlines and some public pity.

This is these government schools, not public schools, government schools that are forcing kids to have this mandate to take these shots without notification to the parents. It is inexcusable.

So, if we're going to talk about health and safety, I'm not sure bribing with junk food is really the way to go. But Leo is exactly right. This is all part of government control and it is that cradle to grave government control that they're seeking, and they start with the education system and that's what you're seeing with uh teachers right now, administrators, teachers unions. They want to play parent, they want to be parent, and the solution to this is for parents to get more involved.

There's a smear shortage right here in New York City as bagel shops all over are saying they're having a hard time stocking up on cream cheese because of guess what -- the supply chain shortage. Some other things that are difficult to find are cheesecake, chicken nuggets, bacon, Doritos, chocolate, and even canned cat food. FOX Nation host, Tyrus is joining me now to break down all the latest food shortages in the supply chain. All right, Tyrus, what's going on in your family? Are you missing cream cheese and chicken nuggets? GEORGE \"TYRUS\" MURDOCH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Unfortunately, no, because I'm gluten free and I'm not allowed to have those things. So, I have to say that I -- those are first world problems. You know, we should - - we could figure some other stuff out if we had to. Judge, what I'm really concerned about is the cause and effect and one of the things that we're not talking about is how this inflation on top of supply and demand has really hurt the consumer, especially middle class Americans like perfect example, if you wanted to buy a new car today, let's say your typical car was like $30,000.00 for a small family car, that car is going to be $75,000.00. A suburban is $70,000.00, it's $140,000.00. So you make the thing, you sign the dotted line, you take the loan. Now as soon as you drive off that lot, that $30,000.00 car is now worth $15,000.00, but over your head is $75,000.00. You can't even trade that car in, not to mention how much it's going to cost us to put gas in it. So forget the fact we can't have cream cheese on our bagels. Our entire economy is in danger because one, we can't get goods; two, inflation is so high and businesses drive everything up, mom and pop shops in America are on red alert right now. So, it is just tragic."

This week, it is the worst it's been in 39 years and this guy gets on television from the White House, the Economic Council and says Build Back Better will solve our problems when it comes to inflation.

For whom? Even billionaires are saying, Elon Musk is saying, this is terrible. This administration has dropped the ball and you, Judge, you're a stickler. You take no mess from nobody. I'm pretty much middle of the lane, I try to let you know bygones be bygones. No, because this is not only affecting my household, my neighborhood, my communities. I see people trying to decide, you know do we even bother with Christmas presents this year? Because we might not be able to pay for simple things, and for them to say it is good -- Here is the deal, Build Back Better even if the fastest is what -- 10 years away, you can't have infrastructure when you have no steel, no workers, and no gasoline in a bulldozer to build anything. They continue to fill us with fantasies. Give us one thing. Here, you want to help, you want to Build Back America, tighten up our borders. Watch the domino effect.
