I don't think the defense team really wanted to remind jurors that she was also a victim in this thing, in Bill Cosby's extramarital activities. But now we're learning that she was very, very angry when this trial went down.

The Times said the shooter had been incited by a Sarah Palin political map with crosshairs on 20 targeted Democratic districts including Gabby Giffords' district. There is no evidence the killer even saw that map and plus he was mentally ill. The Times has ran an embarrassing correction that's good, but even worse than the alt-right falsehood was how tone deaf the editors were. They tried to blame right-wing rhetoric for political violence to deflect from some conservatives blaming left-wing rhetoric for the Trump haters shooting spree in Virginia.

So this Hodgkinson guy, and as I said, he's a Trump hater, despises Republicans, doesn't mean that Bernie Sanders is responsible or Rachel Maddow whose show he watches is responsible. But I get the sense that some conservative pundits are suggesting while this is kind of typical of liberals or liberal hate."

      "speaker": "BENSON",

And immediately the left's narrative was Palin is responsible, the Tea Party is responsible, right-wing hate is responsible. There was not one scintilla of evidence for that. Her shooter was a schizophrenic who was not political and not remotely right wing and yet that big lie took root so deeply that The New York Times editorial board repeated it this week and had to correct themselves."

There was that bull's-eye thing which made people jump to conclusions, but they were wrong conclusions. Now, I believe that, you know, there was less of this I thought this time. I just want to say that again. I think there was less of it this time than there usually has been."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Because of the partisan angle there, right. I think that the left and the media is much more willing to run with the narrative that right wingers are at fault than in the other direction. We saw a few questions about it and then the media sort of just moved on, let's have a nice time at the congressional baseball game. That's great. But if this was a right- winger shooting a Democratic congress people, we would be having a different conversation. I am confident of that."

      "speaker": "MCPIKE",
      "utterance": "I'm not even sure that I want to go down that road. I think in this case obviously because the shooter targeted part of the members of Congress there is an element to that. But in so many mass shootings there are political angles and it's not just about partisanship, but you have shooters trying to make some kind of political statement. This thing that bothered me about some of the coverage in the days following was that a number of reporters asked about increased security for members of Congress. I think if I were the parent of a student in Newtown or member of that church in Charleston or a teenager in Aurora or a patron of the nightclub in Orlando, I would have been a little bit irritated that the media focused on security for members of Congress and not in these other cases. I think we went down a different road and we could have done a better job in some of the question that we're asking. Now, we know that there's always after a number of mass shootings on the right at least. There is anger that the press always goes to gun control. But we do need to ask better questions about the intersection between access to guns and mental health and we need to keep on those questions."

So, right after the shooting I thought that Paul Ryan in the House and joined by Nancy Pelosi, you know, gave very unifying statements. Ryan talking about an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. But the next day, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi talked about a case in which she had faced a stalker who made death threats and listen to what she said."

The congressman, Mike Bost, who is the Illinois congressman who represents the shooter, his office received 14 messages in the last six months from the shooter saying they were angry messages. But he said he never had any threats. Well, I would like to see those messages that shooter gave to the member of Congress through his office. You know, why -- if they saw these things, didn't they do a better job trying to prevent it before. He might not have any threats, well, he said there were no threats, but if you're getting angry messages --"

And yet, and list a couple of his positions which claims oppose gay marriage and ban on semi-automatic weapons.\" So, the guy faced an imminent risk of death.

They talked about what happened. We learned first we thought one member was shot, then we learned actually he only injured his foot and the only member injured was Steve Scalise. It took a while to ferret out who was injured from a bullet and who was injured dodging a bullet. So that was part of the confusion amongst all of us initially. When the lawmakers came in from the field, we got a clearer picture, first-hand account. I mean you don't often get that right away."

And the sense -- the overwhelming sense from them when they came in and which has what it made it so incredibly raw was that they felt as though they had just dodged death because they were sitting on a field, you know, they talked about if the gunman, if Hodgkinson had turned a corner into the dugout, then many more of them would have been shot because they were cornered, you know, things -- stories like that, very compelling."

You know, people who weren't there, the Democrats who were in the minority, you know, they don't have any legislative control. There always going to be the ones right now to be the most vocal, the most critical. I know that that's not going to change because they're too far apart politically on what they want to accomplish."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let's take a deeper dive on these emotional questions of media coverage, partisan rhetoric and the shooting at a Virginia baseball field. Joining us now from New York is Rich Rowley, editor of National Review and Fox News contributor, which some conservative voices in the media and politics are saying that because the shooter hated Republicans and targeted Republicans, that the violence is somehow linked to harsh or hateful liberal rhetoric. Does that go too far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICH LOWRY, NATIONAL REVIEW",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't really buy that. I don't like it when the left does that to conservatives when there are shootings. I don't think we should do it to them. There's nothing that Bernie Sanders has said that would possibly lead any rational person to go and massacre Republican congressmen. So look, I think everyone should be civil, just because being civil is a good in its own right. We should always treat people with respect and recognize every individual has decency. We're all Americans. But the idea that any political rhetoric beyond saying go and shoot these people incites violence, I really reject."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I totally agree with you and the whole guilt by association efforts by more extreme partisans on both sides just drives me crazy especially at a time of tragedy. But why do you think that we have reached a tone now where so many political partisans say such inflammatory things, not necessarily up and coming violence of course but do you think the media culture in part rewards that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Well, in part, you know, we have small Democratic media now where pretty much anyone can have a soap box so that means there are fewer guard rails than there've ever been before. But also with a little perspective, you know, you look back just recent history. The Democrats considered George W. Bush a budding tyrant. The Republicans considered Barack Obama a budding tyrant. Democrats now consider Donald Trump a budding tyrant. And this is nothing new. This goes back literally to the beginning of our history where both Jefferson and Hamilton considered each other dangerous and potential budding tyrant. So this is just kind of the idiom of American politics. I think it's part of having a robust and open constant argument about how we should run our country and I don't think any of that necessarily leads anyone to go out and shoot people. It just doesn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I agree with you again there but the idea that these are all potential tyrants seems to me to that it sort of fall into the, you know, media/political warfare techniques of demonizing the opponents there not just people you are totally wrong (INAUDIBLE) policies, you don't like them personally, that they are evil. They are a threat to democracy and it would be nice if we could tone that down. But as you say, you know, in the age of twitter, anybody can say that and then it gets picked up and cable news does segments about it and that sort of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I have to say how one thing that's really bothered me about the coverage. It's hard to prove but I think it's fairly obvious -- if this had been a Trump supporter who committed such an act of violence, there wouldn't have been anything Donald Trump could have said that would convince anyone in the media that he wasn't responsible. And every Republican in the country would have to answer for it. Now, there's been and lot of conversation and discussion driven by this perpetrator's political views, but it hasn't been as thermonuclear as if he had been someone on the right side of the political spectrum. And then also you still have folks in the media attached to this ridiculous narrative that somehow the shooting of Gabby Giffords perpetrated by a young man who's a paranoid schizophrenic literally out of his mind had something to do with Sarah Palin, a political rhetoric on the right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Absurd at the time, equally absurd looking back six years later. Let's switch to the special counsel's investigation. So, Washington Post reports this week that Bob Mueller is looking at Jared Kushner's business dealings. Big breaking news, everybody picks it up. Well, wouldn't any competent prosecutor be looking at a real estate guy who has had some contacts with the Russians? In other words, is this a, you know, routine part of an investigation? Jared Kushner's lawyer says its standard practice that somehow, you know, makes these screaming headlines."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "I think it's more alarming than that and I think it's a bad sign that Mueller's investigation is spreading well beyond what should be its writ, which is basically finding if the Trump campaign collude with the Russians. But we're sort of far beyond that even, you know, just a month into his appointment, and I kind of believe -- I can't prove it -- but I believe that people will end up being indicted for financial wrongdoing that has almost zero connection to what was supposed to be the purpose of this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean I would say the same thing with all the headlines about Mike Pence has hired a lawyer. Well, any top official who is going to ever have to talk to the FBI is going to hire an attorney and so each thing I think is getting legitimate stories but the volume has cranked up to 11. You know, special prosecutors often expand their mandate, but once James Comey made those allegations at the Senate hearing, doesn't Mueller in order to be credible, if he decides to bring no charges against anybody have to look into some of these things and is that the way it's being portrayed by the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's just always tempting for the special counsels have nothing else to do. This is all they focus on to go until they find something, even if there is nothing on the original charge. And the big problem I have with the media coverage is focused so much on the so-called smoke, you know, but when there's a story that creates a lot of smoke like this New York Times story a couple of months ago about Trump campaign officials allegedly having routine communications with Russian officials and Russian intelligence. You have James Comey Saying that story is flat-out false. All the outlets that repeated that in print, on cable TV, none of them go back and say, oh, we're very sorry we ever, you know, said this or repeated the story, and some smoke just left the room. We want everyone in America in the know. They never do that."

      "utterance": "Well, look, they should have expected this. When you are interviewing Alex Jones you should expect that every call you do with him, anything you say with him, he's going to be recording, so I don't think it should come as a surprise, and not to say that upon listening to what he released of Megyn Kelly's comments, I think she came across fine, meaning, you know, we all know how the booking process works, right. And people end up trying to sweet talk people, convince them to come on, et cetera. And a lot of people say some pretty embarrassing stuff. I didn't hear that from Megyn Kelly."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, sweet talking guest is not a journalistic felony. But, you know, what's more serious and what I find heartbreaking is, you know, the families of the Sandy Hook victims saying that Alex Jones has made their lives a living hell, that he's caused them pain and he's accused them of being actors, some now threatening to sue NBC. And just for example the family of Victorio Soto, the teacher killed at the school writes, \"this is incessant need foro ratings at the cost of the emotional well-being of our family. It's disgusting and disappointing.\" So you have to stop and ask, given that impact on that community in Connecticut, is this really worth doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABRAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, I get it. I hear them and as someone who has covered legal stories and crime story for most of my career, I know how those families feel. And yet I've interviewed murderers for network television and it hasn't had this kind of response. That doesn't necessarily male it right but it means that for some reason we're treating the Alex Jones interview as a more sort of journalistic minefield than when we interview murderers or suspected murders. And that's the part that I don't quite get from a journalistic point of view."

      "speaker": "ABRAMS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABRAMS",
      "utterance": "Oh, come on, you really believe that? I mean, I think that Alex Jones just wants to get more attention for this. I think he's using every piece of the cow that he can and part of that involves him demanding that NBC not air the interview. I mean, he hasn't seen the interview. What is he talking about? I mean, this notion -- I mean, she even makes clear in the pre-interview she does with him, yes, I'm going to have to ask you the tough questions. He's making it seem like he had no idea that there would be hard questions. Look, this is great. The only true winner from this is Alex Jones no matter what the interview is, no matter what part they air. Megyn Kelly is getting beaten up from both sides on this. Alex Jones' supporters saying, oh, look how unfair you are already. People on the left saying how can you give Alex Jones any time, and then of course most importantly as you point out, those families which I'm sure is the hardest part for someone like Megyn Kelly to hear."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. So we have a little bit of time left, you know, Megyn Kelly makes the point that President Trump went on Alex Jones' radio show called (INAUDIBLE) the election. That makes Jones more newsworthy, but ultimately is this about NBC and Megyn confronting Alex Jones about alleged falsehoods or is it also about generating buzz and ratings for her new NBC magazine show?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABRAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, every magazine show is about both those things. I mean the notion that NBC's magazine show can't focus on ratings. Of course, they're focused on ratings. Of course they did this in part because they thought Alex Jones would be a good rating worthy interview. But I think that it's also a good interview for them to do depending on -- look, if she asks softball questions, criticize her. If they air an interview where she is letting him get away with some of this nonsense, then let's criticize her. But until we see that interview, until we see what she's done, I just think that the criticism here has been incredibly unfair before you see it."

      "utterance": "NBC News says that while Alex Jones is trying to distract from and even block the segment, the network (INAUDIBLE) for context and inside into a controversial and polarizing figure. But the NBC station in Connecticut where the school shooting took place not airing the interview tonight. After the break, many in the media stunned that Bill Cosby wasn't convicted yesterday in his sexual assault trial. But, should they really be surprised?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The media's interest in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial surged yesterday as the case based on 13-year-old allegations ended with a hung jury. And the comedian's wife, Camille, put out a statement denouncing the D.A., the lawyers and especially the media."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "How do I describe many but not all, general media blatantly vicious entities that continually disseminated intentional omissions of truth for the primary purpose of greedily selling, sensationalism at the expense of a human life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now from New York is Carley Shimkus, a reporter for Fox News 24/7 Headlines on Sirius/XM. Carley, I said to you on last week's show that the jury might fail to convict Bill Cosby even though he had essentially been convicted by the media. What do you make of Camille Cosby's statement going to coverage of vicious and so forth? CARLEY SHIMKUS, REPORTER, FOX NEWS 27/7 HEADLINES: Well we didn't really see a lot of Camille Cosby during the trial which could have been a strategic position by the defense. I don't think the defense team really wanted to remind jurors that she was also a victim in this thing, in Bill Cosby's extramarital activities. But now we're learning that she was very, very angry when this trial went down. Like you said, she called the district attorney exploitively ambitious, the judge arrogant and she called the media blatantly vicious entities that lie for the purpose of selling sensationalism. Listen, I feel for Camille Cosby but the media was just reporting the facts and the facts maybe that the facts were sensational and shocking, but that's not the media's fault."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well that might be true -- that might be true in this particular case, and one of the reasons the jury maybe deadlocked was because Amanda Constand, the accuser in the case, you know, had made conflicting statements to police early on. But you know, more than 60 women have accused Bill Cosby of sexual misconduct, on very chilling degrees and certainly the coverage has been very negative, but you know, his wife is only addressing this and not addressing the fact that, you know, even if some of these women are exaggerating and even making it up, the vast majority can't be in my view."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Yes, and you know what, the Cosby team is claiming this a victory after the spokesperson even says that his legacy is completely restored. I'd probably pump the brakes on that a little bit if I were his spokesperson because this was not an acquittal. This was just a mistrial and the district attorney has said that they are going to retry the case. The bottom line here is that his legacy is not going to be the Cosby Show or any of his comedy. It is this disturbing chapter of his life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, much of his life. It is going to be a re-trial, and by the way, it's hard to get Cosby's side because he hasn't talked to the press about this during all this time. Let's switch to this Julius Caesar production, I mean, this in my view was a kind of an outrage. New York's public theater putting a Trump character with the red tie and the orange hair on the stage, stabbed to death. We see the scene there. And so two major corporations, Delta and Bank of America have pulled their funding from this production in New York, but the \"New York Times\" is continuing to fund this play saying the company is doing so in the grounds of free speech for the arts. Your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Yes, the \"New York Times\" coverage of the story has absolutely blown my mind. They've covered -- they've written several articles detailing the growing outrage over this Julius Caesar play, and then at the very end, Howie, the very final paragraph, they squeak in a line about how the \"Times\" has sponsored the public theater for 20 years and they will continue to do so. Listen, they can sponsor whoever they want. That's completely fine. It makes sense. I'm sure their audiences overlap. But they need to tell the audience that in advance. That has to be their opening line so that the reader knows that what they are going to read is biased and that the publication has taken a side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, the report is not necessarily biased, but what stunned me on that very day was the front page story on this including the other corporations bailing out, no mention in the \"Times\" and then the sidebar, inside the paper piece that you mentioned is in the 27th paragraph of a 28 paragraph story, the very controversy that was being covered as you pointed out."

      "speaker": "SHIKUS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, yes, it is pretty crazy."

      "utterance": "Still to come, my thoughts on the different \"New York Times\" story, the paper reviving a discredited theory about the shooting of a Democratic congresswoman six years ago and getting it wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The New York Times ran a truly disgraceful editorial after the shooting of Republican Steve Scalise and four other people. It having voices on both sides urging that we lower the temperature and the paper revived a discredited theory from six years ago when Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot and six other people killed. The Times said the shooter had been incited by a Sarah Palin political map with crosshairs on 20 targeted Democratic districts including Gabby Giffords' district. There is no evidence the killer even saw that map and plus he was mentally ill. The Times has ran an embarrassing correction that's good, but even worse than the alt-right falsehood was how tone deaf the editors were. They tried to blame right-wing rhetoric for political violence to deflect from some conservatives blaming left-wing rhetoric for the Trump haters shooting spree in Virginia. Both are wring and the Times should never have published that creed (ph). That's it for this edition of \"Media Buzz.\" I'm Howard Kurtz.
