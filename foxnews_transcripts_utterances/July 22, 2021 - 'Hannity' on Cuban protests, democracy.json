It's not because of these side issues. They want a new government. They want a free Cuba. And it's, I think, incumbent upon us in the United States to be supportive of those efforts. I have called on Joe Biden. The communist regime has shut down Internet. Let's work to beam Internet onto the island of Cuba, so these folks have a fighting chance to converse with one another, to send what's going on to the outside world. Let's build an international coalition, so that the regime knows the free world stands with the people of Cuba. And you know, Sean, I think it's a -- it's great that you're here in Florida. We take pride in being the free state of Florida, right? This is the beating heart of freedom in Florida, in Little Havana, because everybody in this community has been affected in one way or another by the communist dictatorship. Maybe they have had loved ones that have been killed by the regime, imprisoned by the regime. And, obviously, all of their relatives at one point fled a very evil regime. And so I think you're seeing people take to the streets here because we understand, after 62 years, something is different on that island right now. We have an opportunity to really take a new chapter in history. And I think you pointed out in your monologue Cuba would be a phenomenal ally of our country if it was free. They would boom like probably few countries in the Caribbean. It would be a boon for the people of Cuba, and it would also be great for relations with the United States.",

And if he's willing to do that, I think it will make a positive difference. As it stands now, he's basically just sitting there doing nothing. He's leaving these folks out to dry. And what's going to end up happening, if they're -- they don't get any type of assistance, the regime will continue to clamp down, and they will eventually stamp this out, and then they will remain even stronger in power.

Senator Rubio, who will join us in a minute, rightly pointed out that the embargo works.

Let's understand who the people are that are on the right side of freedom. Let's stand with them. And let's tighten the screws on this regime. You know, I think one of the reasons this is happening now is because Trump turned the screws on the regime in Havana and in Venezuela. Biden wants to liberalize all that.

It's about controlling people. A Marxist system wants to keep people poor, because poor people are easier to control. A Marxist system is about leveraging people, basically saying, you're not going to have food, you're not going to have medicine, you're not going to have any benefits unless you agree to do what we want. So that's the first thing. The second thing, it's a tyranny. Tyranny doesn't promote competence. The leaders of Cuba aren't just evil. They're incompetent people, because, in Cuba, you don't get promoted for being smart. You get promoted because you're loyal, because you're compliant, because you give in. The third is, they're liars. Marxism and socialism always has to lie. Fidel was a liar. And every one of them are liars. There is no U.S. embargo against the Cuban people. If a Cuban tonight wants to open up a Versailles in Cuba, they can, and we can sell them stuff. The only embargo is on the Cuban regime, because they own everything. Every business, every hotel, every restaurant, they own it. They own every single one of them. And what President Trump did is, he said, very -- and the policies he put in place, it was very simple. If you're a private citizen of Cuba, you can open up a private business, and we can do trade with you. But we're not going to do trade with military-owned companies, because all that money goes into their pocket. So that's what's happening here. The people of Cuba, especially now that they have had access to the Internet, they realize -- they see how their cousins, their families are living outside of Cuba. You know, Cuban Americans are less than half of 1 percent of the United States population. They have been presidents and CEOs of major corporations, presidents of universities. They have been ambassadors. They have been members of the Cabinet, successful in every field, entertainment, art. They even represent 3 percent of the United States Senate, even though we're half of 1 percent of the U.S. population, and that intelligence...",

It's not because of these side issues. They want a new government. They want a free Cuba. And it's, I think, incumbent upon us in the United States to be supportive of those efforts. I have called on Joe Biden. The communist regime has shut down Internet. Let's work to beam Internet onto the island of Cuba, so these folks have a fighting chance to converse with one another, to send what's going on to the outside world. Let's build an international coalition, so that the regime knows the free world stands with the people of Cuba. And you know, Sean, I think it's a -- it's great that you're here in Florida. We take pride in being the free state of Florida, right? This is the beating heart of freedom in Florida, in Little Havana, because everybody in this community has been affected in one way or another by the communist dictatorship. Maybe they have had loved ones that have been killed by the regime, imprisoned by the regime. And, obviously, all of their relatives at one point fled a very evil regime. And so I think you're seeing people take to the streets here because we understand, after 62 years, something is different on that island right now. We have an opportunity to really take a new chapter in history. And I think you pointed out in your monologue Cuba would be a phenomenal ally of our country if it was free. They would boom like probably few countries in the Caribbean. It would be a boon for the people of Cuba, and it would also be great for relations with the United States."

And if he's willing to do that, I think it will make a positive difference. As it stands now, he's basically just sitting there doing nothing. He's leaving these folks out to dry. And what's going to end up happening, if they're -- they don't get any type of assistance, the regime will continue to clamp down, and they will eventually stamp this out, and then they will remain even stronger in power. And that will be a huge blow to the cause of freedom."

Senator Rubio, who will join us in a minute, rightly pointed out that the embargo works. On the other hand, if the embargo -- if things get progressively worse, then people that are already struggling to get bare necessities, they will even be in more trouble. So, it's a -- you got to balance it."

Let's understand who the people are that are on the right side of freedom. Let's stand with them. And let's tighten the screws on this regime. You know, I think one of the reasons this is happening now is because Trump turned the screws on the regime in Havana and in Venezuela. Biden wants to liberalize all that. And I think all that will do is entrench the regime in power, and really, really make tyranny rule on the island even more."

I would argue, if this movement is successful -- tell me if you agree or disagree -- in five years, the amount of money that would be invested to build resorts and hotels and vacation spots, in five years, this country would be remade at a level that nobody could imagine.

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Cuba is a failure because socialism doesn't work. Marxism doesn't work. Marxism is about power, and nothing to do with prosperity. It's about controlling people. A Marxist system wants to keep people poor, because poor people are easier to control. A Marxist system is about leveraging people, basically saying, you're not going to have food, you're not going to have medicine, you're not going to have any benefits unless you agree to do what we want. So that's the first thing. The second thing, it's a tyranny. Tyranny doesn't promote competence. The leaders of Cuba aren't just evil. They're incompetent people, because, in Cuba, you don't get promoted for being smart. You get promoted because you're loyal, because you're compliant, because you give in. The third is, they're liars. Marxism and socialism always has to lie. Fidel was a liar. And every one of them are liars. There is no U.S. embargo against the Cuban people. If a Cuban tonight wants to open up a Versailles in Cuba, they can, and we can sell them stuff. The only embargo is on the Cuban regime, because they own everything. Every business, every hotel, every restaurant, they own it. They own every single one of them. And what President Trump did is, he said, very -- and the policies he put in place, it was very simple. If you're a private citizen of Cuba, you can open up a private business, and we can do trade with you. But we're not going to do trade with military-owned companies, because all that money goes into their pocket. So that's what's happening here. The people of Cuba, especially now that they have had access to the Internet, they realize -- they see how their cousins, their families are living outside of Cuba. You know, Cuban Americans are less than half of 1 percent of the United States population. They have been presidents and CEOs of major corporations, presidents of universities. They have been ambassadors. They have been members of the Cabinet, successful in every field, entertainment, art. They even represent 3 percent of the United States Senate, even though we're half of 1 percent of the U.S. population, and that intelligence..."

The remittances -- the remittances go to a bank that they set up, the military set up in Panama, OK? You send the money, they take 10 percent off the top. Then they take your dollars away from you, they turn it into this Cuban currency that's worthless. It's worthless in Cuba, imagine everywhere else. And then they keep the dollars. It's a scheme. And they're walking us right into the trap and you've got the two people in charge of Cuba policy right now. And the Biden administration want to open it all up. One of them, the lady at the State Department was the one organizing trips to take congressmen and senators to Cuba to fawn and grovel all over the Cuban regime, so of course these policies are schizophrenic. The people in charge of it are sympathizers."

They have a major spy station there in Lourdes. It's a SIGINT station that collects signals intelligence on SouthCom, Southern, Special Operations Command, Southern Command, NASA, everything you want, they're already there. It wouldn't surprise me if they sent some of these military contractors they use all over the world. But in the end, it's not going to save this regime. This regime has been mortally wounded. It's lost its legitimacy. I'm not telling you it's going to quick and it's going to be easy. But it's a dying animal. And we need to do everything we can to expedite its passing."

And we're going to talk to and have a little bit of a Town Hall with the people that have come to support the people in Cuba that are fighting for freedom. We'll get to all of that straight ahead because now, just as the Biden administration is allowing hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants to pour across the Southern border, it is forcefully warning migrants from Cuba, if you arrive by sea, we're going to send you back. Hold on. But if you arrive at the Southern border, we will just process you, and we will let you break the law. And then we will probably give you free transportation to one of the 48 states in the continental United States.

He fled soon after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. He was then recruited by the CIA. Bravely, in 1961, he was smuggled back into Cuba to help coordinate the Bay of Pigs invasion. Felix Rodriguez also took part in a mission that captured communist revolutionary Che Guevara in Bolivia. And I have a picture of to show -- prove it. He gave it to me tonight. I was very honored. And, Felix, thank you for joining us. We appreciate it. What an incredible story. So, real quick story on my end. I'm broadcasting in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1990 to 1992. I have been at this a couple of years. And I'm there. And I meet this man. And his name was Armando de Quesada (ph). He owned Mando's Pizza (ph). He was an advertiser on my radio show. His family were wealthy landowners. They were killed. His neighbors were killed, their land stolen, confiscated. You know firsthand. You risked your life to do what you did for the cause of freedom going back that far."

Also, he confiscated a lot of the property from all the Cubans. And he was responsible all the way for hundreds of thousands of political prisoners. So, I think that, especially when I saw -- I was in a school in Pennsylvania. And I saw what's going on with this firing squad -- and I graduated in 1960. I was supposed to go to University of Miami. But when I saw what was happening in my homeland, I said it was more important to do something than to go to university. That's when I joined the -- what was called later on the Bay of Pigs invasion. I am glad to be there. I will never change what I have done, the same all of our people from the brigade, goes from all the ages and from all races in Cuba. And we were all united for one cause only, to liberate our country. And we haven't finished yet, until Cuba is free."

One question I have, when Joe Biden -- now they have been facilitating this law-breaking at our southern border and basically nobody gets sent back. You just get, OK, it's not even catch and release. It's just, write down your name, release, and we will ship you off to another state. But if you come by sea, Joe is saying, no, you will be sent back. Am I to read anything into that?"

No, they are saying we want freedom. And something that my colleagues said here is that many demonstrations, you see the American flag. So what a coincidence that you see the American flag for people that feel the oppression of socialism. While in this country, unfortunately, some people are spitting on it."

And then they did some Zoom call with some people and then came back with some third weekend statement. So I don't think you can -- right now, we can't even get him to do the internet, how are we going to get him to do anything else? It's a real challenge here with all of this."

They can't communicate now with their loved ones and their friends and their family. And the internet is crucial. I agree with you. You've been right about that. And I think there is great cowardice of Biden. Is there more we can do? What should the doctrine be if we talk about a doctrine?"

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",

And I can guarantee you, if Biden is missing in action more, you are going to see China and Russia and some of those have even more influence on the island of Cuba without question. So I think you can work with Organization of American States. I think you can work with other members of the international community to stand together and support people who are being oppressed. This should be a no-brainer given the history of 62 years of repression. Instead, you have Biden's administration having our own country be criticized for racism. They are inviting that. That's their priority rather than helping folks who could really make a difference. So, it's bizarre."

This is not going to end any time and it shouldn't. It's Cuba's cry for freedom is what we are seeing. But here in America, we have a Marxist-based organization, Black Lives Matter, say they care about Black lives, what about Afro-Cubans? They don't because communism doesn't know color. And Marxists like Black Lives Matter have come out not tacitly but outwardly in support of the Cuban regime against the people. They are a fraud. It's a grift. But they are a dangerous fraud and grift. And I went up and down Calle Ocho, spoke to so many people including visitors, Cubans, sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters. I also spoke to people who had survived prison in Cuba. And believe me, they don't understand -- but they do understand communism. They don't understand how anyone in this country, anyone supported by the Democrat (ph) Socialists of America can support communism. And we have that in Congress. And we have that in the United States Senate. I spoke to this one young woman. Just watch this."

We probably should all wake up every day and before our feet hit the ground think, you know, the rest of the world doesn't live free.
