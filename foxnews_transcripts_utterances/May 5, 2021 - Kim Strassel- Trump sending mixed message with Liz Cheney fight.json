Take a look at this. The cost of the American Families Plan, originally thought to be about $1.8 trillion over 10 years, now closer to $2.5 trillion. That's an increase of $700 billion. If you want to put it in perspective with the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, the American Family Plan, brace yourself here, the total cost now more than $7 trillion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The price goes up.

He's thrown his loyal vice president over the side because Mike Pence refused to pull an unconstitutional stunt to invalidate the pro forma Electoral College count on January 6.

Kim Strassel now, The Wall Street Journal editorial board member.

That was about her impeachment vote and her right to speak her conscience and vote her conscience.

Here's -- again, short term, not a problem. Recent earnings were very good. But you're getting Republicans in Congress who in the past said, OK, let's just suck it up for all these liberal woke companies, tech companies, and they're good for the economy. They're capitalists. Let's just forget about their -- even if they're giving support to the left. And I don't think -- that is eroding right now. And here's the real problem that they have. If you get a Republican administration, if you get to Republicans in Congress and the House, you can really get a revoking of Section 230, their protection, which essentially allows them to put whatever they want on their Web site without legal consequences. And if that happens, that stock will go -- will be cut in half. And that's, I think, the long-term problem that they have. They have so angered the Republican Party. I don't -- there is -- everybody in the party in leadership wants to basically make sure that Facebook, Amazon and all these woke tech companies, they get a pound of flesh out of them. And if you don't have the Republicans protecting you, you definitely are never going to get Elizabeth Warren protecting you. You are screwed from a company standpoint. So, again, short term, not a problem, Neil, but long term, if they lose that Section 230 protection, which they really could, because the GOP is moving against them, they are in deep, deep trouble, and that stock gets cut in half. I will point out one other thing. It's one thing to ban Donald Trump. And here's I think what a lot of Republicans, cons are -- can't believe. You ban him, but you don't ban the liberals and some of the leftists and some of the dictators on the left that say worse stuff.",

It's about an eight or nine restaurant group based in Philadelphia, and they have instituted a $15 minimum wage for all their employees, so essentially paying more then. And maybe you see a lot of competition out here. This is 18th Street in Philadelphia, right across the street, restaurants, down the block, restaurants. They're competing for the same workers. They're now paying their workers more. This is the called the Marquis Restaurant Group. And the question -- two questions. One, you're paying $15, maybe you have a better shot at keeping employees, but your costs go up, don't they? So do they get passed on along to the folks that want to eat the food at your restaurant?

Right now, it's funded through Labor Day of this year, September the 6th, these enhanced unemployment benefits. And I bet there will be pressure from a lot of folks who are hearing from their constituents about the challenges of getting people to go back to work to taper that September 6.

But the numbers simply don't add up, that the $2.5 trillion that the president wants in higher taxes largely on the wealthy will not come close to paying for the more than $7 trillion of spending planned right now. In fact, they have been adding to that spending figure, because some of the base costs have risen precipitously, including credits and how many get them for childcare, free college tuition and the rest for those attending a community college, that they were actually lowballing those numbers, and hence this is the position we're in. So, when the president talks about all of this being paid for, the reality is, the mathematical reality is, we are nowhere near that. And that is what is worrying a number of Democrats on Capitol Hill Amie Parnes broke that story in The Hill and has a little bit more for it. So, Amie, ones of the things I was intrigued in your story is that Democrats are getting a little anxious about this the closer we get to the midterms. They think this could come back to bite them.

And so I think that that is sort of what's playing on the minds of some Democrats. People think it's unsustainable. They would like to -- these are more moderate Democrats, obviously. But they would like something that they can work with. And they think that the $6 trillion number is just inexplicable, and that they won't be able to explain it away in 2022."

But the argument has always been for the president, the thing he has going for him is the booming economy, things are turning around quickly, that that might negate whatever issues come up and how much money he's spending. Republicans say, you don't need to spend it. People who are convinced that they're not paying for it, or at least thinking that, will maybe welcome it, especially if things look like they're continuing to chug along. What do you think?"

And so he has that momentum going. But I think this is going to be a tougher pill to swallow. And it's given a lot of pause to some of these more moderate Democrats. And if he wants everyone to -- if this goes into reconciliation, for instance, and he needs his entire party, he's going to have a tough time trying to convince senators like Manchin and Sinema to get on board."

And I'm wondering if that's what they're hoping for. Pay no attention to this. Look at the shiny object of stimulus and economic reports that are -- that are improving coming your way."

And they think that it's not -- that doesn't look good or as promising when -- they think that when voters start to figure out what's happening and how much money is coming out, and how much this will cost them, that this won't be good for Democrats in 2022. And some actually point to Obama and what happened after he pushed through the Affordable Care Act, and how that didn't play so well for Democrats in 2010 and how, even in President Obama's terms, they got shellacked.

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good afternoon, Neil. Well, this is the problem. You know, liberals are saying spend more. Moderates are very concerned, as Amie alluded to. And the issue for Democrats on this is not the filibuster. It's the -- the base problem here is, they don't seem to have the votes to be able to pass many of these things. They're able to kind of pin this on the Republicans, saying, oh, we need to get to 60 votes, or we need to get rid of the filibuster. The problem is the math on the Democratic side of the aisle. And you know what this reminds me of, especially with the president's infrastructure plan and all the other ancillary things that go with it? This reminds me of the health care fight in 1993-1994, Hillarycare, where they fought, because it was such a complex bill. This infrastructure package is so complex, and so many tax components to it, that they fought all of 1993 and 1994 and never passed anything. I have been told that they don't think that they can get anything done on this infrastructure package probably until fall, at the earliest. And, again, as Amie alluded to, there are these competing thoughts inside the Democratic caucuses. Do they go for broke, try to pass everything because they have the House, Senate and the White House, and then, if the voters kick them out next time, fine, they have passed these things, or do they try to protect those majorities? You don't get the stars to align very often, and that's the concern right now on the Democratic side of the aisle. But the bigger issue right now is this legislative fatigue. They passed these big COVID relief bills, the last one $1.9 trillion. And, again, can they cough up another $2 trillion, $3 trillion, $4 trillion sometime in the next 18 months, Neil?"

    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "Well, interestingly, a lot of people don't think this is the fight of the life. I have not talk to a single Republican who thinks that she survives that leadership challenge next week. Now, there was a February vote, a referendum on her. That vote was 145 to 61. She survived, mainly because she had the support of Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader. That's not the case right now. And, really, what this is, this is a proxy war between Republicans, those who are afraid to break with former President Trump and those who want to get back to the more core Reaganesque conservative values. And President Trump certainly today has been flexing his muscle. Republicans, based on what Kevin McCarthy has told them, that they are better off sticking with President Trump, that that is the pathway to flip these five or six seats, and become the majority party in the House of Representatives right now. And here's the irony. There's been a lot of criticism from President Trump directed at Liz Cheney. She voted 93 percent with President Trump. And Elise Stefanik, the Republican congresswoman from Upstate New York, who is poised potentially to step into the leadership role next week, if she's defeated in this leadership race, she only voted with President Trump 78 percent of the time. That's remarkable. So, you have this battle inside the Republican Party between what are true conservative values or whether or not they are just the party of Trump still. And it looks like it's more just the party of Trump right now."

We will be exploring this very issue of the Liz Cheney phenomenon here a little bit later in the show, why she is being fingered for calling the president some names and going after him, when the president has called, well, Liz Cheney and Mitch McConnell and Mike Pence and Mitt Romney lots of names. No problem on that side. So, we will explore that. We will also explore a phenomenon during the great pandemic. No one was making any babies. The numbers are in, and the birth rate the lowest since 1979. Jimmy Carter was president, we had long gas lines, the Sony Walkman was introduced, and Michael Jackson's \"Off the Wall\" was a megaseller. What happened?"

Michael Jackson's new album \"Off the Wall\" was very cool, up to that date, the bestselling album of all time. And don't even get me started on the other problem that was going on, those long gas lines in the second big oil embargo against this country by OPEC. But you know what else was going on back then that mirrors what's happening today? People weren't having babies. We're at the lowest count of baby- making, if you will, in United States history going back to 1979, when Jimmy Carter was president. There are a lot of rationale behind this and the latest dearth of births here. But the fact of the matter is, maybe people were just anxious during the pandemic and the scary world that it was to start the baby-making process. Or it could be just the fact that it's expensive or a problem or they put off or whatever. Bottom line, it's that great '70s show all over again. So, what happens now? Let's go to Kat Timpf, the FOX News contributor, FOX Nation \"Sincerely Kat\" host. We have got Mike Gunz back with us, Gunzelman, as we call him, or Gunz, Internet radio sensation, and Danielle McLaughlin, attorney, good read of all things that have to do with, well, our inability or maybe non- desire to procreate.

And then this whole thing with COVID, where it's like, is there such a thing as a secure job or actually being secure in your -- the American dream and your place in that? So, obviously, people are going to be a lot more afraid in the wake of all these things to bring another human into this world, when it's becoming more and more uncertain how you can even take care of yourself."

I can understand not wanting to bring a baby in and all the health risks around the pandemic. But the truth of the matter is, this trend has been going on for years. It picked up some steam here over the last year, I grant you, but something's going on. What do you make of it?"

    {
      "speaker": "MIKE GUNZELMAN, FOX NEWS HEADLINES ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, we have gone from baby boom to baby bust, it seems, for the last couple of years. And I think the -- at least for last year, the two main contributing factors would be the two F's, fear and finance. Now, fear, especially for last year, because you couldn't even go outside. Really, did you want to welcome a newborn into the world when you didn't know what was going to happen? But the financial aspect I think has been going on now for a couple years, where it's just the uncertainty of, I don't even know if I can take care of myself, my spouse, and now I'm going to have a child as well. And a lot of that, I think, has to do with debt, I think student debt, I think credit card debt, I think job uncertainty across all sectors and industry and -- industries and the workplace, that people are just, frankly, worried about just the financial implications of having a child. And you put that together with the fact that people are living longer and that maybe our parents, it was kind of instilled into them that you will go to college, if you go to college, and then you're going to have children right afterwards, and then all of that. Now, it's like people want to travel, people want to maybe figure out their financial worth situation before they go to that next step with the -- with their spouse."

If you look at the data month by month that the CDC let us all see today, November and December, once actually people were thinking about conceiving in the pandemic year, are the lowest months. So, plenty of children were born in 2020, but were conceived in 2019. So it's that end of year birth rate that I was really interested in. You're absolutely right. Birth rates are declining across the Western world, certainly in Western Europe and places like Japan, where they also have an aging population."

      "utterance": "\"Even its President Biden proposes the largest expansion of government in decades, Mr. Trump is spending his energy settling scores in his own parties. He's thrown his loyal vice president over the side because Mike Pence refused to pull an unconstitutional stunt to invalidate the pro forma Electoral College count on January 6. As ever with Mr. Trump, everything is always about him.\" The argument was, well, this fixation on Liz Cheney and whatever criticism she's had of the president and saying that the election was not a big lie, that the big lie is his complaining about that election, have ruffled feathers in the party and beyond. Kim Strassel now, The Wall Street Journal editorial board member. Kim, when you look at it, a lot of Republicans are getting nervous about this, those who will come on the record and talk about it, because they're concerned that this is getting more attention, at a time when the House is theirs for the taking, and maybe the Senate as well, and that this is a huge distraction. What's the sense that you're getting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. And -- yes. And if you talk to those members, there's a lot of criticism now to go around. A lot of them are very frustrated that the former president continues to go after individual members of the party and continues to essentially relitigate what happened last year, when everyone has such an enormous job ahead of them, which is keeping voters and the media focused on the Biden agenda. On the other hand, you have seen a lot of rising discontent among members too about Liz Cheney herself. They had that vote back in February. They kept her in the leadership. That was about her impeachment vote and her right to speak her conscience and vote her conscience. But they feel that they -- she needs to stop at this point, and that both sides are managing to elevate this, the back-and-forth between her and the president, and keep this in the media, when they would rather be looking at other things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I can understand the argument for both sides to stop. And you don't want to make this like a schoolyard fight, well, he started, she started. But the fact of the matter was, after her February advance, to hold onto her position and all that, the president no fewer than some 27 times has targeted her and other Republicans, Mitch McConnell, and, of course, his vice president, relentlessly, Mitt Romney, and on and on. And I guess they feel compelled to answer that. Is the message that Republicans are sending Liz Cheney, the president can say and rip anyone he wants; you, Liz Cheney, cannot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, the president is sending a very mixed message, because, on the one hand, he's going after all of these Republicans. On the other hand, he keeps saying that his number one interest is in making sure that Republicans take back the House and the Senate during the midterms. And the reality is, you can't have both of those at the same time. If you're going to engage in these fights, again, the headlines and all of the focus is going to be on what's already happened last year. It's not going to be on looking ahead. And you're not going to move on. And so I don't think that this is necessarily the message to Liz Cheney, to answer your more specific question. There's a lot of frustration right now among members, members who support Liz Cheney's right to speak out, but who also think that it would be in the better interests of the party to answer these questions by saying, you know what the -- my view is, but, right now, I'm focused on the agenda."

      "utterance": "Year to date, stock is up, profits are up. I think this is a longer-term problem for Facebook, though, and they're starting to push on Republicans in Congress in a big way. Here's -- again, short term, not a problem. Recent earnings were very good. But you're getting Republicans in Congress who in the past said, OK, let's just suck it up for all these liberal woke companies, tech companies, and they're good for the economy. They're capitalists. Let's just forget about their -- even if they're giving support to the left. And I don't think -- that is eroding right now. And here's the real problem that they have. If you get a Republican administration, if you get to Republicans in Congress and the House, you can really get a revoking of Section 230, their protection, which essentially allows them to put whatever they want on their Web site without legal consequences. And if that happens, that stock will go -- will be cut in half. And that's, I think, the long-term problem that they have. They have so angered the Republican Party. I don't -- there is -- everybody in the party in leadership wants to basically make sure that Facebook, Amazon and all these woke tech companies, they get a pound of flesh out of them. And if you don't have the Republicans protecting you, you definitely are never going to get Elizabeth Warren protecting you. You are screwed from a company standpoint. So, again, short term, not a problem, Neil, but long term, if they lose that Section 230 protection, which they really could, because the GOP is moving against them, they are in deep, deep trouble, and that stock gets cut in half. I will point out one other thing. It's one thing to ban Donald Trump. And here's I think what a lot of Republicans, cons are -- can't believe. You ban him, but you don't ban the liberals and some of the leftists and some of the dictators on the left that say worse stuff."

So, we made the decision yesterday these supplemental unemployment benefits, honestly, we got what we incented. We were incenting people not to work. So, we made the decision to opt out of the federal supplemental unemployment benefits, and replace it with a back-to-work bonus. This is going to help employers.

If they were on unemployment, all they have to do is go get a job. We know who's working. They will be notified. If they stay at work for four weeks, they get a $1,200 check. And it also means that they get that check. They can't then refile for unemployment. So, this is a one-way ticket back into the job force."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Governor, I noticed you have a very low unemployment rate. The most recent month I saw posted was a 3.8 percent unemployment rate. So, the timing of this is with a strong backdrop for the economy as well. Did that factor into the timing of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIANFORTE",
      "utterance": "Well, most of what motivated this was just hearing from our small businesses. They can't open up. We have restaurants that are shutting down a couple days a week because they can't find staff. We're coming into tourist season. Americans probably are not going to go to Europe this summer, but they're welcome to come to Montana, enjoy Glacier National Park, maybe get a line wet in one of our trout streams. But if we don't have the waitstaff, hotel staff, cooks, carpenters, we're not going to be ready for all the visitors coming to Montana. This is about being array and getting all of Montana back to work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What has been the reaction from Washington, Governor, on this decision, the Labor Department or these other entities that were behind sort of shepherding this process, along with these extended benefits?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIANFORTE",
      "utterance": "Well, there has been -- we have seen a continual stream of initiatives out of Washington that disincent work. I think nobody starts life thinking, hoping they're going to grow up and become dependent on the government. We need unemployment as a safety net for folks that find themselves in a rough spot. But it shouldn't be a permanent status. That's why we're doing away with these supplemental benefits. We're reinstituting work requirements. And we're putting this incentive to go back to work. I'm a free market guy. We should be incenting work, not sitting at home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm wondering too, with -- I think there were 14,000 open job positions in your state, by last count. So, obviously, employers have had a devil of a time trying to fill those slots. But what if the math isn't based on the unemployment benefits that folks are receiving, but just not wanting to work at the positions that are available?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIANFORTE",
      "utterance": "Well, you got to start someplace. And we do have 14,000 jobs open in Montana that we know of, 25,000 people on unemployment. But it's a virtuous cycle. If a small business has two open positions, they hire those two spots, they can expand their hours of operation, the next thing they do is hire two more people. So we have got to get our economy going again, and incenting work just make sense, instead of incenting people to stay home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Montana Governor Gianforte. Now, there are a lot of small businesses and other businesses across the country that are welcoming a move such as this, because they are trying to get people to work for them. But the competition that you get with all of these extended unemployment benefits makes it mathematically prohibitive for anyone to leave home. What if more do, because more governors do what this governor did? After this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It is very significant, what the Montana governor is doing, regardless of your politics, because he's saying he's encountering businesses in his state that are trying to hire folks, but those folks, with the extended jobless benefits, the extra $300 a week they're getting, on top of the roughly $582 Montana weekly jobless benefit, it's making it prohibited for businesses to top that. So, removing the federal feature might allow that to happen. And this is a issue, as I say, that's being borne out across the country. Jeff Flock has been in Philadelphia today talking to a lot of folks, businesses included, that feel this pressure right now -- Jeff."

      "speaker": "JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Particularly restaurant businesses, Neil, that, well, they just are in such competition for these workers that they can't find. But you talk about incentivizing work. If you can't find people willing to work for what you're paying, here's a crazy idea. You could pay them more. And that's just what this restaurant here behind me is doing. It's about an eight or nine restaurant group based in Philadelphia, and they have instituted a $15 minimum wage for all their employees, so essentially paying more then. And maybe you see a lot of competition out here. This is 18th Street in Philadelphia, right across the street, restaurants, down the block, restaurants. They're competing for the same workers. They're now paying their workers more. This is the called the Marquis Restaurant Group. And the question -- two questions. One, you're paying $15, maybe you have a better shot at keeping employees, but your costs go up, don't they? So do they get passed on along to the folks that want to eat the food at your restaurant? Perhaps so. Maybe that adds to the inflationary -- inflationary spiral that maybe we're starting to see right now. But I would point out, again, if you can't find people that want to work for what you're paying, maybe you just pay them more -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You think about it, Jeff -- and I have crunched the numbers, certainly in the Montana case, that to keep up -- or for, let's say, a restaurant or a small business to hire these people, to woo them away from the equivalent of 21 bucks an hour that they make between the state unemployment compensation and the added federal benefit, that's a tough one for businesses to compete with. Now, again, it depends on the locale. I get that. But I'm just wondering how, in the meantime, a lot of restaurants and others are dealing with this. They're always short-staffed, it seems."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLOCK",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what? Some -- and not this -- I would point out to say not this restaurant, but I did talk to some others, and one in particular, who said, I have got people willing to work, but they want to work under the table. They want to be paid under the table, so that they can continue to collect those unemployment benefits, and also make some money at the restaurant. So -- and the person that I talked to said, well I'm just not going to do that. I would subject myself to penalties and all sorts of problems. So -- but, apparently, they're -- you make a good point. There are folks out there that maybe would work otherwise, if it wasn't for the money that they're getting to stay home. And then, of course, there are others -- and I point out, there are others who just say, I don't want to go back to food service. I'm dealing with people all the time. I'm concerned about my health. Maybe I don't -- until this virus totally gets beaten, I don't want to go back to work. That's the reason I'm staying home, not because I'm just lazy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I hear a lot of that. It's a very demanding profession. It's -- we're still not out of the woods on this. Jeff, great reporting, as always, my friend."

      "utterance": "Jeff Flock following all of this in Philadelphia. It's just a microcosm of what's happening across the country. And it is an issue that will be front and center on Capitol Hill as they continue to push these various spending packages that are getting a lot pricier. Mike Emanuel on all of that in the nation's capital. Mike, I just wonder. This is just another feature of good intentions possibly going bad or a little bit too good and a little bit too pricey. And now they're worried about, with the very strong economy, whether we need them as much. How is that falling out on the Hill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, you're absolutely right, Neil. From talking with lawmakers on the Hill, they're obviously greatly concerned about constituents who are suffering through no fault of their own, who've lost benefits, who've lost salary over the past months due to the COVID lockdown. But now that things are reopening, I have been interviewing people for small business segments in restaurants and other small businesses around the country who say, I'm having trouble finding workers. I'm having trouble staffing up for what we expect to be a busy summer tourist season. And so the question Capitol Hill is, when do you cut off the funding? Right now, it's funded through Labor Day of this year, September the 6th, these enhanced unemployment benefits. And I bet there will be pressure from a lot of folks who are hearing from their constituents about the challenges of getting people to go back to work to taper that September 6. But one thing our government struggles with is, once they start giving people stuff, they have a hard time taking it back, because that is quite unpopular with a lot of their constituents, AKA, voters. And so there's the struggle for lawmakers, policy-makers in Washington. Once you give it out, it's tough to take it away -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And the reality is, is, the economy might not need the boost at all. In fact, this might be compounding problems here. There's a great deal of talk about the total package of the president's initiatives now going from $6 trillion to $7 trillion, if you include all of his various programs. And I know it's worrying a lot of Democrats, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "No question about it. They realize that, yes, they do have control of Washington at this point. But that could be short-lived. The margin in the House is very slim, a handful of seats, in the sense, a 50/50 Senate. So, 2022 could really change the dynamic of power here in Washington. You could potentially be looking at a Republican Senate in 2023 and a Republican House dealing with President Biden. And so there's a school of thought that says, get as much across the finish line now, because you may not have an opportunity in 2023 going forward. But there are other folks who say, you might want to be careful, because the voters are going to have something to say come November 2022, Neil."

Michael, thank you very, very much, Mike Emanuel in Washington. A reminder, we're renewing something we had going for you earlier, letters, e-mails, comments, texts. They're all welcome. And we're all going to be featuring this on Friday, every Friday. We might extend this even beyond. But you must be nice."
