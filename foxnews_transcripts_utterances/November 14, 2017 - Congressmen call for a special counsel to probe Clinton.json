Now, I can tell you this tonight, from what I am hearing, investigations may already be under way, and things, apparently, are moving very quickly.

Now, Sessions is explaining that just because a special counsel has not been appointed, that does not mean that it won't happen, and that the threshold for one won't eventually be met. Now, look, we've been exposing these massive Clinton scandals, and frankly I believe crimes, on this show for over a year. Yes. It's frustrating, people are getting impatient. I totally understand why Congressman Jim Jordan was pressing and demanding answers to important questions. We all want the truth. There needs to be an investigation because we know laws were broken.

If you listen very closely to Sessions today, he is suggesting that it would take, quote, \"A factual basis that meets the standards of a special counsel\" in order for the DOJ to make that type of appointment. Those words, I can assure you, were carefully crafted. Now sources told me earlier this month, and we reported it right here on the show, that Sessions has not, hear me, has not recused himself in the Uranium One scandal, and if there is an ongoing investigation, Sessions isn't going to, can't reveal all that in an open setting in front of Congress.

Now, this of course was all going on while Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration were signing off on that corrupt Uranium One deal. Yet nobody did anything to stop Putin and his plan. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there is so much important information that we need to explain tonight and we're going to untangle this web of Clinton corruption and show you how all of it is connected. All right. Let's start right up here with Uranium One scandal. At the very center of this, we have of course, ah, Hillary Clinton. Now, in 2010, Clinton was serving as the secretary of state. One of her responsibilities was as the head of the department, of state to serve on a committee of foreign investment in the United States is known as CFIUS. Now, it was made up of nine officials from different departments in the federal government, they were tasked with reviewing foreign investments in U.S. companies and resources. One last point here, you see all of this. Now, remember, we don't have enough uranium in this country, we have to import uranium. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, another notable Obama official that was serving on that board was the attorney general. That is Eric Holder. And together along with seven other Obama officials while on this government board, they approved the sale of a company called Uranium One to a foreign nuclear energy company. Pay close attention here, watch all of this began to unfold. Now, Uranium One was a Canadian-based uranium mining company, and it controlled and estimated 20 percent of raw uranium in the United States. By the way, we don't have enough, we import it. In other words, one fifth of America's supply of the foundational material used to make nuclear weapons, and we import it because we need it. And the company that Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder and other Obama officials allowed to buy Uranium One. It's called Rosatom. That is a Russian state-run atomic energy conglomerate, that is controlled by Vladimir Putin on the Russians. You know, the bad actors, the hostile regime. Now, to put this simply, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others, nine total, approved a Russian takeover of 20 percent of America's uranium supply in 2010. Now, it's all while Vladimir Putin was becoming more and more hostile on the world stage. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why would anyone, let alone members of our government think it's a good idea to let Putin control 20 percent of our uranium supplies when we don't have enough? It never made sense, it still doesn't make sense. It's not like America has a lot of uranium to begin with. Guess what? Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, if you look at all of this up here, and the rest of the Obama administration, I argue created a national security crisis. This is insanity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then in 2010, during the very same time that the Uranium One deal was being reviewed by the government board, former President Bill Clinton, he sought approval from his own wife's State Department to meet in Moscow with high-ranking board members of this group Rosatom that controls all their energy there. The request was made while Bill Clinton prepared to give a $500,000 paid speech in Moscow, twice as usual speaking fee. The bank involved by the way out of financial interests in all of this, Uranium One, and it was called renaissance capital, and they have links to the Kremlin. And it was actively lobbying for the Russians to take over Uranium One. Now ultimately the speech took place but meeting with Rosatom never happened. Instead Bill Clinton just sat down with Vladimir Putin himself. Now, the last piece of this web of corruption is the Clinton Foundation. Now, between 2009 and 2013, the chairman of Uranium One used his family foundation to make millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation before and after Hillary approved the sale of the company to Putin and Russia. And that's not all. Other Uranium One investors, guess what? They also donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Now, where I come from, that sounds like a quid pro quo, that's what we call pay to play. Now, look at all of that. Do you see that? OK. That's only part of it. Now, let's turn to the second ongoing Clinton scandal. Now no matter how much Hillary Clinton deflects and ignores this issue, the scandal surrounding a private server will not go away, because she broke the law, and she got away with it. This all started in 2008. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Private server, email account set up under the name of a former Clinton aide in 2009. Hillary Clinton becomes secretary of state. She uses that personal email account to conduct official State Department business where she sent and received top-secret, special access program, classified information. You are not allowed to do that. This came to light in 2015 after the House Select Committee on Benghazi subpoenaed Hillary Clinton's emails related to the Benghazi terror attack. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Following the subpoena, an employee of Platte River Networks, that's that small mom-and-pop shop in a bathroom tech company. Well, they were responsible for servicing Hillary Clinton's private server, and let's see, they deleted, what, over 30,000 emails using something that is called BleachBit, it's like acid washing your hard drive. Then once all of this was revealed, and because the concerns that Hillary may have mishandled top-secret government information, the FBI actually opened a criminal investigation to find out what is going on here. You're not allowed to do this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The person in charge of the investigation was then-FBI Director James Comey. See how this is all beginning to come together here? Oh. Pretty interesting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, during the course of the investigation, the Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked James Comey, hey, don't call this an investigation, call it a matter. Oh. Take the Clinton talking points and Comey will fully comply. Then one week before James Comey announced the FBI's decision on whether or not to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton, then the Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who you can see right here, and former President Bill Clinton, you can see right there. They had that meeting on the tarmac for a private meeting lasting 40 minutes. When pressed about it, Lynch said, oh, we were only talking innocent small talk about golf and our grandchildren. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then after a week of this meeting a week after, Comey announced the FBI would not recommend charges for Hillary Clinton, even though he spent a good 13.5 minutes explaining how Clinton had top-secret, special access program, classified information stored on that unsecured server that anyone could have hacked. And by the way, we believe five foreign intelligence agencies did, and we also have since found out that the original draft of Comey's announcement, well, it described Clinton's actions as grossly negligent. OK, that is the legal standard. But then after three drafts, it was changed to extremely careless. They didn't want to site with the actual law said. And we also know that Comey made his decision not to recommend charges against Clinton before he ever interviewed the key witnesses in the case, including Clinton herself. The fix was clearly in. And that's why all of this here needs to be investigated. Look at how important. Look at how this all begins to tie together, one common thread, Hillary Clinton. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now a third scandal involves Fusion GPS and the fake news Russian propaganda, anti-Trump dossier. Now of course at the very center of the scandal, there you go, it's Hillary Clinton again. And during her failed run for the White House, the Clinton campaign paid millions and millions of dollars to a law firm, it was named Perkins Coie, for legal fees. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the Clinton controlled DNC also paid millions of dollars to the same very law firm during that same period. A lawyer within the firm then employed a consulting company, you've heard about it, Fusion GPS, which in turn utilized the services of a former foreign spy, there's Christopher Steel. Steele used the current and former Russian government sources to create the now infamous totally discredited fake news Russian lies, propaganda, misinformation dossier. That was all an attempt -- they paid for it, she paid for it -- to influence you, the American people in the election, and lie to you and propagandize to you. Now prior to the election, this dossier was secretly shopped around, eventually ended up in the hands of Senator John McCain. McCain passes the document to the FBI Director James Comey, and now there are concerns that this faked dossier was used as evidence in order to justify a Russia collusion investigation into the Trump campaign. In other words, was this dossier actually used in a FISA court to get a warrant to surveil the Trump campaign or an opposition party? This dossier was not made fully available to the public until BuzzFeed ended up publishing it on January 10, 2017. Well after the election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, now we turn our focus, see this? Another one, another troubling scandal. And questions that are raised over a former Democratic I.T. staffer. Now, we begin this time with Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, change of pace. One of Hillary Clinton's top allies in the Democratic Party. Now, she employed an I.T. staffer named Imran Awan. Now, Awan and several of his relatives, all right, they all worked for congressional Democrats as I.T. staffers for years, and they reportedly earned between $2 and $4 million, all while having access to House servers. And earlier this year, while news broke of the investigation into Awan and his family, they were double billing -- hmm, how did they do that? -- and stealing House equipment. Democratic lawmakers rightly fired Awan and his relatives, and he was denied access to the House servers. But as Fox News has reported, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she kept him on her payroll. Then in March of this year, Awan's wife and their children flew to Pakistan where Awan had been sending a lot of money and finally Awan was arrested in July of Dallas Airport in Virginia. He was trying to board a flight to Pakistan, and was charged with bank fraud, all while some fear that he was responsible for exposing House Democrats' information online. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, meanwhile, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is defending her decision to keep this guy on the payroll, despite the fact that he was under investigation and only fired him after his arrest. And now in tonight's final, if you will, scandal, we have more shocking evidence when it comes to Hillary Clinton as it relates to the fix being in. The Democratic Party is now in disarray following revelations that Hillary Clinton rigged and stole 2016 primary. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this scandal started all the way back in 2015 when Hillary Clinton declared her candidacy for president. Now, at the time one of Clinton's strongest supporters was none other then-Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she was serving as the chair for the Democratic National Committee. Hillary Clinton wanted nothing more to be president. But the socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, he was standing in her way for Bernie. Poor Bernie, right? The primary fight was close and in July of 2016, just days before the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks releases thousands of emails, allegedly hacked from key DNC staff members. Those emails, they exposed how the DNC was working against him. The fix was in for her. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, a response to the DNC hacking, well, did Wasserman Schultz and the DNC go to the FBI to investigate alleged cyber-attacks? No, of course not, why would they do that? Instead, they hired a law firm, again Perkins Coie, sound familiar? Remember them? The same law firm from the discredited Fusion GPS anti-Trump dossier. They're the ones that were connected there. And as you can imagine, people were outraged over what was discovered in the lake and Wasserman Schultz, she had to step down on the eve of the convention. She was replaced by Donna Brazile. Donna Brazile just wrote a book. In that book, Donna Brazile slammed Wasserman Schultz, as you can see here, and, by saying that she let Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn do whatever they wanted, they were running the DNC. She revealed that a secret contract existed between the Clinton campaign, right here, and the DNC, and Brazile exposed how Hillary Clinton and her campaign had total control of the DNC's finances, strategy, personnel decisions, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings. And for all of you who would have voted for this man, Bernie Sanders, you were cheated. The DNC sold you out, and Clinton literally stole the primary election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look, these are all massive scandals.

Nobody disputes that. That is clear. We now have this whistle-blower that has come forward who reportedly has audio recordings of Russian officials talking about using bribery to get favors from the Clintons, giving donations to the Clinton foundation. That has yet to appear, but I think that will be pretty strong. The third part of this ingredient is we have the actual flow of money. Tens of millions of dollars to the Clintons as this deal is going down.

First, General Sessions says, there were 27 criminal leak investigations. 300 percent increase over the nine that had been done in the three years before. Just 300 percent sound familiar? Remember back in the summer when Sarah and I were reporting the total number of searches on American records? 300 percent. That is what happens when America's records get on masse, they get searched, the temptation to leak increases. Second thing, he fumbled the entire factual basis of understanding why the nuclear bribery case is related to the decision on uranium one. Someone needs to brief them on the facts.

It says, quote, \"The attorney general was clarifying the legal basis for appointing a special counsel, not passing judgment on whether it applied in any specific investigation.\" Now, that statement and Sessions' testimony today is crucial in all of this. Now, Sessions is explaining that just because a special counsel has not been appointed, that does not mean that it won't happen, and that the threshold for one won't eventually be met. Now, look, we've been exposing these massive Clinton scandals, and frankly I believe crimes, on this show for over a year. Yes. It's frustrating, people are getting impatient. I totally understand why Congressman Jim Jordan was pressing and demanding answers to important questions. We all want the truth. There needs to be an investigation because we know laws were broken. We know crimes were committed. The evidence is overwhelming, it's incontrovertible. Now, with all that said, things are happening that we can't reveal all the information tonight, but here's what I can tell you. If you listen very closely to Sessions today, he is suggesting that it would take, quote, \"A factual basis that meets the standards of a special counsel\" in order for the DOJ to make that type of appointment. Those words, I can assure you, were carefully crafted. Now sources told me earlier this month, and we reported it right here on the show, that Sessions has not, hear me, has not recused himself in the Uranium One scandal, and if there is an ongoing investigation, Sessions isn't going to, can't reveal all that in an open setting in front of Congress. Now, we're going to have a lot more to say about these things in the coming days. Now, Congressman Ron DeSantis, he also had a very interesting exchange with the attorney general today. Watch this."

      "utterance": "All that should sound very familiar because it is exactly what the facts are, what we've been telling you on the show for months, that Vladimir Putin and his agents, they orchestrated a bribery kickback, money laundering racketeering scheme all in an attempt to get a foothold in America's uranium market. Now, this of course was all going on while Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration were signing off on that corrupt Uranium One deal. Yet nobody did anything to stop Putin and his plan. Now, there is so much important information that we need to explain tonight and we're going to untangle this web of Clinton corruption and show you how all of it is connected. All right. Let's start right up here with Uranium One scandal. At the very center of this, we have of course, ah, Hillary Clinton. Now, in 2010, Clinton was serving as the secretary of state. One of her responsibilities was as the head of the department, of state to serve on a committee of foreign investment in the United States is known as CFIUS. Now, it was made up of nine officials from different departments in the federal government, they were tasked with reviewing foreign investments in U.S. companies and resources. One last point here, you see all of this. Now, remember, we don't have enough uranium in this country, we have to import uranium. Now, another notable Obama official that was serving on that board was the attorney general. That is Eric Holder. And together along with seven other Obama officials while on this government board, they approved the sale of a company called Uranium One to a foreign nuclear energy company. Pay close attention here, watch all of this began to unfold. Now, Uranium One was a Canadian-based uranium mining company, and it controlled and estimated 20 percent of raw uranium in the United States. By the way, we don't have enough, we import it. In other words, one fifth of America's supply of the foundational material used to make nuclear weapons, and we import it because we need it. And the company that Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder and other Obama officials allowed to buy Uranium One. It's called Rosatom. That is a Russian state-run atomic energy conglomerate, that is controlled by Vladimir Putin on the Russians. You know, the bad actors, the hostile regime. Now, to put this simply, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others, nine total, approved a Russian takeover of 20 percent of America's uranium supply in 2010. Now, it's all while Vladimir Putin was becoming more and more hostile on the world stage. Why would anyone, let alone members of our government think it's a good idea to let Putin control 20 percent of our uranium supplies when we don't have enough? It never made sense, it still doesn't make sense. It's not like America has a lot of uranium to begin with. Guess what? Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, if you look at all of this up here, and the rest of the Obama administration, I argue created a national security crisis. This is insanity. And then in 2010, during the very same time that the Uranium One deal was being reviewed by the government board, former President Bill Clinton, he sought approval from his own wife's State Department to meet in Moscow with high-ranking board members of this group Rosatom that controls all their energy there. The request was made while Bill Clinton prepared to give a $500,000 paid speech in Moscow, twice as usual speaking fee. The bank involved by the way out of financial interests in all of this, Uranium One, and it was called renaissance capital, and they have links to the Kremlin. And it was actively lobbying for the Russians to take over Uranium One. Now ultimately the speech took place but meeting with Rosatom never happened. Instead Bill Clinton just sat down with Vladimir Putin himself. Now, the last piece of this web of corruption is the Clinton Foundation. Now, between 2009 and 2013, the chairman of Uranium One used his family foundation to make millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation before and after Hillary approved the sale of the company to Putin and Russia. And that's not all. Other Uranium One investors, guess what? They also donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Now, where I come from, that sounds like a quid pro quo, that's what we call pay to play. Now, look at all of that. Do you see that? OK. That's only part of it. Now, let's turn to the second ongoing Clinton scandal. Now no matter how much Hillary Clinton deflects and ignores this issue, the scandal surrounding a private server will not go away, because she broke the law, and she got away with it. This all started in 2008. Private server, email account set up under the name of a former Clinton aide in 2009. Hillary Clinton becomes secretary of state. She uses that personal email account to conduct official State Department business where she sent and received top-secret, special access program, classified information. You are not allowed to do that. This came to light in 2015 after the House Select Committee on Benghazi subpoenaed Hillary Clinton's emails related to the Benghazi terror attack. Following the subpoena, an employee of Platte River Networks, that's that small mom-and-pop shop in a bathroom tech company. Well, they were responsible for servicing Hillary Clinton's private server, and let's see, they deleted, what, over 30,000 emails using something that is called BleachBit, it's like acid washing your hard drive. Then once all of this was revealed, and because the concerns that Hillary may have mishandled top-secret government information, the FBI actually opened a criminal investigation to find out what is going on here. You're not allowed to do this. The person in charge of the investigation was then-FBI Director James Comey. See how this is all beginning to come together here? Oh. Pretty interesting. Now, during the course of the investigation, the Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked James Comey, hey, don't call this an investigation, call it a matter. Oh. Take the Clinton talking points and Comey will fully comply. Then one week before James Comey announced the FBI's decision on whether or not to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton, then the Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who you can see right here, and former President Bill Clinton, you can see right there. They had that meeting on the tarmac for a private meeting lasting 40 minutes. When pressed about it, Lynch said, oh, we were only talking innocent small talk about golf and our grandchildren. And then after a week of this meeting a week after, Comey announced the FBI would not recommend charges for Hillary Clinton, even though he spent a good 13.5 minutes explaining how Clinton had top-secret, special access program, classified information stored on that unsecured server that anyone could have hacked. And by the way, we believe five foreign intelligence agencies did, and we also have since found out that the original draft of Comey's announcement, well, it described Clinton's actions as grossly negligent. OK, that is the legal standard. But then after three drafts, it was changed to extremely careless. They didn't want to site with the actual law said. And we also know that Comey made his decision not to recommend charges against Clinton before he ever interviewed the key witnesses in the case, including Clinton herself. The fix was clearly in. And that's why all of this here needs to be investigated. Look at how important. Look at how this all begins to tie together, one common thread, Hillary Clinton. Now a third scandal involves Fusion GPS and the fake news Russian propaganda, anti-Trump dossier. Now of course at the very center of the scandal, there you go, it's Hillary Clinton again. And during her failed run for the White House, the Clinton campaign paid millions and millions of dollars to a law firm, it was named Perkins Coie, for legal fees. Now, the Clinton controlled DNC also paid millions of dollars to the same very law firm during that same period. A lawyer within the firm then employed a consulting company, you've heard about it, Fusion GPS, which in turn utilized the services of a former foreign spy, there's Christopher Steel. Steele used the current and former Russian government sources to create the now infamous totally discredited fake news Russian lies, propaganda, misinformation dossier. That was all an attempt -- they paid for it, she paid for it -- to influence you, the American people in the election, and lie to you and propagandize to you. Now prior to the election, this dossier was secretly shopped around, eventually ended up in the hands of Senator John McCain. McCain passes the document to the FBI Director James Comey, and now there are concerns that this faked dossier was used as evidence in order to justify a Russia collusion investigation into the Trump campaign. In other words, was this dossier actually used in a FISA court to get a warrant to surveil the Trump campaign or an opposition party? This dossier was not made fully available to the public until BuzzFeed ended up publishing it on January 10, 2017. Well after the election. Well, now we turn our focus, see this? Another one, another troubling scandal. And questions that are raised over a former Democratic I.T. staffer. Now, we begin this time with Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, change of pace. One of Hillary Clinton's top allies in the Democratic Party. Now, she employed an I.T. staffer named Imran Awan. Now, Awan and several of his relatives, all right, they all worked for congressional Democrats as I.T. staffers for years, and they reportedly earned between $2 and $4 million, all while having access to House servers. And earlier this year, while news broke of the investigation into Awan and his family, they were double billing -- hmm, how did they do that? -- and stealing House equipment. Democratic lawmakers rightly fired Awan and his relatives, and he was denied access to the House servers. But as Fox News has reported, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she kept him on her payroll. Then in March of this year, Awan's wife and their children flew to Pakistan where Awan had been sending a lot of money and finally Awan was arrested in July of Dallas Airport in Virginia. He was trying to board a flight to Pakistan, and was charged with bank fraud, all while some fear that he was responsible for exposing House Democrats' information online. Now, meanwhile, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is defending her decision to keep this guy on the payroll, despite the fact that he was under investigation and only fired him after his arrest. And now in tonight's final, if you will, scandal, we have more shocking evidence when it comes to Hillary Clinton as it relates to the fix being in. The Democratic Party is now in disarray following revelations that Hillary Clinton rigged and stole 2016 primary. Now, this scandal started all the way back in 2015 when Hillary Clinton declared her candidacy for president. Now, at the time one of Clinton's strongest supporters was none other then-Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she was serving as the chair for the Democratic National Committee. Hillary Clinton wanted nothing more to be president. But the socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, he was standing in her way for Bernie. Poor Bernie, right? The primary fight was close and in July of 2016, just days before the Democratic National Convention, WikiLeaks releases thousands of emails, allegedly hacked from key DNC staff members. Those emails, they exposed how the DNC was working against him. The fix was in for her. Now, a response to the DNC hacking, well, did Wasserman Schultz and the DNC go to the FBI to investigate alleged cyber-attacks? No, of course not, why would they do that? Instead, they hired a law firm, again Perkins Coie, sound familiar? Remember them? The same law firm from the discredited Fusion GPS anti-Trump dossier. They're the ones that were connected there. And as you can imagine, people were outraged over what was discovered in the lake and Wasserman Schultz, she had to step down on the eve of the convention. She was replaced by Donna Brazile. Donna Brazile just wrote a book. In that book, Donna Brazile slammed Wasserman Schultz, as you can see here, and, by saying that she let Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn do whatever they wanted, they were running the DNC. She revealed that a secret contract existed between the Clinton campaign, right here, and the DNC, and Brazile exposed how Hillary Clinton and her campaign had total control of the DNC's finances, strategy, personnel decisions, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings. And for all of you who would have voted for this man, Bernie Sanders, you were cheated. The DNC sold you out, and Clinton literally stole the primary election. Look, these are all massive scandals. For years, we have been warning you about the web of corruption committed by the Clinton crime family, that they have gotten away with for decades. And now take a look at this. It shows the entire scale of the Clintons' willingness to do anything and everything to gain power and wealth at all costs. Look at this. Pretty amazing. There is so much to investigate. All right. We have a jam-packed show tonight. Up next, you're going to hear from three congressmen. They are leading the charge to hold the Attorney General Jeff Sessions accountable over the scandals. Also tonight, as it relates to Senate candidate from Alabama Roy Moore, I have an important commentary you do not want to miss. I promise. Straight ahead."

Nine people sign off on this thing and then you have the transfer of money with people involved, back to the Clintons, and then they funded a phony dossier full of Russian lies to hijack an election and now we know she already hijacked a primary.

We don't have enough. Why would we ever give it away? We were promised it would never go overseas. He went to Canada, it went to Europe and it likely went to Asia. Joining us now, the man who got the started, author of the book, \"Clinton Cash,\" Peter Schweizer, Fox News contributor, former deputy assistant to the president, Sebastian Gorka. Peter, you got this started, you watch this unfold today, and I want to get your initial reaction. I want you to give us the money aspect to this as it relates to the Clintons, who paid who, when and where, and how active and involved were they in this deal? PETER SCHWEIZER, \"CLINTON CASH\" AUTHOR: Look, Sean, I've always felt the evidence was really clear. I don't know that hesitation is at the Department of Justice. There were several facts that no one debates. Fact number one, you have the Cossack uranium minister (inaudible) in a 2010 video definition describing in great detail how Bill and Hillary Clinton shook him down and shut down Cossack officials to compel them to give uranium assets to Frank (inaudible) who is the founder of uranium one. Nobody disputes that. That is clear. We now have this whistle-blower that has come forward who reportedly has audio recordings of Russian officials talking about using bribery to get favors from the Clintons, giving donations to the Clinton foundation. That has yet to appear, but I think that will be pretty strong. The third part of this ingredient is we have the actual flow of money. Tens of millions of dollars to the Clintons as this deal is going down. I would dare say, Sean, anybody in Washington, D.C., elected office, from President Trump to Vice President Pence, the members of congress or the senate, if that body of evidence existed, there would be an investigation today on corruption charges and bribery. I just think the facts are so clear."

Why would anybody ever think it's a good idea to give Vladimir Putin 20 percent? Especially as we have now learned through investigative reporting, Putin's agents in America were involved in bribery, extortion, racketeering, money laundering and kickbacks. These are now facts, Mueller knew it and Eric Holder knew it. Why would we give away uranium, or rights to uranium when, in fact, we need uranium?"

The New York Times, CNN, The Washington Post, will not show you the truth and you and your team put it out so everyone can see it. I said it before, and it made the left blow up, but I will say it again. The Rosenberg's were executed for giving away the secrets on how to make a bomb. The Clinton crime Cartel sold those things that you need to make a bomb, which is American uranium, and they gave it to a Russian government that is in league with rogue nations. None of that should ever have been sold to anybody."

The second offense, Hillary Clinton is saying that she was not involved in the decision, I'm sorry, but she does not have a great track record of speaking the truth. The person that they sort of prop out, Assistant Secretary of State Fernandez to say she was not involved in this decision. Four days before he first made that statement, Sean, he is in the Podesta email saying he wants to do whatever he can to help Hillary Clinton get elected.

May be determined under the Department of Justice guidelines that a special counsel is necessary to evaluate that, because of the FBI, Department of Justice role in the approval process on uranium one, so it raises the specter of the possibility for the need of a special counsel.

I think the people want to know the answer. There were two things that struck me about the hearing today. First, General Sessions says, there were 27 criminal leak investigations. 300 percent increase over the nine that had been done in the three years before. Just 300 percent sound familiar? Remember back in the summer when Sarah and I were reporting the total number of searches on American records? 300 percent. That is what happens when America's records get on masse, they get searched, the temptation to leak increases. Second thing, he fumbled the entire factual basis of understanding why the nuclear bribery case is related to the decision on uranium one. Someone needs to brief them on the facts. In 2009, the FBI had a criminal evidence way before the prosecution in 2014, and the question is, what did they do with that information?"

They had ample evidence at that time, and enough so that according to the informant's attorney, the informant himself, it was being brief all the way to the top, we believe even to President Obama himself. I think the question is this, why weren't they aware of that when they made their decision? And apparently they weren't. This is the reason why we need the investigation. We need to see how far this went, who was informed, who was not informed and why. And I think as we start moving closer and closer to the informants testimony, John made a very good point, it did not seem that Attorney General Sessions was aware of all the facts of this case."

I mean this is somebody who approached the Justice Department and said I have information, I know what's going on, I'm a patriot, I want to deliver that information to you, and I want out. It was the Justice Department and the FBI who asked him to stay on. Please, stay on, please continue to help us build a case."

And that is if, in fact, FISA warrants were issued by a FISA court based on the steel dossier, we had a fundamental miscarriage of justice and it puts a serious risk into our whole constitutional basis, upon which these courts are supposed to operate. They paid for dossier that has been discredited becomes the basis, not just of a warrant, but of a foreign surveillance warrant, a foreign intelligence surveillance warrant that included Americans. I would be filing motions to quash all of that evidence and suppress all that evidence and I'm sure if that comes up with lawyers will be doing it, but the fact that that may have happened. If it turns out that that is the case, I think we have reached a whole new level of a constitutional crisis."

All of the violations at the NSA and the FBI and the CIA at the end of the Obama administration suddenly dropped on the court. You take that, the possibility that may be a dossier was used for some form of a warrant support. There are really important integrity questions and I think the public deserves to know what I think congress is trying to get the answers."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity,\" before we close tonight I want to address the new very serious sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Roy Moore. If you watch this program regularly you know I will not rush to judgment, we have seen in the media and politicians get it wrong so many times, I've outlined all of that. In light of new information about Judge Roy Moore, we have to address this issue tonight. We should be troubled by two things in this case. When The Washington Post story first broke I said that the allegations it should be taken seriously, they should be fully investigated. It's a 14-year-old girl. We need to discover the truth. I also said, I can understand why women wait years to come forward to because of the evil that in cases where they are guilty, its evil trauma, I can understand it, people have a difficult time talking about it years later. This past Friday I had Judge Roy Moore on my radio program and I methodically step-by-step went through point by point, every allegation against him and let him respond, listen to that part of that interview."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Would it be unusual for you as 32-year-old guy to have dated a woman as young as 17? That would be a 15 year difference or a girl 18. Do you remember dating girls that young at that time?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "No. I don't remember that, I don't remember ever dating and any girl without the permission of her mother. I think in her statement, she said that her mother actually encouraged her to go out with me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now he gave a third answer, he said not generally, not without permission of the mother it seemed inconsistent and a lot of other people saw the same thing. On the third time he unequivocally denied that he dated somebody in their late teens even though I was pressing again and again. We have another accuser that came forward, she is alleging that Roy Moore sexually assaulted her when he was 16 years old and he was in her 30s. Here is how Judge Moore responded to that accusation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "I want to address what's been brought out into television today by Gloria Allred and the client that she has, about things that I allegedly did. I want to make it perfectly clear, the people of Alabama nobody they know my character. They know what I've stood for in the political world for over 40 years. I can tell you without hesitation this is absolutely false. I never did what she said I did. I don't even know the woman, I don't know anything about her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "He denied knowing this fifth accuser but this accuser has brought forth a yearbook that Moore appeared to sign \"to a sweeter, more beautiful girl, I could not say Merry Christmas, love Roy Moore D.A.\" I looked at the handwriting and I know some people have Twitter and said things about this. Here's where I am tonight, between this interview that I did and inconsistent answers between him saying I never knew this girl and then that your book comes out. For me, the Judge has 24 hours. He must immediately and fully come up with a satisfactory explanation for your inconsistency that I just showed you. You must remove any doubt. If you can't do this, then Judge Moore needs to get out of this race. This country has way too many issues and problems. The American people deserve a hundred percent truth and honesty. We need correct answers first time on issues of this serious, Judge Moore, you owe that to the people of Alabama. The Republican Party that you represent and to the country which is suffering under so many problems. We deserve answers and consistent answers, and truth. Thank you for being with us.
