And I've never gotten into the, you know, sort of questioning people's motives or their competence. I'm very concerned about -- about policy. And, Chris, really what's happening inside the party is there's a debate about whether the country should look inward and kind of withdraw and take care of itself or whether the country ought to look outward. And -- and these involve issues of trade and immigration and our relationship with our allies. And -- and the most interesting things that's coming, Chris, that you should focus on at some point, now that I'm the producer for your show, is that we are seeing the rise of millennials and gen-x-ers in the 2018 election. They are now going to equal the baby boomers. And what does that mean? They think profoundly differently than what the -- what this inward-looking group of Republicans care about, because they care about the environment, they don't want to focus on all these social issues. They understand America's place in the world. They're comfortable with -- with global outreach. It's -- immigration, another one. So what's going to happen over time is that the gen-x-ers and the millennials are going to begin to overtake the baby boomers.

We can't compete as effectively in the world and some companies just hightail it out of America because of that. So I do think we need a tax bill. When it comes to, how do you pay for it? You know, I think in that case, I happen to believe that entitlements have to be reviewed. And it may be separate from the tax bill, but it needs to happen because debt is going to swallow us up if we're not careful. In our state, I've been able to cut taxes, but I've -- I've been able to stay, because we have a balanced budget requirement, to be able to pay for them in order -- instead of spending more in government, we gave money back to people. As a result, in Ohio now, we're up 490,000 private sector jobs since I've come in. That's up from a loss of 350. So lower taxes does matter. But regulation matters. I think that's why the market's doing better right now is because the Trump administration has been -- has been moving away from stringent regulations and more common sense regulations and that's helped our economy to grow.",

We begin with the latest reports at least one person has been charged in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The reports say a federal grand jury approved the chargers Friday. Those charges have been sealed by a judge and anyone facing charges could be taken into custody as soon as tomorrow. Meanwhile, House Republicans are launching new investigations into Hillary Clinton, including the revelation that her campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for opposition research that led to the Russian dossier that accused the Trump campaign of collusion with the Russians. Joining us now to discuss all this, Congressman Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Chairman, let's start with the report from several news outlets that the first Mueller charges will be announced tomorrow. As a former federal prosecutor yourself, what will you be looking for?"
    },

      "speaker": "REP. TREY GOWDY, R-SC, CHAIR, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE",

Let's assume arguably (ph) though the reporting is true -- we don't know who is being charged, we don't what they're being charged for, we don't know the time period. I will say this, the only conversation I've had with Robert Mueller, it was stressing to him, the importance of cutting out the leaks with respect to serious investigations. So, it is kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and executing the law would violate the law. And make no mistake, disclosing grand jury material is a violation of the law. So, as a former prosecutor, I'm disappointed that you and I are having the conversation, but that somebody violated their oath of secrecy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's handicap this, though, if you will, sort of expert analysis. As a federal prosecutor, you're quite right. We do not know who is being charged and what they are being charged for. What, if anything, when we find that out, whether it's somebody close to the president, somebody further down, whether it's something related to Russia or whether it's in effect an extraneous charge, not to say it's not a legitimate charge. But something like fraud, or money laundering, what will that tell us about the Mueller investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, a little phrase in the memo from Rod Rosenstein arose or may arise from investigation. And the reason you have that phraseology is, if special counsel finds evidence of a crime that's unrelated to his or her original jurisdiction, you don't ignore it. But it's going to be really important whether or not this indictment involves 15-year-old business transactions or 15-day-old conversations with Russia. So, it's really important what the charge is. It's really important who the person being charged is. One thing I don't get that excited about, although I do see a lot of reporting, is somehow or another you're going to be able to flip a witness and that witness is going to turn state's evidence on everyone else. If you didn't believe a witness yesterday, chances are great you're not going to believe that witness tomorrow, particularly if they are under indictment and have a reason to curry favor with the government. These investigations come down to documents and evidence, much more so than they do witness testimony. So, I would caution your viewers, don't get too excited that, all of a sudden, the government now has a star witness. That star witness, you probably didn't believe a week ago and you probably won't believe a week from now."

I don't think any of your viewers can think of a single thing he did as the FBI director that calls them to have a lack of confidence in him. I think most of our viewers have to be reminded that he actually was the FBI director or that he actually was a U.S. attorney, because he's a pretty apolitical guy. I see the reporting. I see the same thing you're making reference to that he and Comey are friends. I'm not really sure what the definition of that is. I've got a lot of coworkers that it wouldn't stop me from investigating them or prosecuting them. So, they're not family members. They weren't business partners. I would encourage my Republican friends -- give the guy a chance to do his job. The result will be known by the facts, by what he uncovers. The personalities involved are much less important to me than the underlying facts. So, I would -- I would say give the guy a chance to do his job."

      "utterance": "Let's turn to the revelation this week that it turns out that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the opposition research that led to the writing, the formulation, of this Russian dossier that has made all kinds of accusations against President Trump and his campaign. What do you think is the significance of that revelation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the areas of significance is just how hard the Democrats in Congress fault Republicans for trying to gain access to this information. If it were up to Adam Schiff and other Democrats, who, of course, want all the facts to come out, they want all the facts of Russia to come out, except who finance the dossier. So, that's the most important thing to me is how unserious the Democrats in the House have been about uncovering all of the facts. I am interested in who paid for the dossier because that helps you understand motive and intent and whether or not you can rely on the document. I am much more interested in whether or not the Department of Justice and the FBI relied upon that dossier and initiating a counterintelligence investigation or in court findings. That is really important to me. I don't expect the DNC to be objective. Almost by definition, opposition research is not objective. I do expect an entity represented by a blindfolded woman to be objective. And if they relied on that dossier and they didn't corroborate it or vet it, then we have a serious issue and that's the next thing that House Intel is trying to find out, is whether or not the U.S. government relied on it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Let me ask you about that, because your -- what -- the two points you are making, and I agree, these are two very important questions. Did the FBI based its original investigation, at least in part of the dossier? And when you talk about court representations, that's the possibility that they use the dossier to convince a FISA court to allow the FBI to wiretap people in Trump world, Trump associates. Do you have any evidence of that? I understand the investigation is just beginning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, the investigation is not just beginning. We've been trying for a long time to get the Department of Justice to give us access to this information, and frankly it took the speaker of the House this week to tell the department that we're not going away. You know, Chris, people don't like it when I say this, but it's actually true -- it's sometimes hard to tell the difference between the Obama Department of Justice and the current Department of Justice in terms of transparency and their willingness to share information with Congress. This is a really simple request. Did you rely on the dossier? And if so, did you vet it before you relied upon it? You can answer that in 30 seconds. But it's taken three months for the Department of Justice, and only recently have they agreed to give us the information. So, the battle is not just with House Democrats. Unfortunately, it's also with the Department of Justice, the access (ph) of the information we need to wrap up this investigation."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "What about the fact that the Clinton campaign and the DNC, which paid $12 million for the law firm, Perkins Coie, that paid for the opposition research that led to the dossier, that in the FEC filings, it simply says $12 million to Perkins Coie, the law firm, for legal work? No mention of the fact that it was also paying for oppo research that went to Christopher Steele, former British intelligence agency -- agent that went to the Kremlin. Not the money to the Kremlin, but his investigation. As I understand it, that willful misrepresentation of campaign expenditures is a criminal offense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not an election law expert, Chris, but the good news is you don't have to be to understand the absurdity of believing that you can launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm. I mean, imagine if you and I were running for Congress and we just hired a law firm and said, hey, you go to all the oppo, you go buy all the television, you go buy all the bumper stickers, you go hire all the experts, and we're going to launder all of this through a law firm. I can't think of anything that defeats the purpose of transparency laws more than that. So, I am interested in that, and I am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the DNC because no one can remember who paid $10 million to a law firm to do oppo research. I find that stunning. Ten million dollars and no one can remember who authorized it, who approved it, who said, this is a really good idea? So, you've got two issues, a memory issue, and then the lack of transparency by laundering money through a law firm."

In 2015, the House Oversight Committee also wrote the Obama administration trying to understand what CFIUS did, whether or not they had all the information. But, Chris, also keep in mind -- we've spent most of 2017 trying to better understand what Russia did to this country in 2016. Not to the Democrats, not to the Republicans, but to this country. So, what we know was that Russia was not our friend in 2016. It's not that big of a leap to ask, I wonder if they were all friends in 2010. That's not that big of a leap. It wasn't Republicans who gave the reset button to Russia. It wasn't Republicans who said we'll have more flexibility in the second term. It was a Republican named Mitt Romney who said Russia was our greatest threat, and the Democrats laughed at him."

The word collusion has of criminal connotation to it. I think the premise of your question is accurate. For a long time, we've heard about all the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, for which there is no evidence, and lo and behold, despite serious Democrat opposition, we have uncovered that the DNC was working with Russian actors to try to disparage Donald Trump's reputation. So, it's certainly interesting whether it's collusion, coincidence, coordination, I don't know yet."

WikiLeaks is not our friend. Julian Assange is not our friend. They tried to attack the fundamentals of our democracy and that's what I spent 2017 focusing on. That to me is an American issue. I wish the Democrats would help a little bit more instead of reading the Moscow phonebook during the witness interviews, trying to see whether Jared Kushner knows a guy named Igor. I wish they'd help. But that's been my focus in 2017 -- is understanding that Russia tried to subvert our democracy. And it would be great if my Democrat friends helped a little bit."

And so, we don't know what will happen tomorrow, if anything will happen tomorrow, if these reports are correct, that the investigation should allow itself to play out. The country has the right to know what Russia, who's an enemy of the United States, has done to try to undermine our democracy. And as we get to at the second part of this panel, we certainly have the right to know what other things have gone on with uranium or the Russians or the Democrats.

And that's problematic because this is about the United States. Look, I think too many people have gone too far and now they are reaping what they sowed. We have created a modern-day red scare about all things Russia, to the point now where a uranium transaction that may or may not have been legitimate is now subject to this immense scrutiny because it involves Russia. And I find this all problematic. Russia is a problem. Russia is an enemy of ours, but we can also work with Russia on certain things.

And as Vanity Fair reported in March of 2017, source A for that dossier was a senior Russian foreign ministry figure, and source B was a former top level intelligence officer still active in the Kremlin. So, we do know that the Clinton administration paid a foreign operative to get information from the Kremlin on Donald Trump. That is using the Kremlin to get dirt on your opponent.

What I would say is what people are frustrated with in the country is the fact that it isn't likely anybody can get along with anybody down there. I focus on the policy, things that I agree with the Trump administration on and those that I disagree upon. And I've never gotten into the, you know, sort of questioning people's motives or their competence. I'm very concerned about -- about policy. And, Chris, really what's happening inside the party is there's a debate about whether the country should look inward and kind of withdraw and take care of itself or whether the country ought to look outward. And -- and these involve issues of trade and immigration and our relationship with our allies. And -- and the most interesting things that's coming, Chris, that you should focus on at some point, now that I'm the producer for your show, is that we are seeing the rise of millennials and gen-x-ers in the 2018 election. They are now going to equal the baby boomers. And what does that mean? They think profoundly differently than what the -- what this inward-looking group of Republicans care about, because they care about the environment, they don't want to focus on all these social issues. They understand America's place in the world. They're comfortable with -- with global outreach. It's -- immigration, another one. So what's going to happen over time is that the gen-x-ers and the millennials are going to begin to overtake the baby boomers. And it will -- it will -- it will mean a profound shift in the way both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party function. And the question is, and to some sense, they're up for grabs because right now they're leaning independent. And the question is, who appeals to them?"

So can't one argue that what you call the inward-looking, the populist, nationalist wing of the Republican Party is taking over?"

      "speaker": "KASICH",

I think the bulk of the Republican Party, and I've been in the Republican Party since I was a college student, is one that believes in the fact that America has a place in the world. You know, Reagan talked about it, advances in humanity. I agree. I think the bulk of the Republican Party does believe that immigration provides energy to our country. I think that the bulk of the Republican Party believes that America is special and has a place in the world at which to advance freedom and free enterprise and all those things. I think that this move towards nationalism or looking inward, a lot of loud voices, but I don't happen to think it's -- it's the bulk. And we -- we will have to see over time. But for those -- that debate, that debate, to some degree, is going to be settled by the demographics in the near future. Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but soon it's going to be decided by that new wave of new thinking by these young people who can bring a lot of energy to the Republican Party and the conservative movement."

Republicans are going to unveil their tax plan this week and, according to reports, there are going to be big cuts in corporate taxes. There's going to be a dramatic hit to the debt. Perhaps as much as $2 trillion increased national debt we're going to be taking on. Is that the right way for the party and the country to go on tax policy?"

    {
      "speaker": "KASICH",
      "utterance": "Well, look, Chris, here's the thing, you need to have faster economic growth. Our economic growth over the last couple decades has been anemic. And that means people can't get work. That means that we don't have a -- have growth and opportunity in all the things that people want. I favor a tax bill. Our corporate taxes are too high. We can't compete as effectively in the world and some companies just hightail it out of America because of that. So I do think we need a tax bill. When it comes to, how do you pay for it? You know, I think in that case, I happen to believe that entitlements have to be reviewed. And it may be separate from the tax bill, but it needs to happen because debt is going to swallow us up if we're not careful. In our state, I've been able to cut taxes, but I've -- I've been able to stay, because we have a balanced budget requirement, to be able to pay for them in order -- instead of spending more in government, we gave money back to people. As a result, in Ohio now, we're up 490,000 private sector jobs since I've come in. That's up from a loss of 350. So lower taxes does matter. But regulation matters. I think that's why the market's doing better right now is because the Trump administration has been -- has been moving away from stringent regulations and more common sense regulations and that's helped our economy to grow."

Immigration has always been sort of high-octane power for our country. It brings people in with a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas. Of course we have to have a secure border. Everybody believes that. But to begin ratcheting down the number of people who can legally come here, I -- I don't support that. And in terms of DACA, these kids who came here -- one kid told me the other day he came when he was seven months old, I think. He's not 27. He's worried about what's going to happen to him. That's nonsense. Just let the pressure off those young people. They're contributing to our country and the DACA thing should -- it should not be -- they should -- it should not be part of a negotiation. Let them stay in America. You don't have to give them citizenship, but let them stay in this country if they've been law-abiding. They're conserving."
