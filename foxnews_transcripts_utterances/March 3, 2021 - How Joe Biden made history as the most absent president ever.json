And a border mayor has a warning for the administration tonight. Also, Congressional Democrats citing vague Internet chatter. Well, they closed the Capitol because of that and canceled Thursday votes. And just how big of a role is Dr. Biden playing in this administration? Raymond Arroyo will tell us in Seen and Unseen. But first, the problem creators. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. The Democrats are great at one thing, identifying problems that in reality can never be solved, then promising to fix them. And then pushing policies that only make things worse. At which point, the same Democrats simply demand that you sacrifice more of your money and your rights. And then rinse and repeat. Now, case and point, the question of how to get America back to normal, we went from 15 days to slow the spread to we just need a vaccine to you must wear masks and socially distance forever. Now as THE ANGLE told you last spring, these shifting metrics were all part of an effort to keep you both hopeful and compliant. Now remember those tedious White House COVID briefings.",

The truth is that so-called experts, they never liked the idea of freedom loving Americans doing what they want, when they want to do it. COVID is their chance to shut you down and they're taking it. Now yesterday, Texas and Mississippi. I know you heard about it, they announced that they were going back to normal. So, of course, team despair was back in the press today. A new consensus is emerging among scientists that SARS Cov-2 will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come. As a result, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask wearing and avoiding crowded places. Now, this is the type of thinking that kept us in Afghanistan for 19 years and almost two decades later, you wonder what was it all for in the first place? The only proper response to Biden and Fauci's disappearing goalposts is to just ignore them altogether as Texas and Mississippi did yesterday. Now, of course, there's nothing more aggravating to a liberal than independent minded Americans doing what Fleetwood Mac sang about all those years ago and just going their own way.

It turns out that he's just another snob using dismissive, deplorable like, demeaning language to describe people who didn't vote for him. Now, Biden's rage or condescension will backfire. Because day-after-day, other states will follow Texas's lead. They're going to see the truth. And they don't want to keep paying for other states to stay closed and bail them out. And they shouldn't have to. But that's exactly what Biden's idiotic $1.9 trillion porker of a bill does, it rewards incompetent states, and punishes responsible ones. This was about power and politics all along, as I mentioned to Sean. They're using this pandemic, to fundamentally upend and change the way we live our lives, from the way we do our business to the way we educate our kids into the way we travel. And while you suffer through lockdowns, they'll just pat themselves on the back for things like saving the climate. Well, they can only thrive though when you're miserable, and you're powerless. That's why every piece of good news about this virus from vaccines to declining deaths and hospitalizations, it's all been dismissed and kind of downplayed in the end by Fauci and friends. And it will always be until the Democrats realize that liberty is more popular than lockdowns. As soon as tomorrow, the CDC is going to release guidelines for the fully vaccinated people telling them how they can conduct themselves. Well, is it good news? Of course not.",

      "sentences": "In 2022. Now, once again, we hit a benchmark that they set, but it always disappears. Biden's experts are kind of like illusionists. But the fantasy solutions, of course aren't limited to COVID. Joe Biden and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas are creating the most severe border crisis in our lifetime. And it's all in their quixotic quest to establish a more humane immigration system. By abruptly ending Trump's wildly effective remain in Mexico policy for asylum applicants, the Biden administration is luring families and children to our southern border in record numbers. Check out these increases year- over-year. It is staggering. The number of unaccompanied minors is exploding especially in the Big Bend and Del Rio sectors where we were just a few years ago, arrivals there up 141 percent, 122 percent, respectively. The DHS is now predicting that 117,000, let that sink in for a second, unaccompanied minors will cross into the U.S. this fiscal year. And almost all of them will be able to stay. They're going to flood our public schools. They're going to get free health care, food stamps, housing assistance, you name it. Well, what are we getting returned? Well, potential COVID super spreaders. That's what. The city of Brownsville, Texas says that 108 migrants so far, 6 percent of those released by Border Patrol have tested positive for COVID. Oh, goody. Were they quarantined? The rest of us would be? No, they were not. In fact, those COVID infected migrant families are now heading to places as far away as Maryland and New Jersey. Now, I thought the CDC warned against any unnecessary travel, but they get to travel with COVID. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to cover this up by shutting down a Twitter account used by ICE to keep the public you aware of the latest developments. The account was created in 2013 and bolster under the Trump administration was used to post details about known fugitives, including their name, nationality, criminal history, and the U.S. jurisdiction where they were released. Now, wow, they're shutting that down. Don't we have a right to know? What did Biden promise again?",

Well, they're reparation games, they're just going to breed more resentment, and they're never going to happen anyway. Instead, what they should be doing is honestly advocating for the only measures that actually improve the lives of poor and working-class people of all races, strong families, faith, hard work, the rule of law, and yes, fixing failing schools with school choice. And remember what we kept telling you, right, the Left cannot fix anything though. Because all they can do is making empty promises. Like the promise that everything will be better in a few months, if you just stay home and wear a mask. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Kim Strassel, Wall Street Journal Editorial board member and Fox News Contributor and Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee. Congressman, I want to begin with this breaking news that the House is going to cancel votes tomorrow, because of this amorphous Intel that they've uncovered about the people who want to come to the Capitol and do people or the building harm.

Maybe in a way, it's good, because in the next two weeks, think about what the Democrats are going to do. They're going to radically change election law. They're going to radically change police law, they're going to radically change - excuse me, gun law next week. And they're going to radically change immigration law to add to the fact that the border is already open, and unaccompanied minors are flooding across into our country.

We don't know as even the congressman said, we haven't had the briefing. But you can certainly see a certain agenda in Democrats' actions right now, including in the White House, because they want this to be a theme. Look, they're going to try to keep what happened on January 6th, alive as an argument that the only extremists that are out there in the country are fall on one side of the political aisle. insurrection, other words, because this is their way of trying to undercut all conservative policies and the Republican Party.

Well, they closed the Capitol because of that and canceled Thursday votes. And just how big of a role is Dr. Biden playing in this administration? Raymond Arroyo will tell us in Seen and Unseen. But first, the problem creators. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. The Democrats are great at one thing, identifying problems that in reality can never be solved, then promising to fix them. And then pushing policies that only make things worse. At which point, the same Democrats simply demand that you sacrifice more of your money and your rights. And then rinse and repeat. Now, case and point, the question of how to get America back to normal, we went from 15 days to slow the spread to we just need a vaccine to you must wear masks and socially distance forever. Now as THE ANGLE told you last spring, these shifting metrics were all part of an effort to keep you both hopeful and compliant. Now remember those tedious White House COVID briefings."

Now yesterday, Texas and Mississippi. I know you heard about it, they announced that they were going back to normal. So, of course, team despair was back in the press today. A new consensus is emerging among scientists that SARS Cov-2 will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come. As a result, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask wearing and avoiding crowded places. Now, this is the type of thinking that kept us in Afghanistan for 19 years and almost two decades later, you wonder what was it all for in the first place? The only proper response to Biden and Fauci's disappearing goalposts is to just ignore them altogether as Texas and Mississippi did yesterday.

Because day-after-day, other states will follow Texas's lead. They're going to see the truth. And they don't want to keep paying for other states to stay closed and bail them out. And they shouldn't have to. But that's exactly what Biden's idiotic $1.9 trillion porker of a bill does, it rewards incompetent states, and punishes responsible ones. This was about power and politics all along, as I mentioned to Sean. They're using this pandemic, to fundamentally upend and change the way we live our lives, from the way we do our business to the way we educate our kids into the way we travel. And while you suffer through lockdowns, they'll just pat themselves on the back for things like saving the climate. Well, they can only thrive though when you're miserable, and you're powerless. That's why every piece of good news about this virus from vaccines to declining deaths and hospitalizations, it's all been dismissed and kind of downplayed in the end by Fauci and friends. And it will always be until the Democrats realize that liberty is more popular than lockdowns.

But the fantasy solutions, of course aren't limited to COVID. Joe Biden and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas are creating the most severe border crisis in our lifetime. And it's all in their quixotic quest to establish a more humane immigration system. By abruptly ending Trump's wildly effective remain in Mexico policy for asylum applicants, the Biden administration is luring families and children to our southern border in record numbers. Check out these increases year- over-year. It is staggering. The number of unaccompanied minors is exploding especially in the Big Bend and Del Rio sectors where we were just a few years ago, arrivals there up 141 percent, 122 percent, respectively. The DHS is now predicting that 117,000, let that sink in for a second, unaccompanied minors will cross into the U.S. this fiscal year. And almost all of them will be able to stay. They're going to flood our public schools. They're going to get free health care, food stamps, housing assistance, you name it. Well, what are we getting returned? Well, potential COVID super spreaders. That's what. The city of Brownsville, Texas says that 108 migrants so far, 6 percent of those released by Border Patrol have tested positive for COVID. Oh, goody. Were they quarantined? The rest of us would be? No, they were not. In fact, those COVID infected migrant families are now heading to places as far away as Maryland and New Jersey. Now, I thought the CDC warned against any unnecessary travel, but they get to travel with COVID. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is trying to cover this up by shutting down a Twitter account used by ICE to keep the public you aware of the latest developments. The account was created in 2013 and bolster under the Trump administration was used to post details about known fugitives, including their name, nationality, criminal history, and the U.S. jurisdiction where they were released. Now, wow, they're shutting that down. Don't we have a right to know? What did Biden promise again?"

Well, they're reparation games, they're just going to breed more resentment, and they're never going to happen anyway. Instead, what they should be doing is honestly advocating for the only measures that actually improve the lives of poor and working-class people of all races, strong families, faith, hard work, the rule of law, and yes, fixing failing schools with school choice. And remember what we kept telling you, right, the Left cannot fix anything though. Because all they can do is making empty promises. Like the promise that everything will be better in a few months, if you just stay home and wear a mask. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Kim Strassel, Wall Street Journal Editorial board member and Fox News Contributor and Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee. Congressman, I want to begin with this breaking news that the House is going to cancel votes tomorrow, because of this amorphous Intel that they've uncovered about the people who want to come to the Capitol and do people or the building harm.

But we got a wall around the Capitol, we got razor wire around the Capitol. And now they're telling us because someone said something crazy on the Internet, they're going to shut down Congress. Maybe in a way, it's good, because in the next two weeks, think about what the Democrats are going to do. They're going to radically change election law. They're going to radically change police law, they're going to radically change - excuse me, gun law next week. And they're going to radically change immigration law to add to the fact that the border is already open, and unaccompanied minors are flooding across into our country. So, maybe it's a good idea that we're not here. But I don't know that the threats that critical. We've not got a briefing guy; all members have not got a briefing. So, I just don't know.

We don't know as even the congressman said, we haven't had the briefing. But you can certainly see a certain agenda in Democrats' actions right now, including in the White House, because they want this to be a theme. Look, they're going to try to keep what happened on January 6th, alive as an argument that the only extremists that are out there in the country are fall on one side of the political aisle. insurrection, other words, because this is their way of trying to undercut all conservative policies and the Republican Party. But that is a very different thing. And I think it's dangerous. We should not be playing games with what our threats, credible or diminishing them or over hyping them because it gets in the way of law enforcement to do their job correctly."

But remember those days when everybody was listening, happily to Cuomo tell us how we were supposed to run a state and trashing on Ron DeSantis down in Florida. Hey, let's compare the numbers between those states right now in terms of kids getting educated in terms of actual cases and deaths per population, in terms of vaccinations.

But having been through this in 2019, I can see it tracking exactly the same as far as the severity and where this is going. So, it's really about trying to be prepared. And one of the very difficult things about trying to be prepared during a pandemic, is the things that we've all done to in response to the pandemic that don't seem to always translate. So, for instance, people that are coming into the country, legally or illegally, there's restrictions. Well, it doesn't appear to be that that's the case when it comes to our illegal crossings. And so, as people and families are released from Border Patrol. There's no testing going on. We don't know if they're being released at a 6 percent infection rate or 20 percent infection rate.

And so, to get through the point of knowing if the variants are going to be impacted by these vaccines or not, and then really introducing our community to a whole new virus, essentially, even though it's a variant, it's a big concern.

I cannot overstate, Laura, how desperately important to liberals it is to cling to the maximalist's narrative about what happened. They don't accept it. If you say that it was a protest that went out of control and became violent or even a riot, it's they insist that it has to be an armed insurrection, as we just heard, or even a coup attempt. Why is that in part because they want to elevate fear levels about their political adversaries to make everybody think that they're fighting not just conservatives or people with a different ideology, but domestic terrorist who actually tried to overthrow the government. And also, because they're very intent on introducing a whole set of new laws that will vast the FBI and the CIA and the NSA under Joe Biden, immense powers on American soil against American citizens, which will happen to be directed also at their political adversaries. So, they're desperate to maintain this mythology about what happened that day."

Zero legal authority. This is what I meant earlier. If you get enough people to be petrified of the threat that they're facing by constantly inflating and elevating what it actually is, they will then acquiesce to anything. So nobody wants to ask questions about what the FBI collected and whether it was illegal for them to do so because there was an insurrection, an armed insurrection going on, and nobody should care what they do in order to stop it. And if they can create this framework going forward, that the United States is facing people who want to overthrow it, that there's an armed group, a large group in United States who believes in rightwing ideology and white nationalism threatening the very existence of the U.S. government, a total fraud, a total fiction, but if they can get people to believe that, they can start doing things like mass surveilling the citizenry and infiltrating groups and monitoring everybody not just online but in their private conversations. That is absolutely what they are setting out to do."

I guess now he is going to turn it in to the let's go after the insurrectionist committee. So, look, we are all for trying to get the intelligence committee to work. But I find that hard to believe that we're going to get to that point if they're going to call us the domestic terrorists, and as you just said, an armed insurrection. And they fail to point out continually that the Democrats are the ones that have a long history of objecting to the electors. And so there has been a breakdown in the institutions, as we well know, as your guest I think laid out very well in the last segment."

I remember in 2009 and 2010, I think you were around during the Obamacare rallies, protesting Obamacare. We were up on Capitol Hill. It was a great time, we had music. It was fun for people. Who is going to do that now, even if the fences were down, given the fact that you now know geolocation data is used, and that you could very well be surveilled and called a domestic terrorist later?"

You may remember that they actually did get -- they go our phone records and then misrepresented that during the impeachment hoax. But, Laura, you're exactly right. One of the basic rights we have in this country is freedom to assemble. And so you have to remember that all of this talk is really, I think, frightening the American people at this point to get out and be part of the government because they don't know if their own government is going to be spying on them, including the members of Congress. And the fences and the razor wire that are around this Capitol right now, it's a Hollywood production. And if we are going to shut everything down every time somebody says something bad or calls into my office, this Capitol will never open up again. Maybe most Americans would think that is probably a good idea."

They don't want the people to have access to Congress. They don't want people walking, the unwashed masses walking into the Capitol Hill just to chat or make an appointment with a congressman, I don't they want that anymore. They just want to tell us what to do."

Because people either are afraid to come and rally and protest their government, and also the fact that it's all locked down, it's allowing them to squeeze through this real radical agenda with really no opposition from anybody in the United States because people don't know what is going on and have no access to the representatives."

Remember the CDC guidance urged that schools be reopened even without teachers being vaccinated. But the Biden administration and the teachers' unions didn't like that. So out went the science. Talk about neanderthal thinking. And Randi Weingarten whom you saw in one of those clips was really the shadow education secretary today, patrolling the language at these events.

Where are we today? We keep talking about reparation as if the people who are responsible for what happened 200 years ago are still alive. Biblically speaking, it says the people who commit the crime are the ones who are actually responsible. You should not hold the children of those people responsible for the sins of their parents. We have to move away from this. Slavery was ugly. Jim Crow was nasty. But the reality didn't break black America. Government programs broke black America giving them money. And right now I think they know they are in trouble. The person in the White House is insensitive to blacks. Look at his crime bill. Look at what he has done.

We have a problem with all this stuff that they are doing. And it's not helping the black people. I will just say this. Government just needs to leave black Americans alone. Give them the opportunity to stand on their own two feet. For over 200 years people like Frederick Douglass have been saying that. Just level the playing field and leave us alone and allow us to find out who we are as a people. And I think we would be in a lot better position. Defunding the police hurt minority communities.
