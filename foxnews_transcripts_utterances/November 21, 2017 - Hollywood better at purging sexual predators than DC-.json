      "sentences": "And good evening from Washington. Breaking just moments ago, some sad news to share with you. David Cassidy, the pop culture icon of the 1970s, he died just a short time ago in a Florida hospital at the age of 67. The musician and actor have been hospitalized for several days with organ failure. This after he announced his diagnosis with dementia earlier this year. And David Cassidy was best known, of course, for his role in the 70s hit show \"The Partridge Family\" where he played older brother, Keith. So many of us watched that as kids. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And his family provided a statement that read, in part, \"David died surrounded by those he loved with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long. Thank you for the abundance and support you've shown him for these many years.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, all of us of a certain age especially remember him, remember a lot of laughs from that show. And our prayers and, of course, our thoughts go to David Cassidy's family, his friends and his many fans. May he rest in peace. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And on to other stories tonight, sex and seniority. That is a topic of tonight's Angle. We learned last week of a shush fund created by Congress to settle claims for representatives who engage in sexual assault or other abuse. It's paid out over $17 million so far. We thought it was $15 million a couple of days ago. And the names of the members and other workers on Capitol Hill that are involved in this are all under wraps until we and other outlets began to shine light on the Office of Compliance, most members of Congress didn't even know it existed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And therein lies the problem. When the government is this large and this unwieldy, mischief is bound to follow both personal and professional. And soon, no one is looking out for the people. They're just looking to cover themselves and representatives, well, they settle into their positions of power and year after year, term after term, they tune out their constituents. And pretty soon, they're taking orders from the swamp rather than the people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, if we want to end the corruption, and move legislation on Capitol Hill, we need the old timers to do the decent thing and begin to retire. John Conyers is the most potent example. The congressman who has just been charged this week with sexual harassment by two women so far in two days is 88 years old. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He has held his congressional seat for 52 years. So LBJ was president and the film \"Mary Poppins\" was released the year he was elected. Now, it's time for John to go fly a kite, too, and he's not alone. Remember that song? Congressman Louise Slaughter, Democrat from New York is also 88. She's been in Congress for 33 years. Republican Congressman Sam Johnson, 87 years old, and he's been kicking around Congress for 26 years. Sander Levin of Michigan is 86 years young and he served as a congressman for 34 of those years. In the Senate, things aren't that much better. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, otherwise known as Di-Fi is 84 years old. Looking great, though, and she's held the seat for a quarter of a century. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Senator Chuck Grassley, also 84, and he's been Iowa's senator for half of his life, 42 years. Senators Orrin Hatch and Richard Shelby, both 82 years old and have served 40 and 38 years respectively. Just those eight senators and congressmen have been padding around Congress on the taxpayers' dime for a combined 290 years. This is a total joke. President Trump was elected to be an agent of change, to break up the bureaucracy and drain the swamp. That's hard to do when the old guard is impeding progress and protecting the bureaucracy in D.C. These elder statesmen need to look themselves in the mirror and ask -- is a lifetime tenure what the founders really had in mind when they created this system? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What did Thomas Jefferson mean when he wrote this -- \"A government by representatives elected by the people at short periods was our object and our maxim.\" Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Adams in 1800. \"Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices, a rottenness begins in his conduct.\" Thomas Jefferson in 1799. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, now, I have to say this to be fair, I realize there is wisdom with age and experience in Congress can really be an asset at times. Senators like Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, I like them both a lot. They've continued to listen to their voters on most issues. And they've been pushing through the president's judicial nominees and working hard on his tax bills. So that's good stuff. But for most people, decades of power, decades in power, can also isolate them even from the best of men and isolate them from the people they're supposed to represent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The people are crying out for transformational change and the president is the impatient agent of that change. But to make it a reality, these incumbents who have remained long past their expiration dates have got to step aside. Let's get some new blood in there and some new ideas into the halls of Congress. And by the way, again to be fair, there are some younger senators a la Ben Sasse, Corey Gardner and Jeff flake, who have gotten pretty good themselves pretty young, too, at ignoring the will of their own voters. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Amidst the calls for Al Franken and Roy Moore to step aside, I have a call of my own tonight. It's time for the dinosaurs of Washington who refuse to press the president's agenda, to step aside and lumber off into the sunset. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If they're not going to return power to the people, they need to go now. And that's The Angle. And now, on to our top story tonight. A giant in the Democratic Party I just mentioned is being rocked by a second allegation of sexual misconduct. The second as many as two days. Congressman John Conyers paid his accuser $27,000 out of a congressional account in 2015 that drove another accuser to depression. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Ethics Committee is already investigating Conyers but is that enough? And should taxpayers be on the hook for his misdeeds? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here to react is Kimberly Wehle, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore, and Congressman Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania. It's great to see both of you. Happy Thanksgiving and all that jazz. Professor, let's talk to you. This is some wild stuff. I mean, we have had accusations more recent than others, some really old sweep both Hollywood, business, media and politics. What is your take on this Conyers issue now that we know he used his own budget, his office budget to pay some of these settlements?",

This is a big figure in the media following a lot of other big figures, some in our own network, CBS, PBS Bloomberg, CBS has canned him. What's going on?",

      "utterance": "And good evening from Washington. Breaking just moments ago, some sad news to share with you. David Cassidy, the pop culture icon of the 1970s, he died just a short time ago in a Florida hospital at the age of 67. The musician and actor have been hospitalized for several days with organ failure. This after he announced his diagnosis with dementia earlier this year. And David Cassidy was best known, of course, for his role in the 70s hit show \"The Partridge Family\" where he played older brother, Keith. So many of us watched that as kids. And his family provided a statement that read, in part, \"David died surrounded by those he loved with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long. Thank you for the abundance and support you've shown him for these many years.\" And tonight, all of us of a certain age especially remember him, remember a lot of laughs from that show. And our prayers and, of course, our thoughts go to David Cassidy's family, his friends and his many fans. May he rest in peace. And on to other stories tonight, sex and seniority. That is a topic of tonight's Angle. We learned last week of a shush fund created by Congress to settle claims for representatives who engage in sexual assault or other abuse. It's paid out over $17 million so far. We thought it was $15 million a couple of days ago. And the names of the members and other workers on Capitol Hill that are involved in this are all under wraps until we and other outlets began to shine light on the Office of Compliance, most members of Congress didn't even know it existed. And therein lies the problem. When the government is this large and this unwieldy, mischief is bound to follow both personal and professional. And soon, no one is looking out for the people. They're just looking to cover themselves and representatives, well, they settle into their positions of power and year after year, term after term, they tune out their constituents. And pretty soon, they're taking orders from the swamp rather than the people. So, if we want to end the corruption, and move legislation on Capitol Hill, we need the old timers to do the decent thing and begin to retire. John Conyers is the most potent example. The congressman who has just been charged this week with sexual harassment by two women so far in two days is 88 years old. He has held his congressional seat for 52 years. So LBJ was president and the film \"Mary Poppins\" was released the year he was elected. Now, it's time for John to go fly a kite, too, and he's not alone. Remember that song? Congressman Louise Slaughter, Democrat from New York is also 88. She's been in Congress for 33 years. Republican Congressman Sam Johnson, 87 years old, and he's been kicking around Congress for 26 years. Sander Levin of Michigan is 86 years young and he served as a congressman for 34 of those years. In the Senate, things aren't that much better. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, otherwise known as Di-Fi is 84 years old. Looking great, though, and she's held the seat for a quarter of a century. Senator Chuck Grassley, also 84, and he's been Iowa's senator for half of his life, 42 years. Senators Orrin Hatch and Richard Shelby, both 82 years old and have served 40 and 38 years respectively. Just those eight senators and congressmen have been padding around Congress on the taxpayers' dime for a combined 290 years. This is a total joke. President Trump was elected to be an agent of change, to break up the bureaucracy and drain the swamp. That's hard to do when the old guard is impeding progress and protecting the bureaucracy in D.C. These elder statesmen need to look themselves in the mirror and ask -- is a lifetime tenure what the founders really had in mind when they created this system? What did Thomas Jefferson mean when he wrote this -- \"A government by representatives elected by the people at short periods was our object and our maxim.\" Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Adams in 1800. \"Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices, a rottenness begins in his conduct.\" Thomas Jefferson in 1799. Well, now, I have to say this to be fair, I realize there is wisdom with age and experience in Congress can really be an asset at times. Senators like Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, I like them both a lot. They've continued to listen to their voters on most issues. And they've been pushing through the president's judicial nominees and working hard on his tax bills. So that's good stuff. But for most people, decades of power, decades in power, can also isolate them even from the best of men and isolate them from the people they're supposed to represent. The people are crying out for transformational change and the president is the impatient agent of that change. But to make it a reality, these incumbents who have remained long past their expiration dates have got to step aside. Let's get some new blood in there and some new ideas into the halls of Congress. And by the way, again to be fair, there are some younger senators a la Ben Sasse, Corey Gardner and Jeff flake, who have gotten pretty good themselves pretty young, too, at ignoring the will of their own voters. Amidst the calls for Al Franken and Roy Moore to step aside, I have a call of my own tonight. It's time for the dinosaurs of Washington who refuse to press the president's agenda, to step aside and lumber off into the sunset. If they're not going to return power to the people, they need to go now. And that's The Angle. And now, on to our top story tonight. A giant in the Democratic Party I just mentioned is being rocked by a second allegation of sexual misconduct. The second as many as two days. Congressman John Conyers paid his accuser $27,000 out of a congressional account in 2015 that drove another accuser to depression. The Ethics Committee is already investigating Conyers but is that enough? And should taxpayers be on the hook for his misdeeds? Here to react is Kimberly Wehle, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore, and Congressman Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania. It's great to see both of you. Happy Thanksgiving and all that jazz. Professor, let's talk to you. This is some wild stuff. I mean, we have had accusations more recent than others, some really old sweep both Hollywood, business, media and politics. What is your take on this Conyers issue now that we know he used his own budget, his office budget to pay some of these settlements?"

And retribution is swift, and people are moved out and new people moved in presumably and the notion is that there's money at stake, right? And so, when it comes to our elected officials, without a will to actually remove them from office, from the voters' standpoint, there's really not much that we can do, the constitution doesn't say much about it."

I think that this legislation is a step in the right direction because if you work on Capitol Hill, and you've been mistreated, the process that you have to go through in order to file a complaint and have your grievance heard is so opaque, confusing, that it's just not fair. It's not fair and it's not right and I think the slush fund that you spoke to is sort of indicative of the American public's frustration with at times how Congress is governed. They feel there's a different set of rules for members of Congress. And the point here is, look, as a member of Congress, you have a budget. I pay staff, office supplies, office space, et cetera, et cetera. That money should not and cannot be allowed for use to pay off an employee who may have been mistreated. That has to end.

We got people in Congress who have been there half a century plus. Now, old people, senior people, we're all getting up there, ok? They have a lot of wisdom. But this was not meant to be a permanent job security program, working on Capitol Hill. We got people up here for three decades, four decades and in the case of John Conyers, five decades. You kind of get removed from the people after five decades. You go from fundraiser, lobbyist and consultant, to this and that. Where the heck are the people in all of that?"

So, there's a couple of different ways to look at that. I understand the sense of the American people is sometimes members of Congress are there too long. Obviously, it's up to the constituents in their district to vote them out if they don't want them there. We're dealing here with a situation where when improper conduct does occur, are the mechanisms in place in order to right the situation, to treat a young woman who may have been mistreated and I think there's a feeling that the mechanisms that are in place now are insufficient."

It is preposterous on both sides. Men can be victims. Women can be victims. Men can be victims of false accusations, but we must say there are false accusations, and both can be. I'm glad this is going to change. Professor, thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to both you. And as we've been discussing an unprecedented number of high profile men, mostly men have been taken down by allegations of sexual misconduct and while it's been empowering for many women to finally see justice after all these years of silence, has the pendulum begun to swing too far? Should the response to every allegation be resignation, firing? You know, social, you know, shaming and joining with us more insight, from here in Washington is Seth Berenzweig, an attorney who specializes in workplace sexual harassment issues and in fact, you do this for a living.

I'm a supervisor at a manufacturing company. You know, I'm a trucker. I've gotten so many calls from people who said I was falsely accused. It is unfair what happens mostly to men and we're not all sinners and women are not all saints. I've heard this for the last week. What say you?"

There are people who are victims in different context. But I think that the common denominator through all of that is companies often don't know what the rules are. If they don't know where to draw the line, then it makes it harder for them to know how to not color over the lines. So, I agree with you that there can be different kinds of over or under reactions but fundamentally, I think one of the basic fixes which is remarkably simple in this kind of a context that now that we're having this dialogue, is education and training. You know, it really only takes about half a day to go into a corporate board room to go into the company and it provides some basic high-level training of what the law is to help people understand what's going on."

      "utterance": "Sure, when you're talking about the issues of sexual harassment, the basic legal test of that depends upon a sexually oriented act that someone directs in the workplace towards another person who based on the totality of circumstances reasonably concludes that that is offensive or unwanted. And really, as a common denominator to what you've been talking about through the whole show in this critical conversation, part of the reason why this has been swept under the rug is because up until only a couple of weeks ago, this has been happening in the dark behind closed doors. In the employment world, everything changed overnight fundamentally because of a guy by the name of Harvey Weinstein. And that shed light because of his absolutely horrific conduct on what's been going on behind these closed doors. Now there's new education and a new conversation in this country about how to be able to handle these."

Chris, I want to talk to you first because what I heard about this tragic incident, of course, I think about Brian Terry, I think about so many of the border patrol agents over the years who have lost their lives protecting our border.

It's possible. But it's highly unlikely. The way they make this sound is that he went down some deep ravine and that's just not the case. It was a culvert on the side of the road. These agents know those culverts there, it's right off I-10. It's not like that took them by surprise. For both agents to be, you know, struck or -- struck in the same manner, it's just -- it's highly unlikely, and I don't understand if -- if it had been an accident, why has it taken four days, three and a half days for them to figure out or rule out it's an accident? On top of that, they're offering $25,000 reward to the FBI, if it's an accident, who would possibly be able to collect that reward? That tells you that sheriff doesn't know -- I hate to be rude.

We need to empower the border patrol. We need more of them and we need a wall. If it was an accident, either drove off into that culvert, doesn't seem very tall to me, sandy. They fell off and hit their heads and died. Doesn't add to the argument of the wall, does it?"

But if you look at all the facts surrounding this particular incident, this agent was out there specifically looking for what we call foot sign or footprints in the ground. He found some. He radioed it in. He said that this is good foot sign. He himself got out on foot and he started to follow these footprints in the dirt up to an area. If I can paint a picture for your viewers, if they're playing hide-and-seek, if you're the one that's hiding, you're going to see the person that's coming looking for you especially if they have a flashlight in hand. These individuals that were hiding, they were able to attack these agents and they were able to take the agents out, very, very common. It could happen to any agent at any time. I mean, I can tell you from my own perspective as a K-9 handler, I arrested 57 illegal aliens by myself with my K-9 partner. That situation could have gone bad very, very quickly, and in this particular case, it did go bad and that's because we have dangerous borders."

But if they don't live, you know, near where you live, McCallan or El Paso, they really don't get what it's like. It's dangerous for property owners. It's dangerous for residents. It affects morale of border patrol agents when they don't feel like they're getting the support or the credibility that they deserve.

For instance, these folks that are coming through, a lot of people come through this area. A great number of people come through this area. The thing is the majority of them don't stay here. They're funneling into the rest of the country, the Atlantas, Houstons, the New Yorks, the Middle America, and 20 percent of the people we encounter have criminal histories. And it's just -- it's an ongoing thing and at some point, we need to get serious about this border security. We need the infrastructure. We need the manpower but more than anything, we need that political will to get it done. Because without that, we're just going to continue spinning our wheels and incidents like this are going to continue to happen. Incidents like the murder are going to continue to happen.

Congressman, you can't tease us and give us nothing here tonight. Is there something going on?

      "utterance": "Well, we absolutely can talk about it, Laura. I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton and particularly in this e-mail scandal. In late October, right before the election, e-mails were sent by now the deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe where McCabe said that the Hillary investigation would be given special status, that it would not go through the normal investigative procedures that would typically append to this type of an investigation. He told others at the FBI that there would be a small team at headquarters that would make the decisions and conduct the investigation, walling off others who might have discovered information or brought additional facts to light. Link this to the information we have about James Comey drafting the exoneration statement of Hillary Clinton before she was even interviewed, before other key witnesses were interviewed. So now we have absolute proof of what you've been saying for a long time, Laura, and that's that Hillary Clinton was treated differently than any other American would be treated. And as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I want answers from the FBI about how we can stop this type of special treatment for politicians in the future."

That's just an absolute outrage. But in this case, we're talking about the former secretary of state, she's running for president, has a white hot spotlight on her and on this question of her e-mails, the ones that were destroyed, the intent to set up that private server. When something is designated as special investigation, one could hear that and say there's going to be more scrutiny placed on the subject. But you're saying when it's special, it means skirting normal channels? Is that what you can confirm to us tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, Laura, we have to look at all the evidence in context. Here you have Mr. McCabe telling others at the FBI that this won't be handled like other investigations, that it will be a small team at headquarters. The reason that's so troubling is we've learned as a consequence of testimony before the Senate that James Comey leading that investigation drafted the exoneration statement, essentially rendered the verdict on the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal before even conducting the investigation. Now we've got these McCabe e-mails that showed that others were not allowed to participate, that they were expressly excluded. Even more damning context is the fact that these e-mails also reveal that McCabe was dealing with his own scandal because he was involved with his wife's political campaign funded by the Clintons and their allies. And that's not the type of FBI we need. We need the types of checks and balances at the FBI where people get equal treatment under the law. We don't have that in a circumstance where you've got special treatment for someone like Hillary Clinton, and then you've got an exoneration statement before you even have the investigation concluded."

Isn't that nice? The New York Times also ran a strange opinion piece that seemed to try to tie Manson to some of President Trump's supporters, making the case that Manson was inspired by rightwing causes rather than the far left counterculture.

I know a lot of people, friends of mine from college and law school, who met each other in the workplace. I mean, how many times -- well, I met somebody and they became friends and we started dating. And now like a quarter of young people, we did this poll last night. A quarter of young people according to this new YouGov poll say that if someone asks another person out and they're not romantically involved, that that can be sexual harassment."

That's kind of -- not every allegation is correct either. Some are devastatingly true, but sometimes people just, I guess they want to date somebody and they say do you want to go out? I guess you can't do that either."

I don't think the president should have probably got involved in tweeting back at LaVar Ball. But nevertheless, he did get the guys out. They made a mistake. They were grateful to President Trump. What do we make of this? Racist, this is a racist comment from President Trump?"

The real dog whistle is when these white elitists still think they can throw the red meat of racism and we're going to be their attack dogs. First, I'm tired of it. This is not the party they're telling us about who racists are. Look at the Democratic history. You talk about the party of slavery, secession, segregation, and socialism, that's the Democratic Party. In the killing fields of America, black Americans today are in the Democratic community. So let's not have these people calling everybody else racist every chance they get to think we're going to respond to it the way they want us to."

I think that the president has a history of going after African-American athletes and key figures. If you look at Steph Curry, Colin Kaepernick Jemele Hill, he continues to go after these people and is throwing out right wing red meat rhetoric by way of social media. It is unprecedented for a president to get on social media and do these kinds of things."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's a separate question. That's a separate question whether it's racist. Whether he should have tweeted, but we're talking about racist. I mean, President Trump gives as good as he gets. Somebody doesn't look like they're grateful, then he's going to say it back."

Racist is this -- 83 percent of our black teen males are unemployed, 75 percent of black boys in the state of California cannot pass standard reading and writing, 1,800 black babies are killed every single day when they target our black communities. Our communities are killing fields, and it's done by Democratic policies. And they are the ones that are target us and have the audacity to call those who are trying to stop abortions, trying to educate our kids -- right now, unemployment is down at a 17-year low by a president, and right now the left is not giving him any credit for that because they could care less about black lives. So let's really deal with the real deal. We have a party of socialists and racists --"
