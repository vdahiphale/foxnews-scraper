We know from talking to people who have spoken with the president in the past 24 hours that Brett Kavanaugh and Thomas Hardiman were the frontrunners for the position with the idea also that the president could throw a Hail Mary, and pick Amy Coney Barrett.

There are reports that Amy Coney Barrett is at home in Indiana tonight, which would make it pretty difficult for her to be here at the White House. But people playing this very close to the vest. Only the president, a handful of people know what's really what. So, we will see. But already -- you know, what this is boiling down to now is obviously, we have the announcement. But the president really is stealing for a huge battle in the Senate for confirmation here, and the schedule is very, very tight. It's only been 12 days since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, and tonight we're getting the nominee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, outside groups, the White House would like to get this done before the Supreme Court begins its October term at the beginning of October.

The rest, frankly, taking America for a ride, and the president is right to call them on this, but there's another dynamic at work, which is this. The European Union now has protections for its own army, its own air force, its own navy, and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is setting the Germans and the French and everybody else they only need to pay 1 percent into defense, not the 2 percent that NATO demands.

He wrote the majority opinion in this case.

We also -- there are some indications that Amy Coney Barrett is indeed at home in Indiana. We are working on confirmation of that and if that is the case, that would also be pointing in the direction of her not being the pick, but we will see. Here now, Jonah Goldberg.

And perhaps, no branch has more impact ultimately on the country. Decisions on immigration, our borders, guns, and perhaps, the issue of life itself could all come before the Trump Supreme Court. In the past on these occasions, air travel and positioning of the finalists have tipped us off. Tonight, the list is down to four and here's what we know. Thomas Hardiman who presides in the third District is now in D.C. tonight for a prescheduled meeting. Brett Kavanaugh and the D.C. Circuit reportedly seen just about an hour ago leaving the U.S. courthouse in Washington in a black sedan with a fair amount of security, according to reports a short time ago. Amy Coney Barrett lives in South Bend, Indiana, Notre Dame's University and at this hour we do not have confirmation of her whereabouts. And the same goes for Raymond Kethledge, whose Court is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, word is that the president wants to maintain the element of surprise. And that a military aircraft may be utilized to keep the pick under wraps. And although we don't know yet who it is, we know that some say they don't actually care."

Judge Andrew Napolitano, here on the challenges the top contenders will face through this process and Pam Bondi just met with President Trump. So, he made up his mind, we know and that happened earlier today.

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening to you, Martha. And we've been trying to read the tea leaves all day and which way this is going to go. We know from talking to people who have spoken with the president in the past 24 hours that Brett Kavanaugh and Thomas Hardiman were the frontrunners for the position with the idea also that the president could throw a Hail Mary, and pick Amy Coney Barrett. Or if you wanted a fairly easy confirmation, Raymond Kethledge, as well. But I think, we've probably got it down to Brett Kavanaugh, Thomas Hardiman. There are reports that Amy Coney Barrett is at home in Indiana tonight, which would make it pretty difficult for her to be here at the White House. But people playing this very close to the vest. Only the president, a handful of people know what's really what. So, we will see. But already -- you know, what this is boiling down to now is obviously, we have the announcement. But the president really is stealing for a huge battle in the Senate for confirmation here, and the schedule is very, very tight. It's only been 12 days since Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, and tonight we're getting the nominee. And then, outside groups, the White House would like to get this done before the Supreme Court begins its October term at the beginning of October. So that leaves a very narrow window of only 83 days to get this through. And the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a fiery speech on the floor of the Senate earlier today, decrying the process that brought us to where we are that this list of 25 judges from which the president was going to pick were written up by the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo in particular. Schumer, saying that this process is both unfair and biased toward conservative judges who might overturn Roe versus Wade. Listen to what Schumer said earlier today."

      "utterance": "The American people didn't buy and he also talked about David Souter and other justices who were confirmed eventually and actually took different positions. Then the Republican presidents who nominated and thought that they would. So, where we are tonight, we think we got it down to Kavanaugh, we think we have a down to Hardiman, convenience, and coincidence that both of them just happened to be in Washington D.C. Kavanaugh, by virtue of the fact that he sits on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. And the fact that Judge Hardiman was here for the Judicial Conference of the United States is on the Judicial Committee. So, neither one of them would have to be flown in. We don't even know if they're here at the White House, because they're pretty sneaky about all of this, Martha. They would likely bring in the nominee through the south portico which means that we've got no vantage point. We've been looking down the driveway but haven't seen anything of significance other than Newt Gingrich and his wife Calista, who, of course, is the ambassador to the Vatican walking in the West Wing a little while ago.

Do you believe knowing who the pick is that they will support this person?"

So I feel sorry for the President although this is the most important thing. We have gotten it wrong five different times that I can think of Republican presidents nominating five folks whether it is Blackmun, whether it's Brennan, whether it is Warren, whether it is Souter, whether it's John Paul Stevens, those are all Republican nominees that shocked us with their liberalism. You can't think of a single Democrat nominee that shocked you with his or her conservatism so President Trump's first obligation is to not get it wrong like several of his predecessors did. I mean the buzz is that it's not Amy Coney Barrett. We could all be surprised if she could walk into the room tonight. We just don't know.

You are talking to someone whose religious views are very different on the death penalty than the fact that I had to seek it seven times as the District Attorney.

And yet, this Prime Minister, Theresa May, who incidentally was a remained voter in a referendum, presented a plan at Chequers, the country of the British prime minister on Friday that basically said we would still stay a part of many bits of the European Union, including the customs union, the lawmaking process, all of which would mean we were taking rules from elsewhere without having a say.

Perhaps the United States doesn't keep it traditional role as part of NATO and that dynamic changes.

We've now got a position where out of 29 nations, only six of them are paying the basic membership fee of 2 percent. The rest, frankly, taking America for a ride, and the president is right to call them on this, but there's another dynamic at work, which is this. The European Union now has protections for its own army, its own air force, its own navy, and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker is setting the Germans and the French and everybody else they only need to pay 1 percent into defense, not the 2 percent that NATO demands.

A ruling just came down from the D.C. circuit court where Brett Kavanaugh sets on a case that has been on the docket there for 15 years, it's a FOIA case, suggesting that they may be clearing the slate. He wrote the majority opinion in this case. They do not usually come forward with any opinions on a Monday night but when there is a nominee he would have to recuse himself from that case and this has been in the work for 15 years, so now there is a decision in that case that has just been pushed through sort of at the last minute on this Monday evening. We also -- there are some indications that Amy Coney Barrett is indeed at home in Indiana. We are working on confirmation of that and if that is the case, that would also be pointing in the direction of her not being the pick, but we will see. Here now, Jonah Goldberg.

There's been some talk in Washington for a while now that may be Trump was saving that in case Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires from the bench so we can replace the woman with a woman. What I'm looking forward to is all of the people -- if she doesn't get it, looking forward to all the liberals suddenly insisting that she really was the one that should have been on the court because she is great.

She's been on the court I think seven or eight months at this point, that the president perhaps might believe that he's going to get another pick and that perhaps he would like to return to that idea later down the road.

I thought it was brilliant for him to do. It's worth pointing out that one of the reasons why he had to come up with a list in the first place is because there were millions of conservatives who are very skeptical that he would stay true and appoint conservative justices, so he outsource this to the Federal Society.
