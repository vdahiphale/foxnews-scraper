A ton of breaking news this hour, opposition leader, duly elected president, Juan Guaido, is calling for a military uprising tonight, thousands have taken to the streets in Caracas in mass, and the socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro turned his security forces against his fellow citizens, plowing them down with armored trucks. More than 40 Venezuelans have been killed in violent street clashes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, Venezuela as we speak is burning. You're looking at how socialism, by the way, always culminates, chaos, death, poverty, destruction, a violent clash between a population so desperate for basic human rights, food, necessities, security against what has been a tyrannical government hell-bent on maintaining their power. Now, Maduro is backed by Russia. It is backed by Iran, Hezbollah. The terrorist group funded by Iran has been training government forces in Venezuela now for years. Cuba is providing 20,000 troops to protect Maduro from his own people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And meanwhile, the opposition leader is backed by nearly everyone else in the entire free world, but tonight, it will be up to the people of Venezuela to take power back. Take their government back at all costs. If they succeed, it will be prosperity, freedom. They have unlimited national resources and oil, security will be on the horizon. Bare necessities, those needs will be fulfilled, if they fail, predictably starvation, poverty, death, violence, and, of course, a horrible dictatorship, the status quo for years to come. In minutes, we're going to have a lab report on this. And also breaking news tonight both \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times\", they have not learned a single thing from two-plus years of lying. In moments, we will break down for you, we will tell you all about their lying, misleading headlines released about an hour ago about Mueller and Barr.

They debunk their own headlines. Now, this time, predictable hysteria surrounding a so- called bombshell \"Washington Post\" and echoed by \"The New York Times\" report that Robert Mueller wasn't happy with Barr's initial summary of his report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's a problem, buried in the article is a response from a Justice Department spokesperson and it actually says within the article, the special counsel emphasized that nothing -- let me repeat -- nothing in the attorney general's March 24th letter was inaccurate or misleading. But he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the special counsel's obstruction analysis. Wow. Nothing was inaccurate. Nothing. Nothing was misleading.

After all, the entire Mueller report is now completely out. This is only about the media mob smearing the president at every turn. It is always Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, fantasies.

They can't let it go. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No collusion. No obstruction. No conspiracy. But the radical left, the media mob, desperately, breathlessly continue to pursue a fraudulent hoax. And if that does not work, well, we see what their plan B is. You've got people like Nadler and Schiff, and they want to get on Trump, going after some type of conspiracy theory financial crime. They want to empower the IRS to go after the president, get his tax returns. They want banks to hand over confidential information. Then they will say, well, what about obstruction of justice? They'll take anything. They'll take a parking ticket at this point. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As we speak, the Democratic House Judiciary Committee, they are trying to hold the Attorney General Barr to Capitol Hill. And, by the way, they don't want to interview him, they don't want to ask the questions. They want to allow unelected, unaccountable lawyers interrogate the attorney general under oath, probably because they do not think that they are capable of doing that job. An act that Senator Lindsey Graham said was way over the top. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, let's see, we elected congressmen and senators and they do have a responsibility, constitutionally for oversight. But they are supposed to be held accountable to the people. They do not get their lawyers to do their job. They can have the lawyers write the questions, I guess. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They can read them off of little blue cards, except we all know that Nadler and company are scared of that, because that with even prepared question, what are they going to do?

Just breaking tonight, \"The Federalist\" is reporting that Obama's political campaign, get this, they paid nearly $1 million since 2016 to of all places, Fusion GPS, the firm responsible for Hillary Hillary's dirty Russian dossier. That even \"The New York Times\" now late in the game, two plus years later acknowledges may have been Russian disinformation.

The Russians deny that. And while protests and clashes continue in the capital of Caracas, the Trump Administration has not ruled out sending US troops to Venezuela.

A ton of breaking news this hour, opposition leader, duly elected president, Juan Guaido, is calling for a military uprising tonight, thousands have taken to the streets in Caracas in mass, and the socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro turned his security forces against his fellow citizens, plowing them down with armored trucks. More than 40 Venezuelans have been killed in violent street clashes. And tonight, Venezuela as we speak is burning. You're looking at how socialism, by the way, always culminates, chaos, death, poverty, destruction, a violent clash between a population so desperate for basic human rights, food, necessities, security against what has been a tyrannical government hell-bent on maintaining their power. Now, Maduro is backed by Russia. It is backed by Iran, Hezbollah. The terrorist group funded by Iran has been training government forces in Venezuela now for years. Cuba is providing 20,000 troops to protect Maduro from his own people. And meanwhile, the opposition leader is backed by nearly everyone else in the entire free world, but tonight, it will be up to the people of Venezuela to take power back. Take their government back at all costs. If they succeed, it will be prosperity, freedom. They have unlimited national resources and oil, security will be on the horizon. Bare necessities, those needs will be fulfilled, if they fail, predictably starvation, poverty, death, violence, and, of course, a horrible dictatorship, the status quo for years to come. In minutes, we're going to have a lab report on this. And also breaking news tonight both \"The Washington Post,\" \"The New York Times\", they have not learned a single thing from two-plus years of lying. In moments, we will break down for you, we will tell you all about their lying, misleading headlines released about an hour ago about Mueller and Barr. Inside the content of their articles, they debunk their own headlines in their own stories. You can't make this up, a sad state of affairs for journalism in America. Also, a damning new report now breaking surrounding Obama and Fusion GPS. That's the op research firm that Hillary Clinton used. Also, tonight, we'll have Alan Dershowitz. He will discuss the horrific anti-Semitic cartoons in \"The New York Times.\" You have a busy breaking news night, but we start tonight with the very latest on this uprising in Venezuela. We have our own Trace Gallagher standing by with the latest -- Trace."

A few hours ago, Guaido claimed the final phase was underway to oust Maduro, but so far, there are no reports that Guaido supporters have taken control of any military bases. And Nicolas Maduro who has not been seen today is claiming that the military has shown total loyalty. And there were graphic scenes today of military vehicles plowing into opposition protesters and if in true, in fact the military is standing by Maduro, it would be a staggering change of events considering earlier, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that today Maduro was about to fly to Havana.

This rapidly developing horrific situations throughout Venezuela. And we pray for their people tonight. But first, another night, another piece of fake news from the fake news media mob with headlines that are purposely deceptive. They debunk their own headlines. Now, this time, predictable hysteria surrounding a so- called bombshell \"Washington Post\" and echoed by \"The New York Times\" report that Robert Mueller wasn't happy with Barr's initial summary of his report. Here's a problem, buried in the article is a response from a Justice Department spokesperson and it actually says within the article, the special counsel emphasized that nothing -- let me repeat -- nothing in the attorney general's March 24th letter was inaccurate or misleading. But he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the special counsel's obstruction analysis. Wow. Nothing was inaccurate. Nothing. Nothing was misleading. The contents of the article literally debunk the main premise and headline of their stories. Why is this then a story? After all, the entire Mueller report is now completely out. This is only about the media mob smearing the president at every turn. It is always Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, fantasies. They have to keep it alive. They can't let it go. No collusion. No obstruction. No conspiracy. But the radical left, the media mob, desperately, breathlessly continue to pursue a fraudulent hoax. And if that does not work, well, we see what their plan B is. You've got people like Nadler and Schiff, and they want to get on Trump, going after some type of conspiracy theory financial crime. They want to empower the IRS to go after the president, get his tax returns. They want banks to hand over confidential information. Then they will say, well, what about obstruction of justice? They'll take anything. They'll take a parking ticket at this point. As we speak, the Democratic House Judiciary Committee, they are trying to hold the Attorney General Barr to Capitol Hill. And, by the way, they don't want to interview him, they don't want to ask the questions. They want to allow unelected, unaccountable lawyers interrogate the attorney general under oath, probably because they do not think that they are capable of doing that job. An act that Senator Lindsey Graham said was way over the top. Now, let's see, we elected congressmen and senators and they do have a responsibility, constitutionally for oversight. But they are supposed to be held accountable to the people. They do not get their lawyers to do their job. They can have the lawyers write the questions, I guess. Watch this."

And I told everybody in the country, if the president colluded with the Russians, that would be horrible and terrible, but I don't believe that he did. And Mueller said that he didn't. This is over.

They can read them off of little blue cards, except we all know that Nadler and company are scared of that, because that with even prepared question, what are they going to do? How are they going to answer an attorney general that actually knows the law and the Constitution? They are going to have a hard time grilling their DOJ counterpart. And it might just end up looking stupid, which I think is what they fear the most. The hearing is scheduled for Thursday, we will see how this all plays out in the next couple of days. Now this comes as deep state actors, they are now tonight scrambling to cover all of the corruption. And it goes all the way to the top, right to the Obama White House. Just breaking tonight, \"The Federalist\" is reporting that Obama's political campaign, get this, they paid nearly $1 million since 2016 to of all places, Fusion GPS, the firm responsible for Hillary Hillary's dirty Russian dossier. That even \"The New York Times\" now late in the game, two plus years later acknowledges may have been Russian disinformation. The same Fusion GPS that has been accused of illegally operating as an agent of foreign governments, that is currently facing multiple investigations. What is Obama paying for? What did Obama know? What did Biden know? When did they know it? We have a lot more coming up in just a few moments. All right. But, first, we turn to two of the Democrats best friends on conspiracy TV MSNBC. Yes, you want to conspiracy television, you want to learn about oh, let's see Area 51 kind of political conspiracies. Last night, well, two of America's top tinfoil hat commentators, Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell fuming. We at the Fox News Channel continue to demand equal justice under the law, the equal applications of the laws and, of course, hold to account Hillary Clinton's various misdeeds and actually as real evidence, something that they were lacking and still lack for Donald Trump.

Oh, what do they say about Nicholas Sandmann, the 16-year-old, they rush to judgment there too, right? We won't hold the breath as a journalism is dead and buried in this country. They are nothing more than an extension of the Democratic Party. Which by the way, let me just say this -- you know, the reason Hillary is the relevant is because we are supposed to have a constitutional republic, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. And at the same time period that we're talking -- you are talking about Donald Trump colluding with the Russians, well, Hillary Clinton had a rigged investigation when she put top secret classified emails on that server and then, that was the underlying crime. And you care so much about obstruction of justice. Let me educate you some more. There was real intent when she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, Bleach Bit the hard drive, beat up her devices with hammers and pulled out the same cards. Oh, the intent was to destroy the evidence. And, of course, that is not something that you're off audience may have heard about because they are listening to your lies every night. So, the same relevant time period that you are talking about. But there will be justice. We turn our attention now to the radical socialist 2020 candidates. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto, Robert Francis Bozo O'Rourke, many Democrats running to be president of this country, espousing the very same, insane, failed economic policies, kind of like what the CNN, yes, Venezuela.

I would like to know why. Strzok and Page says that the attorney general led the Clinton investigation and under your watch \"The New York Times\" is saying the phony Russian dossier Hillary paid for with funneled money through a law firm to Fusion GPS hiring Christopher Steele might've been Russian disinformation from the get-go. Why did you allow that to happen, where were you? Because Devin Nunes warned you all in 2014. So courageous. But fear not, Uncle Joe, on this program, while you obsess about impeachment, we won't let anyone forget. I won't list it tonight, but we're going to remind everybody about your failed economic legacy, 13 million more in poverty, 8 million more -- 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. We will get it out every night. Also, get out, all of the other statistics that we have here, because it was the worst economy and worse recovery since the '40s, with the time that Obama whispered that he had more flexibility with Vladimir Putin after the election.

The same one that predicted that Bob Mueller was going to have sealed indictments, that didn't happen. Remember that?

He wasn't going to try to make innuendo. He was saying this is what the special counsel discovered. These were the findings. That President Trump did not collude or conspire with the Russians, that they found no evidence that any American or anyone on his campaign did that. And the second half which is, how can a president obstruct when there was nothing there to obstruct to begin with? I mean, William Barr and Rod Rosenstein both made the decision that there was nothing discovered that could constitute obstruction. There was no tampering of evidence. There was no tampering with witnesses. There was no destruction of evidence. So, he basically covered all bases. This is about getting cornered, Sean. I'm going to tell you this. This is about getting cornered. And now they are screaming mad, because they know that someone is going to investigate what happened from the beginning of this investigation into President Trump and his campaign. And there are people within the intelligence community and within the government that are running scared now.

But more importantly, we are going to take a look tomorrow night, I hope to be on your show again and have a column out by tomorrow.

So, we want to know about who Ohr was talking to the FBI to launder that information into it to target Trump. And he admits he talked to Strzok, but the Justice Department is having trouble finding any documents. So we sued.

CNN and the others, \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post,\" they convinced the American people that the president of the United States was a traitor to his country, and they should be ashamed, and that all the rest is window dressing.

In a nationwide address, Maduro told Venezuelans that his supporters defeated what he called the small opposition and that US backed opposition leader Juan Guaido did not take control of any military bases. But, Guaido is now speaking saying that Maduro does not have control of the military though earlier Guaido said his supporters were in the final phase of ousting Maduro and that is clearly not the case, which is a dramatic change considering Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that earlier today, Maduro was about to fly to Havana, but the Russians talked him out of it. The Russians deny that. And while protests and clashes continue in the capital of Caracas, the Trump Administration has not ruled out sending US troops to Venezuela. Meantime here in the US, at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, two people are dead, four others wounded after an on-campus shooting. Local reports say the shooter was a student and opened fire inside a classroom during a presentation. He has now been taken into custody. Police do not believe anyone else was involved and we don't yet have a motive. Today was the last day of classes for UNCC and its 30,000 students. Breaking news updates as we get them."

Let me go back to The New York Times and The Washington Post. New York Times, for example, contradicting their own headline and very clearly stating the Special Counsel emphasized nothing and the Attorney General's March 24th letter was inaccurate or misleading. The witch hunt continues. Then we see Adam Schiff, well, now, they're just going to just move over and start checking, empowering the IRS and asking banks and phishing in this hole and that hole, financial information on Trump.

I kind of trust Mike Pompeo's judgment a lot more than Vladimir Putin's lying judgment, and the question then remains what support could we offer the people of Venezuela? 40 are dead. Look at this; they're running over the people. They're killing people right here in front of us with these trucks, literally running them over. What can we do to help them in their effort as they now try to bring freedom to the Venezuelan people? They have vast resources.

Do you know what they had said there when I interviewed with them? They don't have electricity; the hospitals don't have electricity. They don't have running water. Babies are born and being put in cardboard boxes/ I watched one picture where a doctor was performing a procedure and had no electricity, so they used their iPhone with the light on that to try to perform the operation.

Anyways, now the author of The Introduction to the Mueller Report, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, along with the author of The Case for Trump, Hoover Institution Fellow Victor Davis Hanson. You know professor, this is scary to me. You know how I feel about Israel. I've known Ehud Barak, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin. I've been friends with Bibi for over two decades; you know that. This little country, we see the rise of anti- Semitism around the world and then you've got people in this country that are scaring the living daylights out of me. As we saw what happened in San Diego, we hear Congresswoman Ellmers comments. You actually said so - one of the weapons of hate against Jews deployed by Nazi Germany were cartoons and caricatures that depicted Jews as subhuman animals, often his dogs and spiders, sort of like the Head of the Muslim Brotherhood Morsi who said Jews were descendants of apes and pigs and Obama sent him money and weaponry.

They tell world leaders what to do. They always operate in their own interest. But The New York Times cartoon was worse because it portrayed the leader of Israel with a Jewish star around his neck as a dog, as dehumanized, and the distance between the New York Times editorial office and that synagogue in San Diego gets smaller and smaller as the media gets more quicker and quicker, and the fear is that somebody with a gun maybe with a psychiatric illness will see dehumanizing cartoons like this and will--"

This is no longer just isolated Klansmen that were easily identifiable Nazis; this is deeply embedded within the progressive movement. And what's scary about it is, when Representative Omar or The New York Times or Hank Johnson compares Jews to termites, they assume that either because of their politics or their marginal \"people status\" that they're exempt from criticism. They take the Jewish community for granted and they think, you know what, they're never going to endanger the unity of the Democratic Party by attacking or objecting to what Al Sharpton says or Hank Johnson or Farrakhan. Or, they assume maybe the Jewish community is fully assimilating. It has been four or five generations, many families are going to go the way of the WIC (ph) Americans. A lot of young people don't really, haven't gone to Israel, they're secular. They're not going to object too much. And finally, notice how they always focus on Israel, they always say we're not anti-Semitic. We are not anti-Jews; we're just anti-Israeli. But then, when you start to talk to them and you say, \"Are you worried about occupied Cyprus or occupied Tibet? No. Are you worried about the refugees, the one million Jews that were ethnically cleansed in the Middle East? No. How about the Volga Germans that Stalin? No. Are you worried about the conditions of Muslims in China or India? No.\" It's always this little democratic ally of the United States; it's the humane society that they focus on."
