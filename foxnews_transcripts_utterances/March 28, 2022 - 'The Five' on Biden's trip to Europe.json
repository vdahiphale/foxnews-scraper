So good to be here. No, it was the most stunning piece of television, wasn't it? And it made the Oscars interesting, it boosted their ratings. And all the thing you've been sort of saying the Oscars have gone off the boil now in (Inaudible). But I thought about it a lot. And what I thought it is actually quite complicated because if I was Will Smith and my wife had been through four years of alopecia, which is a very serious condition particularly I think for women where they lose their hair and clumps and eventually last summer, she shaved her head. And she talked about it being a terrifying experience that she had gone through losing all her hair. To then sit there at the Oscars and have a billion people watching as a guy mocks you for that. Now, then comes down to mean to one of two things. Did Chris Rock know that she's had alopecia? In which case, I felt comedian or no comedian, he crossed the line. And if I've been Will Smith, I would've been pretty tempted to do the same thing. Don't condone the violence, I would've been tempted to do the same thing to defend my wife. But Chris Rock has made it clear apparently through friends that he didn't know that she had alopecia, in which case it just becomes a joke about someone's aesthetic appearance which he probably thought she looked pretty cool. He compared her to G.I. Jane. Then he doesn't deserve any of the stuff that went down. And to me it goes to a wider point to think about that marriage, about Will Smith's state of mind, about I don't know what was going on there we don't really know. But it was a stunning moment but I found myself gravitating unlike 99 percent of the people, I think to, feeling slightly defensive towards Will Smith.",

He wasn't -- walked out of the Oscars he could been taken out in cuffs, that was a crime what he did, it's on tape, and it doesn't matter if Chris Rock doesn't want to file charges. It is the people of the State of California versus Will Smith. And Hollywood, though, proves that they don't have to follow the rules, if you're on the right and you say something they don't like then they can respond with violence. I think by the way, Piers, the follow up on you said, I think the guy is an emotional wreck. He goes from cursing to fighting to crying, to, I mean, what is wrong with him?

And, you know, you look at the whole sort of farrago around Donald Trump saying the election was stolen from me. Well, I don't agree with the reasons why he thinks it was. But when I look at what happened with a suppression of the Hunter Biden story and the impact that could have had if it had been allowed to be covered in the normal way, that could have tipped the election in Donald Trump's way. So, this wasn't a trivial thing. And to remind viewers who may not remember this, Twitter actually suppressed the story. It locked out the New York Post account who broke the story about the existence of a laptop, but they allowed the New York Times very recently to report that it was all genuine, because the New York Times said that apparently that was fine. That is the worst example I can think of Twitter, and social media, suppressing information, which was highly relevant to the American people. And that should not be allowed to happen. So, if what Elon Musk is really saying is, we need a social media platform where that kind of thing won't happen, and we know it's always skewed against conservative right. It just is. You don't see the same suppression happening where it benefits the conservative right over the left. It's all one-way traffic. I thought that was shameful. I think Musk has a point.

So good to be here. No, it was the most stunning piece of television, wasn't it? And it made the Oscars interesting, it boosted their ratings. And all the thing you've been sort of saying the Oscars have gone off the boil now in (Inaudible). But I thought about it a lot. And what I thought it is actually quite complicated because if I was Will Smith and my wife had been through four years of alopecia, which is a very serious condition particularly I think for women where they lose their hair and clumps and eventually last summer, she shaved her head. And she talked about it being a terrifying experience that she had gone through losing all her hair. To then sit there at the Oscars and have a billion people watching as a guy mocks you for that. Now, then comes down to mean to one of two things. Did Chris Rock know that she's had alopecia? In which case, I felt comedian or no comedian, he crossed the line. And if I've been Will Smith, I would've been pretty tempted to do the same thing. Don't condone the violence, I would've been tempted to do the same thing to defend my wife. But Chris Rock has made it clear apparently through friends that he didn't know that she had alopecia, in which case it just becomes a joke about someone's aesthetic appearance which he probably thought she looked pretty cool. He compared her to G.I. Jane. Then he doesn't deserve any of the stuff that went down. And to me it goes to a wider point to think about that marriage, about Will Smith's state of mind, about I don't know what was going on there we don't really know. But it was a stunning moment but I found myself gravitating unlike 99 percent of the people, I think to, feeling slightly defensive towards Will Smith."

Jane 2. She is -- Jada Smith is -- she's got a fabulous body, and she's beautiful as was Demi Moore in that film. But aside from all that, in the middle of an event where people are going to get awards in their chosen profession that this guy takes it upon himself to disrupt the event, to go up on stage, to commit violence on stage, then come back and curse out so we can even put on television what he says because he feels slighted about a joke which most people, and by the way if that's a standard I should go to Saturday Night Live and really go crazy over there."

He wasn't -- walked out of the Oscars he could been taken out in cuffs, that was a crime what he did, it's on tape, and it doesn't matter if Chris Rock doesn't want to file charges. It is the people of the State of California versus Will Smith. And Hollywood, though, proves that they don't have to follow the rules, if you're on the right and you say something they don't like then they can respond with violence. I think by the way, Piers, the follow up on you said, I think the guy is an emotional wreck. He goes from cursing to fighting to crying, to, I mean, what is wrong with him? And the Academy should not condone it and honestly, he shouldn't be allowed to come to the Academy again. Look, Kanye -- Kanye West can't go to the Grammy's."

Greg, I remember in the U.K. that every time a left-wing leader either in or out of office wanted to try and get what he thought would be a bit of -- a bit of a bump in the polls, they stopped and they do envy taxing. They've started going after the rich. It's an easy win. And we have one good Ed Miliband who wanted a mansion tax which was a great idea and taxed everyone with a mansion. It turned out that mansions in London, the price of a mansion basically bought you a little cubby hole. And it killed his election chances. And when I heard Joe Biden do this, yes, this is it's envy tax. It's like my other policies aren't working. I keep telling the American people the economy's thriving, they keep looking at the prices at the pump and so on, and realize the opposite is happening. So, what can I do? I'm going to tax the billionaires because it's a good headline. But it doesn't actually solve any problems."

And the moment you defend anybody who is successful, then you come off as a greedy sycophant, and that's why you don't do it. But the fact remains. They make a serious miscalculation every time they want to raise taxes, because it doesn't allow them to think what could be done. Like, there should be an experiment where Democrats decide, OK, we need to solve this problem but we can't say tax, all right. We can't say tax, and we can't blame systemic racism. And then what happens is they might even sit down and come up with an actual solution. But they won't because they're lazy. And the opportunity costs of them always going to taxation means that we never actually solve so many problems -- the problems that still exist today."

And they even made a hashtag. And the hashtag apparently has not worked very well, because it's -- they're not able to get there. There's another reason Biden did this. And that is because he's losing his base completely. And to Greg -- what Greg said, who's going to say, well, billionaires shouldn't pay their fair share, right? Well, there's going to have to be -- there's a policy discussion, but then there's also the politics of it. He is losing women, Latinos, and independents at an alarming rate. If you're in the -- in the White House, and you're a Democrat -- so, you're looking at these numbers and think we got to do something.

I love these stories, not because I know that I was right about Joe Biden, because I love watching Chuck Todd report these horrible numbers from his own network. And that proves that he was wrong. And you can see the pain on his face. Because NBC News, Chuck Todd specifically, was kind of like the Biden's co- chair of his campaign. Remember, they lied for him, they covered up for him. They dragged him over the finish line. The minute he gets in, they say is the new FDR. Then this guy blows up. So, that's what I like to see.

Now, it's about taxes, so it's the billionaires. And before it was about Putin, it's a Putin price hike for gas. This is what they do. And they're not smart enough to create a new -- you know, a new argument that this is what we're going to do. All they say are things like it's transitory inflation.

We're talking about one coming off the break, one of the world's richest men, if not the richest Elon Musk is ready to take on big tech censorship. What's he planning? But also, we need him to employ a lot of people to get us out of a pandemic. So you can tax these guys and make yourself feel better or we can encourage them. We can spare them on.

    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Elon Musk is a genius. And I think he's a maverick risk-taker genius, the best type. And I think he's got a point here because I think what Twitter did, for example, with the Hunter Biden laptop story, was one of the most shameful acts of free speech suppression that I've witnessed in modern media. And, you know, you look at the whole sort of farrago around Donald Trump saying the election was stolen from me. Well, I don't agree with the reasons why he thinks it was. But when I look at what happened with a suppression of the Hunter Biden story and the impact that could have had if it had been allowed to be covered in the normal way, that could have tipped the election in Donald Trump's way. So, this wasn't a trivial thing. And to remind viewers who may not remember this, Twitter actually suppressed the story. It locked out the New York Post account who broke the story about the existence of a laptop, but they allowed the New York Times very recently to report that it was all genuine, because the New York Times said that apparently that was fine. That is the worst example I can think of Twitter, and social media, suppressing information, which was highly relevant to the American people. And that should not be allowed to happen. So, if what Elon Musk is really saying is, we need a social media platform where that kind of thing won't happen, and we know it's always skewed against conservative right. It just is. You don't see the same suppression happening where it benefits the conservative right over the left. It's all one-way traffic. I thought that was shameful. I think Musk has a point. And looking at his own polls that he conducted, I think a lot of people agree with it."

And here's why I like Musk buying Twitter instead of doing a competitor. I can go to lots of different places. I need to go to one place to see him saying something annoying about guns, you posting about your dog, you drunk tweeting about some stupid comedian. That's what I want. I don't want everybody scrambled around in different places. It's about convenience, one town square."

And I want to irritate all the right people, all the people that we all find uniquely irritating. And it's this permanently offended, snowflakey canceled culture mob who descend like a pack of hornets on anything they can get themselves into trying to suppress everyone's right to an opinion, trying to tell us all how to think, how to act, how to how to laugh, or to find funny what statues to revere, what parts of history are acceptable, what parts aren't, and so on. And I think we're all just sick and tired of it. Now, whether you're in in New York, whether you're in London, whether you're in Sydney, everyone is fed up with this. We're fed up with this small vocal, permanently angry, humorless horrible group of people, this woke brigade. And by woke, I don't mean the original interpretation of it which meant just to be more socially aware of social racial injustice. I mean, this new creation of the woke canceled culture, which is somebody who believes their opinion is not just the only one that can be tolerated, but that anyone that deviates one iota from that opinion has to be destroyed, shamed, abused, and then canceled, have the job taken away from, have their livelihood wrecked simply for having a different opinion. So, I think the world has become a small place. I think that in terms of debate, we're all having these same arguments around the world now. And I think the vast majority of people, whether it's an America, the U.K., Australia, or other countries, the vast majority agree with me, and I suspect with the panel here, that this pendulum has gone way too far. And that free speech has got to mean what free speech means. And that doesn't just mean that you tolerate opinions you agree with, it actually means the opposite.
