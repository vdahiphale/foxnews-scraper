And now under Biden, even tampons are in short supply. If that's not a war on women, I'm Joy Behar. And how do you know that I'm not? We could pass for twins if I stopped shaving my back. But that doesn't affect Joe because nothing does. He's just along for the ride and he's not even driving. And that's why as gas prices soar it's also not his problem. The last time he was behind the wheel it was when his secret service member pulled them around the White House grounds in a red wagon. So we got a president who not only does not feel your pain, he's not even thinking about it. Only one thing at a time and that thing is usually how do I climb the stairs? He's no figure for a crisis. Look, I know my limitations. If I'm at a party and you need some drinks, I'll make them but if someone starts choking, I'd be as useless as Dr. Jill Biden.

In an interview, he said, can you get a job? Yes. Is it harder? Yes. It's even harder for older writers. He adds, you don't meet many 52-year-old white males. The same thing Disney Security said to me at the teacups. So, that's what he said on Sunday. I bet you can guess what he said on Monday. Tweeting, \"I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work. It's a form of racism. I absolutely do not believe that racism is practice against white writers. Please know that I strongly supported diversity of voices being heard in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.\" That was a close one, nor did he blink while reading a statement like a POW who'd shot down over (INAUDIBLE). But obviously, he's wrong, white's not getting hired due to their race to hire someone else because of their race isn't racism, its inclusion, right?

Well, instead of focusing on the economy, his woke White House targeted parents at school boards elevated identity over education, major every job appointment was a historic first and to historic worst, instead of prioritizing competence. And now under Biden, even tampons are in short supply. If that's not a war on women, I'm Joy Behar. And how do you know that I'm not? We could pass for twins if I stopped shaving my back. But that doesn't affect Joe because nothing does. He's just along for the ride and he's not even driving. And that's why as gas prices soar it's also not his problem. The last time he was behind the wheel it was when his secret service member pulled them around the White House grounds in a red wagon. So we got a president who not only does not feel your pain, he's not even thinking about it. Only one thing at a time and that thing is usually how do I climb the stairs? He's no figure for a crisis. Look, I know my limitations. If I'm at a party and you need some drinks, I'll make them but if someone starts choking, I'd be as useless as Dr. Jill Biden. And that kind of emergency I'll disappear quicker that Jesse Watters when the check arrives. We need someone to throw us a lifesaver here, not a dumb-dumb, huh? I wonder what Joe has to say."

But you remember the tail, the one proven to be total B.S. after reasonable minds pointed out that the agents were holding reins for controlling horses, not whips? Now despite that, they've already clipped and cleared it with criminal conduct. A federal source tells Fox News the DHS will hit them with administrative violations and they'll be given a chance to defend themselves. Oh nice. I'd say Biden's beating a dead horse. But he might try to arrest himself. Now of all this stinks like Amber Heard's bed after a chili cook off. It's because at the time that this fake news hit the media was all too eager to run with the whips lie. The media then never admitted they blew it and ignored the story after the agents were cleared.

In an interview, he said, can you get a job? Yes. Is it harder? Yes. It's even harder for older writers. He adds, you don't meet many 52-year-old white males. The same thing Disney Security said to me at the teacups. So, that's what he said on Sunday. I bet you can guess what he said on Monday. Tweeting, \"I apologize for saying white male writers having trouble finding work. It's a form of racism. I absolutely do not believe that racism is practice against white writers. Please know that I strongly supported diversity of voices being heard in literature, in Hollywood, everywhere.\" That was a close one, nor did he blink while reading a statement like a POW who'd shot down over (INAUDIBLE). But obviously, he's wrong, white's not getting hired due to their race to hire someone else because of their race isn't racism, its inclusion, right? Fun fact, James Patterson has written two novels with Bill Clinton: \"The President is Missing\" and \"The President's Daughter.\" Apparently, they're working on a third book called the president is missing and so is your daughter."

He just was saying, if you really break down that apology, what he said was, I didn't realize people would be mad, and I don't like that they are. Like, that's it.

Never apologize because the woke mob does not want your apologies. They want your submission, right? So, all they want is the control of you to apologize. I'm going to try to be as succinct as possible when I say this. Historically, old white dudes have gotten a lot of opportunity. So, now, that has changed, and they're trying to give young diverse voices, a lot of opportunities, and maybe old white dudes aren't being looked at in the way that they weren't before. Does that happen? Yes. Was he -- was there an element of correction of correctness into what he said? Yes. But jumping and calling it racism was like the third rail and if I was his publicist, I would have been pulling my hair out. So, that tweet, that apology was literally tweeted behind the barrel of a shotgun."
