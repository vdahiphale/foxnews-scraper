      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, the far left radical extremist organization known as Black Lives Matter, the organization, is now sticking up for Cuba's evil, murdering communist dictatorship. You know the one that kills, tortures and imprisons scores of peaceful citizens out there protesting for the cause of freedom. Coming up, the great one Mark Levin will have an important message for this anti-American organization. Also tonight, the radical left trying to ruin sports, professional sports in particular in order to appease the woke mob. Now the NFL is now committed to playing two separate national anthems. I have a lot to say, we'll explain. Plus, California's mask mandate is back. That's right, and get this -- the state just approved a measure to hand out cash to anyone unwilling to get a job. Everybody gets free cash. Ric Grenell will join us from the Golden State and we are told he has a huge announcement tonight. He will tell us what that is. But, first, we began -- it's no secret the Democratic Party is adamantly opposed to election integrity measures in several key states. These are simple, basic fundamentals. Not that complicated. You would think everybody wants integrity in election and confidence in election results. Things like voter ID, bans on valid harvesting, chain of custody integrity. According to the media mob and the Democratic Party and the leadership and Biden and others, it's racist -- according to the radical left. But tonight, new insight into why Democrats are terrified of election integrity measures. In Georgia's deep blue Fulton County, where Biden received a nearly 73 percent of the vote, there are now reports from \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\" out, \"Newsweek,\" others showing that scores of votes may have been double counted, according to the AJC, a left-leaning newspaper, by the way. Quote, a duplicate write-in vote for singer Kanye West was a big clue that some absentee ballots had been counted twice in Fulton County. The paper continues, quote: Digital ballot images made public under Georgia's new voting law show that nearly 200 ballots that election officials initially scanned two times last fall before recount. These images seen here clearly show duplicate ballots with a different batch numbers. In other words, according to the \"AJC\" and those that are now doing a full audit of Fulton County, all of these ballots were initially counted twice. Tonight we have no idea how many ballots may have been double counted statewide. At best what we are seeing out of Fulton County's incompetence running rampant at a high level, and at worst, serious fraud and potential abuse is going on pretty much in plain sight. Nobody wanted to talk to the whistle- blower eyewitnesses, either. Remember? Now regardless of what happened, this is exactly what I have been telling you. This is why election integrity measures are critical and they need to happen and they need to happen now. Without the new Georgia voting bill, we wouldn't know about any of this. But tonight, Atlanta, Georgia, is not the only place facing scrutiny. An election audit in Maricopa County in Arizona is happening. It's also turning up the shocking results. According to the Arizona Senate president, Karen Fann, quote: Companies hired by the legislature to review the election results came up with a different number of ballots then Maricopa County officials. Huh? Now, tonight we don't know the exact discrepancy, as the audit is now ongoing. But this has to be concerning and concerning development for everybody that wants integrity in elections. Integrity of our elections, confidence in election results, it is paramount to the survival of our great republic. I often cite several measures that all states should adopt. Voter identification, signature verification, chain of custody integrity, voter rolls being updated for every election, and most states have statutory language that partisan observers be allowed to watch of the vote count, all political sides, they should watch the count from start to finish. Audits and investigations also play an important role, and while audits can be painful and they can be expensive and time-consuming, there is perhaps nothing more importance than the accuracy and validity of your vote. Now the Democratic Party, you know, they should welcome election integrity efforts with open arms. Here with more, the author of \"The Case Against the New Censorship\", Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. You know, Professor Dershowitz, what I don't understand is, for example, the most restrictive voting laws that we have found are in Delaware. There is no early voting like Georgia. They have 17 days early in person voting in Georgia, they have drop boxes in every county, they have no excuse absent email and balloting. They don't have any drop boxes in Delaware. You have to provide an excuse to get an absentee ballot. And now, I'm watching the DOJ seemingly being weaponized going after Georgia while ignoring the more restrictive state of Delaware where Joe Biden never lifted a finger, to reform and make more accessible voting for the people in the state of Delaware. Your comments, your observations? How concerned should we be?",

      "sentences": "Well, the evidence shows two things. Number one, there's never been a perfect election. JFK's election wasn't perfect, George Bush's election was imperfect and the current election wasn't perfect. Number two, the evidence seems to strongly suggest that it wasn't stolen and that the outcome was right. There is a big difference between Delaware, for example, and Arizona. Arizona has Native American reservations, and the ease of voting that we all take for granted in the cities of Delaware and others aren't so easy in cities like Arizona. So there are going to be differences. The Supreme Court will uphold, I predict it, will uphold voter registration, voter identification and may be even signature verification. They may not uphold some other issues which have a disparate impact. I think what we're seeing here are arguments on extremes. One side is saying the election was perfect, they are wrong. The other side is saying the election was stolen. The evidence doesn't support that. But we can do better and there's no reason not to try to do better. The goal is maximize the number of eligible voters who actually come out and vote, and minimize, may be make zero the number of ineligible voters in the number of fraudulent and mistaken votes. We can do that. We can do that without racial disparity or without illegal actions. Let's aspire to that goal.",

But as you point out, Sean, it's good to conduct a comprehensive audit by qualified, independent experts. And, you know, part of the problem is some of these voting methods and systems are antiquated. They don't all have backstops to prevent double scanning. Too many states have been willing to spend the money to upgrade their election infrastructures. They need to do that, Sean, as you point out, so people have confidence in the result. And the second problem is many of these election officials overseen the process to partisans and short-term hires actually inputting a lot of the votes, they're not adequately trained. That needs to be fixed. So, again, people there in Georgia and elsewhere have confidence in the legitimacy of the outcome.",

But it's just not going to happen. I think we have to look to the future. We have to accept the fact that Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He will be the president of the United States until the next election, but we have to move forward to make sure that future elections are transparent.

Let's do it, it's simple, these are simple things. All right. Thank you both. All right. Now, tonight, we turn to another basic fact, the woke, far left socialists in the Democratic Party, they are on a mission. Their mission: to absolutely destroy seemingly everything that, well, even unites Americans and that we enjoy. For example, the safety and security of American cities, that's now gone because of these insane \"defund the police\" measures. Comedy has been ruined because of the left's word policing and cancel culture. Almost all new movies, they pretty much absolutely suck because the social justice warriors are in Hollywood and even being patriotic on the Fourth of July is now seen as some sort of offensive political statement, or the flag is viewed as a controversial symbol. And now, so-called liberals are attempting to -- and now they want to politicize sports. This is a really bad idea. The NFL has agreed to play two national anthems before each game. In addition to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", the NFL is now saying they will reportedly play the so-called Black national anthem. Okay, my question is, NBA, NFL, MLB, they want to keep going deeper into politics as their ratings continue to dive and people turn away and are turned off by it. You know, people, they kind of like to go to games because -- well, it's a distraction from everyday life and everybody there has a shared passion for a sport and home team. It's a uniting moment. And now, of course, the social justice warriors will ruin that. The country is supposed to be, we are to be one nation under -- and not a thing, Joe -- God. You know, God, the creator of everything -- indivisible, liberty, justice for all. America is not flawless but we have a system that we can always strive and we can prove we have made great improvements to become a more perfect union. We have far to go and we'll get there.

Dead cops. When do we want to? Now.\" And \"pigs in the blanket, fry `em like bacon.\" Well, that group released a statement attacking the U.S. and defending, that's right, the murdering communist dictatorship out of Cuba, the Cuban regime. Quote: Black Lives Matter condemns the United States federal government's inhumane treatment of Cubans and urges it to immediately lift the economic embargo. Adding, quote: The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government. They couldn't be any more wrong. So ask yourselves, do the radical extremists on the left have anything positive to say but America? Here with his brand-new book just out. This book is masterfully written. It's called \"American Marxism.\" It's on amazon.com, hannity.com, bookstores everywhere. He also hosts \"Life, Liberty and Levin\". I call him the great one, Mark Levin. It wasn't the U.S., great one, that was in the middle of the revolution stealing people's plans and murdering the Cuban people that made false promises that were never fulfilled of great equity and prosperity for the Cuban people. They brought nothing but poverty, misery, imprisonment, and in many cases, death. That would be the Castro brothers and that big, murdering communist dictatorship. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": You know, thanks for having me, Sean. Here's the problem. This ideology is an antihuman ideology and it's easy to promote it. It's an abstraction, is a theory. Everybody's going to be equal, everybody will be taken care of, and it is a lie. Marxism is wrong in every single respect and hundreds of millions of people have paid with their lives and you have police states all over the world to prove it. The problem is, and what I write about an \"American Marxism\" is what's going on in our country. This ideology is a poison, it's being taught in our public schools, it's being promoted in our universities and colleges with tenured professors. It's being promoted even by the Biden administration and the media. The media do not disagree with these Marxist movements in America. Climate change isn't about polar bears and so forth. It's about the degrowth movement. It's a war on capitalism. It's a war on your individual liberty, you mobility. Critical race theory isn't even about race, it's about Marxism. They talk about destroying our history, pulling down our monuments. That's Marxist model, and I go on and on about it in the book. But here's the problem, we have three books now that are hit jobs on Donald Trump. One is written by two \"Washington Post\" reporters who are getting a lot of press today, here and elsewhere. One is written by \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter. Another is written by the usual hit man, this guy Michael Wolff. And so, people are focused on, what did he say? And what's the gossip? And what did Milley say? You know what? It's time we the American people galvanize and organize and confront the threats that face us and stop facing shiny objects that the media and these reporters put out as they make a fortune trashing this country. I don't care what this jerk Milley had to say. I care what's going on in our classrooms, I care what's going on at our border, I care what's happening to our economy. Now, what do we do about it? I spent six chapters in this book explaining who the enemy is, explaining where they come from, explaining their scholarship, explaining how they got to where they are today, because we need to understand not political opposition, not our adversaries, but who are enemies are who want to destroy the minds of our children and destroy our way of life. That's number one. The number two, we talk on and on and on, but what the hell are we going to do about all of this? And so, that's why in the last chapter, which is 10,000 words, I put out what I think is a game plan. We need to empower ourselves. There is power in numbers. We have the resources. We own these damn colleges. They're subsidized by mostly our state tax dollars. We own every piece of what's going on in our public schools, and yet we can't get into public schools to find out what's going on? What's that all about? Green New Deal, where we have a president of the United States that just issues executive orders like he's Benito Mussolini and tells us how to live our lives, where did that power come from? We need to become more litigious. We need to use the FOIA laws. We need to file complaints with the Internal Revenue Service. We need to show up at shareholder meetings and corporations. We need to show up en masse at public events, including school board meetings. We need to claw back money from these colleges and universities. There's a lot we can do, and it's about damn time we focus on it. I can talk about General Milley until I'm blue in the face. That doesn't solve a thing. These three Trump trashing books from the media, you know why we hate the media? Because they deserve it. You know why we hate \"The New York Times\"? Because it deserves that, as I explained in my book. \"The New York Times\" was a mouthpiece for Stalin in 1932 with their Walter Duranty in Moscow when he was slaughtering Ukrainians. \"The New York Times\" covered up the Holocaust. Their man at Berlin was friendly to he Nazi regime. \"New York Times:\" is responsible for Fidel Castro and that awful regime that's there, about the reporter Matthews and so forth. It is a horrendous poisonous corporation. Forget about media, corporation. This is what we need to focus on. We cannot allow this corrupt media to push this country where it's pushing it. And notice, there's not a dime's worth of difference between most of the media in this country and where these American Marxist movements stand, whether it's BLM, whether it's the Green New Deal. They stand for these movements. They stand for this party. Well, we have to stand for ourselves. Nobody's going to save us, not the Republican Party If you love this country, whether you're a moderate Democrat, whether you're libertarian, if you love this country, let us put our differences aside. Let us embrace and empower our numbers, and our wealth, and let us begin piece by piece clawing back, because we are in the abyss. We're not looking into the abyss, we are there. And if we don't do something about it, they will win, and we will lose. That's it.",

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, the far left radical extremist organization known as Black Lives Matter, the organization, is now sticking up for Cuba's evil, murdering communist dictatorship. You know the one that kills, tortures and imprisons scores of peaceful citizens out there protesting for the cause of freedom. Coming up, the great one Mark Levin will have an important message for this anti-American organization. Also tonight, the radical left trying to ruin sports, professional sports in particular in order to appease the woke mob. Now the NFL is now committed to playing two separate national anthems. I have a lot to say, we'll explain. Plus, California's mask mandate is back. That's right, and get this -- the state just approved a measure to hand out cash to anyone unwilling to get a job. Everybody gets free cash. Ric Grenell will join us from the Golden State and we are told he has a huge announcement tonight. He will tell us what that is. But, first, we began -- it's no secret the Democratic Party is adamantly opposed to election integrity measures in several key states. These are simple, basic fundamentals. Not that complicated. You would think everybody wants integrity in election and confidence in election results. Things like voter ID, bans on valid harvesting, chain of custody integrity. According to the media mob and the Democratic Party and the leadership and Biden and others, it's racist -- according to the radical left. But tonight, new insight into why Democrats are terrified of election integrity measures. In Georgia's deep blue Fulton County, where Biden received a nearly 73 percent of the vote, there are now reports from \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\" out, \"Newsweek,\" others showing that scores of votes may have been double counted, according to the AJC, a left-leaning newspaper, by the way. Quote, a duplicate write-in vote for singer Kanye West was a big clue that some absentee ballots had been counted twice in Fulton County."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "The paper continues, quote",
      "utterance": "Digital ballot images made public under Georgia's new voting law show that nearly 200 ballots that election officials initially scanned two times last fall before recount. These images seen here clearly show duplicate ballots with a different batch numbers. In other words, according to the \"AJC\" and those that are now doing a full audit of Fulton County, all of these ballots were initially counted twice. Tonight we have no idea how many ballots may have been double counted statewide. At best what we are seeing out of Fulton County's incompetence running rampant at a high level, and at worst, serious fraud and potential abuse is going on pretty much in plain sight. Nobody wanted to talk to the whistle- blower eyewitnesses, either. Remember? Now regardless of what happened, this is exactly what I have been telling you. This is why election integrity measures are critical and they need to happen and they need to happen now. Without the new Georgia voting bill, we wouldn't know about any of this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But tonight, Atlanta, Georgia, is not the only place facing scrutiny. An election audit in Maricopa County in Arizona is happening. It's also turning up the shocking results. According to the Arizona Senate president, Karen Fann, quote",
      "utterance": "Companies hired by the legislature to review the election results came up with a different number of ballots then Maricopa County officials. Huh? Now, tonight we don't know the exact discrepancy, as the audit is now ongoing. But this has to be concerning and concerning development for everybody that wants integrity in elections. Integrity of our elections, confidence in election results, it is paramount to the survival of our great republic. I often cite several measures that all states should adopt. Voter identification, signature verification, chain of custody integrity, voter rolls being updated for every election, and most states have statutory language that partisan observers be allowed to watch of the vote count, all political sides, they should watch the count from start to finish. Audits and investigations also play an important role, and while audits can be painful and they can be expensive and time-consuming, there is perhaps nothing more importance than the accuracy and validity of your vote. Now the Democratic Party, you know, they should welcome election integrity efforts with open arms. Here with more, the author of \"The Case Against the New Censorship\", Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. You know, Professor Dershowitz, what I don't understand is, for example, the most restrictive voting laws that we have found are in Delaware. There is no early voting like Georgia. They have 17 days early in person voting in Georgia, they have drop boxes in every county, they have no excuse absent email and balloting. They don't have any drop boxes in Delaware. You have to provide an excuse to get an absentee ballot. And now, I'm watching the DOJ seemingly being weaponized going after Georgia while ignoring the more restrictive state of Delaware where Joe Biden never lifted a finger, to reform and make more accessible voting for the people in the state of Delaware. Your comments, your observations? How concerned should we be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the evidence shows two things. Number one, there's never been a perfect election. JFK's election wasn't perfect, George Bush's election was imperfect and the current election wasn't perfect. Number two, the evidence seems to strongly suggest that it wasn't stolen and that the outcome was right. There is a big difference between Delaware, for example, and Arizona. Arizona has Native American reservations, and the ease of voting that we all take for granted in the cities of Delaware and others aren't so easy in cities like Arizona. So there are going to be differences. The Supreme Court will uphold, I predict it, will uphold voter registration, voter identification and may be even signature verification. They may not uphold some other issues which have a disparate impact. I think what we're seeing here are arguments on extremes. One side is saying the election was perfect, they are wrong. The other side is saying the election was stolen. The evidence doesn't support that. But we can do better and there's no reason not to try to do better. The goal is maximize the number of eligible voters who actually come out and vote, and minimize, may be make zero the number of ineligible voters in the number of fraudulent and mistaken votes. We can do that. We can do that without racial disparity or without illegal actions. Let's aspire to that goal."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Well, people there want to know, did it affect the outcome in the state, that Biden won narrowly by itself? No because we are talking about 200 votes out of a 12,000 vote margin. But as you point out, Sean, it's good to conduct a comprehensive audit by qualified, independent experts. And, you know, part of the problem is some of these voting methods and systems are antiquated. They don't all have backstops to prevent double scanning. Too many states have been willing to spend the money to upgrade their election infrastructures. They need to do that, Sean, as you point out, so people have confidence in the result. And the second problem is many of these election officials overseen the process to partisans and short-term hires actually inputting a lot of the votes, they're not adequately trained. That needs to be fixed. So, again, people there in Georgia and elsewhere have confidence in the legitimacy of the outcome."

And again, I don't see anything legally or constitutionally that I could point to in terms of a remedy but you're Harvard law professor, I'm not. So I will defer to you on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "The answer is crystal clear, no one knows. It's never happened. The Supreme Court would duck the issue in the way it ducked to the issue in 2000, in the way it ducked the issue in 2020 and 2021. There would not be a reversal of fortune, a reversal of the election. That would not happen, unless we found unbelievably, it didn't happen here, massive, massive, deliberate fraud. But it's just not going to happen. I think we have to look to the future. We have to accept the fact that Joe Biden is the president of the United States. He will be the president of the United States until the next election, but we have to move forward to make sure that future elections are transparent. It's a very unhealthy thing in a democracy if 30 million, 50 million people don't trust the outcome of an election. The election has to be trusted."

It expands access and guards against voter fraud."

That's happened since Elbridge Gerry invented gerrymandering. But we have to make sure that in a society dedicated to racial equality that there is no disparate impact, that every new law has the same impact on people regardless of race.

      "utterance": "to absolutely destroy seemingly everything that, well, even unites Americans and that we enjoy. For example, the safety and security of American cities, that's now gone because of these insane \"defund the police\" measures. Comedy has been ruined because of the left's word policing and cancel culture. Almost all new movies, they pretty much absolutely suck because the social justice warriors are in Hollywood and even being patriotic on the Fourth of July is now seen as some sort of offensive political statement, or the flag is viewed as a controversial symbol. And now, so-called liberals are attempting to -- and now they want to politicize sports. This is a really bad idea. The NFL has agreed to play two national anthems before each game. In addition to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", the NFL is now saying they will reportedly play the so-called Black national anthem. Okay, my question is, NBA, NFL, MLB, they want to keep going deeper into politics as their ratings continue to dive and people turn away and are turned off by it. You know, people, they kind of like to go to games because -- well, it's a distraction from everyday life and everybody there has a shared passion for a sport and home team. It's a uniting moment. And now, of course, the social justice warriors will ruin that. The country is supposed to be, we are to be one nation under -- and not a thing, Joe -- God. You know, God, the creator of everything -- indivisible, liberty, justice for all. America is not flawless but we have a system that we can always strive and we can prove we have made great improvements to become a more perfect union. We have far to go and we'll get there. This is what Martin Luther King Jr. was fighting for. Not two different anthems but two different races and two different nations, but one America where people are judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Take a look."

Sports allowed people -- you're sitting next to people in a stadium, in an arena, you don't know if they are Democrat or Republican. You don't -- people of all backgrounds, all races and what do you have? A shared passion for a sport, for a team, a home team, high-fiving strangers, I've done it, probably most of you have done it as well. You don't go there to talk politics. You go there to get away from the difficulties of life. You root for the same team together. It's a uniting event. It's a way for Americans to literally form an important bond. And for the record, patriotism, like the kind we just witnessed in that video that happened in the NHL, it's not political. There is nothing wrong with our flag, our great anthem. It doesn't need to be redesigned in any way. It's the greatest country God gave man and we don't need to be ashamed all the time, or apologizing all the time. Should we right wrongs and correct injustices? Yes. Have we done so in the past? Yes. Should we do more? Absolutely. But you know something? The idea that we are one nation under God, that's a dream we can achieve. We certainly don't need, for example, racial inspectors from the United Nations being invited in by the Biden administration telling us that we're evil, like Tony Blinken is suggesting. By the way, we don't need big tech or big government or big Hollywood censoring, canceling, you know, anything they disagree with? By the way, a new faith movie has come out, based on \"God's Not Dead\", which was a big hit. You know, \"We the People\" starring Antonio Sabato Jr. and our very own Judge Jeanine is allegedly being blacklisted, but not on this show. Here's a preview.

And it's revisionist history with the United States asking the U.N. to come into America and assess whether or not we are a racist country, I'm telling you, Sean, where that's going as they are going to finally say we need to pay reparations, and that's where this is all going. They are destroying everything that is American. And the NFL, if they want to do something, if they want to play two anthems or whatever, but if you want to change things in America, you don't do it with the song, you do it by effectuating change in courts, in the legislature and people in power, in schools and the school board -- which is, by the way, what \"God's Not Dead\" is all about. It's Parents whose children are being taught things like critical race theory that have nothing to do with their belief in God and their freedom of speech.

That's why they're trying to destroy our schools. They are in the streets, they're crying (ph), and the Democrats have adopted them as part of their group. They're a fringe group and when they talk about racial equity, that gets torn apart in court. All these pro, preferential treatment based on race programs have been knocked out in court.

Had -- what President Biden has done with the border, opening up, now we're catching people on the terrorist watch list, fentanyl has increased by 300 percent, killing Americans as they (ph) come across, more than a million people have come across this border illegally now in the process. But we also talked about what's happening -- inflation. Democrats in a short amount of time have created an inflation that is a tax on all Americans.

You know, there's a number of things we discussed, but we also discussed exactly what you're talking about -- when we put the Commitment to America out with President Trump. It was the first time in the last election since 1994 that no Republican incumbent lost for Congress. We beat 15 Democrats. We elected more Republican women in the last Congress and the history of Congress then ever before. And we're going to build on those successes and even go further. And even in our first six months, we've outraised the Democrats. But if you want to join with us and you believe in this, go to takethehouse.com. Because that critical race theory, Democrats are pushing that, they're trying to defund our police, they're opening up the borders, they brought inflation back, and we're watching prices like we've never seen before. And let's talk about the gas price, the highest it's been since the last time Joe Biden was in office."

Leader McCarthy, we'll watch carefully. This is a very important race in 2022. Thank you. All right. Now, amid a stream of never-ending fake news from the far left media mob, confidence in your press is plummeting like never before. A new Gallup poll finding that just 16 percent of the American people have the confidence in TV news. Just 21 percent have confidence in their newspapers. Remember, the left-wing sycophants and the propaganda media, they don't care about facts, they don't care about truth. They only care about lying to smear Republicans and conservatives and hiding truth to protect Democrats. Here with reaction, Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance, along with FOX News contributor, \"New York post\" columnist, Miranda Devine. JD Vance, we'll start with you. It's not surprising to me. If anything, I'm surprised it's that high. I don't -- I want -- who -- where is the 21 percent of people that do support it?"

      "utterance": "Yeah, I don't know. We may need a recount on that result, Sean. You know, if you look at the media, they've revealed themselves not just to be biased. I thought the media was biased ten years ago. They revealed themselves to be active propaganda arms of the left. It's no surprise people don't trust them. The other thing that's going on is these reporters are not of their communities. Twenty years ago, we had good local journalists, good local papers. Those things have been destroyed by the big tech companies. So, all you have is these national reporters who clearly hate the country that they're reporting on. It shows in their reporting and it's not surprising people don't trust them."

I ask you all the time, how bad is it for the Bidens? You say on a scale of 1 to 10, it's off the charts. Why do you think they have chosen bias? Do you think they are aware of it, or are they kind of just indoctrinated, blue check mark cult members?"

      "speaker": "MIRANDA DEVINE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, you just see, as JD just said, it's -- the news media has descended into propaganda and I think there are two reasons for that. One was Donald Trump, who -- you had a lot of journalists saying was just beyond the pale, that the old standards of neutrality and objectivity had to be thrown out the window because he was a clear and present danger. And then, of course, there was COVID. And again, there's this sanctimonious attitude that, oh, you can't trust most of the people because they're just dumb and stupid and deplorable. You have to give them information that's good for them, and that's what we saw with Anthony Fauci, and Andrew Cuomo -- two people that the media elevated, lionized, the absolute wrong people -- the opposite of the people who should have been lionized during the pandemic. And, you know, it's a very sad, I'm not surprised at these low opinion numbers, but it's sad not just because I'm a journalist and I've worked in this industry for -- you know, almost all my career. But also because it's just terrible for society, that there is no impartial or neutral set of agreed facts that people can draw their own conclusions from. You can't trust the media now and then other sources like Wikipedia and social media are also have biased the news and slanted it to suit the establishment, left-wing viewpoint and that's a dangerous situation to be in."

Dead cops. When do we want to?

      "utterance": "The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government. They couldn't be any more wrong. So ask yourselves, do the radical extremists on the left have anything positive to say but America? Here with his brand-new book just out. This book is masterfully written. It's called \"American Marxism.\" It's on amazon.com, hannity.com, bookstores everywhere. He also hosts \"Life, Liberty and Levin\". I call him the great one, Mark Levin. It wasn't the U.S., great one, that was in the middle of the revolution stealing people's plans and murdering the Cuban people that made false promises that were never fulfilled of great equity and prosperity for the Cuban people. They brought nothing but poverty, misery, imprisonment, and in many cases, death. That would be the Castro brothers and that big, murdering communist dictatorship. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": You know, thanks for having me, Sean. Here's the problem. This ideology is an antihuman ideology and it's easy to promote it. It's an abstraction, is a theory. Everybody's going to be equal, everybody will be taken care of, and it is a lie. Marxism is wrong in every single respect and hundreds of millions of people have paid with their lives and you have police states all over the world to prove it. The problem is, and what I write about an \"American Marxism\" is what's going on in our country. This ideology is a poison, it's being taught in our public schools, it's being promoted in our universities and colleges with tenured professors. It's being promoted even by the Biden administration and the media. The media do not disagree with these Marxist movements in America. Climate change isn't about polar bears and so forth. It's about the degrowth movement. It's a war on capitalism. It's a war on your individual liberty, you mobility. Critical race theory isn't even about race, it's about Marxism. They talk about destroying our history, pulling down our monuments. That's Marxist model, and I go on and on about it in the book. But here's the problem, we have three books now that are hit jobs on Donald Trump. One is written by two \"Washington Post\" reporters who are getting a lot of press today, here and elsewhere. One is written by \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter. Another is written by the usual hit man, this guy Michael Wolff. And so, people are focused on, what did he say? And what's the gossip? And what did Milley say? You know what? It's time we the American people galvanize and organize and confront the threats that face us and stop facing shiny objects that the media and these reporters put out as they make a fortune trashing this country. I don't care what this jerk Milley had to say. I care what's going on in our classrooms, I care what's going on at our border, I care what's happening to our economy. Now, what do we do about it? I spent six chapters in this book explaining who the enemy is, explaining where they come from, explaining their scholarship, explaining how they got to where they are today, because we need to understand not political opposition, not our adversaries, but who are enemies are who want to destroy the minds of our children and destroy our way of life. That's number one. The number two, we talk on and on and on, but what the hell are we going to do about all of this? And so, that's why in the last chapter, which is 10,000 words, I put out what I think is a game plan. We need to empower ourselves. There is power in numbers. We have the resources. We own these damn colleges. They're subsidized by mostly our state tax dollars. We own every piece of what's going on in our public schools, and yet we can't get into public schools to find out what's going on? What's that all about? Green New Deal, where we have a president of the United States that just issues executive orders like he's Benito Mussolini and tells us how to live our lives, where did that power come from? We need to become more litigious. We need to use the FOIA laws. We need to file complaints with the Internal Revenue Service. We need to show up at shareholder meetings and corporations. We need to show up en masse at public events, including school board meetings. We need to claw back money from these colleges and universities. There's a lot we can do, and it's about damn time we focus on it. I can talk about General Milley until I'm blue in the face. That doesn't solve a thing. These three Trump trashing books from the media, you know why we hate the media? Because they deserve it. You know why we hate \"The New York Times\"? Because it deserves that, as I explained in my book. \"The New York Times\" was a mouthpiece for Stalin in 1932 with their Walter Duranty in Moscow when he was slaughtering Ukrainians. \"The New York Times\" covered up the Holocaust. Their man at Berlin was friendly to he Nazi regime. \"New York Times:\" is responsible for Fidel Castro and that awful regime that's there, about the reporter Matthews and so forth. It is a horrendous poisonous corporation. Forget about media, corporation. This is what we need to focus on. We cannot allow this corrupt media to push this country where it's pushing it. And notice, there's not a dime's worth of difference between most of the media in this country and where these American Marxist movements stand, whether it's BLM, whether it's the Green New Deal. They stand for these movements. They stand for this party. Well, we have to stand for ourselves. Nobody's going to save us, not the Republican Party If you love this country, whether you're a moderate Democrat, whether you're libertarian, if you love this country, let us put our differences aside. Let us embrace and empower our numbers, and our wealth, and let us begin piece by piece clawing back, because we are in the abyss. We're not looking into the abyss, we are there. And if we don't do something about it, they will win, and we will lose. That's it."

In fact, if that takes place, we'll go right to it. Switching gears now. Like we told you earlier this week, California, the recall race out there is getting more interesting by the minute. Larry Elder has entered the race, along with Caitlyn Jenner and several others. Failed Governor Gavin Newsom is building a war chest from far left Silicon Valley and Hollywood donors to try to stave off defeat and the recall and get this! Newsom and the Democrats have approved direct cash payments for Californians, including illegal immigrants. And, by the way, there's also a proposal for universal basic income, guaranteed income. And we're also learning that L.A. County is reinstituting the mask mandate regardless of either whether or not you're vaccinated. What happened to follow the science? Now, perhaps the name most talked about to run against Newsom and to jump is former acting director of national intelligence, Ric Grenell. He tells us he has made his decision on whether to enter the race. Ric, yea or nay. You haven't given me even the slightest hint and I've tried hard numerous times."

I want to be available to push forward this America First agenda. It's the very important agenda I think now more than ever. And two, I think the first thing that needs to be done in California is a structural change. We need to be able to push forward this massive structural change in the state because we are headed in the wrong direction and I think that's going to take many years and it's going to take a couple of different things to do. I've started this 501c4 which I've talked to you about before, called Fix California. We just launched with our lawyer a campaign. We've gone to 26 counties in California to put them on notice that either they clean up their voter rolls or we will see them in court. We put them on notice, given them a couple weeks to make that decision, and there's massive other structural changes that we want to do. I see the need to do that first."

I mean, look what we are giving away and the whole state is going to socialism. So, we're tired of it and now is a time to begin that long fix California measure.
