      "sentences": "This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are following several major, huge breaking news stories tonight. Now, the White House shakeup -- Anthony Scaramucci is out as the White House communications director. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, President Trump and members of his administration are now turning up the heat, finally, on congressional Republicans after the Senate failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare -- of course, a seven-year promise. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then after another North Korean ICBM test, the commander-in-chief -- he is promising you, the American people, to handle this growing threat from this rogue regime in Pyongyang. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee -- they are now finally -- we've been calling for this for months. They are now calling for a special counsel to investigate the massive scandals surrounding Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Loretta Lynch. Also, an explosive new report on the Obama administration loosening rules to make it easier to unmask members of Congress. Wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, all of that and also much more. We have breaking news in tonight's important \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, Anthony Scaramucci has resigned as the White House communications director. General John Kelly is sworn in as the new White House chief of staff. Eric Trump will be joining us tonight with reaction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, after last week's epic failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, President Trump is, yes, rightly pressuring Republicans to keep to their seven-year promise to you, the American people. They are desperate for the promise to be fulfilled. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, over the weekend, the commander-in-chief -- he tweeted out, quote, \"If a new health care bill is not approved quickly, bail-outs for insurance companies and bail-outs for members of Congress will end very soon.\" Now, the president also added, quote, \"Unless the Republican senators are total quitters, repeal and replace is not dead. Demand another vote before voting on any other bill.\" Republicans appear now to be throwing in the towel on repealing ObamaCare. The president -- he is 100 percent committed to hold their feet to the fire, and so are we here on this show. And now, after losing a very close vote -- because why? Senator John McCain, he joined the obstructionist Democrats -- Republicans are apparently what, ready to give up? I'm sorry. There's no excuse. It's pathetic, inexcusable. And it proves that we now have a Republican Party that is not only spineless and gutless and lacking leadership and unity -- what do they stand for? What is their identify? They don't have one! Republicans in Congress, you have a choice to make. You can keep your word and start doing your job and passing bills and keeping promises, repeal and replace ObamaCare, or literally, keep making excuses why you can't implement the president's agenda and your agenda. Guess what will happen? You will risk losing the House and Senate in 2018. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So in case you care, my message to you lazy people in D.C. is stop the vacations, get to work, because when you fail, it's the American people, the forgotten men and women in this country, who end up suffering. You're supposed to serve them, in case you forgot you're public servants. Also tonight, America faces a growing threat from North Korea. The Trump administration is now vowing to take action. On Friday, the rogue regime conducted yet another ICBM test, which Fox News has, in fact, learned is the longest missile test in the history of North Korea. And then over the weekend, the U.S. military, they conducted a successful THAAD antiballistic missile test that was over the Pacific Ocean to send a message back. And earlier today during a Cabinet meeting, President Trump says his administration will handle North Korea. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And this comes after the president called on China to step up and do more to stop Pyongyang's aggressive behavior. The Japan prime minister is now saying that he and President Trump -- they have agreed to take action against North Korea, which is desperately needed. And the president is now facing an increasingly difficult situation here. There's no good answer to this situation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the reason why -- and you will never hear this from the media -- it goes back decades to the Clinton administration. Now, you won't learn this from the media, but back in 1994, then-President Bill Clinton and his administration, they struck a deal with Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, where according to The New York Times the U.S. at the time agreed to give North Korea over $4 billion taxpayer in energy aid over the course of a decade. In exchange, North Korea was going to a freeze and eventually end their nuclear weapons program. And as a part of the deal, North Korea would allow inspectors into its nuclear sites. But this is the important part. Remember, think Iran, because it's like Iran redux here. They would also be allowed to keep their nuclear fuel rods, which could be used to make weapons for an unspecified number of years. Bill Clinton, well, he put those fears aside, gave them the money, your money, and praised this really dumb agreement which they never kept. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Well, it wasn't a good deal for the American people, and Clinton ended up eating words, because in 1998, North Korea test-fired a long-range missile. By 2006, North Korea had conducted its first nuclear test, and under the Obama administration, the North Korean threat grew rapidly. He did nothing about it, either. It turned into the growing crisis that now the president is facing. No great solution. As for the fourth major story tonight on our agenda, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, they have sent a letter to the Department of Justice -- finally. They're calling for a special counsel to be appointed -- finally -- this time to investigate major scandals with real evidence surrounding Hillary Clinton, James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It's about time they did this, used their authority of subpoena power to restore law in the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Guess what? We need equal justice under the law. Now, we've been telling you this for months on the program. There is a massive double standard when it comes to investigating scandals, in this case, that involve Democrats. And the Republicans are in charge. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, these are scandals that, of course, the destroy Trump establishment media -- they just routinely ignore despite mountains and mountains of evidence. There's Hillary Clinton, her mishandling of top secret, classified, special access program information on a private email server in a mom and pop shop bathroom. We also know that Clinton deleted -- imagine if Donald Trump deleted 33,000 emails -- and acid washed her computers with BleachBit and then smashed mobile devices with a hammer the way she did. And then, of course, her lawyers did turn over BlackBerrys to the FBI, but guess what? They didn't have SIM cards. Then there's the real Russia collusion story, the Uranium One deal, which I predict will be the biggest news to come out in the next year or two, where the secretary of state -- remember? -- she approved handing over up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons, to Vladimir Putin and the Russians, all while people involved in the deal in Canada, they kicked back over $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. Then you got James Comey testifying under oath. He had a friend leaking comments to the New York Times, some of which were classified, we're told, government information. He's not allowed to do it. Well, that could be a crime also. Comey may have violated the law. Those were -- that was government property, and that could be a violation of the Espionage Act. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, Comey admitted before Congress, yes, the former Attorney General Loretta, Lynch pressured him not to tell the truth, that the Clinton email investigation was an investigation. Well, she wanted to call it a matter, and he ended up listening! if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as for Lynch, just days before Comey's announcement that let Hillary off the hook, she met Bill Clinton for 40 minutes at an airport tarmac. Conflict of interest? And of course, there's the group behind the fake news anti-Trump dossier. It's about the hookers in Russia that turned out not to be true, Fusion GPS. Well, who was paying for that hit piece? Who were they tied to because they had ties to Russia! And as we've been saying for months, the evidence is overwhelming, staggering and incontrovertible, and the Justice Department needs to do the right thing, appoint a special counsel, get to the bottom of all of these scandals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, finally tonight, a stunning report from our friend John Solomon at The Hill about how former Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, made it much easier to unmask members of Congress. Really? And their staffers? Well, that opens the floodgates for Fourth Amendment privacy violations. With reaction, from The Hill, John Solomon himself, conservative commentator Monica Crowley. OK, so really? We have the former director of national intelligence, then we have the issue of Susan Rice, then we learn from your friend Sara Carter that the general counsel of the FBI is being investigated for also leaking intelligence information. Why is this unmasking story by Clapper so important? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They said the Congress and the executive branch and the judiciary were supposed to be independent coequals. And if the executive branch could on its own begin unmasking information about members of Congress, it opens the door for them to spy on things that are being said about them, or things that they themselves were talking about when they were intercepted overseas. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think the standard in (ph) change (ph) -- back in 1992, CIA director for George H.W. Bush Bob Gates -- he put out a standard that made unmasking a last resort. You'd only unmask a member of Congress if there was no other way to get foreign intelligence. James Clapper, and maybe leading up to the point where James Clapper issued this memo, there may have been some changes, change it to a standard of convenience, which is if it helps you to understand a report, you can unmask a member of Congress. Privacy issue and a separation of powers issue, I think.",

      "utterance": "This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are following several major, huge breaking news stories tonight. Now, the White House shakeup -- Anthony Scaramucci is out as the White House communications director. Also, President Trump and members of his administration are now turning up the heat, finally, on congressional Republicans after the Senate failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare -- of course, a seven-year promise. And then after another North Korean ICBM test, the commander-in-chief -- he is promising you, the American people, to handle this growing threat from this rogue regime in Pyongyang. And Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee -- they are now finally -- we've been calling for this for months. They are now calling for a special counsel to investigate the massive scandals surrounding Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Loretta Lynch. Also, an explosive new report on the Obama administration loosening rules to make it easier to unmask members of Congress. Wow. Now, all of that and also much more. We have breaking news in tonight's important \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, Anthony Scaramucci has resigned as the White House communications director. General John Kelly is sworn in as the new White House chief of staff. Eric Trump will be joining us tonight with reaction. Also tonight, after last week's epic failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare, President Trump is, yes, rightly pressuring Republicans to keep to their seven-year promise to you, the American people. They are desperate for the promise to be fulfilled. Now, over the weekend, the commander-in-chief -- he tweeted out, quote, \"If a new health care bill is not approved quickly, bail-outs for insurance companies and bail-outs for members of Congress will end very soon.\" Now, the president also added, quote, \"Unless the Republican senators are total quitters, repeal and replace is not dead. Demand another vote before voting on any other bill.\" Republicans appear now to be throwing in the towel on repealing ObamaCare. The president -- he is 100 percent committed to hold their feet to the fire, and so are we here on this show. And now, after losing a very close vote -- because why? Senator John McCain, he joined the obstructionist Democrats -- Republicans are apparently what, ready to give up? I'm sorry. There's no excuse. It's pathetic, inexcusable. And it proves that we now have a Republican Party that is not only spineless and gutless and lacking leadership and unity -- what do they stand for? What is their identify? They don't have one! Republicans in Congress, you have a choice to make. You can keep your word and start doing your job and passing bills and keeping promises, repeal and replace ObamaCare, or literally, keep making excuses why you can't implement the president's agenda and your agenda. Guess what will happen? You will risk losing the House and Senate in 2018. So in case you care, my message to you lazy people in D.C. is stop the vacations, get to work, because when you fail, it's the American people, the forgotten men and women in this country, who end up suffering. You're supposed to serve them, in case you forgot you're public servants. Also tonight, America faces a growing threat from North Korea. The Trump administration is now vowing to take action. On Friday, the rogue regime conducted yet another ICBM test, which Fox News has, in fact, learned is the longest missile test in the history of North Korea. And then over the weekend, the U.S. military, they conducted a successful THAAD antiballistic missile test that was over the Pacific Ocean to send a message back. And earlier today during a Cabinet meeting, President Trump says his administration will handle North Korea. And this comes after the president called on China to step up and do more to stop Pyongyang's aggressive behavior. The Japan prime minister is now saying that he and President Trump -- they have agreed to take action against North Korea, which is desperately needed. And the president is now facing an increasingly difficult situation here. There's no good answer to this situation. And the reason why -- and you will never hear this from the media -- it goes back decades to the Clinton administration. Now, you won't learn this from the media, but back in 1994, then-President Bill Clinton and his administration, they struck a deal with Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, where according to The New York Times the U.S. at the time agreed to give North Korea over $4 billion taxpayer in energy aid over the course of a decade. In exchange, North Korea was going to a freeze and eventually end their nuclear weapons program. And as a part of the deal, North Korea would allow inspectors into its nuclear sites. But this is the important part. Remember, think Iran, because it's like Iran redux here. They would also be allowed to keep their nuclear fuel rods, which could be used to make weapons for an unspecified number of years. Bill Clinton, well, he put those fears aside, gave them the money, your money, and praised this really dumb agreement which they never kept. Watch this."

      "utterance": "This is a good deal for the United States. North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, it wasn't a good deal for the American people, and Clinton ended up eating words, because in 1998, North Korea test-fired a long-range missile. By 2006, North Korea had conducted its first nuclear test, and under the Obama administration, the North Korean threat grew rapidly. He did nothing about it, either. It turned into the growing crisis that now the president is facing. No great solution. As for the fourth major story tonight on our agenda, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, they have sent a letter to the Department of Justice -- finally. They're calling for a special counsel to be appointed -- finally -- this time to investigate major scandals with real evidence surrounding Hillary Clinton, James Comey, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It's about time they did this, used their authority of subpoena power to restore law in the country. Guess what? We need equal justice under the law. Now, we've been telling you this for months on the program. There is a massive double standard when it comes to investigating scandals, in this case, that involve Democrats. And the Republicans are in charge. Now, these are scandals that, of course, the destroy Trump establishment media -- they just routinely ignore despite mountains and mountains of evidence. There's Hillary Clinton, her mishandling of top secret, classified, special access program information on a private email server in a mom and pop shop bathroom. We also know that Clinton deleted -- imagine if Donald Trump deleted 33,000 emails -- and acid washed her computers with BleachBit and then smashed mobile devices with a hammer the way she did. And then, of course, her lawyers did turn over BlackBerrys to the FBI, but guess what? They didn't have SIM cards. Then there's the real Russia collusion story, the Uranium One deal, which I predict will be the biggest news to come out in the next year or two, where the secretary of state -- remember? -- she approved handing over up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons, to Vladimir Putin and the Russians, all while people involved in the deal in Canada, they kicked back over $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. Then you got James Comey testifying under oath. He had a friend leaking comments to the New York Times, some of which were classified, we're told, government information. He's not allowed to do it. Well, that could be a crime also. Comey may have violated the law. Those were -- that was government property, and that could be a violation of the Espionage Act. Also, Comey admitted before Congress, yes, the former Attorney General Loretta, Lynch pressured him not to tell the truth, that the Clinton email investigation was an investigation. Well, she wanted to call it a matter, and he ended up listening! And as for Lynch, just days before Comey's announcement that let Hillary off the hook, she met Bill Clinton for 40 minutes at an airport tarmac. Conflict of interest? And of course, there's the group behind the fake news anti-Trump dossier. It's about the hookers in Russia that turned out not to be true, Fusion GPS. Well, who was paying for that hit piece? Who were they tied to because they had ties to Russia! And as we've been saying for months, the evidence is overwhelming, staggering and incontrovertible, and the Justice Department needs to do the right thing, appoint a special counsel, get to the bottom of all of these scandals. Also, finally tonight, a stunning report from our friend John Solomon at The Hill about how former Obama Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, made it much easier to unmask members of Congress. Really? And their staffers? Well, that opens the floodgates for Fourth Amendment privacy violations. With reaction, from The Hill, John Solomon himself, conservative commentator Monica Crowley. OK, so really? We have the former director of national intelligence, then we have the issue of Susan Rice, then we learn from your friend Sara Carter that the general counsel of the FBI is being investigated for also leaking intelligence information. Why is this unmasking story by Clapper so important?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Well, it goes to a very important issue, which is the founding fathers created the separation of powers, right? They said the Congress and the executive branch and the judiciary were supposed to be independent coequals. And if the executive branch could on its own begin unmasking information about members of Congress, it opens the door for them to spy on things that are being said about them, or things that they themselves were talking about when they were intercepted overseas. And I think the standard in (ph) change (ph) -- back in 1992, CIA director for George H.W. Bush Bob Gates -- he put out a standard that made unmasking a last resort. You'd only unmask a member of Congress if there was no other way to get foreign intelligence. James Clapper, and maybe leading up to the point where James Clapper issued this memo, there may have been some changes, change it to a standard of convenience, which is if it helps you to understand a report, you can unmask a member of Congress. Privacy issue and a separation of powers issue, I think."

So that's true, but that's history, and that's all changed. You look at what we've done in just the scant six months that the president has been in office, whether it's revitalizing NATO, whether it's the liberation of Mosul with our Iraqi partners or whether it's simply the -- the domestic national security successes with regard to illegal immigration. This is a results-oriented presidency, and we're going to do the same with North Korea. And please understand there's a whole palette of options. It's not a question of peace or war.

There are more intel leaks, seven times the past two administrations against your father. Then you've got obviously have Democrats, they hate him, they don't want him to have one success. And I think your comment is relevant and appropriate. Then you have got the media, which focuses in on process, palace intrigue, and Russia. Then you have weak Republicans. John McCain had promised us how many years and was so disappointing last week. And the last one is never-Trumpers. But that's a lot of forces ganging up against one guy. Is that the whole swamp?"

They would rather focus on Russia and they would rather focus on these nonsense stories than real news that people care about. And that is the sad thing for this country, it's a sad thing for democracy. It's a sad thing for the morality of this country. It is really a race to the bottom with the media these days. It's no longer who has the best journalistic integrity, who puts out the best story, what's the most meaningful story, how it affects people. It is who can publish the most sensational story that gets the most clicks on Twitter or Facebook or one of these, and it is really become a race to the bottom and there's no question it's hurting."

And coming up on this busy breaking news night, the Trump administration are not backing down from the battle to repeal and replace Obamacare. Republicans, grow up and keep your promise. Former governor Mike Huckabee is next straight ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" So Republican lawmakers in the Senate, they failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare after seven long years of promises. But the president, he is not giving up. Instead he is continuing to put pressure on Congress to make good on the promise of repeal and replace and replace it with something that actually works. Joining us now with reaction as well as the shakeup in the White House, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Governor, one thing that was missing in my mind, I've read Patient Power, Cato Institute, Musgrave, Goodman, what, 15, 20 years ago, and ever since I believed in IRA account, health savings accounts for people. I've been interviewing this guy from Wichita, Dr. Josh Umbehr, Atlas M.D., about health care cooperatives, $50 a month, unlimited care, total access to your doctor 24/7. Not one time last week when the Republicans were wetting toilet paper and throwing it against the wall with their ridiculous ideas did I hear any of these creative, free market solutions. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR",
      "utterance": "Because Washington thinks that they have to come up with a plan that is one-size-fits-all. The truth is one size will mess up all. And that is the problem whether it's Obamacare or even what the Republicans in the Senate tried to do. The smart play, read the constitution. Discover the fact that nobody in Washington has responsibility to provide health care for everybody. Send this back to the states where it belongs. I guarantee you, Sean, that there is a big difference between health care delivery in Massachusetts, where Charlie Baker is governor, and Mississippi where Phil Bryant is governor. But there is one thing in common -- both of those guys would design a plan that would work for their demographics, their constituencies, and it would be 100 times better than Washington."

      "utterance": "I agree."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "So here's the point, Sean. The problem with Washington is not that they are trying things that are too big. They are trying things that are too small. Do something big. Go constitutional. Send it back to the states. I guarantee you it could work better and it would come to innovations like you've mentioned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I'm not the biggest fan on Lindsey Graham and John McCain. But Lindsey Graham is involved in the very idea of block granting money to states, and if California wants to go single-payer, let them pay for. So do you support this as may be the final solution where you can get Murkowski and people like McCain back on board?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I would like to believe that they would be on board for the simple reason that they are going to be hard pressed to say, no, we are not for that. We don't believe the people in our home states have good sense to do it. Sean, as long as Washington is really run by the donor class and by the lobbyists, and everybody and every piece of legislation gets a carve out for their particular special interest, we are never going to see anything happen that turns out well. And what you mention, the kind of innovations, can only happen when there is a kind of freedom and liberty that's left when we do this in a constitutional manner."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Governor, I see the president, he goes out and speaks to these huge crowds, has these amazing rallies, and you see the reaction of people. Right now I look at the Republican Party without an identity. They are not saying build the wall. They can't even get a seven-year promise fulfilled and get their act together or not. We see very specific ideas from the president on energy, on the radical Islam, on building borders, the president's economic plan, middle-class tax cuts, corporate cuts, repatriation for multinational corporations. Where is the identity of the Republican Party, free-markets, capitalism, more freedom, less government intrusion, bureaucracy, where are these discussions within that party? What do they stand for at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "It is hard to say because we have seen in this last total disaster after all these years of voting to repeal Obamacare, some of the very same senators that voted to repeal it then voted to keep it, and they're Republicans. And I've heard people say, we are worried that Republicans may lose the House and the Senate. I am less worried that the Republicans will lose the House or Senate. What I would really like to see is some different Republicans keep the House and Senate, but at least go there with some Republican attitude and really have a goal to shake things up."

The longer they stay, the more attached they to the institutions of the elitist insider's game of Washington, and the less they are attached to the passions of the people they need to be serving."

When we come back, GOP lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee, finally, we have been calling for this for two months, they are talking about calling for a second special counsel to be named. Why? Investigate Lynch and Comey, and, yes, Hillary Clinton. Larry Elder, Gregg Jarrett, next."
    },

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

We have been saying this forever. Joining us with reaction, Fox News anchor, attorney Gregg Jarrett, Salem radio nationally syndicated host Larry Elder. You know I've been on this for weeks. There's nothing with Russia, nothing, but yet Ukraine, Uranium One, Hillary's emails, James Comey, we have so many other issues, Loretta Lynch. It's about time, finally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. And the Judiciary Committee wants a special counsel to look into two dozen different questions that are all very serious and could be crimes. For example, as you point out, was Hillary Clinton enriching herself by conferring benefits to a foreign government, in particular Russia? And what about Fusion GPS. Why was the FBI relying so heavily on this anti-Trump dossier that was done at the behest of a Clinton supporter? Why were they willing to pay $50,000?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Comey was going to pay that. And we have on top of that, look at where that money comes from. And Larry, you are an attorney, too. I want to know where that money came from. I want to know if that money, could it have been laundered, $145 plus million is a lot of money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST",
      "utterance": "These are, of course, very legitimate questions. This is why Donald Trump is upset. There was no special counsel in the mid-90s when hundreds of thousands of dollars were illegally donated to the DNC. The DNC, oops, gave back the money. The FBI investigated, the head of the FBI, Louis Freeh, very well respected, at least as respected as Robert Mueller is, said if there is any reason for special counsel, it is here. Janet Reno refused to do it. And then go down the list. You talked about fast and furious. The scandal with IRS and Lois Lerner, we haven't gotten to the bottom of that. And regarding Fast and Furious, as far as I know Eric Holder is the only sitting A.G. to be found in criminal contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents that Congress wanted. And the list goes on and on and on."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Could we add Debbie Wasserman Shultz's I.T. guy, and we know he was double billing and we know she kept him on for a year afterwards, and we know that there were hard drives, government hard drives smashed. What is it with Democrats and BleachBit acid washing, taking hammers to iPhones and BlackBerries, and destroying hard drives and getting away with that, because I would be in jail and calling both of you to bail me out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "And in a rational world, this sounds like an episode of Jason Bourne. You catch the I.T. guy when he is trying to leave the country at Dulles and his wife had left earlier with money and a bunch of family members on at exorbitant prices. The Democrats dumped him, and Debbie Wasserman Shultz kept him. Is he blackmailing her? Was he one of the sources for WikiLeaks? We don't know. It seemed to me that the people on the other channel would be interested in this if this were a Republican in trouble and as opposed to Debbie Wasserman Shultz."

And I'm thinking I'm paying you a lot of money for the next three years of my life to try and get me out of what is the impossible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Well, a special counsel should have been appointed about a year ago after James Comey decided not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. And the committee wants to know, and a special prosecutor to investigate, how in the world could you determine that she didn't violate the Espionage Act? How is that you determine that she wasn't enriching herself by using her office and paying her husband and her foundation benefits from Russia and banks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Why isn't the Republican Party using their power of subpoena? I know they are not using their power to legislate and keep promises. But you would think that maybe they would use their investigative authority, the fact that they run these committees, and they've allowed the narrative to be Russia, Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Now the judiciary is ready to do that now. And not just with a special investigator. They voted to launch their own investigation. And yes, that would mean subpoenas. Let's haul Hillary Clinton, James Comey, and Loretta Lynch before the committee. Samantha Power and Susan Rice, they also want to look into unmasking."
