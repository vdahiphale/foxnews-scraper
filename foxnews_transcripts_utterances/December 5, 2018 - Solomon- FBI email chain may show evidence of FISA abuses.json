The Hill's John Solomon tonight has just uncovered smoking gun new evidence of FISA abuse committed at the highest levels of James Comey's FBI including a damning e-mail chain.

They are going back to the 1600, 1700s. I'll explain. And an American hero's life was ruined over a process crime? While many top Democrats, they got away scot-free with much worse.

      "sentences": "All right. Little thing about me, I grew up in a house 50 by 100 lot, surrounded by law enforcement everywhere. My mom was a prison guard for 25 years. My father, he was a family court probation officer. Many, many cousins were on the New York police department. And my two relatives that made it to the FBI, they were considered deity. Not kidding. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But tonight, I'm shocked and frankly saddened by what is corruption and abuse of power at the very top of America's most trusted institutions. Now, breaking tonight, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon has yet -- just dropped yet another bombshell on James Comey's FBI. And according to \"The Hill\" and his report, newly unearthed e-mails show that top DOJ, FBI officials that they engaged in a willful and organized effort to defraud a FISA court judge prior to the 2016 election. Now, we have talked about this but we never had these e-mails. This all surrounds the FISA warrant application and the subsequent renewal applications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. According to those newly uncovered e-mails, we now know the basis for this warrant was the Clinton bought and paid for dirty dossier. Remember the bulk of evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, James Comey, along with other top DOJ officials and FBI officials knew the evidence presented in the dossier was shady at best. This is what Solomon has uncovered tonight. The e-mail exchanges show that the FBI were aware before they secured the now infamous warrant that there were intelligent community concerns about the reliability of the main evidence used to support it. That being the Hillary Clinton, Christopher Steele Russian dossier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And according to Solomon, the FBI was fully aware that Steele was, quote: had contacts with news media reporters before the FISA warrant was even secured. Now, remember, the FBI attempted to bolster its FISA application. Remember they used what we call circular reporting, Yahoo News. By the way, they knew the source was Christopher Steele. So, it's really just one source but they like to create the impression for the court that there is multiple sources. No, that's circular reporting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, to say recap, the FBI under President Obama, they got a warrant to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page at the height of the 2016 election. In order to achieve this feat, well, they had presented the FISA court judge with evidence that we now know that the FBI knew was sketchy and knew was not verified and they themselves had doubt about it ever being true. Now, they knew the evidence was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton, that was withheld from the FISA court judges. And the evidence was bolstered with the circular media reporting that the FBI knew Christopher Steele was behind. But, as we now know, that's not how so-called evidence was presented to the FISA court. So, tonight, the smoking gun evidence that the leadership under FBI committed a complete and total fraud on the FISA courts by presenting the court Hillary's bought and paid Russian dossier as real intelligence and they hid the fact that the other evidence was nothing more than circular reporting. They knew it all. The e-mail chain shows it all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the evidence shows a serious miscarriage of justice, a serious abuse of power. It should shock every American, especially in light of yesterday's news. And this Friday, James Comey will testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Hopefully, he will be held accountable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we did reach out to the FBI and James Comey for comment, have yet to receive a response. John Solomon will join us with more on devastating new report in a minute. But, first, we do turn to the mainstream media's obsession of the week once again featuring Robert Mueller's partisan witch-hunt and special counsel memo on Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, well, many in the press are yet again predicting an end to the Trump presidency. It's going on for two years. It hasn't happened yet. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. Despite the hysteria, predictable hysteria, you just saw the latest Mueller memo does not contain any Watergate-like revelations, not even close. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here are the facts: the Mueller memo makes references to Lieutenant General Flynn violating -- this is how deep they had to dig here -- violating the Logan Act. The Logan Act is an archaic law that was passed, get this, in 1799 and it was only responsible for two indictments in the 1800s. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, he was also allegedly been investigated for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act or FARA, as it's called, which was used only seven times since it became law in 1966. This is how -- it's all in that memo that we had last night. This is how desperate and how pathetic Robert Mueller is. Now, remember, Lieutenant General Flynn was first a victim of a crime himself because they knew nothing about General Flynn except that they illegally surveilled him, illegally unmasked him. They put aside the -- what we now call you are supposed to do mitigating. They're supposed to literally, once an American is on the line, you are not supposed to identify them. And then raw intelligence on General Flynn was leaked. And that illegally leaked information was then used against him by team Mueller. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, well, he pled guilty to a process crime. That's true. You can't get him on any underlying crimes about collusion with Russia and lying to Mueller's investigators neither Comey didn't think he lied, McCabe didn't think he lied and Peter Strzok who interviewed him, he never thought Lieutenant General Flynn was lying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He pleaded guilty only after he had legal bills that were wrecking his finances, forcing him to sell his family home, nearly going bankrupt. And in all likelihood, he was told investigators would go after his son who he did business with. So, he fell on the sword in that case. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Is that what justice in America is supposed to look like to you? What about Mr. Mueller? Are you happy about this? Is this what we get after your 567-day investigation? This guy served his country 33 years, five years in combat. According to the memo, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation but the details of that cooperation are redacted. However, the memo does detail zero evidence of collusion, none, zero once again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And while an American military hero's life has been wrecked for a process crime, we'll take a look at those on the left. Do you see those people there? Well, seemingly will never be prosecuted for their lying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin -- remember, they lied to the FBI about Hillary Clinton's private e-mail system. DOJ official Bruce Ohr or Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson likely lied. How do we know? Because they gave completely contradictory testimony. Then we have dirty dossier author Christopher Steele, he was fired from the FBI for lying. That didn't stop him from trying to work with Bruce Ohr and feed special counsel Mueller more of his phony lies in the course of this investigation. James Clapper lied under oath about the national surveillance program. So, too, did John Brennan as he also likely lied about -- under oath about leaking. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we know James Comey lied to Congress about when he wrote the report exonerating Clinton and Comey's second in command Andrew McCabe was fired because of a long pattern of lying. Don't forget Lois Lerner lied to investigators about the IRS scandal. Obama's A.G. Loretta Lynch lied about talking to anyone on the Clinton campaign about the FBI's Clinton probe. And another Obama A.G. Eric Holder lied under oath on multiple occasions. But rest assured, Robert Mueller can now sleep well at night after taking down a decorated military hero who dedicated his entire adult life to public service, 33 years serving his country, five of those years in the field of battle. Great job, Mr. Mueller. I'm sure America is feeling a lot safer tonight now that lieutenant general Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI when the FBI never thought he lied. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, later this week, by Friday, Mueller is expected to file new memos on Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort who have also been accused of violating their plea deal. Now, still the only thing in common with Flynn, Manafort and Cohen is that their cases similarly have absolutely nothing to do with Trump-Russia collusion, period. We are dealing with taxi medallions and loan applications and taxes from back in 2007. And we'll have a lot more later on the show with that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, with the details from his breaking news report is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. All right. Let's start at the beginning here. Because we have talked a lot about these issues but tonight's news is different, because we have now discovered a long e-mail chain.

One is that James Comey is involved in discussions. Two, there is mention in these e-mails that the intelligence community, possibly the NSA or another agency, had concerns about the quality of the intelligence in the Steele dossier. And, three, that there were pretty significant worries, concerns that Christopher Steele had already begun talking to the news media. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is before they filed a FISA warrant, before they fire him. If all those things are true, if the FBI had not corroborated and there were concerns about the Steele dossier, if they knew that Steele had talked to Yahoo News and then Yahoo News has used as a corroborating piece of evidence for the dossier, these are serious issues that would be misleading the court with this information by portraying it as something more solid than it is. And, you know, we learned all about this from two appearances on Fox News over the holiday week. Devin Nunes showed up on Maria Bartiromo's show and your show and he said, hey, I kind of amended my request for the declassification. No one followed up.

Ronald Reagan about this point in 1983 was at 35 percent. The fact is that Macron, the wonder boy of France, is now down to 25 or 26 percent and just had the worst riots in Paris in 50 years.

The Hill's John Solomon tonight has just uncovered smoking gun new evidence of FISA abuse committed at the highest levels of James Comey's FBI including a damning e-mail chain. Coming up, we are going to show you the damning new discoveries. Also tonight, the Mueller witch-hunt is apparently winding down. The mainstream media is praying, hard, for the bombshell that they're not getting. And in just moments, we are going to tell you everything you need to know about the special counsel's brand new report on Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. They are going back to the 1600, 1700s. I'll explain. And an American hero's life was ruined over a process crime? While many top Democrats, they got away scot-free with much worse. Tonight, we'll show you some disgusting remarks from a prominent senator we were just talking about that thinks we the people are pretty stupid. And later, we'll bring you the latest chapter in the war on Christmas -- get this -- featuring a far left pastor putting the Baby Jesus in a cage to protest President Trump. Unbelievable.

      "utterance": "All right. Little thing about me, I grew up in a house 50 by 100 lot, surrounded by law enforcement everywhere. My mom was a prison guard for 25 years. My father, he was a family court probation officer. Many, many cousins were on the New York police department. And my two relatives that made it to the FBI, they were considered deity. Not kidding. But tonight, I'm shocked and frankly saddened by what is corruption and abuse of power at the very top of America's most trusted institutions. Now, breaking tonight, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon has yet -- just dropped yet another bombshell on James Comey's FBI. And according to \"The Hill\" and his report, newly unearthed e-mails show that top DOJ, FBI officials that they engaged in a willful and organized effort to defraud a FISA court judge prior to the 2016 election. Now, we have talked about this but we never had these e-mails. This all surrounds the FISA warrant application and the subsequent renewal applications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. According to those newly uncovered e-mails, we now know the basis for this warrant was the Clinton bought and paid for dirty dossier. Remember the bulk of evidence. Now, James Comey, along with other top DOJ officials and FBI officials knew the evidence presented in the dossier was shady at best. This is what Solomon has uncovered tonight. The e-mail exchanges show that the FBI were aware before they secured the now infamous warrant that there were intelligent community concerns about the reliability of the main evidence used to support it. That being the Hillary Clinton, Christopher Steele Russian dossier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And according to Solomon, the FBI was fully aware that Steele was, quote",
      "utterance": "had contacts with news media reporters before the FISA warrant was even secured. Now, remember, the FBI attempted to bolster its FISA application. Remember they used what we call circular reporting, Yahoo News. By the way, they knew the source was Christopher Steele. So, it's really just one source but they like to create the impression for the court that there is multiple sources. No, that's circular reporting. So, to say recap, the FBI under President Obama, they got a warrant to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page at the height of the 2016 election. In order to achieve this feat, well, they had presented the FISA court judge with evidence that we now know that the FBI knew was sketchy and knew was not verified and they themselves had doubt about it ever being true. Now, they knew the evidence was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton, that was withheld from the FISA court judges. And the evidence was bolstered with the circular media reporting that the FBI knew Christopher Steele was behind. But, as we now know, that's not how so-called evidence was presented to the FISA court. So, tonight, the smoking gun evidence that the leadership under FBI committed a complete and total fraud on the FISA courts by presenting the court Hillary's bought and paid Russian dossier as real intelligence and they hid the fact that the other evidence was nothing more than circular reporting. They knew it all. The e-mail chain shows it all. Now, the evidence shows a serious miscarriage of justice, a serious abuse of power. It should shock every American, especially in light of yesterday's news. And this Friday, James Comey will testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Hopefully, he will be held accountable. Now, we did reach out to the FBI and James Comey for comment, have yet to receive a response. John Solomon will join us with more on devastating new report in a minute. But, first, we do turn to the mainstream media's obsession of the week once again featuring Robert Mueller's partisan witch-hunt and special counsel memo on Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, well, many in the press are yet again predicting an end to the Trump presidency. It's going on for two years. It hasn't happened yet. Take a look."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here are the facts",
      "utterance": "the Mueller memo makes references to Lieutenant General Flynn violating -- this is how deep they had to dig here -- violating the Logan Act. The Logan Act is an archaic law that was passed, get this, in 1799 and it was only responsible for two indictments in the 1800s. Now, he was also allegedly been investigated for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act or FARA, as it's called, which was used only seven times since it became law in 1966. This is how -- it's all in that memo that we had last night. This is how desperate and how pathetic Robert Mueller is. Now, remember, Lieutenant General Flynn was first a victim of a crime himself because they knew nothing about General Flynn except that they illegally surveilled him, illegally unmasked him. They put aside the -- what we now call you are supposed to do mitigating. They're supposed to literally, once an American is on the line, you are not supposed to identify them. And then raw intelligence on General Flynn was leaked. And that illegally leaked information was then used against him by team Mueller. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, well, he pled guilty to a process crime. That's true. You can't get him on any underlying crimes about collusion with Russia and lying to Mueller's investigators neither Comey didn't think he lied, McCabe didn't think he lied and Peter Strzok who interviewed him, he never thought Lieutenant General Flynn was lying. He pleaded guilty only after he had legal bills that were wrecking his finances, forcing him to sell his family home, nearly going bankrupt. And in all likelihood, he was told investigators would go after his son who he did business with. So, he fell on the sword in that case. Is that what justice in America is supposed to look like to you? What about Mr. Mueller? Are you happy about this? Is this what we get after your 567-day investigation? This guy served his country 33 years, five years in combat. According to the memo, Flynn agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation but the details of that cooperation are redacted. However, the memo does detail zero evidence of collusion, none, zero once again. And while an American military hero's life has been wrecked for a process crime, we'll take a look at those on the left. Do you see those people there? Well, seemingly will never be prosecuted for their lying. Longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin -- remember, they lied to the FBI about Hillary Clinton's private e-mail system. DOJ official Bruce Ohr or Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson likely lied. How do we know? Because they gave completely contradictory testimony. Then we have dirty dossier author Christopher Steele, he was fired from the FBI for lying. That didn't stop him from trying to work with Bruce Ohr and feed special counsel Mueller more of his phony lies in the course of this investigation. James Clapper lied under oath about the national surveillance program. So, too, did John Brennan as he also likely lied about -- under oath about leaking. And we know James Comey lied to Congress about when he wrote the report exonerating Clinton and Comey's second in command Andrew McCabe was fired because of a long pattern of lying. Don't forget Lois Lerner lied to investigators about the IRS scandal. Obama's A.G. Loretta Lynch lied about talking to anyone on the Clinton campaign about the FBI's Clinton probe. And another Obama A.G. Eric Holder lied under oath on multiple occasions. But rest assured, Robert Mueller can now sleep well at night after taking down a decorated military hero who dedicated his entire adult life to public service, 33 years serving his country, five of those years in the field of battle. Great job, Mr. Mueller. I'm sure America is feeling a lot safer tonight now that lieutenant general Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI when the FBI never thought he lied. Now, later this week, by Friday, Mueller is expected to file new memos on Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort who have also been accused of violating their plea deal. Now, still the only thing in common with Flynn, Manafort and Cohen is that their cases similarly have absolutely nothing to do with Trump-Russia collusion, period. We are dealing with taxi medallions and loan applications and taxes from back in 2007. And we'll have a lot more later on the show with that. But, first, with the details from his breaking news report is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. All right. Let's start at the beginning here. Because we have talked a lot about these issues but tonight's news is different, because we have now discovered a long e-mail chain. Is that a proper way to characterize it?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm told that James Comey is one of them, that there are people from the national security division of the Justice Department and that there are key players that were the obvious people involved in the FBI. I don't have their names, working at various points on the Russia investigation. So, it's a large group of people trying to get ready to get this FISA warrant submitted to the court and there are two or three very important revelations. One is that James Comey is involved in discussions. Two, there is mention in these e-mails that the intelligence community, possibly the NSA or another agency, had concerns about the quality of the intelligence in the Steele dossier. And, three, that there were pretty significant worries, concerns that Christopher Steele had already begun talking to the news media. This is before they filed a FISA warrant, before they fire him. If all those things are true, if the FBI had not corroborated and there were concerns about the Steele dossier, if they knew that Steele had talked to Yahoo News and then Yahoo News has used as a corroborating piece of evidence for the dossier, these are serious issues that would be misleading the court with this information by portraying it as something more solid than it is. And, you know, we learned all about this from two appearances on Fox News over the holiday week. Devin Nunes showed up on Maria Bartiromo's show and your show and he said, hey, I kind of amended my request for the declassification. No one followed up. So, we started of requesting questions and we followed up there is e-mail trail and it may be some of the more damning and belated produced evidence that may suggest wrongdoing at the FBI."

I can tell you people who have seen it or been involved with that e-mail say directly it's amongst the most damning evidence of wrongdoing by the FBI. If those people see it, and if Devin Nunes thought it was important to bother the evidence and ask him to declassify this among the other documents, I think we should assume it's a very important piece of evidence."

The core evidence for the FISA warrant, that's Andy McCabe's description. Without it, we would not have pursued the FISA warrant, came from a product paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party to try to destroy Donald Trump in the final months of the election. We know that the people who handle that evidence prepared and tried to rush it through the FBI to the court were two agents who on their own said they wanted to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. We know the person who created the dossier doesn't stand by it. He says he knew it was uncorroborated intelligence when he submitted it and he himself despise Donald Trump. And despite all that, and now the NSA or some other intelligence community agency having concerns about the dossier, and the FBI knowing the journalists they were going to use corroborating --"

He is fearful and his lawyers are fearful if he releases the documents before then, he will be accused of tampering or trying to sway the investigation at the last minute. It's on a wind down. Let it wind down is what the president and his lawyers I think are thinking, according to my reporting. And then we can he have this debate about how this thing originated and all the flaws that occurred and try to make sure it doesn't happen again to some other person in the future. I think that's the process he is following."

When you read this thing on General Flynn, we find out, OK, that there are only two known instances in which individuals have been indicted for violating the Logan Act, the last of which came at 1853. And neither indictment resulted in conviction. And the other one is mentioned is the FARA law and we know that the DOJ issued a report that tallied all the prosecutions under FARA since 1966. That would be seven cases with one conviction. Is this how deep we go to get a guy that served 33 years in the military, that the FBI didn't believe was lying?"

He brought on a team, all of them dedicated to destroying Trump. They have done everything they could to destroy Trump. And part of that technique, which, frankly, Sidney Powell described brilliantly in her book, \"License to Lie\", about the Justice Department. Part of that technique is you throw the kitchen sink. You basically threaten somebody and say I'm going to bankrupt you, I'm going to put your son in jail, I am going to charge with you so many different crimes you will never get out from under it. Now would you like to talk? And when you have the full power of the federal government against you, it's pretty tough not to try to find a way to get him off your back. It has nothing to do with the truth. It has nothing to do with justice. And, Mueller, I think, in a really sad -- historians some day will comment that this was one of the most extraordinary efforts to undo the will of the American people by an established bureaucracy and its establishment friends that we have seen in all of American history. I want to make one point just to put this in context. Donald Trump after 92 percent negative coverage for two years, 92 percent negative coverage for two years is somewhere between 44 and 48 percent approval, depending on the poll. Ronald Reagan about this point in 1983 was at 35 percent. The fact is that Macron, the wonder boy of France, is now down to 25 or 26 percent and just had the worst riots in Paris in 50 years. So, the whole notion that Mueller is now the person who is going to go out and save America by destroying the president, I think is an anti-constitutional effort by the organized left."

And as we previously reported on this show, congresswoman, there she is, Pramila Jayapal, who participates in the writing of the nation's laws -- well, she went and met the caravan, met up with them in Tijuana and escorted several migrants across the country. Isn't that nice of them? And joining us now, FOX News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, let me just read this to you a little bit here. We talked about family separation and all the issues involving immigration, well, number one, we have a study that shows $70,000 per year the American taxpayer pays for every illegal immigrant. We have also 63 percent of illegal immigrants get some form of government assistance. But look at this one case. Here we have, you know, a guy that had been deported eight times now commits a murder with a guy he works with at a creamery. Geraldo, you get so worked up. I want a wall. I want to vet people.

It won't solve the problem particularly of the drug cartels and the professional criminals, but it will stop some of the kind of chaos that we have seen recently with the migrant caravan. All I am asking is for compassion for the youngsters brought here at a tender age by their parents through no fault of their own. If the president can win the wall, the Congress funding of the $5 billion down payment for the wall, then I think the Democrats in Congress, it is incumbent on them to compromise if they want the Dreamers to get the pathway to citizenship.

And you are right, Sean, this is a season of anticipation. And there actually is, it's advent. And it's actually the waiting for Santa and that anticipation actually has very deep cultural and religious significance for myself, for you, and for many other Americans. And what I think is interesting is Dr. Johnson is clearly an atheist. And so many times people who come from that secular point of view are calling for tolerance and open-mindedness and respect for so many things, and yet they can't seem to find that for Christian traditions and beliefs. And that's really what this is about."
