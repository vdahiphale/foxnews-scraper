If it's the latter, I think Rand Paul would be happy to have that debate face to face any day of the week. If anyone is on the fringe here, it's McCain and Graham. Both men made a big mistake with their drive-by hits on Rand Paul. It is all but certain that Senator Graham will face a serious primary challenger in 2014. And I bet his first campaign commercial will go something like this: \"I stood with Rand, while Senator Graham dined with Obama.\" And that's \"The Memo.\"",
