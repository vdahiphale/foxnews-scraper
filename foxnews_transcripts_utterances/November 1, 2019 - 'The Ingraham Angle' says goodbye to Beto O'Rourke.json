In a way this is actually riveting only accurate description because this whole thing, just like the Mueller report, by the way, it is staged, Trumped up if you will.

We will have a full recap and analysis with Mercedes Schlapp, Gregg Jarrett, and Tom Bevan in moments. But first, the Democrats want you to know they are not gloating over that impeachment resolution vote. Yesterday, I just want you all to understand, was a very solemn day. OK America?

And at this point, I take Pelosi and her Democrat lapdogs about as seriously as they take the political announcements of Stephen Colbert whom I haven't watched him in any great length since he left comedy central when he was actually funny. Look, we have very serious issues facing the country. We had this trade issue with China ongoing, the national debt, immigration, health care costs, prescription drugs, still problems with our schools, given all that, why are Democrats so laser focused on this farce of an impeachment about Ukraine? For the answer, look no further than then today's unreal, amazing jobs numbers. 128,000 jobs are created in October, almost doubling expectations. The DOW was up 300 points to close just 12 points shy of it all time high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ both closed at a fresh all-time high. By the way, this is all coming despite the dire predictions of the experts. We should just do a whole show called the experts and completely run all of their old comments because they have spent the past few months, really in the past year, predicting, hoping, praying for an economic downturn."

Pelosi isn't flinching telling \"Bloomberg\" today there is, I should say, a mountain of concerns to be brought up. A mountain of concerns? Meanwhile our biggest economic rivals themselves are sinking into recession. Germany is already basically there. Italy is expected to have zero economic growth this year and China's economy is taking a nosedive with its GDP growth at its lowest level in decades. While they are all stumbling, our economy under Trump, even with the Mueller thing and now it is impeachment stuff hanging over his head is the envy of the world. With no counterargument, Democrats are reviving the Mueller road-show and it closed out of town to allow reviews a few months back, as I recall.

Then of course we had the impeachment drama during the week, the resolution, but then you end with these numbers that all of these experts said weren't possible. You have the GM strike you have all of this other uncertainty because of this cloud hanging over the President, how big was it? MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISER: You know it was a monumental week for the President. I mean, he used to talk about the foreign policy success of taking down Baghdadi and then leading towards these economic numbers just alone, African-Americans are seeing record low unemployment for African-Americans also for Hispanics as well.

I'm not sure she's any better off now that she's put out a plan of how she's going to pay for it? She talked about cutting defense spending, reforming immigration, all of these things and the price tag is enormous and she's already taking heat again from the centrist Democrats that are running, let alone what Donald Trump would do in a general election if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee. So it's a problem for her, it's a problem for all Democrats because they - this is where the party is.

It is an economic and financial impossibility to achieve what is truly the price tag of $52 trillion. The worst part of it is she just dismissed the fact, after admitting that 2 million jobs would be lost - that's just part of the cost of the pan. I would like to see her say that to the 2 million people who would receive pink slips if she's President and the millions more who are depending on those wage earners. She is indifferent to all of this and frankly, I think she's just ignorant of the math. Her only background is a professor of bankruptcy. Well, she will need that because she will bankrupt the nation."

Gregg, I want you to stay for a moment and a new report just coming out that talk between the whistleblowers lawyers and Adam Schiff staff has ground to a halt. Whistleblower Attorney Mark Zayed telling \"The Washington Examiner,\" we remain committed to cooperating with any Congressional Oversight Committee's request so long as it properly protects and ensures the anonymity of our clients. Gregg, is it Schiff who is pushing for the whistleblower not to testify and who says the whistleblower - I don't even necessarily believe it's a whistleblower, deserves anonymity? That's not what the statute says."

Intelligence activity and a member of the Intelligence Committee, and Trump isn't and that was a diplomatic conversation, not Intel discussion and so he doesn't qualify for protection under the whistleblower statute but he's being hidden because he would reveal the conversations between himself and Schiff and the staff, which Schiff lied about."

Now when it goes public, again, I think most people have actually taken sides. It's already gotten so down in the weeds, we've got a new name, new list of folks that are testifying behind closed doors, the public can't really keep up with what's going on and a lot of folks have already chosen sides on this and to your point Laura, if you go to any one of these states, impeachment is not at the top of the list."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The media, they are not even bothering to try to hide their impeachment cheerleading at this point. This is an actual headline from today's \"Washington Post\". Adam Schiff once wanted to be a screenwriter. Can he give the Trump presidency a Hollywood ending? Can you believe that? It's nice going, Jeff Bezos. Democrats and the media think everything is like a movie and they believe the fictional alternative universe of Tinsel Town is actually reality. Joining me now, Charlie Kirk, Founder and President of Turning Point USA and Dinesh D'Souza Conservative Author and an actual filmmaker. Dinesh, is this just hype for like an Amazon series on the superhero Adam Schiff who saves us from a corrupt sitting President or are they just really that out of touch with reality? It actually read like a parody, worse than Adam Schiff's parody. DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMAKER: Well, I think, ironically, that this notion of Adam Schiff as a kind of fictional screenwriter and director as somebody who has concocted a narrative, as somebody who has in a way set up action, is trying to direct it, is trying to stage the witnesses, choreograph a kind of climatic conclusion. In a way this is actually riveting only accurate description because this whole thing, just like the Mueller report, by the way, it is staged, Trumped up if you will. What they have done is Schiff was collaborating of course with the whistleblower. So in a sense he's sort of like an actor who is himself part of the plot except he has kept himself off stage so people can see what was discussed beforehand. So the whole thing yes it is staged, yes it is fiction. It might be reverting but it's also fake news."

      "utterance": "Pretty extraordinary. When you are writing a crime novel or a crime film, there's something called plotting backwards where you start with the villain, you start with a crime, and you work backwards. It seems like Schiff did this when it came to the whistleblower and it came to this entire narrative of Ukraine. He started with we want Donald Trump to be removed as President of the United States and then seems he went through whatever actions I took to try to make that happen, meeting with the whistleblower, lying about it, changing the whistleblower rules which actually wouldn't be defined as a whistleblower, as Gregg Jarrett previously mentioned. And we have to point out, that \"The Washington Post,\" 19 minutes after this President was sworn in, 19 minutes, after he was sworn in they said the case for impeaching Donald Trump begins. This is a premeditative impeachment. And Adam Schiff, I think he might have missed his calling a Hollywood but he still drumming up fake fictional stories and as Dinesh accurately pointed out not only is he making the stories, he's part of this sort of inner espionage against a dually elected President."

We don't need a fellow in a uniform to tell us how he felt about it and how he was grieved about it and troubled about it because we know what was actually said up on the call.

Why are the Democrats going all in a year out from a presidential election? Probably because their record is one of ruin, chaos, and, frankly, violence to our financial markets, financial upheaval. Look at the Democrat dominated California, where shoplifting and theft now are exploding. Five years ago the state passed prop 47. That downgraded any theft below $950 from a felony to a misdemeanor. Well, this, together with selective enforcement that focuses more on violent crimes, has resulted in thieves running amok. And it's feeding the state's homelessness crisis, and a lot more."

It was about saying that we were going to downgraded felonies stealing and make it about just basically being a misdemeanor. OK, so you are seeing that property is up because it was about property in the first place. What you're saying to people is that if you still up to $950 from someone, no one is going to show up, the police are not going to show up because it's been downgraded to a misdemeanor. This is awful. I mean, $950 it a lot of money, Leo. You cannot deny that, and now you are saying that is totally unrelated, violent crimes are down. Prop 47 had nothing to do with violent crimes."
