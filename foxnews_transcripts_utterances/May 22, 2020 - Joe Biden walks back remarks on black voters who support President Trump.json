You know, the more that he gets into the situations where he asked to talk about what he's for and what he plans to do, he constantly just falls back on his record rather than looking at the future and providing a platform for a modern era. So, he is still fighting that. But his comments came off, as he, you know, clearly described just now as taking for granted the African American vote as Democrats have done for years. And it's really interesting to watch this cultural shift that's been happening in the past couple years under President Trump where you had people like Kanye West and Sean Diddy Combs coming out and saying, look, our votes are not for free and we haven't seen results from the people we've been voting for in the Democratic Party for decades now and we want to see some change here. So, Joe Biden assumes based on skin color that you should vote for a certain party in a certain way, which, if the shoe was on the other foot and a Republican said it, it would be headline news in the front of every single show, every single newspaper and every single Republican would be asked about it. But instead, Joe Biden will apologize for it and the media will move on."

I thought his apology was pretty good and when I watch the segment in context, I saw two people enjoying each other's company. And so, he got a little bit too comfortable.

I'm done with that. Joe Biden has a history of stepping on his own tongue. He was the put you all back in chains guy. You can't go into a 7-Eleven without a slight Indian accent guy. He was the one astonished that Barack Obama took a shower, that he was clean. I don't understand why that shocked him. I couldn't get. He's the first clean African American kid? What did that even mean? Even explaining it now was cringeworthy. All of us were like, I don't know what he meant. Because you don't, because you don't think like Joe Biden. And let me say as well, the Democrat Party in general they've gotten a pass for 50 years from the media. They have been on the wrong side of right with the black community forever and the media has told them otherwise. The school choice issue, the jobs issue, they've driven Baltimore, Cleveland where I believe Geraldo, you have a relationship, of long relationship. But Cleveland, St. Louis. They've driven these places into the ground and I'm just wondering again, why we are supposed to take this fictitious high road here, because they are not going to extend those same courtesies to us ever."

And the information at the time I think showed that it worked. And also, if you look at how America came together and did what the public officials asked us to do and we socially distance and we did flatten those curves, then I have to think that he would say that it was successful. Then when he talks about going forward, would we have to shut the whole country down again, I don't -- I think we know so much more now about figuring out a way to isolate, contact trace, and deal with these things. And so, you deal with it like a hot spot, like a wildfire fighter instead of dealing with it like where you shut everything down. I just feel like we know a lot more.

There is nothing worse for a society than regulatory laws that demand enforcement by the police who really don't want to enforce them. Eric Garner, for example, died because he was selling loose cigarettes which was against the law and the cops had to enforce the law. If there wasn't a law against selling loose cigarettes, he might still be alive. So, this is the same thing that could happen again and again.

The President of the United States and why didn't they enforce that even though he says and the executive say he was wearing a mask when the cameras weren't on. It's just, I think that they completely overreacted in their enforcement of this. And as Dana said, you know, this is about the information we have the time and evolving and we get two, three months down the road here and people start looking around and going, why is it that the liquor store is open but I can't go to church? And why is it that my small business can't be open but Walmart can be open? And why is it that politicians are allowed to go to their second homes that they have but they want to keep people who are the constituents away from going to their second homes for the sake of safety or social distancing. So, when you don't move and adapt as many of these Democrats have done in the states, while you have scandals like Governor Cuomo sending thousands of elderly people back into nursing homes who then spread the disease to other people, people get pretty irritated but the government trying to throw them in jail. Especially, last point, at the beginning of this when they were releasing violent people from prison. And now they are threatening people with arrests or criminal records for not wearing a mask?

And by the way, you all media folks interested in doing the right thing, maybe you should try to do journalism once in a while before you start lecturing me about a mask. That's what I think. I think America would get up and cheer. But I'm glad he came out on the church thing. Listen, Geraldo, did the Constitution go on vacation? Did I miss that? I mean, if the Constitution only matters when at times of no stress and it doesn't matter during a crisis, then it doesn't matter at all. I mean, these lockdowns are ending and people are re-finding their big God- given rights in the Constitution because we say they are ending. The government has completely lost consent of the governed on this issue, even in liberal cities. We ended these lockdowns because people said we have had enough. The Constitution doesn't take a break. It's not a suggestion. They've done this completely wrong. And why I understand and I think the panel generally agreed by listening to your comments, in the beginning doing it while we still had some uncertainty, these prolonged lockdowns now have no science behind them at all.

Is that we are doing a terrible job in general in dealing with our elderly population. We need to upgrade and revamp the nursing home structures and facilities. Think about new ways to house people. We always talk about children are our future. Well, who gave them their damn future? It's these 80 and 90-year-olds who fought in wars who raise these people, who now some of them don't know where they are. They need care. We have so much compassion for the children. The teachers are underpaid. The kids they need. No, no, no. We are taking people who are basically containers of wisdom and we are shoving them in closets because they are in the way. So, it's not just -- you know, the pandemic did a lot of things. It's stress tests different parts of our lives. Right? We are learning about family, about medicine, about government, and we are seeing, man, we just don't treat our elderly correctly. The fact that they were able to die like that was because we weren't on the watch in general."

I find it quite disgraceful that Governor Cuomo while he is messing around with swabs with his brother on CNN, he is trying to pass the blame here for this nursing home tragic disaster in New York off to the president. He knows darn well other governors were given discretion too in nursing homes and took a completely different tack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, and one of them was the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, another, you know, a fellow Democrat of Andrew Cuomo. Now they had that terrible outbreak in that one nursing home and we all watched that as it started to unfold and that's when we really started to understand that this virus was going to be a killer. I also noted that there was this story in the New York Times this week that if Cuomo had agreed to shut down New York sooner, like the same week that Washington did, he could have stopped 80 percent of deaths in the state. So, you know, we start -- Geraldo asked me about President Trump, did he regret the lockdown? I think that this question should be posed to Andrew Cuomo. Now, he has said we didn't have the information. We didn't know. But Jay Inslee had the same information. So I don't think that is good enough. And I think that the accountability has to be there. The other thing I would say to Greg's point, and for Janice Dean. You know, I'm starting to have -- I'm at the age now where I have friends who are having to make decisions about what they can do to care for their parents. And, you know, they've got kids in college and they've got their parents maybe having to go to a retired living facility or assisted care or even in a nursing home, and the stress of thinking that your loved one is not going to be getting be taken care of, it's a lot. So I also agree with Greg on that, rethinking of how to approach this. And I don't think it's a government solution. But there has to be more accountability and possibly even, dare I say it, more regulation or at least some checks on the system."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "No. And I think it's very important to point out that the nursing homes in New York were begging Andrew Cuomo not to have this executive order. They push back as hard as they could in most cases to say we do not have the ability to bring people who are infected with COVID back into our facilities without putting others in harm's way, and Cuomo went through with it. And he can say he didn't have all the information, but at the same time that you had the Javits Center that was being built, the Mercy ship from the Navy that was sent up and had the ability to take patients, the Secretary of Defense said, we'll take COVID patients if we need to, those were not used. So at the same time that those places sat empty, Andrew Cuomo was still enforcing this executive order to send these patients back into nursing homes. And so, you know, they did what they could to push back, but the government, the hand of government was doing this. I'm very curious about whether people will vote with their feet and leave places like New York as a result of bad leadership which not just results in bad livelihoods but also in this case has been very fatal for a number of families."

Greg is right. nursing homes are disgustingly oversized. They're fat to take advantage of government entitlement programs, beginning with Medicare in 1965 They've got to shrink in size. They're horrible. They're their breeding grounds for infection. One person -- one elderly person gets sick, they all -- they all catch whatever that one got. And the other point is, you know, we have to look at Andrew Cuomo in the context of those briefings that he's been doing every single day and compare those to President Trump. I love him. But his White House briefings have been combative, they've been -- you know, he's been punching down at reporters. You know, you look at it, you say, my God, what's the president doing slugging it out with the reporters who's just trying to get face time, compare that with Cuomo's which was so orderly, you know, well done graphically. You know, the Piper will come calling for Andrew Cuomo eventually. The press is already on his case. What about putting infected people into these nursing homes? The shine will dull over time.

Fox News was amazing, so supportive, like got it everywhere. I had over 11 million views, if you can believe that. But -- well, of course, Jasper joined me. Online, Kim Strassel and her three children put together this amazing guide for all sorts of different books for different age groups for kids. It's an awesome resource for parents and children. Her -- she's so well-read. Her kids devour books. They were inspired by Storytime. So Kim Strassel was amazing for that. You can check it out at foxnews.com.

All right, with graduations not being held this year, a lot of the 2020 class of graduates are getting very creative. Take a look at Alexandra Lenczewski, a member of the 2020 class of Brooklyn Law School. She held her own little mini graduation ceremony in her backyard by taping the photos of her fellow graduates onto little sticks and putting them in the line. She made sure all of them were honored by having their bios and their photos. So it's a mini graduation but major accomplishments by the class of 2020. And we hope the economy can get back so they can get out and into the world with some employment. So congratulations to the 2020 grads."
