      "sentences": "Good to see you, Sean. Thanks so much. Welcome, everyone to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. The family feud and the DACA trap. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Members of the anti-Trump resistance are delighting in a new war of records between Steve Bannon and President Trump, which the left is hoping is going to breathe life into that flagging Mueller Russia collusion investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a soon-to-be published book about the first year of the Trump presidency, Bannon suggested that President Trump was aware of that controversial June 2016 meeting between Don Jr. and a Russian attorney at Trump Tower. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Bannon says reportedly the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these people up to his father's office is zero. By the way, it's worth noting that Bannon didn't actually join the campaign until August of 2016, two months after that meeting occurred. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As you can imagine, all of this set off a feeding frenzy in the media since Bannon's account contradicts the statements of the White House officials who have claimed that the president never was told about that meeting. Bannon goes on to characterize the Trump Tower meeting as both treasonous and unpatriotic. He predicted that Mueller's team will, quote, \"crack Don Jr. like an egg.\" The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner was also called out by Bannon. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And he said, \"You realized where this is going. This is all about money laundering. Mueller shows Senior Prosecutor Andrew Weissman first and he's a money laundering guy. Their path to blanking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner. It's as plain as the hair on your face.\" The president responded in a typically blunt statement. He said, \"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me and my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve doesn't represent my base. He's only in it for himself.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK. Here's my advice in the form of a few questions. I am kind of playing a little bit of Dr. Phil or Judge Judy here. Some questions, who does this help? Does this kind of unseemly tit-for-tat, advance the conservative populist agenda at all? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What is going through frankly both side's minds? Now, Donald Trump is the head of the Republican Party. It's not Bannon or me. It's Donald Trump. With these statements, Bannon has given credence to the worse conspiracy theories of the impeach Trump forces. Bannon probably won himself a trip to testify on Capitol Hill as well. Is that what Bannon wants? I know Steve Bannon. Is that what he wants? If there is a policy difference between Trump and Bannon, any issue or any of us with the administration, any issue, have a substantive exchange. Rally the voters to your point of view on whatever issue it happens to be. But fellows, it didn't really make sense for a high-profile advisor and his former boss to publicly attack each other when the stakes are this high. How does that make any sense? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Aren't you playing right into the hands of the Democrats and the media who are hoping for nothing more than your mutually assured destruction. Ironically, what Bannon's comments, again, if accurate, have actually done, they have created a tidal wave of establishment support for President Trump. They are rallying into his side today. Not exactly how we saw this story developing. Now on to more important matters. There was a big meeting between Congressional leaders of both parties at the White House today on a potential deal to give legal status to the 800,000 so-called Dreamers brought into the country by their parents or sent to the country on their own. It's a negotiation that is scheduled to continue tomorrow. The president will be involved tomorrow in that meeting. If you recall, Obama through an executive action, DACA, he allowed all of these people to stay and work in the country for rolling two-year periods. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You can re-up after every two-year period. In fact, in 2017, even during the Trump administration, tens of thousands of illegal Dreamers applied for and received their DACA status. So, Obama's policy lived on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last September Trump said he would end the program. Then he gave Congress six months to find their own solution, kind of smart. Trump demanded that lawmakers pass responsible immigration reform. What might that look like? Well, the president has given us a few clues already. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We must end the visa lottery. We must mandate E-verify. Hire thousands more immigration and ICE agents to enforce the law and immigration judges, by the way, and cut the number of green card recipients by half. The Dreamer nightmare is upon us. Dreamers actually will cost the American taxpayer $2.6 billion annually if Congress passes amnesty. That's according to the Congressional Budget Office, not me.

Thousands of homeless U.S. veterans on the streets tonight shivering in the cold with no one to care for them suffering from PTSD, mental illness, addiction problems and mental issues. They are out on the streets, but we are catering to the illegal immigrants. That's the priority of Congress.

The failure of Republicans to protect and secure the border cost them dearly at the ballot box for several cycles. Their perpetual efforts to cater to the violators of our laws at the expense of working citizens and legal immigrants are one of the reasons that Donald Trump got elected in the first place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, it's called America first.

That's a lot of calls. But the key people, the ten people, not one of them was willing to come on this show to discuss this critical national issue or what they have planned. What is going on behind closed doors? I'm telling you my instinct kicks in. This to me could spell trouble with a capital-t. Now on to our guests.

We have to be very careful of exposing sources and methods. But when you are at a level this high when you have got accusations on one side that the president was engaged in a conspiracy with a foreign power and accusations on the other that our law enforcement agencies were in a bad way tapping Americans, using opposition research documents to launch investigations, those are as serious an accusation as you get, and you don't trust that anymore to a commission or a special counsel.

      "utterance": "Good to see you, Sean. Thanks so much. Welcome, everyone to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. The family feud and the DACA trap. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Members of the anti-Trump resistance are delighting in a new war of records between Steve Bannon and President Trump, which the left is hoping is going to breathe life into that flagging Mueller Russia collusion investigation. In a soon-to-be published book about the first year of the Trump presidency, Bannon suggested that President Trump was aware of that controversial June 2016 meeting between Don Jr. and a Russian attorney at Trump Tower. Bannon says reportedly the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these people up to his father's office is zero. By the way, it's worth noting that Bannon didn't actually join the campaign until August of 2016, two months after that meeting occurred. As you can imagine, all of this set off a feeding frenzy in the media since Bannon's account contradicts the statements of the White House officials who have claimed that the president never was told about that meeting. Bannon goes on to characterize the Trump Tower meeting as both treasonous and unpatriotic. He predicted that Mueller's team will, quote, \"crack Don Jr. like an egg.\" The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner was also called out by Bannon. And he said, \"You realized where this is going. This is all about money laundering. Mueller shows Senior Prosecutor Andrew Weissman first and he's a money laundering guy. Their path to blanking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner. It's as plain as the hair on your face.\" The president responded in a typically blunt statement. He said, \"Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me and my presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve doesn't represent my base. He's only in it for himself.\" OK. Here's my advice in the form of a few questions. I am kind of playing a little bit of Dr. Phil or Judge Judy here. Some questions, who does this help? Does this kind of unseemly tit-for-tat, advance the conservative populist agenda at all? What is going through frankly both side's minds? Now, Donald Trump is the head of the Republican Party. It's not Bannon or me. It's Donald Trump. With these statements, Bannon has given credence to the worse conspiracy theories of the impeach Trump forces. Bannon probably won himself a trip to testify on Capitol Hill as well. Is that what Bannon wants? I know Steve Bannon. Is that what he wants? If there is a policy difference between Trump and Bannon, any issue or any of us with the administration, any issue, have a substantive exchange. Rally the voters to your point of view on whatever issue it happens to be. But fellows, it didn't really make sense for a high-profile advisor and his former boss to publicly attack each other when the stakes are this high. How does that make any sense? Aren't you playing right into the hands of the Democrats and the media who are hoping for nothing more than your mutually assured destruction. Ironically, what Bannon's comments, again, if accurate, have actually done, they have created a tidal wave of establishment support for President Trump. They are rallying into his side today. Not exactly how we saw this story developing. Now on to more important matters. There was a big meeting between Congressional leaders of both parties at the White House today on a potential deal to give legal status to the 800,000 so-called Dreamers brought into the country by their parents or sent to the country on their own. It's a negotiation that is scheduled to continue tomorrow. The president will be involved tomorrow in that meeting. If you recall, Obama through an executive action, DACA, he allowed all of these people to stay and work in the country for rolling two-year periods. You can re-up after every two-year period. In fact, in 2017, even during the Trump administration, tens of thousands of illegal Dreamers applied for and received their DACA status. So, Obama's policy lived on. Last September Trump said he would end the program. Then he gave Congress six months to find their own solution, kind of smart. Trump demanded that lawmakers pass responsible immigration reform. What might that look like? Well, the president has given us a few clues already."

I'm frankly concerned about any DACA deal, but if it's going to happen, we must fully fund the border wall. We must end chain migration. We must defund these sanctuary cities. We must end the visa lottery. We must mandate E-verify. Hire thousands more immigration and ICE agents to enforce the law and immigration judges, by the way, and cut the number of green card recipients by half. The Dreamer nightmare is upon us. Dreamers actually will cost the American taxpayer $2.6 billion annually if Congress passes amnesty. That's according to the Congressional Budget Office, not me. More unaccompanied alien children are coming across now today. Why are the numbers going up? Because Congress is flirting with granting citizenship to Dreamers. All of the benefits of health care, education and housing so foreigners see the green light here. According to the last two months of available stats, we have seen a surge -- 7,000 unaccompanied children have crossed the border. They can't be deported to their home country under current U.S. law. They get to stay here. They are detained and released into the U.S., becoming our responsibility, the U.S. taxpayer's responsibility. Given that we -- just think about this is just one metric. Thousands of homeless U.S. veterans on the streets tonight shivering in the cold with no one to care for them suffering from PTSD, mental illness, addiction problems and mental issues. They are out on the streets, but we are catering to the illegal immigrants. That's the priority of Congress. This is unconscionable. In a moment, we will explain the demographic, political and cultural effects of illegal immigration that have swept and by the way, could swamp the country. The failure of Republicans to protect and secure the border cost them dearly at the ballot box for several cycles. Their perpetual efforts to cater to the violators of our laws at the expense of working citizens and legal immigrants are one of the reasons that Donald Trump got elected in the first place. Remember, it's called America first. If Republicans make some quickie deal on DACA and violate the president's promise to his base, it will be GOP last. That's the angle. By the way, an important note, we contacted ten senators who are intimately involved in the DACA negotiations today. That's a lot of calls. But the key people, the ten people, not one of them was willing to come on this show to discuss this critical national issue or what they have planned. What is going on behind closed doors? I'm telling you my instinct kicks in. This to me could spell trouble with a capital-t. Now on to our guests. Here in the studio with me in Washington, I have a trifecta, Steven Camarota, is the director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies, Harmeet Dhilon, an attorney and Republican strategist, and Jose Aristimuno is a former spokesperson for the DNC.

It's great to have you on. Different perspectives on this perhaps, but let's start with you, Anne, on this Bannon and Trump feud.

I don't think it will have any effect. It's clear that the media has no idea why Trump won. I am starting to wonder if Trump and Bannon have any idea why Trump won. The issues that Trump ran on is immigration, trade and no more wars. The trade deals are easy. No more wars ought to be easy, but it's all about immigration.

I have my reservations about Donald Trump, but I do want him to succeed. The fact in the White House Bannon alienated people and leaked and got fired for leaking when he called out of the blue a left wing-journalist, and Alabama was a debacle. Bannon is not back off.

But to date there's nothing in the public that says there's collusion. And you see the Democrats really pull back from collusion."

      "utterance": "Well, so we have been told just recently by the New York Times that it was George Papadopoulos that inspired this entire investigation, not the discredited dossier. Of course just last year the New York Times was saying that it was in fact the dossier that did it. But now that it's been discredited, now it's George Papadopoulos. So to find out that the head of intelligence says he doesn't even know this guy's name, he was not on his radar screen at the time that he was leaving office, it's another reason to be incredibly skeptical of the notion that it was some 28-year-old junior Trump staffer that somehow launched an entire FBI probe."

      "utterance": "You guys had a lot to say about CNN's promoting legalized weed as they rang in the New Year. It was so much fun. Wasn't that night fun? Many tweets expressed sympathy for our guests last night Corinne Larmarco (ph). Remember her daughter was killed by a speeding driver who was high on pot. And she shared a lot of her personal experiences. Marianne Hofer wrote \"My son starting smoking pot little by little, tried other drugs, and now he's gone because of an accidental overdose. This will not end well for many.\" Sari Treks said \"I honestly cannot imagine the grief you both suffered. My heart aches as I reach my arms around you both in comfort as a mom. Prayers for strength.\" Char 4 Trump blamed pot industry, saying \"They don't care about how much marijuana hurts people and their families. They want to make money at any cost. I personally have seen how this harmless pot has hurt loved ones and their children. If they can burn your brain cells they can control you and our country.\" But Blues Girls asked \"Do you drink booze, Laura? Alcohol is much more dangerous than pot. Soon pot will be legal in most if not all states. Deal with it. And I don't even smoke the stuff.\" Sadly she may be right about the legalization movement. It is not going to stop us from revealing what we believe is the great threat to our children, our teens, and the developing brain. We will try to bring you the truth about the research, the honest peer reviewed research that's out there. And by the way, I really like your feedback. Keep it coming on Twitter, on Facebook. You can find me @IngrahamAngle, and I really value your input. Whether you agree with me or not I do want to hear from you, so keep it coming, and we will feature it on the show. We will be right back with a chilling media habit."

What's happened to us as country? Do you want to know what tough is, or cool, really cool? It's not an egg hammer. It's 240 years ago today George Washington and his men marched 18 miles overnight in bitter cold in what became known as the battle of Princeton. They didn't have fancy north face or Patagonia parkas for the crowd. They slogged through the cold and ambushed Cornwallis' 8,000 soldiers with nothing but leather boots and a love of freedom. And it bolstered the morale of the revolutionaries. END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
