      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Another round of impeachments. Well, yes, packing the courts and a forced government shutdown. Those are just some of the little moves that the Democrats have flow to disrupt a Supreme Court justice confirmation. Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Judiciary Committee and a former Supreme Court clerk himself, is here with insight. Also, the Trump DOJ has just designated multiple American cities as anarchist's jurisdictions. Victor Davis Hanson tells us what that actually means and why it had to come to this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, how did Joe Biden kill off two-thirds of the country? Raymond Arroyo explains it in Seen and Unseen. But first, riot at the court. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For decades and decades, conservatives have been disappointed by the Supreme Court's turn from being a fairly apolitical institution that calls balls and strikes and leaves most of the big policy decisions to elected officials to an activist body pressing liberal social goals on the rest of us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, reading Miranda rights under the Constitution, that was one thing. But in 1973, everything changed with Roe v. Wade. Justice Harry Blackman and six others used the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to strike down a state law prohibiting abortion, which then took the issue away from all 50 states. And nothing has been the same since. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } More than any other that case set the precedent for the court to act as kind of a super legislature to impose a new social order on the American people. But when unelected life tenured judges ended up taking power away from the people and exercising it themselves, that created a huge fissure in America. Our framers never envisioned that a handful of unaccountable jurists would have such outsized influence. But that's exactly what happened. Now, conservatives have been patiently waiting and patiently working to repair this damage to our constitutional system, for as long as I've been alive, they've been trying. So, they've marched, they've raised money, and we've all voted for candidates who promised to restore the separation of powers to its rightful place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But often we've come up short. Too often, justices nominated by Republicans end up evolving to the Left, from William Brennan and Eisenhower nominee to Warren Burger, one of Nixon's picks to David Souter of Bush 41 fame and John Roberts, a Bush 43 appointee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In seminal cases, they abandon the principle of judicial restraint and joined the activist liberals. And one of my earliest memories as a young Reagan administration staffer was watching the Robert Bork hearings. That was back in 1987. What they did to him was vicious political blood sport, and Republicans weren't ready then to fight back. Well, a few years later, he warned about judges becoming social justice warriors.",

Those are just some of the little moves that the Democrats have flow to disrupt a Supreme Court justice confirmation. Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Judiciary Committee and a former Supreme Court clerk himself, is here with insight. Also, the Trump DOJ has just designated multiple American cities as anarchist's jurisdictions. Victor Davis Hanson tells us what that actually means and why it had to come to this. Plus, how did Joe Biden kill off two-thirds of the country? Raymond Arroyo explains it in Seen and Unseen. But first, riot at the court. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. For decades and decades, conservatives have been disappointed by the Supreme Court's turn from being a fairly apolitical institution that calls balls and strikes and leaves most of the big policy decisions to elected officials to an activist body pressing liberal social goals on the rest of us. Now, reading Miranda rights under the Constitution, that was one thing. But in 1973, everything changed with Roe v. Wade. Justice Harry Blackman and six others used the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to strike down a state law prohibiting abortion, which then took the issue away from all 50 states. And nothing has been the same since. More than any other that case set the precedent for the court to act as kind of a super legislature to impose a new social order on the American people. But when unelected life tenured judges ended up taking power away from the people and exercising it themselves, that created a huge fissure in America. Our framers never envisioned that a handful of unaccountable jurists would have such outsized influence. But that's exactly what happened. Now, conservatives have been patiently waiting and patiently working to repair this damage to our constitutional system, for as long as I've been alive, they've been trying. So, they've marched, they've raised money, and we've all voted for candidates who promised to restore the separation of powers to its rightful place. But often we've come up short. Too often, justices nominated by Republicans end up evolving to the Left, from William Brennan and Eisenhower nominee to Warren Burger, one of Nixon's picks to David Souter of Bush 41 fame and John Roberts, a Bush 43 appointee. In seminal cases, they abandon the principle of judicial restraint and joined the activist liberals. And one of my earliest memories as a young Reagan administration staffer was watching the Robert Bork hearings. That was back in 1987. What they did to him was vicious political blood sport, and Republicans weren't ready then to fight back. Well, a few years later, he warned about judges becoming social justice warriors."

Justice Kennedy was a very nice man, but he then spent decades disappointing the voters who put Reagan in office. But conservatives soldiered on within the constitutional framework. And we were told that we had to get control of our own party and then win at the ballot box to affect change at the court. Well, that's what we did. And we did it with Trump's victory in 2016. And now that we have the chance to put a fifth judicial conservative on the court, I no longer count Robert as one. Democrats are threatening to blow up the entire system, hence the title of the ANGLE, right at the court. They claim that if they win the Senate, they'll pack the court by adding new justices, expanding it.

And we predicted it here on the angle, poor Biden, he can't get control of these people. He's just an empty vessel to be filled with radical policies by radical politicians who hate our history, hate most of our traditions and hate most of our people. He's too weak to control the young Bolsheviks. He doesn't have the sharpness to redirect their efforts and now his entire party is going off the rails. The real choice in this election has nothing to do with Biden. It's a choice between President Trump and the hard Left. And this confirmation battle will show us just how crazy the other side is. Republicans are doing what they've promised to do for decades to put originalist and textualist on the court. We've never proposed packing the court or trying to add new states. Those threats are only coming from one side. The Democrat Party is no longer the party of Clinton or even of Obama, for that matter. It's the abortion party, it's AOC's party. And for that, they're willing to destroy everything we Americans built together over 244 years. One issue. Let that sink in for a moment. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Rob Leider, former Clarence Thomas clerk and George Mason University law professor. Also, with me, Harmeet Dhillon, civil rights attorney and co-chair of Lawyers for Trump.

And I always say that for conservatives to get five votes at the Supreme Court, they probably need six or seven justices to get that on any issue. So, from that end, it will present a shift. And I think the Democrats will fight with everything they have, but their tools are very limited because of some prior decisions they made in terms of breaking the filibuster. So, I do think it will - I think it will be ugly. I think it will be as ugly as the previous confirmations.

With all due respect and I disagree with Rob, I think that this confirmation is going to be nastier. It already is. And in the Kavanaugh situation, we didn't have mobs threatening violence in the streets over these issues. We didn't have picketing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's home to pressure him physically and loudly. And we did not have Senate packing. We did not have so many of the other threats that they're throwing at us. I mean, the court packing is an FDR thuggery. It's a long time ago they've been saying that. So, I think this is going to be everything on the table.

Republicans and Democrats have two totally different views on what the rule of law is. Do you, for example, follow the text and the original intention of the framing generation? Or does the Constitution evolve, and do you mix law with empathy?

That's not the Joe Biden of today, but the Joe Biden of today has the same lack of principle. His party has the same lack of principle, but now they're bringing violence. It is real. We are seeing it in every city in America.

You don't know what will happen in the election and I do think there will be legitimate concerns if the Republicans confirm somebody, were he to lose the election in terms of capability, they can do it. Justice Stevens, I think took about two weeks from nomination to confirmation. It's certainly not a problem. There's no required process in the Senate that they have to drag it out. The Senate just has to take a vote. The committee will take a vote. But how long the hearings are up to the senators.

And in 2018, they grew our majority in the Senate. And the voters had front and center the issue of what kind of justices are going to go to the court. And Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, they embrace radical leftists who want to undermine the Constitution and Bill of Rights. And President Trump promised to nominate justices in the mold of Scalia and Thomas. You mentioned my book, One Vote Away. We're actually moving the date up. It was going to come out October 6th. It's now coming out next Tuesday. And so, you can preorder it right now on Amazon. But the entire book is talking about the stakes of this election and one vote on the Supreme Court. And so, every one of our rights, whether it's free speech, we're one vote away from losing our fundamental protections on free speech, religious liberty, the right to worship according to our faith, according to our conscience. We're one vote away from losing it. And right after right after right, it comes down to the court and the president is going to make the nomination this week.

Joe Biden has been explicit that if he doesn't win on Election Day, he intends to challenge the legitimacy of this election. He's already hired a top tier team of lawyers headed by veteran Supreme Court advocates. All of us remember what happened in the 2000 election, Bush versus Gore. I was part of the legal team representing George W. Bush and Bush versus Gore. I think what we saw in Florida, in Bush versus Gore with litigation challenging the election, if Joe Biden loses, we're going to see all over the country, not just one state, but multiple states. And if the Democrats succeed in keeping this seat vacant, there would be only eight justices on the Supreme Court, eight justices. If they divide four, four, they cannot make a decision. The court has no authority divided four, four. And so, we all remember the 36 days of uncertainty, of chaos that played out in Bush versus Gore without filling this seat. This election could last weeks or months. And with the kind of chaos we're seeing that constitutional crisis I think would be incredibly unhealthy for our country."

This should be stated clearly now.\" Senator, many of us have been frustrated that more hasn't been done to protect people and places, landmarks.

That will be interesting to see."

He's telling people to vote in America, as the American Academy of Television Arts and Sciences just gave his Canadian series the Best Comedy Series Emmy. If that's not love and acceptance, I don't know what is. As you mentioned, Laura, partisanship coupled with shattering of shared TV viewing drove the Emmys to its lowest all-time rating. They're down to 5 million people, down from 7 million last year, and that was a descent. Nobody's watching any longer. It's tragic."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "You've heard of sanctuary cities, but what about anarchist jurisdictions? That's the designation of the DOJ today leveled on three Dems run cities consumed by riots and lawlessness. New York, Seattle, Portland, they could now lose federal funding if they continue to allow Antifa and Black Lives Matter's radicals to run wild. And can you blame them? \"The New York Times\" reported today that Portland protesters are storming the suburbs, including one instance where they were triggered, triggered by an American flag. Quote, according to Portland resident Terrance Moses, \"They said take it down. They wouldn't leave. They said they're going to come back and burn the house down.\" Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution senior fellow. Victor why was this designation so important, and why now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "I think Attorney General Barr is trying to do two things. First is he's trying to recreate deterrence so it stops, so we don't have these riots going all summer long, all fall long, and then endangering the election and the aftermath of the election. That's what he's worried about. But more importantly, he is trying to reestablish a principle that a citizen of Minnesota or Washington or Oregon is first a U.S. citizen, and second a state resident, and they have inherent civil rights. So what he's doing, he's looking back at the history of the old Confederacy, if you will, and he is saying just as Lincoln protected federal property in 1859, 1860 and 61, I'm going to do the same thing. But more importantly, he's looking at civil rights movement. When JFK said to, I think it was Alabama. He said, if you're not going to support free and open housing to people regardless of race, we are going to cut off HUD funding. And then they said that Alabama, I think that was LBJ in 64 said, if you do not disperse welfare funds equitably and you continue to discriminate, the federal government is not going to give you any reimbursements at all. And that was very effective. And then in addition, they looked at individuals that were crossing state lines with weapons, that were conspiring to commit riots and mayhem, and they charge them with racketeering, conspiracy --"

    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "-- weapons across lines. Yes. And it was a multifaceted way of restoring order by recreating deterrence, and it was predicated on the idea that people have inherent rights as U.S. citizens, and they are not stripped away just because they live in a particular state. And the irony of it is it was very effective, and Barr has sort of recalibrated and applied it not to segregationists but to the anarchists. And I think they are really surprised at it, because it's quite ironic."
