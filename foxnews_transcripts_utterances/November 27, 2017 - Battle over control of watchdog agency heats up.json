However, the lady on the left side of the screen, Leandra English, started this day thinking that she was still the director, appointed by the outgoing director. She was the deputy there. Mulvaney came in, essentially delivering doughnuts, saying this is my job and I'm going to that the desk and then later held a news conference saying I'm the guy."

Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of \"No Labels\" Radio on Sirius XM, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist. This was quite the thing this morning, Jonathan. It seems like the courts are getting involved here and Mulvaney probably is going to just continue as is."

So he looks to be on legally solid ground. But I think this just is, it just reveals how toxic the city has become. This is the most meaningless dispute. This is a role that is interim. The president is going to replace the person, and we are already in a lawsuit. A lawsuit starts flying after 48 hours. It's quite incredible the way this played out."

As it has been in practice it has been almost without restraint in what it can go after and the penalties that can be levied against groups that it decides needs to be levied against. Republicans have long claimed this bureau is corrupt and unaccountable and unconstitutional. And this response we are seeing from that bureaucracy and Democrats on the Hill seems to be saying that's exactly how we wanted and that's how we designed it. But in addition to the Office of Legal Counsel and the Department of Justice and the other legal opinions, there are some previous precedents showing the president does, as we know from the constitution but also the federal vacancies act shows the president does have the right to determine who should oversee the agency."

This is a force that needs clear lines drawn, clear boundaries, definitions. But Jonathan is right to the extent that it's such a needless drama because ultimately President Trump will get exactly who he wants in the position. And it was just going to be an acting job anyway. And so in that regard, it's kind of a meaningless chaos with doughnuts and a lot of excitement and a court ruling."

We will continue to fight for this nation.\" However, going on to say that they didn't want to get in the middle of any political back and forth between Senator Warrant and President Trump.

Senator Hatch, the Finance Committee Chairman, also said later on after trying to blame this on Democrats who have been shut out of the process from the start, this is really, really going to be tough. And it is because they just don't have the votes. The other thing is they are challenging themselves to another very difficult sort of corner, which is do not ultimately have a conference with the House. Basically they want to pass something by the end of the week that they can send back to the House and have the house OK because they can't handle a conference committee. There are so many provisions the Senate has that the House won't accept. So it's not that we will get a bill out of the Senate this week. The question is will there be a tax reform bill."
