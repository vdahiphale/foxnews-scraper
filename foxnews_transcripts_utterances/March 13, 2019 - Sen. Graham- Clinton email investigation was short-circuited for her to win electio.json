      "sentences": "Welcome to “Hannity.” Day two of the scandal that is now rocking the entire world of higher education. Dozens of wealthy families, business executives and yes, Hollywood celebrities caught rigging the system, paying huge crimes, fixing even SAT and ACT scores, also their little children, their precious skids to gain admission into some of America's top universities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the man at the very center of this fraud is named William \"Rick\" Singer. He is cooperating with federal authorities apparently naming names. Hours ago, \"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin appeared in court to face charges for her involvement in this scheme and was released -- get this -- on a one million-dollar bond. By the way, the same amount as R. Kelly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And she and her husband are accused of paying half a million dollars so that their two daughters could get into USC as purported crew athletes. They never were crew rowers ever. They never played once. They even went as far as to photoshop pictures. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, fellow actress Felicity Huffman was arrested at gunpoint during a raid by multiple FBI agents after she was accused of paying thousands of dollars to fake her daughter's SAT scores. And according to the University of Southern California, students who benefited from this fraud may now get kicked out of the college. But that should be the least of their worries because their parents now apparently, they will be facing up to 20 years behind bars. So far, 50 people have been charged including multiple college athletic coaches, school administrators, several SAT, ACT officials. And fraudster William \"Rick\" Singer claimed to have successfully serviced over 800 clients who paid him tens and tens of thousands on in some cases millions of dollars. Unbelievable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why? I guess for status, bragging rights, so they could tell their friends that their privilege children got into the best schools, even though in reality, their children weren't good enough academically or weren't good enough athletically. To do so, they stomped on the futures of other people. This is a zero-sum game, there's only so many spots in each school. Children who are probably not as financially will off, or kids who had to work for everything, kids who put in the time academically or athletically, talking about thousands and thousands of hours studying and training and actually earning their grades or positioned in their sport. Kids who spent all this time on and off the field to better themselves and enrich the school with their incredible athletic ability. Kids who played sports competitively. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Most kids now, they focus on one sport since about the time they are seven.

And also, thanks to the courage of Congressman Collins of Georgia, the full transport of the Lisa Page testimony, we now learned yesterday on learning more today that it was Obama's Department of Justice actually directing the FBI not to charge Hillary Clinton with the standard in the law which was gross negligence. According to Lisa Page, quote: We had multiple conversations with the Justice Department about charging gross negligence and the Justice Department's assessment was that it was both constitutionally vague, really? So that they did not actually feel they could permissibly bring that charge and they need a new standard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Congressman Radcliffe then asked, quote: You are making it sound like it was the department that told you you're not going to charge gross negligence which is in the statute because the prosecutors were telling you we are not going to. Page responded: That is correct. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's correct? That means this was ordered by the Department of Justice of Barack Obama headed by Loretta Lynch -- yes, the same attorney general at the time that met days before this decision secretly on the tarmac in Phoenix with Bill Clinton supposedly 45 minutes talking about grandchildren. This was in the final days of that investigation. The same person who asked James Comey, don't call this an investigation. We call it a matter. Really? That was an investigation. It should have been. The same person who reports directly to Barack Obama. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, we now have added a very important new component to this entire deep state issue. What did Barack Hussein Obama know and when did he know it? This now takes it straight to the former president and the Oval Office, Barack Obama. And thanks to Page, we also know the top FBI investigator, her boyfriend Strzok, viewed the investigation into Trump-Russia collusion, that was the insurance policy that we knew they talked about. And they joined the Russian investigation in order to build a case to impugn and potentially impeach the duly elected new president of the United States, assuming that all their work and the release of all those lies and all of that propaganda and the dossier they disseminated to influence the American people before the vote in 2016. The only problem here is there was collusion but it wasn't Trump-Russia collusion. According to Page, the FBI had absolutely no evidence after they started an investigation, after exonerating Hillary this investigation began in July of 2016, Trump Russia collusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, they went all the way through May of the next year. They found no evidence. This is before Bob Mueller was even appointed. They found nothing. And here we are 665 days later into what is Mueller's intensive investigation, still zero signs of collusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, Rand Paul said today, the president has been saying, there should never happen to an American president in this country. This is the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal we've ever seen. Now, also, the conclusion of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes Committee, no Russian collusion. The bipartisan Senate investigation, the Burr hearings, no Russia collusion. And for months, some people -- you know, they've been trying to tell me Mueller is of good and honorable and decent man. He served his country. Semper fi.

Why would he ever hire Hillary Clinton supporters and a former Clinton lawyer and no Republicans? You know, you've got to wonder if Mueller has paid attention to all of the abuse of power and corruption we have exposed right here on the show for two years. I wonder if he has this fidelity to truth and the law. You know, soon we will all know the answer to that. But it's not a good sign that Mueller, you know, appoints a guy like Andrew Weissmann. Remember Enron, the accounting case, tens of thousands of people lost their job. This guy license to lie in Sidney Powell's book, withheld exculpatory evidence.

Meantime, records for the charity of Rick Singer, he is the ringleader of the scam, show payments of $338,000 to the NYU athletic department, $546,000 to the University of Texas athletic department, and $100,000 to Princeville Enterprise.

And my daughter has been recruited by a lot of people. And all of her friends, they're all going to get - they're all recruited. All of my son's friends are all recruited. Since the time they are eight, they've traveled the country and the world, and then you take a picture of your kid and put it on an athlete when the kid has never played the sport or the whole test a scandal. Lara, your thoughts. Lara. LARA LOGAN, FORMER 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT: Sean, when I look at this breaking news like that, I obviously approach it as a journalist. That's my first thought, is - what do we know for sure? And then I start to ask questions just instinctively. And one of my first questions is about the role of the charity in this. That is particularly interesting to me because it's something that I've seen come up in other stories and in other scandals. Right? This is a very - this is a very well used method of hiding illicit money if you like or at least disguising money, as using a charity to funnel money through a charity. So that's very interesting to me. That aspect of this is particularly interesting. And then, of course, I really wonder - as a journalist, my other question is how big is this? What is the breadth of it? Who are the other people in the colleges that knew about this? And how far does this extend? And then, unfortunately, the next question for me is - I know the law enforcement has indicated that many of the kids didn't know what their parents were doing. But what about the ones who did? What about the ones who were given more time to take a test when they didn't have a learning disability? What about the ones who were given the answers to an SAT test or who knew that someone else was taking the test for them? If those things did actually happen, which the FBI has said they did, then it really raises the question as to whether or not those children will be charged because there are other college students who've been charged with other crimes in the past. And once they sign those forms as an adult when they're over 18, there is a question of responsibility and consequences there.",

And I think there's enormous frustration around the country with people looking at this and saying, wow, we work so hard and here it was, it was completely rigged, it was rigged for people who had the money, who had the access.

Dozens of wealthy families, business executives and yes, Hollywood celebrities caught rigging the system, paying huge crimes, fixing even SAT and ACT scores, also their little children, their precious skids to gain admission into some of America's top universities. Now, the man at the very center of this fraud is named William \"Rick\" Singer. He is cooperating with federal authorities apparently naming names. Hours ago, \"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin appeared in court to face charges for her involvement in this scheme and was released -- get this -- on a one million-dollar bond. By the way, the same amount as R. Kelly. And she and her husband are accused of paying half a million dollars so that their two daughters could get into USC as purported crew athletes. They never were crew rowers ever. They never played once. They even went as far as to photoshop pictures. Now, fellow actress Felicity Huffman was arrested at gunpoint during a raid by multiple FBI agents after she was accused of paying thousands of dollars to fake her daughter's SAT scores. And according to the University of Southern California, students who benefited from this fraud may now get kicked out of the college. But that should be the least of their worries because their parents now apparently, they will be facing up to 20 years behind bars. So far, 50 people have been charged including multiple college athletic coaches, school administrators, several SAT, ACT officials. And fraudster William \"Rick\" Singer claimed to have successfully serviced over 800 clients who paid him tens and tens of thousands on in some cases millions of dollars. Unbelievable. Why? I guess for status, bragging rights, so they could tell their friends that their privilege children got into the best schools, even though in reality, their children weren't good enough academically or weren't good enough athletically. To do so, they stomped on the futures of other people. This is a zero-sum game, there's only so many spots in each school. Children who are probably not as financially will off, or kids who had to work for everything, kids who put in the time academically or athletically, talking about thousands and thousands of hours studying and training and actually earning their grades or positioned in their sport. Kids who spent all this time on and off the field to better themselves and enrich the school with their incredible athletic ability. Kids who played sports competitively. Most kids now, they focus on one sport since about the time they are seven. Now, I know because I've lived through. Now, if found guilty, those involved in the scandal are the new faces of yes, greed, corruption and selfishness in a rare moment of honesty, even fake news CNN's Don Lemmon summed it up like this. Take a look."

And by the way, she's not the only 2020 Democrat facing claims of rampant hypocrisy. In tonight's 2020 HANNITY watch on the election -- well, they have breaking news tonight. Remember when the left told America that all claims of sexual misconduct, they are to be believed. No due process, no presumption of innocence necessary. Apparently, Democrats don't apply that same standard to themselves, as we have learned tonight. A former aide to #metoo champion, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York, actually resigned after her claims of sexual misconduct were allegedly swept under the rug. And meanwhile, Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign is still dealing with allegations of sexual harassment. Apparently, \"believe all women\" is not a motto for the Sanders campaign. It's not one they ever obey themselves. And don't forget Kamala Harris. One of her top aides forced to resign because of sexual misconduct but only after details of his $400,000 payoff became public. Brave senators. And this will be an issue in 2020. We'll have more on this later in the show, but we turn now to a serious situation over American skies tonight. Out of an abundance of caution, earlier today, the president ordered all Boeing 737 MAX 8, 9 planes grounded in light of new information from the ongoing investigation into the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.

Let me be more clear -- I want to say this about Boeing. Boeing is great American company. They have created some of the best, most reliable planes use worldwide. I want Boeing to beat the French owned Airbus in the open market and I know they will. All Americans should be rooting for Boeing to get to the bottom of this serious situation, resolve it and get back to producing some of the best aircraft this world has ever seen. And some of our fellow American citizens, they built those aircraft. We are going to bring you those developments as they continue to unfold. First, we turn to our “Hannity” watch on the deep state. We have more breaking news tonight. For the past few nights right here on this program, we have been urging you to just hang on, be patient, because justices around the corner for all high-level government bureaucrats that we have been telling you about for two years, those that were involved in bringing Clinton's investigation so she could remain the Democratic candidate, those involved in trying to alter an impact election with Russian lies they knew were allies but they disseminated them anyway, all while persecuting the Trump campaign for something he never did or his campaign never did.

According to Lisa Page, quote",
      "utterance": "We had multiple conversations with the Justice Department about charging gross negligence and the Justice Department's assessment was that it was both constitutionally vague, really? So that they did not actually feel they could permissibly bring that charge and they need a new standard."

      "utterance": "You are making it sound like it was the department that told you you're not going to charge gross negligence which is in the statute because the prosecutors were telling you we are not going to. Page responded: That is correct. That's correct? That means this was ordered by the Department of Justice of Barack Obama headed by Loretta Lynch -- yes, the same attorney general at the time that met days before this decision secretly on the tarmac in Phoenix with Bill Clinton supposedly 45 minutes talking about grandchildren. This was in the final days of that investigation. The same person who asked James Comey, don't call this an investigation. We call it a matter. Really? That was an investigation. It should have been. The same person who reports directly to Barack Obama. Tonight, we now have added a very important new component to this entire deep state issue. What did Barack Hussein Obama know and when did he know it? This now takes it straight to the former president and the Oval Office, Barack Obama. And thanks to Page, we also know the top FBI investigator, her boyfriend Strzok, viewed the investigation into Trump-Russia collusion, that was the insurance policy that we knew they talked about. And they joined the Russian investigation in order to build a case to impugn and potentially impeach the duly elected new president of the United States, assuming that all their work and the release of all those lies and all of that propaganda and the dossier they disseminated to influence the American people before the vote in 2016. The only problem here is there was collusion but it wasn't Trump-Russia collusion. According to Page, the FBI had absolutely no evidence after they started an investigation, after exonerating Hillary this investigation began in July of 2016, Trump Russia collusion. By the way, they went all the way through May of the next year. They found no evidence. This is before Bob Mueller was even appointed. They found nothing. And here we are 665 days later into what is Mueller's intensive investigation, still zero signs of collusion. You know, Rand Paul said today, the president has been saying, there should never happen to an American president in this country. This is the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal we've ever seen. Now, also, the conclusion of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes Committee, no Russian collusion. The bipartisan Senate investigation, the Burr hearings, no Russia collusion. And for months, some people -- you know, they've been trying to tell me Mueller is of good and honorable and decent man. He served his country. Semper fi. He's a marine, impeccable integrity. I have wandered from day one why did Bob Mueller's staff this political investigation with only Democratic donors. Why would he ever hire Hillary Clinton supporters and a former Clinton lawyer and no Republicans? You know, you've got to wonder if Mueller has paid attention to all of the abuse of power and corruption we have exposed right here on the show for two years. I wonder if he has this fidelity to truth and the law. You know, soon we will all know the answer to that. But it's not a good sign that Mueller, you know, appoints a guy like Andrew Weissmann. Remember Enron, the accounting case, tens of thousands of people lost their job. This guy license to lie in Sidney Powell's book, withheld exculpatory evidence. That's Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann. Then, he put four Merrill executives in jail for a full year. That was overturned by the fifth circuit. Why would -- why would he ever be hired by Mueller? And today, Paul Manafort case, liberals aren't going to be happy unless Paul Manafort dies in jail. He was sentenced to more prison time for the second case that he have been involved in. None of them, we now have two cases, nothing to do with collusion whatsoever. Here's his attorney earlier today. Listen to the nice little protesters and resistance in the background."

Today busy in his favorite conspiracy based network MSNBC, shifting the narrative, squirming when asked a simple question about his previous grandiose claims that he had evidence of collusion.

I think they corruptly got a warrant against Carter Page and that should scare every American. You've got the Utah U.S. attorney acting as a quasi- Mueller when it comes to all things DOJ, FBI. I think we need a special counsel to look at the potential crimes by the Department of Justice, the FBI regarding the Clinton email investigation and the Russian investigation against Trump early on. The point is, the Congress, me, not going to happen in the House, we're going to call them all before the committee. Did they try to invoke the 25th Amendment to take the president down? Did they get a warrant against an American citizen using information they know was flawed? Did they taint the Clinton email investigation because they were afraid that if they indicted her, she would lose an election they wanted her to win? You're going to get answers to that the best I can give them to you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Here's the question I've got. Why would you decide not to charge her before you even talk to her? The point is, it seems to me they were going to make sure he didn't go too far, that the Department of Justice under Loretta Lynch was never going to let this email investigation go too far. Before they even talked to her, apparently, they decided not to charge her and when they did talk to her, they talk to her without being under oath. They gave a lot of people immunity in the Clinton email investigation for no good reason. So here's what I think happen. I think the Clinton email investigation was short-circuited because they did not want to compromise her ability to win election. They hated Trump's guts, they started the beginning of the Russia investigation before he won as an insurance policy in case he did win."

So, they couldn't have verified it but they used it for FISA warrants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

He's got a political agenda, right? So with that knowledge, they asked for a warrant on four different occasions against Carter Page. And here's what McCabe said. Without the dossier, we would have never gotten a warrant. They show the -- McCabe said it, but it gets worse. After Trump wins, Comey gives them a copy of the dossier saying, I want you to know this is out there. We can verify any of it, but I just want you to know about it.

Everything is going to be great. Free retirement, whether you're willing or unwilling to work. It's all - it offers to take away all fears of people.

And actually, the President and first lady talked about it on Friday with me. They told me some stories that they will never forget, how they met people who impacted their lives forever. They were down there mourning. And here you have The View trying to say that Melania has a body double. Are you serious? This is how low they've gotten. They will literally look for anything.

And now USC says all applicants connected to this cheating scheme will be denied, and those already in school will be reviewed, meaning Loughlin's 19-year-old daughter, Olivia Jade, a YouTube star, could be kicked out of USC. Meantime, records for the charity of Rick Singer, he is the ringleader of the scam, show payments of $338,000 to the NYU athletic department, $546,000 to the University of Texas athletic department, and $100,000 to Princeville Enterprise. That's a mysterious business that happens to share the same address as UCLA's former soccer coach. So far, this pay to not-play scheme has resulted in coaches being fired or suspended at USC, Stanford, Wake Forest, University of Texas, Georgetown, Yale, and UCLA among others. Those who allegedly cheated to inflate SAT and ACT scores are also being rounded up. Sean."

      "utterance": "Unbelievable. All right. Thank you so much, Trace Gallagher. Joining us now with reaction, journalist, former 60 Minutes Correspondent Lara Logan, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. I just happen to be at an age where I have young kids. And my daughter has been recruited by a lot of people. And all of her friends, they're all going to get - they're all recruited. All of my son's friends are all recruited. Since the time they are eight, they've traveled the country and the world, and then you take a picture of your kid and put it on an athlete when the kid has never played the sport or the whole test a scandal. Lara, your thoughts. Lara. LARA LOGAN, FORMER 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT: Sean, when I look at this breaking news like that, I obviously approach it as a journalist. That's my first thought, is - what do we know for sure? And then I start to ask questions just instinctively. And one of my first questions is about the role of the charity in this. That is particularly interesting to me because it's something that I've seen come up in other stories and in other scandals. Right? This is a very - this is a very well used method of hiding illicit money if you like or at least disguising money, as using a charity to funnel money through a charity. So that's very interesting to me. That aspect of this is particularly interesting. And then, of course, I really wonder - as a journalist, my other question is how big is this? What is the breadth of it? Who are the other people in the colleges that knew about this? And how far does this extend? And then, unfortunately, the next question for me is - I know the law enforcement has indicated that many of the kids didn't know what their parents were doing. But what about the ones who did? What about the ones who were given more time to take a test when they didn't have a learning disability? What about the ones who were given the answers to an SAT test or who knew that someone else was taking the test for them? If those things did actually happen, which the FBI has said they did, then it really raises the question as to whether or not those children will be charged because there are other college students who've been charged with other crimes in the past. And once they sign those forms as an adult when they're over 18, there is a question of responsibility and consequences there."

I think another issue here is that, as a parent too, Sean, these parents absolutely did no favors to their children. I mean, what they did was just set them up for failure. It also told them that they weren't worth it, that they - working hard wasn't necessary, that they weren't good enough to actually make it. And I think there's enormous frustration around the country with people looking at this and saying, wow, we work so hard and here it was, it was completely rigged, it was rigged for people who had the money, who had the access. And like Lara said, I wonder how many more of these establishments, like William Singer has, are around the country."
