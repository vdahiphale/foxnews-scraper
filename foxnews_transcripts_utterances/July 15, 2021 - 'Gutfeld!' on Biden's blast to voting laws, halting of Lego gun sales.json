The group of undergrads and some faculty signed an open letter published in the school paper criticizing the restaurant and its CEO for his Christian beliefs. Writing, \"Our first concern relates to Chick-Fil-A's long history of antagonism toward the LGBTQ-plus community. Over the past two decades, Chick-Fil-A has donated significant sums to groups that oppose LGBTQ-plus rights.\" It's true Chick-Fil-A has donated money to the fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Paul Anderson Youth Home, and the Salvation Army, you know those hate groups. So, instead of debating such positions, they'd rather just banned those who hold those position. Seems to me that they are the real chickens here. They also scolded the menu writing in part, \"Consisting primarily of fried chicken and potatoes, the menu at Chick-Fil-A does not supply an array of options suitable for a diverse campus community.\" They clearly never had their Polynesian sauce.

The group of undergrads and some faculty signed an open letter published in the school paper criticizing the restaurant and its CEO for his Christian beliefs. Writing, \"Our first concern relates to Chick-Fil-A's long history of antagonism toward the LGBTQ-plus community. Over the past two decades, Chick-Fil-A has donated significant sums to groups that oppose LGBTQ-plus rights.\" It's true Chick-Fil-A has donated money to the fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Paul Anderson Youth Home, and the Salvation Army, you know those hate groups. So, instead of debating such positions, they'd rather just banned those who hold those position. Seems to me that they are the real chickens here. They also scolded the menu writing in part, \"Consisting primarily of fried chicken and potatoes, the menu at Chick-Fil-A does not supply an array of options suitable for a diverse campus community.\" They clearly never had their Polynesian sauce.

Yes, look, I am very happy to take every shot available at Notre Dame because I root against them in football. I will note for these students. They have literally Jesus overlooking their football. Right, this is the school that they chose to attend. So, that's a thing about Notre Dame. And the other point I'll make briefly in their defense, which I'm loathed to do But I'll try. It's 180 kids. Out of 8600 kids who go to the school so that's roughly two percent. My guess is if you pull the other 98 percent almost all women say yes, I would like some delicious fried chicken and take your politics elsewhere."

And you had these idiots in the city council running around to all the cameras saying hate is not welcome in this city. No one wants this chicken here. And then they open their locations all up and down Sixth Avenue right here and they were lying around the block. New Yorkers are speaking, which is they like chicken and don't care about your politics."

Two employees from an Ohio hospital have been placed on leave after giving a kidney to the wrong patient. As if that was bad enough, another transplant patient says that she just hates her new penis. Still, under Obamacare, it's considered a stunning success. Red Meat joke. Luckily the recipient is alive and the kidney is compatible. The hospital did not immediately return to Fox News request for comment or perhaps they accidentally returned a comment meant for Fox News to CNN. See where that happened there? Judge, you're pretty smart. So, I'm going to ask you this question that's been bothering me for ever since I was a child. Why? Why do we have two kidneys? Like we have a backup kidney. But we don't have two hearts, and we don't have two livers, Kat, which is her -- Kat, should have two livers."
