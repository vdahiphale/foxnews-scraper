So, a decision has come down, an illegal immigrant and seven-time felon Jose Zarate who shot and killed Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier walking with her dad was given credit for three years already served on the weapons felony. But he is about to be turned over to the federal authorities now. As it appears, this case is not completely over. Any moment now, the federal government will him into custody; away from the sanctuary state of California where he will face two new felony charges. Giving the Steinle family one more chance at justice in her killing. In moments, I have an exclusive interview with the man who defended Zarate, Public Defender Matt Gonzales. But first, Trace Gallagher joins from our West Coast Newsroom with what is going on there behind scenes in California with this case at this late hour.

Either tonight or this weekend, and Jose Garcia Zarate will be taken into custody by the federal authorities in San Francisco and taken across the bay to Oakland -- where he'll be arraigned early next week in federal court for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.

Steinle's death then became a key piece of Trump's immigration enforcement narrative on the campaign trail. Now, in federal court, Garcia Zarate's prominent defense attorney will try to turn the tables. Jay Tony Serra says, he plans to argue that the case against Garcia Zarate should be dismissed because it's vindictive, adding that a guilty vote for Garcia Zarate is a vote for Donald Trump.

People at one point were saying that the chief of staff was a success because he was good at controlling information to the president. That's crazy. A lot of people voted for Trump hoping the fact that he would left these tactics on the campaign, got more serious to actually govern and be the president, and now they're saying that he's really not.

But he is about to be turned over to the federal authorities now. As it appears, this case is not completely over. Any moment now, the federal government will him into custody; away from the sanctuary state of California where he will face two new felony charges.

And in case you're wondering, despite San Francisco being sanctuary city and California now being a sanctuary state, local and the state authorities can no longer shield Garcia Zarate. He has to be turned over to the U.S. Marshals because he's facing federal indictment. Remember, the reason he was able to fire the gun that killed Kate Steinle is because when San Francisco law enforcement had him in custody instead of turning him over to immigration agents to be deported for a sixth-time, they decided to set him free. Steinle's death then became a key piece of Trump's immigration enforcement narrative on the campaign trail. Now, in federal court, Garcia Zarate's prominent defense attorney will try to turn the tables. Jay Tony Serra says, he plans to argue that the case against Garcia Zarate should be dismissed because it's vindictive, adding that a guilty vote for Garcia Zarate is a vote for Donald Trump.

This is somebody with no weapons possession history. You know, he's not a member of a gang. He doesn't just --"

Obviously, they're very interested in Mr. Garcia Zarate, but the allegation that Mr. Serra is making is that they're interested in him only because he beat the murder charges. And so, the question is: is that something that they should be allowed to do? They would never have prosecuted this case; they had no indictment until he was acquitted of murder."

He's been five times deported from the country. So, to say that he's just sort of this, you know, innocent person who doesn't deserve this kind of scrutiny by the federal government, I think, is a bit of a stretch. I do want to talk about the political nature of this. Let me move on. This is Francisco Ugarte, your co-counsel, talking about what he sees as a political agenda in this case. Let's play that."

      "speaker": "GONZALES",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the point that Francisco Ugarte was making was that this was a case from the outset was a ricochet, so the bullet struck very close to where Mr. Garcia Zarate was seated. We've never seen a murder case in San Francisco that was based on a ricochet. And so, it only came to the forefront because our current president elected to use it in his campaign. I think that's the point he was trying to make."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I think the point that he was trying -- the point that has been made about this case is that this is an innocent woman who was walking on a pier. How this did not turn out to be a manslaughter case is something that is a large question for anybody who observed it closely. He picked up a gun, an illegal firearm as an immigrant; the gun went off and Kate Steinle is dead because of it. So, you know, I guess, you know, this supposition that this is a partisan, sort of, big anti-immigration agenda seems to belie the actual facts of what happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALES",
      "utterance": "There's no question Kate Steinle is innocent. I mean, this is a tragedy. We all wish it wouldn't have happened. But the question of somebody's immigration status when the prosecution is trying to prove premeditated murder, in effect the courts say somebody's immigration status isn't relevant to that determination any more than an American citizen being charged in another country who say, let's say, overstayed their visa, that that wouldn't be an issue in a case about whether or not there's going to be a crime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Overstaying a visa is very different than being kicked out -- he was supposed to be removed from the city of San Francisco and that was completely overshadowed and overlooked. You know, he was not handled in a legal manner by the city of San Francisco or -- and he completely managed to fall through all the cracks five times after he was kicked out of the country. I can't imagine how you would feel if it happened to someone that you loved or someone in your family."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALES",
      "utterance": "Let me just say this, though. This isn't -- when we talk about sanctuary city and what caused Mr. Garcia Zarate to be released, it's not the city of San Francisco fighting ICE and Homeland Security that wanted to put a detainer on him. The federal courts have actually made it very clear that they want these federal agencies to have a probable cause determination that somebody is not a citizen and can be deported prior to allowing the agencies just to call up a city and say hold this person for us. So, it's really federal agencies refusing to follow federal courts in California, Nebraska, North Dakota, Utah, Rhode Island. That's really what this is about."

      "speaker": "DAVID WOLH, ATTORNEY AND CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, first of all, counsel completely ignored the issue of illegal re-entry into America by someone convicted of a felony. That crime alone is prosecutable and results in a ten-year sentence. Forget about the gun charges that were also a sentence that the feds would go after and go after righteously. They're seeking justice; Jeff Sessions has been involved in this. He knows what's going on, and he's going to do what the state authorities did not do. And by the way, this issue, Martha, what they're talking about across the feds jumping in after the state fails the prosecution, these very same lawyers when the cops and the Rodney King beating case were acquitted and the feds jumped in and filed charges and got a conviction on them, they stood on the chairs and they were cheering like you couldn't believe. So, this is all about who's being prosecuted, not the feds jumping in after a failed state prosecution."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOHL",
      "utterance": "Well, what's going to happen now is he will be detained by the federal authorities. There will be an arraignment on the charges of illegal reentry to the United States by a felon. The gun charges possibly civil rights charges. He will end up probably taking a plea. He'll be convicted. He'll be sentenced to federal prison. And in reaction to this, I have the good news I think from a victim's perspective, Martha. I spoke to a friend, State Senator Jeff Sessions today, who's a conservative warrior in Sacramento, one of the few. And on Monday, he will introduce a bill in Sacramento to add a sentencing enhancement for those who commit a felony in the state of California while being in the United States illegally. So, that could add three, five, ten years to the sentence. This is the first, this a novel approach. This is something that takes a lot of courage to do in California. But this guy, Jeff Stone, is the guy who can do it. And believe me, he's fully committed after seeing this Kate Steinle verdict, and after seeing my client's case, the Sandra Duran, of course, my client's fiance being run over by an illegal who had been deported five times and killed. So, this has got to stop, and he appreciates what it's going to take, and so I give him a lot of credit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOHL",
      "utterance": "No, it will not impact the Zarate case and it's going to be a very uphill battle in Sacramento, because, obviously, you know, he faces a top liberal opposition, people who view people like Mr. Zarate as important to them maintaining the power. But Jeff is going to be giving his best shot. And I'll tell you what, you may want to have him on next week because this could get very, very interesting."

Plus, there's a growing body of reporting and the latest from the New York Times says Mueller's case for collusion may be very thin if not falling apart, which is what the president has long argued.

The other officials included Former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Former Press Secretary Sean Spicer; however, Sean Spicer is now telling us this evening that that is not the case. Still, this contradicts a blistering New York Times piece that claimed that the president was the one who personally lobbied to get Sessions to stay on the case to protect him from charges. Here now on this and other things related, Jay Christian Adams, Former Justice Department Attorney, it's good to see you tonight. Thank you so much for being here."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, in and of itself, regardless of what happened, there's a couple of different stories here. Whether Don McGann was the one who went to Sessions and said, you know, we really don't want you to recuse yourself and whether these other individuals were involved, is there anything wrong with that inherently?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAMS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, not. Don McGann didn't do anything wrong. There's a lot of reasons why, Martha, but among them are the fact that Jeff Sessions wasn't implicated in anything relating to the theory of this Russian investigation. It wasn't alleged that he was involved, that he directed it, that he knew about it. He just happened to be in the same building without any specific information. So, Don McGann was doing absolutely nothing by urging him to stay on the case, something I believe he should. He would do a much better job of keeping Mueller from going out of control than Rod Rosenstein is doing as the deputy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, it doesn't seem to me that the attorney for the president, going to the attorney general, and saying these are the reasons why we think there's a legal case for you to not make this decision, that seems to be, in my mind, just looking at it, a fairly appropriate role. And you know, when you add to that, the fact that Jeff Sessions didn't; he didn't listen to them. You know, I mean, he listened to their case. They made their case, whether it was one of them or three of them or even if the president also suggested it -- we know his feelings are pretty well-known on the subject. You know, Jeff Sessions decided not to go that route and went his own way. So, it's not like he was pigeon-holed into doing something he didn't want to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right. But the question is, Martha, what is the scope of the recusal? I mean, if it related to an investigation involving Russia, that's one thing. But so far, we've seen from Mueller that this investigation involved such Earth-shattering events like Paul Manafort laundering money through an Alexandria, Virginia rug store or Mike Flynn not telling the truth on a question which is the -- the sort of a Gotcha Law, 18-USC-1001. So far, it doesn't have anything to do with Russia, and so it really raises questions as to why Jeff Sessions is not involved, why he's not making sure that they turn documents over to Congress regarding how they relied on the phony dossier. There's all kinds of questions that seemingly only Jeff Sessions can fix."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, in terms of the broader investigation, there's a feeling now that Trump allies are pushing these other investigations, re- opening the Hillary Clinton and the like, and trying to downplay this Russia probe. And there's a battle going on between Republicans and the Democrats on the Hill over whether they think that that's proper, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, right. Chuck Grassley, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate today called for a closer look at the Hillary matters. But, Martha, there's a reason for this. There's a growing perception in the country that the Justice Department is biased, that law enforcement is based on who you are, what your party is, who you agree with politically. And when you learn the details of what happened in the campaign where the dossier, this phony insane dossier, was possibly being used by FBI officials to do national security surveillance on Americans and then unmasking the surveillance, it becomes a frightening story instead of a ridiculous one. And I think Congress is on to it, and that's why people like Holder and Comey are so nervous because the bad behavior last year during the election is really a frightening one."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, with regards to the relationship of the attorney general to the president, this is something that you saw first- hand in the prior administration when you were seeing things that were going on that you didn't like. There's a lot of, sort of, I don't know -- \"hysteria\" is too strong a word. But concern about whether or not the president should be protected by the attorney general. I just want to put up a quote from Eric Holder in terms of the way he spoke of his relationship with President Obama when asked if he was going to be leaving the administration. He said, \"Well, I'm still enjoying what I'm doing. There's still work to be done. I'm still the president's wingman. So, I'm there with my boy. So, we'll see.\" What do you think?"

Fast and furious, the city of Ferguson being lit on fire because Holder stoked a mob there that echoed the president's views on police. I mean look, we had a situation where Holder was running interference all the time for Barack Obama. And now, suddenly, suddenly, when Jeff Sessions isn't even doing it. When it's only suggesting that he ought to people like Holder and Comey and the rest of them go completely crazy. It shows you the bias that we're talking about. People are not treated the same way by this Justice Department and the institution of the Justice Department. The sort of insiders treat people differently based on their political allegiance, and that's what we're learning."

He has written seven books, won prestigious magazine awards, and then a columnist and critic for some of the nation's leading publications. But for most of his career he has also been accused of being fast and loose with his facts. Now the accuracy of his new book, Fire and Fury is also being called into question, and it's not just for the unbelievable statement like his contention that Donald Trump didn't know former House Speaker John Boehner even though they had golfed together and spoken many times, but also for his sourcing. It remains very unclear if Wolff's White House interviews knew they were on the record. Those who know Michael Wolff claiming had a long history of burning sources and printing off-record comments. For example in 1998, Wolff wrote a book about his internet startup in the dot-com bubble years, and 13 people accused him of inventing or changing quotes. The book was also replete with factual errors. Wolff himself has also acknowledged that he's not a conventional reporter. And in the opening to Fire and Fury he writes that many of his accounts provided are, quote, in conflict with one another and may be boldly untrue, saying he settled on a version I believe to be true.

Trump's governing style is unfamiliar and often disconcerting, but his accomplishment are not inconsiderable. Wolff's book is merely political gossip and like the loose talk about the 25th amendment should be treated as nothing more than a momentarily blip on the nation's political radar.

It actually pretty much confirms what we hear over and over from reporters and everyone who's coming out of the White House that it is totally chaotic. He doesn't know how to govern. He doesn't know what's going on. He is driven by his own importance of self. They can't control him. People at one point were saying that the chief of staff was a success because he was good at controlling information to the president. That's crazy. A lot of people voted for Trump hoping the fact that he would left these tactics on the campaign, got more serious to actually govern and be the president, and now they're saying that he's really not. Look no farther with his tweets with North Korea. People are concerned."

I mean, everybody had watched him on TV. Everybody watched him as real estate developer. So, the fact that he's exacerbating to a ton of people, Chris, I don't think it is a huge revelation. The way he works, the way he approaches things. That he handles everything as a businessman and thinks that you should be able to settle problems the way that businessmen do. That he's not a huge reader and voracious devour of policy wonk briefings. And none of that is a big shock."

The big question about this book, the narrative that Wolff lays out here, yes, it is very much in keeping with a lot of reporting that we heard during the campaign, during the early days of the White House. The question now is, is it still that way? Has John Kelly, the chief of staff, imposed strictures to make things work better? Are people not back stabbing each other in the way that they were in the time when this book was happening? If this is a chronicle of the way it was, that's not a big of a deal -- or it's a survivable thing for the administration."

At the end of the day they're going to look at the ledger, they're going to look at how they feel they're doing. They're going to look on whether or not they think the country is headed in the right direction. And Mollie, I'm not really sure they're going to care that much about how exuberating or frustrating the president was for some of the people who worked there."

What really separates normal people, I think, from people who lost their head over Trump, and that's whether you are a fanatic or a critic of Trump, is how much attention you pay to the rhetoric versus how much attention you pay to the actual policies. And if you look in terms of the policies of what happened, people are not going to be upset with Donald Trump for what he's done in terms of deregulation or his handling of foreign policy -- corporate tax reform for the first time in 30 years. And there's this segment of the population that still haven't been able to accept the reality that the American electorate chose Donald Trump to be president. So they're flailing about and trying to say, no, really, you have to listen to us. We don't think he's stable. They've been saying that for 30 years, I think. But it's not a message that resonates with a lot of people."

I mean, look, every person that has come out of the White House has tried to make money off there, right? Like, everyone is writing a book. And that's partly because of the fact, I have to imagine, they feel like there's something to talk about. I would actually disagree with Mollie the fact that people don't want to know what's going on. People don't want to know how the sausage is made. I think they do. I think there's a lot of people who held their nose and voted for Trump. And I think the fact that Bannon is now leading a revolution of Republicans from within and turning so quickly on Trump, and that Trump is turning so quickly on him really shows a state that a lot of Republicans are very uncomfortable with the fact with what they signed up for in supporting him."

The stunning new report on the rift in the most powerful trio in football as we head to a big, big weekend, is it true? Plus, don't look now but the Dow is off to its best start ever for the market year. Take a look at that. Remember when Paul Krugman said that it would never -- the market would never survive a Trump presidency, it would just fall apart. Charles Payne is here on that and the underreported story of the uptick in jobs for African-Americans in this country, when Charles Payne joins me coming up."

It caps off a week of stunning action for the Dow Jones Industrial hitting another record -- this is unbelievable, right? Charles Payne will be with me in just a second. This is the best start to the year since 2006. To put a finder point of what I said going to the break, Charles Payne host of Making Money on the Fox Business Network joins me now. Charles, very strong numbers we've seen over the course of the beginning of this year. Can it be sustained? CHARLES PAYNE, \"MAKING MONEY\" HOST: It's actually going back to the beginning of last year. And absolutely it can be sustained. The fact the momentum is getting stronger and stronger and stronger. And, of course, we have the job reports -- looking for a little bit more, but the underlying data there including unemployment -- by the way, unemployment for all sectors going really well. But black unemployment at the lowest level ever, this goes back to '72 when they started keeping this data, is more pronounced than any other racial group. The participation rate is going up. They're coming back to the labor force. It is absolutely a marvel of what we're seeing in this country."

Keep in mind though, you know, the same tide lift all ships. So, if President Trump does continue with this economic revival that we're seeing, particularly in areas that are hard hit, I call them dirty fingernail jobs. Manufacturing through the roof. Manufacturing jobs have come back like crazy. These are the sort of areas where people will fill in their wallet, all people, but particularly blacks, Hispanics and folks like that. And then, I think, some of the other things, obviously, housing. How they handle welfare reform. Because remember, the main stream media is going to portray him as being cold."

But there are people who believe that that group had been sort of catered to and not -- you said the tide lifts all boat, but they're talked to in a different category sometimes by candidates. And that, perhaps, needs to change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "I think it needs to change. I think America and the DNA of most Americans -- it's part of all of us that the idea that we can make it. The idea that we could be anything. You know, when young kids listen to music, they listen to music about being bosses, about owning private jets. So, the American DNA across the color spectrum is about success. And I think that's one of the intangible that's coming back to the equation. It's hard to measure it, but you can see it. You see it with the manufacturing data with the optimism data. Homebuilder sentiment through the roof. One of the reasons why, traffic, this fire foot traffic has spike to levels not seen in almost two decades. So, Martha, it's there for all Americans. And again, you know, I think if President Trump articulates a message to black Americans that's not unlike the message to anybody else, hard work, pull yourself up by the boot straps. If I create the right economic backdrop you can start a business. You can participate is this. So, you know, he's got to worry about that. I would say, law enforcement, that was some rhetoric, particularly, things early in the campaign. Those are areas that can hurt the message to the community. But I really believe on the economic side of it, people -- all people are feeling it. Again, I don't know what kind of survey folks have taken out there, when they come back, let's say 34 percent approval rating, because more, more Americans are feeling and seeing in their own personal lives an improvement."

And perhaps the trainer guru, Alex Guerrero, who he is very close to, that Belichick isn't too crazy about hanging around all the time."

      "utterance": "Well, all of this has been discussed and re-discussed and now it's a bi-week. So this stirred it up once again. All of these things have occurred. And, you know, the miracle really is that they've kept this together for 18 years for sustain excellence and won five championships and it's been in seven Super Bowls. And now, if they can keep it together for another month or so, perhaps a sixth Super Bowls. So, you know, 18 years is forever. No one else -- this is unprecedented. I mean, Michael Jordan won six championships, but no one has been together for almost a couple of decades to see this happen in the modern era. So, yes, people said nerves get frayed and the voice wears thin. I remember Al Davis, the great owner of the Oakland and the Los Angeles Raiders, said something to me many, many years ago, and it was with John Madden and he says the voice wears thin of a coach after about eight or ten years. And Madden won a Super Bowl and then he decided that that was enough. And then Tom Flores won two Super Bowls and he decided after ten years that was enough. So just imagine what it's like for the players to go through. Bill Belichick and as tough and as discipline and rigorous as he is, the man is a genius, but that voice it's got to get tired at times. I'm sure for Tom Brady, who is the ultimate soldier, and goes out there and does everything that he's asked to do. You know, it's got to be very, very difficult and hard. And he's 40-years-old. I think he knows what to do. And when you see him screaming at a coach, you know, it's really, really hard to win a game."

And what they have been able to accomplished, it's going to end at some point. Will it end in four weeks? Will it end in a year? It will end. Tom Brady is 40-years-old. He just led the league in passing. It's unheralded and unheard of. And by the way about Alex Guerrero, if Tom Brady is happy with it why should anybody else care?"

Daphne Merken writes that while women are lockstep expressing outrage publicly in private, many recognize that the pendulum of punishment can swing too far, that we live in a moment where an accusation is an indictment. What if he said, she said, she said ends unjustly. Merken writes this are scary times for women, as well as men. There is an inquisitorial whiff in the air, and my particular fear is that in true American fashion, all subtlety and reflection is being lost. Something to think about. Have a good night everybody.
