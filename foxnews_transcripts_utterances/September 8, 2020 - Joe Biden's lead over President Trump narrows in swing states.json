A new poll from NBC and Marist has very tight, essentially tied, likely voters, 48-48. If you look at internals of that poll, the Latino vote, you compare the 2016 exit polls with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, 62-35, Clinton getting the Latino vote in Florida.

And it's got kind of intensity now that sometimes is just reserved for October. The other thing is, again, from sports, I learned in Washington, you're on offense or you're on defense. Trump is on offense and Joe Biden is on defense. Trump, the schedule, let's remember, this guy is what, 72? This is a herculean schedule that Donald Trump keeps with no sign of slowing down. Biden, on the other hand, seems to be laboring, not to belabor a point others have made. But you're on offense or you're on defense, and he's very much on offense, and I think that is a very good thing. The other thing is we are so roiled as a country in terms of violence, splits, divisions, I think that the firmness of Trump, his strength, whatever people may think of his occasional solecisms, may bring moderates, people in the middle, back to Donald Trump.

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": They are two very different candidates, Bret, modeling two different types of campaigns, the president trying to demonstrate that America is back, that we are putting the pandemic behind us, Biden still very much believing that we need to take steps to contain and then suppress the virus. A few things about the tightening, though. I think it's very important when we consider that this election in 2016 was decided by fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. It can be a very narrow margin can have decisive results in the Electoral College. And I think we're looking right now in these polls as something very similar happening, not in three states but maybe in six. And that could lead to a very prolonged postelection. The other thing I'd note is that with the Hispanic vote, I think if Trump should win this election, the Democratic National Convention will be seen as a missed opportunity by the Biden-Harris ticket. It had very little to say to Latino voters. And there's this misconception that Latino voters vote solely on immigration. That is not the case.

      "utterance": "A Trump campaign ad, a Biden campaign ad, and they're all over the place, especially in the key battlegrounds, as you take a look at one of the battleground states, North Carolina. They are trying to get Air Force One to miss our shot again, but it's there. They are on the ground and he's getting really, the president is, to disembark and talk to the folks there in Winston-Salem. This comes as some battleground states are showing tightening, one of them being Florida, the biggest battleground of all. A new poll from NBC and Marist has very tight, essentially tied, likely voters, 48-48. If you look at internals of that poll, the Latino vote, you compare the 2016 exit polls with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, 62-35, Clinton getting the Latino vote in Florida. But in this poll Joe Biden at 46, Donald Trump at 50 percent, and that is tracking some Latino numbers in North Carolina as well, one element. Obviously, we always look at those polls as snapshots in time, but it's interesting to look at them. Let's bring in our panel, Bill Bennett, former Education Secretary, host of \"The Bill Bennett Show\" podcast, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" A.B., let me start with you. Looking at that NBC/Marist poll, it is interesting to see that shift in just a few weeks."

      "speaker": "A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS",
      "utterance": "I did always think that the polls were going to tighten and voters were going to kind of come home. I think Joe Biden has seen these really good polling numbers for months, but his campaign expected that interest and engagement on the other side was going to be heightened around this time and that they would have to be prepared for a tightening race. I think if you are the Trump campaign you just have to contest everywhere you can with all the force and ability that you can because you're behind. I think if you are the Biden campaign, you have to do what they've been saying for months they're going to do, which is defend Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Nevada, not be seduced by Texas and Georgia, and then look to pick up places like North Carolina and Florida. So they are more cautious than people give them credit for, but it's still going to be a very volatile time between now and Election Day."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, we have those what if scenarios on the map that will play out over the next few weeks. Bill, if this is true, and the Trump campaign is picking up Latino voters in places like Florida and North Carolina, if they are moving the needle in the black vote by one, two, three points, in some of those states that really could turn the tide."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I understand if you go from eight points from the black community, which was last time, so 11 or 12, then Trump wins. The movement among Hispanic voters, the Latino community is dramatic. I agree with A.B., the thing is tightening, but it's also heating up. And it's got kind of intensity now that sometimes is just reserved for October. The other thing is, again, from sports, I learned in Washington, you're on offense or you're on defense. Trump is on offense and Joe Biden is on defense. Trump, the schedule, let's remember, this guy is what, 72? This is a herculean schedule that Donald Trump keeps with no sign of slowing down. Biden, on the other hand, seems to be laboring, not to belabor a point others have made. But you're on offense or you're on defense, and he's very much on offense, and I think that is a very good thing. The other thing is we are so roiled as a country in terms of violence, splits, divisions, I think that the firmness of Trump, his strength, whatever people may think of his occasional solecisms, may bring moderates, people in the middle, back to Donald Trump. They want some certain captain here, even if he curses from time to time -- I don't mean Trump does, but a captain does -- in stormy seas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Matthew, what about that schedule. You see the president stopping at two states today. And you see the former vice president Joe Biden taking the day off the campaign trail, no events for Biden or Harris today. We were kind of surprised when we saw that, that the lid for the press was on by midday. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": They are two very different candidates, Bret, modeling two different types of campaigns, the president trying to demonstrate that America is back, that we are putting the pandemic behind us, Biden still very much believing that we need to take steps to contain and then suppress the virus. A few things about the tightening, though. I think it's very important when we consider that this election in 2016 was decided by fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. It can be a very narrow margin can have decisive results in the Electoral College. And I think we're looking right now in these polls as something very similar happening, not in three states but maybe in six. And that could lead to a very prolonged postelection. The other thing I'd note is that with the Hispanic vote, I think if Trump should win this election, the Democratic National Convention will be seen as a missed opportunity by the Biden-Harris ticket. It had very little to say to Latino voters. And there's this misconception that Latino voters vote solely on immigration. That is not the case. What's more important to them is economy, and Trump's economic mission I think is more powerful than Joe Biden's."

A.B. the money game, Joe Biden raising a lot of money in recent weeks. Total raised, $328 million, total spent $229 million, and you take a look at the cash on hand there, roughly about $100 million. The president, a big raise, $414 million, but a huge spend, and the big story about the spending on that, $301 million, but cash on hand a little bit more. The president even going so far as saying he would put his own money in this race up to whatever he needs to spend."

But this is a troubling story for them because you and everyone on this panel and I have talk to Republican donors who have expressed concerns in the summer months about the spending, the disorganization, the grifting that has gone on, and just spent almost $1 million dollars to not even still really have a message, has been a source of a lot of tension on the Republican side, and a lot of concern about the Senate majority and whether donors should just support the senators and not the president's presidential campaign. So he is on TV in a lot of battlegrounds right now."

      "utterance": "But Mitch McConnell's aligned super PAC doesn't want to spend $5 million in Kansas right now. They have a lot of money to spend, they have a lot of expense on the Senate Republican side. They have many, many races where the Republican might win but they have to play defense and do a lot of spending, so they need a lot of money. And they've been very frustrating at the fact that the presidential campaign and Trump aligned super PACs have been hoovering all this money for years, and their majorities now in question. But I just want to quickly say about TV ads. So Trump is down in battleground states, and for TV ads for September are going to get back in October. We'll see later on how effective TV ads are. Remember that Trump has been up on YouTube and Facebook for many, many years now, running a general election campaign on those social media platforms all along, long before there was a Democratic nominee. So we're going to look back and have to assess how powerful TV ads are in 2020."

It's a massive shame, and it's a shame mainly on the liberals and the Democrats because of the powers of the teacher unions and the education establishment. Look, you can find a way to work at Amazon, people can find a way to work at Walmart, apparently you can even find a way to work at a gym if it's a government building in San Francisco, but we can't open the schools? Your earlier segment pointed out all the schools in the civilized world are opening, but our schools aren't. And here's the point -- these kids are safer and better off in school and out of school. Obviously academically, we hope obviously, mentally, and in terms of physical safety. This is a power play by the unions. And here is a particular shame -- the Democrats, the liberals who say they speak for the poor and the minority, it is disproportionately the poor and minority parent who will now have to choose between whether to go back to work or to stay home with the kids. And it is school which is a fortress, the place of refuge for more minority kids per capita than any other group, it's the place where they can get a meal, two decent meals, and where they can have the wisdom and guidance of adults. But this power play to keep it shut down, American people, a lot of them are furious about this, and they're right."
