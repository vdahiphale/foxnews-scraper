He's going to be able to get people in thanks to Harry Reid deploying the nuclear option four years ago with a simple 51 to 49 majority, which means he could get all of those judges to be conservative judges, and we need to balance that. We've seen the ninth circuit court of appeal, the hyper-liberal ninth circuit court of appeal shoot down everything he's brought in front of them, Martha. So this is critical. This is going to be a big deal for him. Gorsuch made the Supreme Court -- conservative majority, now we're going to go to the federal bench, so he's going to get what he wants done with these judges.

If that is true, then the way you succeed is by flooding the zone with policy; by focusing on your agenda; by going out to the places like Iowa, rallying the country around his agenda, the things that forgotten Americans sent him to Washington to do. They didn't send him to Washington to fight with the fake news media, or you know, or have a big fight with Congress over Russia, they sent him to do these things, to them - to get jobs, can help with them opioid crises, help them with all these problems.

It sort of forced Comey to confirm that he wasn't in any type of federal investigation.

So, that exists, and there was a White House kind of tapes. I've been to the White House many times, I haven't seen any of those things, I don't operate under the assumption that those exist. But we do know that the tactic that the president said that he may have tapes forced Comey's hand to say publicly-three times during testimony-that there was no evidence of collusion, it also forced him to correct the story those after that same evidence existed in the New York Times and a competitor network."

So, the Democratic Party has a deep, deep problem which is that they have lost contact and a connection with the center of the country. There was at Priorities USA, and liberal super PAC, put out a study the other day that they lost - there are between seven and nine million Americans who voted for Barack Obama, who switched their vote for Donald Trump in the last election. They are not going to solve the problems, so they figure out a way to reconnect with those voters, and what they are doing is the opposite; they're pushing them away. Every single day, they are treating Donald Trump with contempt, and when they treat Donald Trump with contempt, those people feel that they are being treated with contempt and they will never recover until they stop."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, right now the uncertainty in the individual market is driving up premiums tremendously. It would immediately establish certainty for the insurance company, allowing them to lower those premiums. Going forward, relative to the House bill, it greatly increases the amount somebody who's lower income will receive in order to buy his or her insurance-that's another good thing. It also creates a stabilization fund that insurance companies could use to create a so-called \"invisible high-risk pool or reinsurance pool,\" that again, has been estimated to have decreased main premiums by 20 percent."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And basically, don't like it for all of the reasons that you just stated that you like it. You're saying that it has enough heart for you, as I saw that, you know, you wanted it to pass the Jimmy Kimmel test, which we all remember well. They're saying it still keeps the government way too deep into the health care business and costs Americans too much money."

And people who are paying 20, 30, $40,000 a year in premiums, and some who are paying that much, would next year, like next month be given a quote 40 percent higher than that. Now, I would love it if we can change things today, but that's what Democrats do. Conservatives say we have to evolve, not have a revolution, and I think what we need to do is evolve into something which lowers those premiums and provide incredible coverage."

Let's put up on the screen, President Obama weighed in on this on Facebook today. And he was, you know, sort of sounding like most Democrats have sounded on this so far. Here is what he said: \"The Senate bill is not a health care bill, it's a massive transfer of wealth from middle class and poor families to the richest people in America,\" Lisa?"

But you know, also, in regard to President Obama's statement, look, ObamaCare is failing. You have multiple big insurers pulling out of the marketplace because it's not working; because the premise that, somehow, healthy individuals are going to be able to support, you know, the higher risk unhealthy individuals simply hasn't happened. So, what Republicans are trying to do as Senator Bill Cassidy said, trying to stabilize a marketplace that is not stabilized at this current juncture, and also to help Americans with premiums."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN GRUBER, OBAMACARE ARCHITECT AND MIT PROFESSOR",

So, essentially, it doesn't get rid of the structure of ObamaCare, and some sense that's good, I agree. But in some sense it said, look, takes somewhere who's 175 percent of poverty, instead of paying a thousand dollars a year for their insurance, they will pay $10,000 a year for their insurance. So, that's why he's mad. If basically, if not - there's no point to this, it doesn't do anything. Bill Cassidy listed some positive aspects. That's great! We could do everything Bill Cassidy listed without massively cutting one of the largest social safety nets in our country. And look, you guys always forget the quote of what I said in the past, and I'm sorry about that. But it's commentators like the last one, who is treating your viewers like they don't have intelligence. When they don't highlight the fact that during the during the Affordable Care Act, there were 25 days straight of Senator floor debate: the second longest Senate floor debate in our nation's history, and they want to rush this through with three days after CBS score. That is ridiculous."

I think they were told that if they could keep their doctor, they were told they could keep their plan; that was judged as the lie of the year because everybody up and down the food chain who gets medical care found out that that actually wasn't the case. And you know one of the things that are very interesting in this is that it does sort of try to go after things like means testing. Age-adjusted tax credits, ways of looking at where there's waste, and I remember when President Obama said, you know, one of the ways he was going to pay for ObamaCare was to go after waste, and fraud, and abuse. That never happened, Jonathan."

The single fact is, ObamaCare did more to reduce fraud in the U.S. Health Care System than any piece of legislation before, you can look it up. And look, I want your viewers to simply ask themselves, simply ask themselves will they be better off; your viewers who are rich, they'll be better off; I'm leaving them out of it. Your viewers who are in below $250,000 a year, I know my political views don't agree with theirs. I want to just simply sit down and ask themselves: are they going to be better off under a law which makes lower and middle-income people pay much, much more for their health insurance? That's a simple fact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, let me ask you this. First of all, fraud in 2014 toward the end of those years was $125 billion. And in fact, there was a program under ObamaCare that was supposed to find a fraud in hospitals, and under the Obama administration, it was cut back because the hospitals didn't like it because the program gave them a little bit of pad that they actually liked. So, there are plenty of places-"

      "speaker": "GRUBER",
      "utterance": "That's just not true. If you look at fraud collections by Medicare, they peeked under the actions taken by the Affordable Care Act. We've actually done more to reduce fraud under this law. First of all, fraud is a trivial part of health care, let's be honest, 125 billion is a tiny, tiny fraction of our health care spending. But second, the actions taken - Medicare fraud collections peaked on the Affordable Care Act."

You know, in terms of looking at the system and how it works, and getting doctors and patients back into the same sphere where they're dealing with each other instead of these faraway entities, do you think this will bring down costs and help them do that, Lisa? Quickly, I need an answer, sorry."

There are so many limitations in what you can do within those parameters. But I think there are real mechanisms they're trying to do - and just look at, even just giving states more flexibility with the 1332 waiver that basically ObamaCare and Democrats tried to make impossible for states to access: allowing states to be able to be more innovative. And you'll get something like Medicaid, which is unsustainable at the rate it's currently expanding. But look-"

America is also filled with pride over the display of character and sportsmanship at the congressional baseball game. I heard it was very special.

Pack the courts with men and women who align with his way of thinking. The president for the alliance for justice group warning, quote, they're taking advantage of the moment to realize their dream of putting judges hostile to civil rights and civil liberties on the bench. Who will be there long after Donald Trump leaves office? Hear now David Wohl, and Attorney Richard Fowler, is a senior fellow at New Leaders Council, and a Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, as we watch the picnic tonight, your thoughts on the potential for these judge positions and how they may make America look, David?"

Now there are 100 vacancies right now in the federal judiciary, and what does that mean? He's going to be able to get people in thanks to Harry Reid deploying the nuclear option four years ago with a simple 51 to 49 majority, which means he could get all of those judges to be conservative judges, and we need to balance that. We've seen the ninth circuit court of appeal, the hyper-liberal ninth circuit court of appeal shoot down everything he's brought in front of them, Martha. So this is critical. This is going to be a big deal for him. Gorsuch made the Supreme Court -- conservative majority, now we're going to go to the federal bench, so he's going to get what he wants done with these judges. Big deal for him."

Thousands of mourners lined the streets of his hometown in Ohio, today, where he was remembered as being the nicest kid who had a bright future ahead of him. That's his family on the right in that picture. We know that he suffered severe brain injuries while he was in custody, and it has outraged many including our nation's leaders. A bipartisan pair of lawmakers are trying to prevent other Americans from facing a similar fate. They join me now, California Democrat, Adam Schiff, and South Carolina Republican, Joe Wilson. Gentlemen, thank you very much for being here. Obviously, a very difficult day in Wyoming, Ohio, today, but you are trying to have something good come out of this. Congressman Schiff, tell us about this legislation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAM SCHIFF, U.S. CONGRESSMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, the legislation would require a license to visit North Korea, and it would essentially ban one category, that is tourist travel. Tourist travel exposes American citizens to great risk and harm. We saw, obviously, how tragic that could be with the death of Otto Warmbier. But it also provides a source of hard currency for North Korea. It allows the north to take Americans hostage and use them as bargaining chips to compel high-level delegation visits to try to retrieve American citizens. So, this is something that we want to do more to discourage. I want to thank my colleague, Joe Wilson, for all his leadership on this issue, and our foreign affairs chairman Ed Royce for agreeing to take up the bill. It is a very bipartisan work product. And I think it's time, certainly, tragically come."

      "speaker": "JOE WILSON, U.S. CONGRESSMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm really grateful. It would require a license before tourists could visit North Korea. Currently, people can visit at any time, but this would limit the persons, they would have to have a license from the U.S. department of treasury, and it would provide for humanitarian efforts, but not for tourism. Tourism only benefits the communism totalitarian dictatorships. And I'm just so proud of President Donald Trump pointing out his deep affection for Otto Warmbier and his family. The American people have been so tragically affected by this murder of a -- just a wonderful UVA student."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You know, Congressman Schiff, in terms of how that part of this tension is going, you know, this bill have any impact on that? Or what do you expect from the president when it comes to that in the face of the death of Otto Warmbier, and the new resolve to be stronger against this regime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHIFF",
      "utterance": "I think this bill, certainly, signals a willingness in the United States to do whatever we need to do to crack down on North Korea. In this case, deprive North Korea of this hard currency, as well as the opportunity to exploit to the presence of American citizens. But there's a lot more we need to do as the president has alluded. And as our secretary of state underscored recently, there's a lot more that China can do, really needs to do. China has the primary economic leverage on North Korea. I think we're going to have to make it clear to China that unless they do more, were going to have to put secondary sanctions on Chinese financial institutions, expand our missile defense, expand our naval presence. Those are steps we don't necessarily want to take, but will have to."

      "utterance": "I mean, there's not a ton of tourism in North Korea, but I understand the meaning behind what you're trying to do and to prevent anyone from seeing the same fate that Otto Warmbier saw when he visited that country. There are still other individuals that are there, there are three other Americans. What can be done in congress, are you putting pressure on the situation, Representative Wilson, to try to bring them home and use this as some sort of leverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILSON",
      "utterance": "And sadly, we've had 17 Americans that had been held by the North Koreans over the last ten years, and three still are in custody. And we will be making every effort, and I appreciate the extraordinary efforts of President Trump working with President Xi of China. Every effort we made to bring these persons home, to protect American citizens, and in any way -- this is a classic example of bipartisanship that American people need to see. A Republican from South Carolina, a Democrat from California, the American people are united against a dictatorship in Pyongyang."

This is our last day together as Wyoming High School class of 2013. Tomorrow morning, we will all belong to another class, another job, or another city. No matter where we go or what we do though, we will always have this group here. Even Wyoming class of 2013 is a thing of the past. We'll have the support of all these people around us. We'll have to knowledge we gain as a group, and we'll have to make reruns. The memories we created to be played over and over again. Thank you."
