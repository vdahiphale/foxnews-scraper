The Senate confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson began today, and the Democrats apparently forgetting the Kavanaugh hearings are blasting the GOP for even considering asking about her legal history. Senator Marsha Blackburn is here on that. Plus, how do you make money in Biden's America? By opening a 'Let's Go Brandon' store, of course. The 'Ingraham Angle' goes on the road to New Jersey to check it out. And air raid sirens going off tonight in Lviv. Ukraine, as the port city of Mariupol remains surrounded. We'll bring you a live report in moments. But first, now that The New York Times is admitted what we knew to be true all along, that the Hunter Biden laptop story is real and not Russian disinformation. It's time for some answers to serious questions raised by Hunter's seedy ties. And these aren't questions about the political consequences for Joe Biden. They represent massive national security concerns. So, of course, the White House is trying to sweep it all under the rug.",

What the laptop showed was that Joe Biden was intimately familiar with the Biden family business, in which members of the Biden family shake down corrupt foreign governments and oligarchs in exchange for their proximity to Joe Biden. Joe Biden was the one who was getting 10 percent for the big guy. Joe Biden was the one who went on a national stage and lied and said that it was Russian disinformation that his son's laptop had all this material. He knew that was false. And blaming a nuclear power in the middle of an election for something that you know that they didn't do is so irresponsible from a foreign policy perspective, but also a domestic policy perspective. Joe Biden was the point person in Ukraine when his son was taking money by serving on the board of an energy concern there. That was very much compromised by U.S. involvement in that country. Joe Biden was the one who took his son on a trip to China, shortly after which he was able to arrange a deal with this Chinese communist connected entity. So this isn't just Hunter Biden, this is Joe Biden, and the media know that. And that's why they lied about this, covered it up, engaged in a conspiracy with tech companies to make sure that this was not something that voters could know about before 2020's election, because they knew if they knew that Joe Biden would not be elected president.",

He instructed them just to ignore it, not to run anything on it because it was garbage. And this is exactly what Joe Biden relied on. He relied on his pet media, who were just so desperate to make him win and Donald Trump lose the election. And he got away with it. And this is the question now and there's no reason why those media outlets should have been so in curious. Tony Bobulinski, who was Hunter Biden's business partner had met Joe Biden twice, knew very much about the Biden influence peddling scheme overseas.

Matt, why is the woke left determined to destroy women's sports as we know it? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Well, it's part of an overall war on truth, I think. And in this, the truth is really quite simple that men and women are different. Lia Thomas is a man. The fact that he perceives himself allegedly to be a woman does not make him a woman, just basic reality there. And the fact that he's a man means that he has many - it's not just hormones, he has innumerable biological ingrained advantages over women. Everything from the size of his limbs, the size of his organs, his lung capacity, and so forth. All of these things give him an immense advantage over women, which is also why, when you look at most competitive sports, men almost always performed better than women on average. I mean, the fastest man in the world is always faster than the fastest woman. The best male swimmer in the world is always faster than the best female swimmer. But the thing is, you and I, we could sit here and talk about it. I can talk about it. I could try to defend women's sports myself from the outside, which I've done and talk about the fundamental truth. But I think, there's nothing that can replace the women who are actually involved or on the ground, who are in these sports. There is nothing that can replace them taking a stand and protesting this. And that's why it's really good that finally some of them are starting to do it. It takes a lot of courage. We talk a lot about courage in our society, a lot of false courage is applauded. It takes real courage to actually take a stand against this, as at least some of these swimmers have. I think the next step, though, is for the female swimmers, or female competitors in any of these sporting events when a male shows up to realize that because the man is there, this is all a charade now. It doesn't mean anything. So, refuse to participate at all.",

And the battering goes on. 90 percent of that city of 400,000-plus destroyed or damaged; hundreds of thousands with no food, electricity, water, medicine, a truly horrible situation. Meanwhile, in the capital of Kyiv, more artillery blasts were heard on Monday and around the clock curfew is in place as rescue workers dig through the rubble of yet another Russian missile strike, hitting shopping mall, high rise building, killing eight. Russians claimed it was a Military target. Finally, you're right. These artillery and missile blasts by the Russians could be, according to officials, a sign of what they think is Moscow switching to Plan B. They fail to win a quick decisive victory on the ground. Thanks in part to the bravery of the Ukrainian forces, and thanks in part to the Russian incompetence.

      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "But it's also not about just Hunter Biden. It's about Joe Biden. What the laptop showed was that Joe Biden was intimately familiar with the Biden family business, in which members of the Biden family shake down corrupt foreign governments and oligarchs in exchange for their proximity to Joe Biden. Joe Biden was the one who was getting 10 percent for the big guy. Joe Biden was the one who went on a national stage and lied and said that it was Russian disinformation that his son's laptop had all this material. He knew that was false. And blaming a nuclear power in the middle of an election for something that you know that they didn't do is so irresponsible from a foreign policy perspective, but also a domestic policy perspective. Joe Biden was the point person in Ukraine when his son was taking money by serving on the board of an energy concern there. That was very much compromised by U.S. involvement in that country. Joe Biden was the one who took his son on a trip to China, shortly after which he was able to arrange a deal with this Chinese communist connected entity. So this isn't just Hunter Biden, this is Joe Biden, and the media know that. And that's why they lied about this, covered it up, engaged in a conspiracy with tech companies to make sure that this was not something that voters could know about before 2020's election, because they knew if they knew that Joe Biden would not be elected president."

      "utterance": "You know, Miranda, 50 percent of those who voted for Joe Biden said they never heard about the laptop before the election. And 10 percent said, they wouldn't have voted for him had they known. And that's in a very close election with Joe Biden getting 51 percent of the popular vote. I mean, what does this say about the role of the media in electing our leaders?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVINE",
      "utterance": "Well, the reason that those Biden voters were in the dark was because their organs of choice, whether it be the New York Times, The Washington Post, or all the organs that follow them and take their agenda speaking points from those newspapers and CNN and MSNBC. We know Jeff Zucker at CNN instructed his staff on the day that The New York Post ran our first bombshell story before the election. He instructed them just to ignore it, not to run anything on it because it was garbage. And this is exactly what Joe Biden relied on. He relied on his pet media, who were just so desperate to make him win and Donald Trump lose the election. And he got away with it. And this is the question now and there's no reason why those media outlets should have been so in curious. Tony Bobulinski, who was Hunter Biden's business partner had met Joe Biden twice, knew very much about the Biden influence peddling scheme overseas. And he offered himself up to the media just after our story broke three weeks before the election, and nobody took him up on it."

I think sounding such a cautionary note at the time was appropriate.\" Mollie, there are no consequences to these 51 so-called intelligent agents. And the other part of it is the fact that they've never really told us what is certainly Russian disinformation, that identified it as not being credible."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

People who created multiple efforts to get rid of President Donald Trump, either before he was elected president, or during his presidency, including the absolutely dangerous Russia collusion conspiracy theory, they weren't held accountable. And that's because the media actually like to be lied to by intelligence officials, and they like to do things such as engage in these conspiracy theories, downplay legitimate news stories that voters had every right to know, and really needed to know before they went to vote in 2020. And they continue to peddle misinformation and disinformation even right now as it relates to whether or not to get involved in World War III. And the media are in - completely irresponsible, as are these intelligence officials. We are in a really bad situation with so many members of our establishment regime completely and peddling untruths."

She's the one who missed the cut off to get into the consolation final in the 500 free. The top 16 advanced, while she placed 17th. She argues, she missed out because of transgender Penn swimmer Lia Thomas' dominant performance in the race. Gyorgy wrote a letter to the NCAA and posted it on her Instagram over the weekend. Writing in part, \"I'm writing this letter right now in hopes that the NCAA will open their eyes and change these rules in the future. It doesn't promote our sport in a good way and I think it's disrespectful against the biologically female swimmers who are competing in the NCAA.\" 21-time all-American and nine time national champion swimmer Maggie Bowen tells Fox News, she agrees with that.

Matt, why is the woke left determined to destroy women's sports as we know it? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Well, it's part of an overall war on truth, I think. And in this, the truth is really quite simple that men and women are different. Lia Thomas is a man. The fact that he perceives himself allegedly to be a woman does not make him a woman, just basic reality there. And the fact that he's a man means that he has many - it's not just hormones, he has innumerable biological ingrained advantages over women. Everything from the size of his limbs, the size of his organs, his lung capacity, and so forth. All of these things give him an immense advantage over women, which is also why, when you look at most competitive sports, men almost always performed better than women on average. I mean, the fastest man in the world is always faster than the fastest woman. The best male swimmer in the world is always faster than the best female swimmer. But the thing is, you and I, we could sit here and talk about it. I can talk about it. I could try to defend women's sports myself from the outside, which I've done and talk about the fundamental truth. But I think, there's nothing that can replace the women who are actually involved or on the ground, who are in these sports. There is nothing that can replace them taking a stand and protesting this. And that's why it's really good that finally some of them are starting to do it. It takes a lot of courage. We talk a lot about courage in our society, a lot of false courage is applauded. It takes real courage to actually take a stand against this, as at least some of these swimmers have. I think the next step, though, is for the female swimmers, or female competitors in any of these sporting events when a male shows up to realize that because the man is there, this is all a charade now. It doesn't mean anything. So, refuse to participate at all."

So you're edging them out. And this becomes - for all we hear about from the left about defending women, here - this is really the central fight when it comes to defending women in our culture. It's not just sports, it's also locker rooms, it's women's privacy, safety. Their very identities are being appropriated.

But a lot of the focus right now, Judge, is on Mariupol. The Russian Defense Ministry told Ukraine to surrender by Monday morning. Guess what? They said no. And the battering goes on. 90 percent of that city of 400,000-plus destroyed or damaged; hundreds of thousands with no food, electricity, water, medicine, a truly horrible situation. Meanwhile, in the capital of Kyiv, more artillery blasts were heard on Monday and around the clock curfew is in place as rescue workers dig through the rubble of yet another Russian missile strike, hitting shopping mall, high rise building, killing eight. Russians claimed it was a Military target. Finally, you're right. These artillery and missile blasts by the Russians could be, according to officials, a sign of what they think is Moscow switching to Plan B. They fail to win a quick decisive victory on the ground. Thanks in part to the bravery of the Ukrainian forces, and thanks in part to the Russian incompetence. Now, it looks like Russians could be digging in and trying to simply beat the Ukrainians into submission with their weaponry, their long range weaponry.

It had a promising steel and iron industry connected to its deepwater ports. It's really been a promising city which Putin has leveled. And for that reason, I think we've seen a lot of the Ukrainian people really stand strong and try to resist Putin's plan to bring the entire Donbas. It's the base of the Don River under his indirect control through quislings in Luhansk and Donetsk.

There were attacks on our Colonial Pipeline as well as (ph) GBS, the meatpacking distributor, one of the largest in the world last fall. So the Russians - coming out of Russian territory were willing to execute those sorts of attacks in the past. There have been some cyber skirmishes in the opening days of the war, which the U.S. and our cyber warriors have sought to assist the Ukrainians, also our private sector has sought to patch some other vulnerabilities. There has yet to be though the major cyber standoff, or the major cyber back and forth through this conflict between the Russians and the U.S., perhaps because the Russians already think they're overstretched in Ukraine and they don't want to expand the war.

There is no question in my mind whatsoever that she is not only soft on crime, but that she is soft on people who peddle in child pornography, people who use and avail themselves of child pornography. It is revoting. And this needs to be explored, it needs to be discussed. She needs to be given a chance, of course, to explain her side of the events. But I think the record that Senator Hawley has laid out is incontrovertible. And I'm stunned that Democrats would try to say that Republicans are in error for bringing this up.

Republicans as the party of law and order, as the party of tough on crime policies, they need to go right at this and go at it aggressively. One of the defensives that I have seen is that these were only individuals who possessed child pornography. They weren't distributing it.

I guess my friends had shared it with others, which was picked up by Exit 82 scanner news who did a hit piece on it. But guess what? It backfired."
