But first, (INAUDIBLE) comedian is a disaster as we were just talking about the White House correspondents' dinner. Ed Henry is on deck."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Last night's White House Correspondent's Dinner turned into a travesty when a comedian Michelle Wolf turned in a crude and cursing performance that not trashed the President but such aides as Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is sitting right there on the dais and Kellyanne Conway."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHELLE WOLF, COMEDIAN",

      "utterance": "Joining us now, Ed Henry, Fox's Chief International Correspondent and a past President of the White House Correspondents Association. We were both there at the dinner. I've never seen a performance like that. She was not only nasty, but she was dropping f-bombs on live television carried by CNN and MSNBC. What's your take as someone who has gone through this process?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Even worse, she was joking about abortion. I won't even repeat the jokes. They were so vile. Bottom line is I understand (Inaudible) as President. I respect her. It's a tough job. You are up there, you pick the comedian, and there is a first amendment in this country whether you like it or not. Sometimes you're going to say first amendment protects stupid and vile things as well. However, I think it's long past time -- here we are you know hours later for the association to put out a simple one sentence statement, saying we do not agree with this, these personal, vile attacks on Sarah Huckabee Sanders who is a good person. Dare I say that if Hillary Clinton had been elected and Jennifer Palmieri were up there, and got all these personal attacks about your appearance. I won't even add."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "We're talking about the first amendment. By the way, and I am hearing this on social media. I am not letting the President off the hook. When he said the press is the enemy of the American people months and months ago, that was not right. He should not have said that. You might disagree with individuals' stories to tar the entire media, including me, including you that we're the enemy of the American people. I am not letting him off the hook about that. But we should show respect to the President. We should show Press Secretary. I shouldn't even have some to say that. That's elementary. And people right now are not doing that. And she is the Press Secretary. She is a professional woman who puts herself out there. Attack her for what she says about Syria, attack her on substance, do not attack her personally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Michael would represent me and represent me on some things. He represents me like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think it's a shock that Michael Cohen represented him. We know this. There are documents of people are kind of overplaying that. However, where the President continues to kind of misstep there I think you know from a media perspective, I have never seen any public figure comment on a legal matter and it go well for them. Your lawyers tell you let that play out in the court. Don't get involved. And I think he pours gasoline on whatever fire might be out there when he comments. And so you know -- but on the other hand, I spoke to the President because it was take your daughter to work day, I think that same day. And he told me, look, I was on Fox & Friends for a half-hour and then every other network, he told me in private, played the whole thing. And even though they were criticizing him, he doesn't care. He said everybody was talking about everything I had to say, and he told me he's going to do more of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He says Kellyanne Conway says he may call the Fox & Friends once a month and was on all the cable networks, almost in real time. Here's how CNN handled it. Let's put up the banner from the Don Lemon's show. We got that, President Trump's unhinged interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "You know this is where -- you know there -- I just again, I am not giving him a pass. I think his comments on Cohen probably didn't help him. But the bottom line is you see this with banners more and more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Crazy, unhinged. The idea of fair and balanced coverage -- I am just laughing. It's not even close."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I know Don Lemon doesn't like him, but the banner is supposed to be a neutral headline. All right, you used to (Inaudible) questions at Presidents, take a quick look at NBC's Jonathan Carl, asking one the President didn't like."

    },

I've worked with John Carl. I'll try to do a (Inaudible) kind of thing. I respect John Carl, and he's a fair journalist."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, the intense focus on Donald Trump's war with the media, Hillary Clinton had some pretty hostile relations with her press corps, described by one reporter who included \"She really, really hates me.\" Joining us now from New York is Amy Chozick of the New York Times, the author of the book Chasing Hillary. Ten years, two presidential campaigns and one intact glass ceiling. Amy, you write in the book it felt damn good to bask in the girl power when Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination. You described your own coverage is neutral to positive. What part of the wet kiss is thrown, then you say when you wrote your last story after the election, you finally cried. So did you feel compromised at all as a reporter covering this candidate who you passionately believed in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AMY CHOZICK, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I want to clarify. I cried at the end because I was absolutely exhausted. And I make clear in the book it's not because Hillary lost. I mean look, if you read the book you know there was an incredibly contentious relationship between Hillary Clinton and the political press. And Hillary Clinton, specifically the New York Times and my position as the lead beat reporter. I mean she had called the political press back in the 90s big egos and no brains. And I think that tension kind of carried over and really spilled over into that U.N. press conference where she had to address the private email server for the first time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, since you bring that up, let me jump in and we'll come back to that. You say -- again, I'm just quoting from your book, the email scandal broken by the New York Times by the way, you initially thought it had no more national importance than Bristol Palin's pregnancy, and you went on to say that it was a non-story but you said I would regret and even resent that it became the only story. So you had some problems with coverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "No, I didn't compare it to Bristol Palin's pregnancy. I was comparing it to other scandals that I had covered to the volume of this scandal. I mean this is not specific to the New York Times. But you know the email server became the only story, and I think that there were plenty of other things the public should have known about Hillary Clinton, so eventually I did grow to resent that that was the only thing anyone was talking about. Positive or negative it's just the fact, there were probably other things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Perhaps it was harder to tell other things about Hillary Clinton because she had such a tortured relationship with her and such little access to the press corps. But since the book came out, you know Chelsea Clinton says you got a few things wrong, including that she was popping the champagne cork on election night when she says she was home with her baby. That's a pretty key detail."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "Well, you know and I identify with Chelsea since I have my 8- week-old baby at home right now. Look, Howie, speak to the broader theme of the book, which is they were attacking the book before it even came out, and attacking the reporting in it. And I have a lot of respect for Chelsea. I've covered this family for a decade. I kept copious notes. I went above and beyond what most authors do, which is hire a fact checker. So I think you know some of the fighting over champagne and hair treatment speaks to the broader themes of the book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You write that Hillary Clinton's coterie of mostly male aides, sometimes taunted you, made crude remarks toward you. Now we know that one of them is (Inaudible) who was on this program last week, and I asked him about that. He said he pleaded guilty. But why didn't you name them in the book. You give them these various nicknames. It almost seems like you are protecting them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "Well, as I've explained in the author's note, I didn't give these guys nicknames because I was protecting their anonymity. You've made a connection that you think one of them is Hillary's aide. The point is kind of a literary one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I know who it is because you say in the book that he also played in the debates and he acknowledges."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "This wasn't about granting anonymity. This was about -- for a reader, an average reader. My mom's book club in Texas, for instance, these guys all have similar descriptions, white, clean cut, about the same age, they all played the same role in my life, which was controlling coverage, very much trying to get in my head. And so as a literary device, they really became this kind of tragic, comic, Greek chorus. And so you know I thought for the story it would resonate with readers more to give them kind of monikers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Here's a quote. I adopted Hillary's mood, I went around despondent and aggrieved, pissed off at the world, at my editors, at myself for not being likable enough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That doesn't sound like fun."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "There is an instinct, a distinctly female instinct to want to be likeable. And I do think any campaign reporter who has been vetted with their candidate, there's often kind of you pick up the mood of the campaign, and that was a particularly joyless as Democrats describe it, joyless period in Hillary Clinton's campaign. And so when you are traveling everywhere she is and going to all these rallies, you can't help but sort of adopt that mood. My colleagues on the Bernie bus were exuding this confidence of a budding insurgency. And we had the feeling of a dreary mechanical slog a lot of the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I want to clear the air on one thing. You were on this program a year ago, excuse me, four years ago. And after Roger Ailes died last year, you wrote a piece saying that Fox gave you all this makeup and this was part of Roger Ailes' plan for sexting up female reporters. I mean I've been on every network and makeup people all try to make women and men look good. Looking back, any regrets about that cheap shot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "Look, I love the Fox News makeup artists. They make me look great. I'm incredibly grateful. I am getting very little sleep with a newborn, and they really you know turned me into being almost TV ready, I think. That was not a shot at the makeup team who work hard. They are good at their jobs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, they do work hard. And they are good at their jobs, which I was I thought it was an unfortunate anecdote. But I will say you are very candid in this book about your tortured relationship with Hillary and even your feelings about your newspaper. So, Amy Chozick thanks very much for joining us this Sunday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOZICK",
      "utterance": "Thanks for having me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Good to see you. After the break, a cultural milestone as one of America's great entertainer's is found guilty of sexual assault, the Cosby verdict next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Bill Cosby's retrial on sexual assault charges have been getting remarkably little media attention until a verdict was announced."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "A verdict in the retrial of comedian Bill Cosby, the man has now been found guilty on all charges against him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "We are under vindicated. We are validated, and we are now part of the tsunami of women's power and justice. We are not shutting up, and we are not going away. Get over it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "I thank you all in the media. You are the pillars of democracy. Without you, none of this would have happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "(Inaudible) And joining us now from New York is Carley Shimkus, a reporter for Fox News 24/7 headlines on SiriusXM. So there has been almost a universal media celebration about this verdict, despite the fact that many journalists, including me had affection for him growing up, as a comedian, as TV's Dr. Huxtable. What makes this such a cultural moment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, symbolically this trial is really so important because Bill Cosby is the first famous man to be found guilty of sexual misconduct following the #MeToo movement. You know I would like to think and I do believe that he would have been found guilty regardless. But everything that happened with Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey could have been in the back of juror's minds, because now they know that this happens a lot and this happens a lot in Hollywood."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But on that point, he wasn't found guilty the last time before the #MeToo movement exploded, before Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and so many other. Now there was another difference this time, was a different climate to be sure. But also there were several other Cosby accusers who were allowed to testify as opposed to just Andrea Constand, who was the focus of the prosecution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "That's right. So there were five other women that were allowed to testify against Bill Cosby in this case. And the DA even called those women the difference makers, because then prosecutors could sort of create the narrative that Andrea Constand was just part of a patter of behavior that Bill Cosby used. Also, Cosby hired a different legal team and they used a very different tactic, where they attacked the witnesses' character instead of their claims, suggesting Andrea Constand was a gold digger and calling another witness as somebody who slept around. So that sort of below the belt tactic did not work in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right, because he already had made a $3 million settlement with Andrea Constand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "As this thing unfolded, I was reading some of it on the inside pages in the newspapers. I mean it received remarkably little media attention, was that because it came to be seen as old news and we have sort of been through with the first trial, or was it a misjudgment by the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "You know I think that there were a couple of reasons, of course, there is so much news coming out of Washington right now. This is a retrial like you've said, so we've lived through this testimony before. Also, Bill Cosby is 80 years old. He's in poor health. And his legacy has already been destroyed. So the impact of a guilty verdict is much less than if this happened at the peak of his career."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. He'd already been convicted clearly in the court of public opinion and in the court of law. So finally, you know looking at this, though, I think there has been a tendency to think that this is now the precedent for other kinds of cases when it may be rather unique to Cosby as opposed to when you have a defendant who is not particularly famous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know I do think that every trial will be you know judged fairly and equally. And you're right. People keep on calling this a precedent. I don't necessarily think that you can make that case. But I am sure that Harvey Weinstein did look at this verdict, and he did feel very nervous for his own future, because there are so many similarities between these two men and how often they used their power to assault women and how often this happens. Wherever Harvey Weinstein is right now, he's probably very nervous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "A very different climate. Carley Shimkus, thanks very much, great to see you."

      "utterance": "Joy Reid, the MSNBC host apologized back in December after the discovery of some homophobic web posts that she had written a decade ago. But when media eye recently unearthed more posts from that era, mocking gay people and homosexuality, really ugly stuff. We came up with a rather far fetched explanation that she had been hacked, which would have to have occurred back when she was little known. And yesterday, Reid admitted that she can't prove any hacking."
    },

      "speaker": "JOY REID, MSNBC",
      "utterance": "I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things because they are completely alien to me. But I can definitely understand based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past why some people don't believe me. I have not been exempt from being dumb or cruel or hurtful to the very people I want to advocate for. I own that. I get it. And for that I am truly, truly sorry."
