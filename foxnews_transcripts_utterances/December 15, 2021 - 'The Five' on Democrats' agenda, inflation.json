They would like to get the energy costs down so they can do that by getting LNG. They would stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.

That's a huge wake-up call. Where else can you get 69 percent of Americans to agree on today? They agree on that. So, what happens? So, a progressive group puts out poll tested messaging and says here's what you do to fight back. You just blame all of the private sector for being greedy. And they tried it with the energy companies. Now they are trying it with meat. Now I'm not saying that there isn't a problem especially when it comes to the producers, like the cattle ranchers. That is a problem, I do think, and that's one of the things that both the Trump administration and the Biden administration are looking into.

As the mayor, she's got some skin in this game and she can force the DA in ways that you and I can't figure out to prosecute and make no mistake, lawlessness begets lawlessness.
