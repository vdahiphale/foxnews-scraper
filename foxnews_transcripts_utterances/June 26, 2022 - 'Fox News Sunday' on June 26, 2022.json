There are those that are tightening down on restrictions, making it nearly impossible to get an abortion in their particular state. But there are others that did expand in anticipation of what may happen in Roe being overturned. And we had Governor Polis from Colorado on \"FOX News Sunday\" a few weeks ago and I really pressed him on how far the law goes. And he couldn't give me any limitation up to and through the ninth month of pregnancy. There are number of places where that will be true across the country. So, it will be about people choosing to go those states, if that's what they choose. But keep in mind that -- with these trigger laws that go in the other direction that say there is no ability to get an abortion or after 6 weeks, 12, 15, whatever it is. The penalties in those laws, nearly every one I reviewed, the penalties are never for the woman. It is always for the doctor or the medical personnel who help her to try to obtain an abortion, or actually obtained an abortion. A number of states have made it clear they don't want the women themselves to be subject to any criminal penalties, Martha.",

You heard Governor Hochul in New York say we're putting $35 million towards this, $25 million of that is to beef up our clinics, our personnel to make sure they are able to ramp up their ability to see patients. Also interestingly enough, $10 million of that money in New York is going to go to clinic safety for abortion providers. There's nothing in that conversation about security provisions for crisis pregnancy centers who don't offer abortions but offer other options. There are private groups raising money saying, you know, if you are angry about this decision, donate here and we'll make sure that we share this money with women who need to tap into our funds. And, you know, a number of private employers as well have a -- we've got a growing list that we're keeping track of there at FOX have said we will pay as an employee benefit for people to travel. For example, Dick's sporting goods had said we will pay up to $4,000 per employee to reimburse them for travel expenses if they have to go out of state.

Nothing, he said, nothing in this opinion could be used, none of this reasoning for anything but abortion. He says, we differentiated as a different kind of right, just as Roe and Casey did, because they will look at it as involving, quote, potential life. So, he said, none of this reasoning could apply to those. Now, what's getting attention is Justice Thomas' concurrence where he says, that's true. I agree with the majority in this. He signed on to the majority. Nothing in this opinion goes to those topics. But then he has an added line because he says, when it comes to issues of substantive due process, other cases like the contraceptive, the same sex marriage cases, we may need to re-examine those at the future -- in the future at some point.

All of us in the conservative world have believed that there's nothing in the Constitution giving the federal government the right to regulate abortion. There's nothing in the Constitution that creates a right to abortion as a constitutional principle. This was judged (ph), made out of cloth law. Now, what this court has done is taken us back to pre-1973 where each state can decide through their elected officials when life begins and how to treat -- treat life. And this is a huge victory for the pro-life movement. President Trump deserves a lion share of credit here. He fought like a tiger to put three constitutional conservative judges on the court.

He made a distinction between same marriage and contraception which I think will win the day over time. One thing we're not talking about is Harry Reid. We wouldn't be here if Harry Reid had not changed the rules of the Senate, allowing a simple majority. Harry Reid believed they're going to have Democratic presidents forever.

So, here's what you have. You have a full assault on the Constitution by the left. They want to do away with Electoral College. They want to expand the number of judges on the Supreme Court to pack it. And now, they're pushing Bernie Sanders to change the rules of the Senate. The Senate will hold here. The Senate will not change. The 60-vote requirement for legislation will hold. But if you left it up to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they would blow the Senate up to get their way.

I played a sound byte a moment ago where he said back in 2006 that any abortion was a tragedy. He's definitely changed his tune on that. How does this play for the president going forward? JONATHAN SWAN, \"AXIOS\" NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: So, inside the White House they've been preparing for this since the leak happened, since the leak came out at the start of May of the decision. They immediately saw, in terms of the political dimension's oven it, they saw this as their best opportunity to energize Democratic voters this year. The guns issue was another one, but that's sort of been neutered (ph) a little bit because of the bipartisan deal on The Hill. So, to the extent that they have an issue that can rev up their base, their base has been very depressed, they've got probably the most horrible political environment for Democrats in a decade. And this issue has been, to some extent, a life raft for them. So, they're going to do a full court press on this. The vice president has a really prominent role in this. She's been meeting with pro-choice groups almost every week since that leak happened and they're going to mobilize their political and outside infrastructure to get as much political bang for their buck as they can out of this decision.",

And one thing that Republicans need to be concerned about, looking back at 2010, 2012 and 2014 Senate races is, what kind of Republican rhetoric are we going to hear from this? So, Mary Miller, last night in Illinois, talked about white life, whatever that means. This is a shade of Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, Sharron Angle, Christine O'Donnell, four Senate races that we left on the table.

They've made it their number one issue, their litmus test that takes them to the polls. It's the issue they vote on. This now shifts the dynamic. The dynamic now becomes, people who say, hey, I didn't think my abortion rights were going to go away. They've been here for 50 years. My mom, my grand mom had abortion rights and now that precedent has been erased and now I'm outraged and so I am now incentivized to go and vote. And I think for Democrats there is a big hope there.

Kind of that -- playing up that unknown fear. So, I think they will absolutely try that. Nancy Pelosi talked about what the plan is going to be for the midterms. I don't know if it works. In -- four months is a very long time, ahead of November, especially in Washington. Anything could happen. Think about what happened last year in August.

So I don't know that it helps Democrats the way I think they're hoping that it might help, especially with inflation and gas prices. That is what people are talking about mostly, especially independents. In states like Nevada, that I just went to a week ago, talking with independents, people who used to be Democrats, people who used to be Republicans who are now unaffiliated voters, so those - that's now the majority in that state.

Shannon, great to have you with us this morning. Obviously, we're continuing to get -- she's our senior legal correspondent, I should point out, as you well know and watched her throughout the week. So, tell us a little bit about the latest that the impact of this across the states, Shannon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "So, Alex did such a good job in touching on this. There were trigger laws that actually go in both directions to states across the country. There are those that are tightening down on restrictions, making it nearly impossible to get an abortion in their particular state. But there are others that did expand in anticipation of what may happen in Roe being overturned. And we had Governor Polis from Colorado on \"FOX News Sunday\" a few weeks ago and I really pressed him on how far the law goes. And he couldn't give me any limitation up to and through the ninth month of pregnancy. There are number of places where that will be true across the country. So, it will be about people choosing to go those states, if that's what they choose. But keep in mind that -- with these trigger laws that go in the other direction that say there is no ability to get an abortion or after 6 weeks, 12, 15, whatever it is. The penalties in those laws, nearly every one I reviewed, the penalties are never for the woman. It is always for the doctor or the medical personnel who help her to try to obtain an abortion, or actually obtained an abortion. A number of states have made it clear they don't want the women themselves to be subject to any criminal penalties, Martha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But, Shannon, one of the things that you hear is that it will fall on -- the burden will fall on poor women who cannot travel, who cannot get access, who can't leave their state. What is the remedy for that? Is there an accurate remedy for that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. We've heard a number of states step up and say, we're going to make sure we provide options so that our state, which is very liberal with their policy, will be an open door for women who need to travel. You heard Governor Hochul in New York say we're putting $35 million towards this, $25 million of that is to beef up our clinics, our personnel to make sure they are able to ramp up their ability to see patients. Also interestingly enough, $10 million of that money in New York is going to go to clinic safety for abortion providers. There's nothing in that conversation about security provisions for crisis pregnancy centers who don't offer abortions but offer other options. There are private groups raising money saying, you know, if you are angry about this decision, donate here and we'll make sure that we share this money with women who need to tap into our funds. And, you know, a number of private employers as well have a -- we've got a growing list that we're keeping track of there at FOX have said we will pay as an employee benefit for people to travel. For example, Dick's sporting goods had said we will pay up to $4,000 per employee to reimburse them for travel expenses if they have to go out of state. So, Martha, a lot of public and private money stepping up to address that particular question."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, I'm just thinking of something that I heard a lot of over the course of this. And I don't know if there's an answer to it yet, Shannon. But, you know, with regard to mailing prescription abortion pills across state lines. Do we know whether or not there will be restrictions on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, some states have gotten very specific. They've gone that far. They've talked about not only the in-person physical abortions that you would under go as a medical procedure, but all the pharmaceuticals that you could order. And this is something that the Biden administration has talked about, too, that they want to make sure it can cross state lines. That's going to be the next phase I think of weeding through this, to see what the different states have done and how that will work across state lines."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, with regard to the other laws out there -- same sex marriage, the use of contraception. I'm going to talk a little more about this with Senator Graham in a moment. But what is your take when you read the opinion on whether or not overturning those is possible?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Not on the basis of the reasoning in this case. And Justice Alito was very clear. He said, I don't know how I could be more clear. We are distinguishing away the issue of same sex marriage, of contraception, of other issues of sexuality this court has weighed in on. Nothing, he said, nothing in this opinion could be used, none of this reasoning for anything but abortion. He says, we differentiated as a different kind of right, just as Roe and Casey did, because they will look at it as involving, quote, potential life. So, he said, none of this reasoning could apply to those. Now, what's getting attention is Justice Thomas' concurrence where he says, that's true. I agree with the majority in this. He signed on to the majority. Nothing in this opinion goes to those topics. But then he has an added line because he says, when it comes to issues of substantive due process, other cases like the contraceptive, the same sex marriage cases, we may need to re-examine those at the future -- in the future at some point. But he's saying nothing in this case gets us to that conversation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, what it does, it takes us back to before 1973. Before 1973, the law of the land was that each state can decide the issue of life when life begins, whether or not to have an abortion, what circumstances around having an abortion. All of us in the conservative world have believed that there's nothing in the Constitution giving the federal government the right to regulate abortion. There's nothing in the Constitution that creates a right to abortion as a constitutional principle. This was judged (ph), made out of cloth law. Now, what this court has done is taken us back to pre-1973 where each state can decide through their elected officials when life begins and how to treat -- treat life. And this is a huge victory for the pro-life movement. President Trump deserves a lion share of credit here. He fought like a tiger to put three constitutional conservative judges on the court. He stood behind Kavanaugh. And all of us who've been working for the last 50 years to get this right, to have a constitutional reset, Friday was a glorious day."

    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, it's satisfying to know that through the constitutional process, you can make a difference. You know, when Roe came out, we didn't burn down the Capitol, as conservatives. We didn't go to liberal justices' homes and try to intimidate them. The radical left are constitutional anarchists. They are literally trying to change the country from top to bottom. They want to pack the court because they don't like this decision. They want to abolish the Electoral College so California and New York can pick the president in perpetuity. At the end of the day, they want to federalize elections, take it away from the states, to make sure you have ballot harvesting and do away voter IDs. So, these constitutional anarchist -- here's my advice to you. Quite trying to burn down America and work like we did in the fields. Elect people who agree with you at the ballot box. Your next guest, one of your next guests is from Georgia. I'm dying to say what she will say about how she would handle as governor any effort to regulate abortion in her state. This was won through the ballot box by conservatives and we're not going to liberals intimidate the rule of law system to take it away from us."

But it's not going to change the 2022 outcome. Most Americans believe that -- I really do believe most Americans are comfortable with elected officials making decision about life. Let every state do it the way they would like. What's going to be on the ballot box is $5 gas. You can't walk down the street without being attacked. Crime is rampant. We have broken borders. But, yeah, this is a -- this is a big day for the pro-life movement. For all of you -- I wish Henry Hyde were alive so he could see this. For all of you who have been working for 50 years to elect members of the House and Senate and presidents that would put constitutional conservatives on the court, your day finally arrived. And to the left, the way you do this, is to do what we did. You take to it the ballot box. You don't try to destroy America. These constitutional anarchists like AOC have to be dealt with.

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I really respect Clarence Thomas. They tried to destroy him. Remember his confirmation process? They tried to destroy Kavanaugh. You know, Bush 41 stood by Clarence Thomas. President Trump stood by Kavanaugh and here we are today. But Alito I think set the right tone. He said nothing in this decision puts those cases at risk. The reason he decided that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided is because it deals with the potential for life. These other privacy issues like contraception. Do not deal with the potential for life. He made a distinction between same marriage and contraception which I think will win the day over time. One thing we're not talking about is Harry Reid. We wouldn't be here if Harry Reid had not changed the rules of the Senate, allowing a simple majority. Harry Reid believed they're going to have Democratic presidents forever. He took the rule the Senate, he changed them. And those simple majority rules led to Trump getting three great conservatives on the court. And one thing we're not talking about is Justice Ginsburg, who was a mighty voice for the liberal cause. She chose not to retire. So, it was amazing series of events that allowed us to get here today. And at the state level, to my friends on the left, you're going to have a hell of a fight on your hands at the state level, at the ballot box, and that's what they should have been all along."

But your colleagues in the Senate, Joe Manchin, he's a pro-life Catholic. He's calling for legislation to codify Roe v. Wade. Murkowski, Collins also doing the same. Bernie Sanders says we got to end the filibuster, and we must codify as the law Roe and Casey. What do you say to them?"
    },

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

It allows states to determine life, not five unelected judges. I don't see -- Susan Collins or Murkowski are pro-choice -- changing the rules of the Senate. The rules of the Senate would require 60 votes to enshrine Roe v. Wade. Unless you blow up the Senate, that's not going to happen any time soon. As conservatives, you'd need 62 votes. So, here's what you have. You have a full assault on the Constitution by the left. They want to do away with Electoral College. They want to expand the number of judges on the Supreme Court to pack it. And now, they're pushing Bernie Sanders to change the rules of the Senate. The Senate will hold here. The Senate will not change. The 60-vote requirement for legislation will hold. But if you left it up to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, they would blow the Senate up to get their way. All these people just want an outcome. The constitutional provisions restricting their ability to win, those be damned. We want to change America to get outcomes. And conservatives are going to fight and we're going to uphold the Constitution. And I don't think Joe Manchin or Sinema or Murkowski or Collins are going to blow up the Senate because they're disappointed with this court ruling. I don't believe that. I pray they will not."

He's governing in the most radical way in any president maybe in modern history. What happened is the radical left has taken over the Democratic Party. And he is going where they're taking him. What do they want to do in light of this opinion? They want to change the makeup of the court, to pack it with additional judges so it will become liberal, not conservative. What do they want to do when it comes to elections? They want to federalize elections, take the power away from the states, institute ballot harvesting, and doing away with voter IDs. They want to make D.C. and Puerto Rico a state. At the end of the day, their constitutional anarchists are in charge of the Democratic Party. And I appreciate President Biden saying to the left, don't use violence. What I worry about is this protest going unchecked at judges' homes is giving a green light to there are no rules anymore. If we don't watch it, somebody's going to get killed out here. And I'm urging Merrick Garland to start putting people in jail who show up at justices' homes to try and intimidate them and their family. If we don't reset here pretty soon, somebody's going to get killed. Do what we did. Go to the ballot box. Try to win elections. Don't burn down the country."

What is more concerning to me though is the notion that our constitutional rights and bodily autonomy that women for 50 years have come to rely on will now be subject to state by state imprimatur rather than being governed by a federal notion that no matter who you are, no matter where you live, we live in the United States and our ability to control our bodies should be sacrosanct regardless of state lines."

Black women in Georgia face the highest maternal mortality rate. They are three times more likely to die. We know that Black women are the most likely to be underserved by their medical care.

But I don't think that's where we are and I don't think that's where we have to be. My intent is to balance public safety and justice. Because doing otherwise has never worked. We cannot punish our way into public safety. But we also have to recognize that there are deep challenges in how law enforcement engages our communities. And that is why I'm pushing both for public safety measures, accountability measures, and criminal justice reform measures. What I believe most fundamentally, and this is true if you look at my entire record, is that living wages have to be paid especially to our public worker, especially to law enforcement. And in the state of Georgia, if you're a correctional officer, you made $39,000. If you're a community supervisor, that is someone who deals with probation and parole, and Georgia has the highest rate in the nation, you make $39,000. If you're a trooper cadet, you make a little under - you make a little over $40,000."

That it -- what we saw was a mass leaving of the - of office of police officers across the country? We saw an increase in homicide rates, 19 percent in Atlanta, 55 percent last year. Do you think it was a mistake to defund the police, to have this movement across the country?"

      "utterance": "The intention that we had in 2020 was to call attention to the harm that was being done to black people by the police. We have a litany of murders that shocked the consciences of every American. But let's be clear, in the state of Georgia, violent crime went up 55 percent in 2019 to 2020 under Brian Kemp. It had nothing to do with the reaction to George Floyd's murder, to Rayshard Brooks' murder, to Ahmaud Arbery's murder, to Breonna Taylor's murder. It happened under Brian Kemp's leadership. It happened under a president and a governor who believed that punishment rather than a balanced approach was the answer. We know that has never worked. That we have to have both public safety and justice. And that's simply the intention that I have. Let us invest in our public safety workers. Let us invest in making certain that our communities are served, that we center the well-being of our communities, that we think about their health care, we think about their safety and we think about those who are providing that safety. I want us to have the best law enforcement possible to protect our communities, but they also have to be held accountable. And we can do both and. It is a false choice to say that we have to do one or the other."

This is a dangerous movement that has led to a lot of violence and unrest in cities across the country. Do you disagree?"

      "utterance": "I am pointing to the data that is in Georgia. And we saw the largest increase in violent crime preceding that conversation that happened after George Floyd was murdered, after Ahmaud Arbery was murdered. Let' be clear, Georgia was facing a rise in assaults, a rise in violent crime. We're going to face a rise in gun violence because we have a governor who has weakened gun laws and allowed dangerous people to carry weapons without a permit, without a background check. And so I think it is very convenient to try to attach this to one moment that is insufficient in terms of its data and in terms of its outcome. But we know in Georgia, the number of people leaving law enforcement often cite pay. They cite pay, they cite morale and that's because they are not feeling completely supported by our governor and by our leadership."

Before I let you go, I want to ask you one more question, and it's about President Biden. His approval numbers are at 39 percent. Obviously, we have soaring inflation. We've got gas prices that are putting a real dent in people's wallets across the country.

Welcome to all of you. It's great to be with you in Washington.

I also think there's a lot of other issues that are going to be in play, like inflation. I think it's certainly an issue that people are concerned about, and gas prices.

I played a sound byte a moment ago where he said back in 2006 that any abortion was a tragedy. He's definitely changed his tune on that. How does this play for the president going forward? JONATHAN SWAN, \"AXIOS\" NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: So, inside the White House they've been preparing for this since the leak happened, since the leak came out at the start of May of the decision. They immediately saw, in terms of the political dimension's oven it, they saw this as their best opportunity to energize Democratic voters this year. The guns issue was another one, but that's sort of been neutered (ph) a little bit because of the bipartisan deal on The Hill. So, to the extent that they have an issue that can rev up their base, their base has been very depressed, they've got probably the most horrible political environment for Democrats in a decade. And this issue has been, to some extent, a life raft for them. So, they're going to do a full court press on this. The vice president has a really prominent role in this. She's been meeting with pro-choice groups almost every week since that leak happened and they're going to mobilize their political and outside infrastructure to get as much political bang for their buck as they can out of this decision."

We don't know if it's, as Jonathan mentioned, how much that's going to motivate Democrats versus all the other things that everyday Americans are dealing with every day, inflation being the most prominent example. And one thing that Republicans need to be concerned about, looking back at 2010, 2012 and 2014 Senate races is, what kind of Republican rhetoric are we going to hear from this? So, Mary Miller, last night in Illinois, talked about white life, whatever that means. This is a shade of Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, Sharron Angle, Christine O'Donnell, four Senate races that we left on the table. And it's one reason in Missouri that Republicans are so concerned about Erick Wright and this potentially being the nominee, as opposed to the other candidates who have -- don't have the controversial rhetoric and also private life that he has had."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You know, how do Republicans sort of frame this discussion and how do they talk about it given the fact, Juan, that you're going to have a lot of moderate voters in places like Pennsylvania or Michigan who may be swayed by this issue. It's really difficult to tell how much though given the things that Doug points out, given inflation, given gas prices. How much is it going to matter?"

    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it does matter. And it matters if you look back at exactly the segment of the electorate that decided some past elections, you point directly at suburban white women and you'd say, are they motivated to turn out to vote? Is this a big issue for them? What we know historically is that abortion has really been a trigger for people who are opposed to abortion rights. They've made it their number one issue, their litmus test that takes them to the polls. It's the issue they vote on. This now shifts the dynamic. The dynamic now becomes, people who say, hey, I didn't think my abortion rights were going to go away. They've been here for 50 years. My mom, my grand mom had abortion rights and now that precedent has been erased and now I'm outraged and so I am now incentivized to go and vote. And I think for Democrats there is a big hope there. I think you're looking, just picking up on what Doug was talking about, you're looking not only at those states, you're looking at Arizona, with the Mark Kelly race, you're looking at Pennsylvania in a big way in terms of that -- the governor's race and the Senate race, where all of a sudden the suburbs outside of Pittsburgh, outside of Philadelphia, they are going to make a big difference."

You know, I mean I -- I think it's an open question, Aishah, when you look at this issue because it has been a very long time that this has been in place and yet a lot has changed in the world since then. I look at these young womens pro-life groups who are outside the Capitol. They have grown in size. You look at the Hispanic vote, which is now becoming more conservative slowly over time. What about the political impact of this?"

      "speaker": "AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",

I think if they can try to bottle this emotion up that we're seeing out in the streets, a call for protests, to try to pour that into the midterms, it could work. I could see some sort of ads out there playing like - playing on that unknown fear of, you know, something like, you know, if you saw what they took away from you with reproductive rights, think about what else they could take away. Kind of that -- playing up that unknown fear. So, I think they will absolutely try that. Nancy Pelosi talked about what the plan is going to be for the midterms. I don't know if it works. In -- four months is a very long time, ahead of November, especially in Washington. Anything could happen. Think about what happened last year in August. I mean we're approaching that one year anniversary. If something like that were to happen again, things could definitely go a different direction. So I don't know that it helps Democrats the way I think they're hoping that it might help, especially with inflation and gas prices. That is what people are talking about mostly, especially independents. In states like Nevada, that I just went to a week ago, talking with independents, people who used to be Democrats, people who used to be Republicans who are now unaffiliated voters, so those - that's now the majority in that state. They are mostly worried about gas prices, inflation, not as much about social issues."

But this decision really is a tremendous burden on working class to middle class women, and specifically those who are Latino, black women who, you know, may have a child. Most people who have abortions have a child. Half of them are in poverty. So, someone who is like trying to get their nursing certificate suddenly, you know, an unintended pregnancy, suddenly their life choices are limited because their rights have been taken away. The court talks about individual rights and individual liberties. They've taken away individual liberty from these people."

And, actually, despite all of the early kind of heady optimism, Russia, it's digging -- they're digging in and they're making slow gains. And this is looking like it's developing into a war of attrition. So, the big challenge for Biden right now is keeping unity in the west. That's easier said than done. You're already seeing here in America how strong the argument is particularly on the right in the base, in the right, about not sending any more money to Ukraine. And we've got all these problems here domestically, why are we sending $40 billion to Ukraine? They're going to have a lot more trouble when they come back to The Hill again to get something else for Ukraine. This is becoming a more and more difficult issue. So, they're trying to hold it together and it's really fragile. It's very, very fragile, this coalition that they've got together."

You've got countries like India that are now importing a ton of Russian oil. So, you have to think about why we're not hearing more of that from congressional leaders. Why we're not talking about secondary sanctions when other countries around the world are seemingly looking the other way and not, you know, siding with us on this. So, I do wonder why they're not questioning more about that and -- when the front door is open - when the front door is closed, but the back door is open, does it really matter?
