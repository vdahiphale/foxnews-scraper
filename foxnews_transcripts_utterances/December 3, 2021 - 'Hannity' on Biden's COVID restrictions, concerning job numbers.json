      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY this news breaking Friday night. It is now day 111 -- that's right -- since Joe Biden abandoned our fellow Americans trapped in Afghanistan including military families, hundreds of them, thousands of green card holders and, of course, our Afghan allies, something he said days earlier he'd never do. Joe Biden has turned the page. The mob and the media's turned the page. We will not -- we will remind everybody until they are home safely. Now, of course, this is one of many self-inflicted crises that Biden is unwilling incapable of resolving. Now, breaking earlier, more really bad news for Americans, the November jobs report was a disaster abysmal, falling way short of every projection. Keep in mind: we are already facing a severe worker shortage in the country. We now have record-setting inflation, a 31-year high. You're now paying on average about a buck more a gallon. That's 20, 25, 30 bucks more every time you fill up your tank. We're paying a fortune now to heat and cool our homes, and everything you buy in every store you go to is costing more because of Joe Biden's stagnant growth and now, it is getting worse. But don't take my word for it. Let's look at CNBC. The U.S. economy created far fewer jobs than expected in November and a sign that hiring started to slow ahead of the new coveted threat. But today, Biden proudly announced that this was quote incredible news and that our economic recovery is going strong. What world are you living in, Joe? Now, I thought Biden promised to shut down the virus, not the economy, what happened? Now one big problem for Joe is you just can't lie your way out of a crisis. Americans are suffering. Look at the Gallup poll today. We'll get into that in a minute. And the truth be told, it doesn't appear that Joe can do much of anything at this point in his life. He's frail. He's weak. He's confused. He's confounded. He's mumbling he's a bumbling cognitive mess and even a simple tree lighting, that became a massive struggle. You can't make this up either. Take a look.",

But we also know that it's been less than a week since he was up in Nantucket shopping indoors, he had his mask pulled down at a place where masks were required. So it was worth asking and I didn't just ask him, I asked Jen Psaki about the COVID tests for the president and she said, well, he's tested positive -- or he's tested negative a few times in a row. I reminded her that she also tested negative a few times in a row before her positive test, but no changes to his schedule yet. The bigger thing though right now and we've all been living in this world for the last two full years almost, the instructions from the federal government, if you have any kind of a symptoms, whether you are vaccinated or not, regardless of a test that day, you're not supposed to go to work. And I get that the president has a home office behind us. He lives at work. But it was surprising to see him showing those symptoms out there.

Yesterday, Biden's approval rating hit a new low in a morning console poll, and also a new low in the Trafalgar Robert Cahaly poll, 36 percent. Believe it or not, the numbers for his vice president, that's Kamala Harris right there, are even worse. As it turns out, Kamala Harris is not just hated by hundreds of millions of Americans, she's also deeply unpopular with her own staff. Things are getting worse every day. New reports out, a mass exodus is in the works. You have three top staffers that have already announced their departures from the office of the vice president. Many others are now worried about being permanently branded a Harris person which are fate -- I guess they view that as a fate worse than perhaps even death apparently. Some are being burned out from what they are describing as an extremely toxic work environment. Now, whatever is happening, it doesn't bode well for Kamala's presidential ambitions. Now maybe she should take some time away from the office, and maybe as borders czar, go visit the actual southern border, not where the action is, not someplace distant from where things are happening. Here with reaction, author of the brand new book \"Beyond Biden: Rebuilding the America that We Love\", FOX News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. You know, I've never really asked you this but I think it's time. Almost every night now, we're playing Joe Biden. For a period, I was -- I made fun of it. It's not funny anymore. He can barely form a sentence at times. It's incomprehensible at other times. Nancy Pelosi the same thing, you just heard what we played. Does America have to worry about two of the top leaders of this country in the free world being a cognitive mess?",

The Chinese are developing a whole series of systems designed to defeat us. They have a very effective international diplomatic strategy. They're developing all sorts of new weapons. We've had a series of admirals tell us that we lose every single war game in which we try to take on communist China for Taiwan. We just had a leading general in the space command who reported that we are being attacked every day. We noticed, I paid attention. We're being attacked every day by the Russians and the Chinese in space assets. We are in a huge problem. We have a news media incapable of dealing seriously with the world and we have national leadership in the White House and in Nancy Pelosi and to some extent Schumer who are in incapable of the kind of changes we need. So I think we're now entering one of the most dangerous periods in American history, rivaling the period just before the civil war or the period of the Revolutionary War, and I think people need to understand how really deeply serious the crisis is going to become, and all of our opponents as you just said all of our opponents are watching Biden fall asleep. They're watching Kamala Harris laughing and they're thinking themselves, this is the executive branch leadership? This is the commander-in-chief?

Then you have to ask the question if they're compromised because the Bidens did a lot of business, had a lot of business dealings with both China and Russia. So I think those things come into play. And look at the Canadian economy is thriving but our economy is a disaster under Biden and the people that are being hurt the most are the poor and the middle class, because of the 31-year high in inflation, and the higher cost of energy.",

A corruption which involves Ukraine, Russia and China is clearly a national security crisis explains a lot of the timidity that Biden has towards dealing with China. In terms of the impact of inflation which is in essence a tax. This administration, the fact is big government socialism does not work. We're watching it in inflation. We're watching it in unemployment, we're watching it in energy prices, we're watching it at the border, we're watching in our school systems. And I think this is all going to come crashing down next year and I think we may have a historic sweep on a scale that even you and I and we were together in 1994 when we picked up 53 seats, John Boehner picked up 64 seats. I think this could be a sweep that far exceeds those because I think people are going to form a -- this ain't working coalition. That's more than just Republicans.

We'll follow that story. And also tonight, out in the great city of Chicago, the trial of hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett, well, that kicked off this week. Prosecutors detailed his alleged efforts to use the staged attack where the actor said he was targeted by Trump supporters in Chicago as a ploy to demand a higher salary on the show \"Empire\". And we also learned that Jussie Smollett apparently set up a dry run of the fake attack the day before with his two alleged accomplices now Smollett is facing six counts relating to the false statements he made to police. And don't forget, this scandal is also a media scandal and is the media mob along with Democrats like, oh, Kamala Harris amplified Smollett's lies with breathless hysteria, despite no facts to ever back up the story. Remember, Kamala Harris tweeted back in 2019, quote, this was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or the color of their skin.

Number two, he is going to be sued up the kazoo by so many people and number three he's got a future career he thinks that he's got to worry about. So this was not something he decided to just do on the fly. Let me make one thing clear. The fact that so many weeks have passed since Halyna Hutchins was killed tells me that he has had now a chance to assess everything, make a decision as to what he's going to say, what his story is, and this whole thing about how I'm not responsible somebody else is. Look, it's his production company. He was in charge of hiring those people who worked on that set and for him to absolve himself and to somehow claim that he's a victim is contrary to what the facts and the evidence will show in this case ultimately.

It is now day 111 -- that's right -- since Joe Biden abandoned our fellow Americans trapped in Afghanistan including military families, hundreds of them, thousands of green card holders and, of course, our Afghan allies, something he said days earlier he'd never do. Joe Biden has turned the page. The mob and the media's turned the page. We will not -- we will remind everybody until they are home safely. Now, of course, this is one of many self-inflicted crises that Biden is unwilling incapable of resolving. Now, breaking earlier, more really bad news for Americans, the November jobs report was a disaster abysmal, falling way short of every projection. Keep in mind: we are already facing a severe worker shortage in the country. We now have record-setting inflation, a 31-year high. You're now paying on average about a buck more a gallon. That's 20, 25, 30 bucks more every time you fill up your tank. We're paying a fortune now to heat and cool our homes, and everything you buy in every store you go to is costing more because of Joe Biden's stagnant growth and now, it is getting worse. But don't take my word for it. Let's look at CNBC. The U.S. economy created far fewer jobs than expected in November and a sign that hiring started to slow ahead of the new coveted threat. But today, Biden proudly announced that this was quote incredible news and that our economic recovery is going strong. What world are you living in, Joe? Now, I thought Biden promised to shut down the virus, not the economy, what happened? Now one big problem for Joe is you just can't lie your way out of a crisis. Americans are suffering. Look at the Gallup poll today. We'll get into that in a minute. And the truth be told, it doesn't appear that Joe can do much of anything at this point in his life. He's frail. He's weak. He's confused. He's confounded. He's mumbling he's a bumbling cognitive mess and even a simple tree lighting, that became a massive struggle. You can't make this up either. Take a look.",

I reminded her that she also tested negative a few times in a row before her positive test, but no changes to his schedule yet.

And I get that the president has a home office behind us. He lives at work. But it was surprising to see him showing those symptoms out there.

Yesterday, Biden's approval rating hit a new low in a morning console poll, and also a new low in the Trafalgar Robert Cahaly poll, 36 percent. Believe it or not, the numbers for his vice president, that's Kamala Harris right there, are even worse. As it turns out, Kamala Harris is not just hated by hundreds of millions of Americans, she's also deeply unpopular with her own staff. Things are getting worse every day. New reports out, a mass exodus is in the works. You have three top staffers that have already announced their departures from the office of the vice president. Many others are now worried about being permanently branded a Harris person which are fate -- I guess they view that as a fate worse than perhaps even death apparently. Some are being burned out from what they are describing as an extremely toxic work environment. Now, whatever is happening, it doesn't bode well for Kamala's presidential ambitions. Now maybe she should take some time away from the office, and maybe as borders czar, go visit the actual southern border, not where the action is, not someplace distant from where things are happening. Here with reaction, author of the brand new book \"Beyond Biden: Rebuilding the America that We Love\", FOX News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. You know, I've never really asked you this but I think it's time. Almost every night now, we're playing Joe Biden. For a period, I was -- I made fun of it. It's not funny anymore. He can barely form a sentence at times. It's incomprehensible at other times. Nancy Pelosi the same thing, you just heard what we played.

We've had a series of admirals tell us that we lose every single war game in which we try to take on communist China for Taiwan. We just had a leading general in the space command who reported that we are being attacked every day. We noticed, I paid attention. We're being attacked every day by the Russians and the Chinese in space assets. We are in a huge problem. We have a news media incapable of dealing seriously with the world and we have national leadership in the White House and in Nancy Pelosi and to some extent Schumer who are in incapable of the kind of changes we need. So I think we're now entering one of the most dangerous periods in American history, rivaling the period just before the civil war or the period of the Revolutionary War, and I think people need to understand how really deeply serious the crisis is going to become, and all of our opponents as you just said all of our opponents are watching Biden fall asleep.

Then you have to ask the question if they're compromised because the Bidens did a lot of business, had a lot of business dealings with both China and Russia. So I think those things come into play. And look at the Canadian economy is thriving but our economy is a disaster under Biden and the people that are being hurt the most are the poor and the middle class, because of the 31-year high in inflation, and the higher cost of energy.",

A corruption which involves Ukraine, Russia and China is clearly a national security crisis explains a lot of the timidity that Biden has towards dealing with China. In terms of the impact of inflation which is in essence a tax. This administration, the fact is big government socialism does not work. We're watching it in inflation. We're watching it in unemployment, we're watching it in energy prices, we're watching it at the border, we're watching in our school systems.

We'll follow that story. And also tonight, out in the great city of Chicago, the trial of hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett, well, that kicked off this week. Prosecutors detailed his alleged efforts to use the staged attack where the actor said he was targeted by Trump supporters in Chicago as a ploy to demand a higher salary on the show \"Empire\". And we also learned that Jussie Smollett apparently set up a dry run of the fake attack the day before with his two alleged accomplices now Smollett is facing six counts relating to the false statements he made to police. And don't forget, this scandal is also a media scandal and is the media mob along with Democrats like, oh, Kamala Harris amplified Smollett's lies with breathless hysteria, despite no facts to ever back up the story.

He was in charge of hiring those people who worked on that set and for him to absolve himself and to somehow claim that he's a victim is contrary to what the facts and the evidence will show in this case ultimately.

It is now day 111 -- that's right -- since Joe Biden abandoned our fellow Americans trapped in Afghanistan including military families, hundreds of them, thousands of green card holders and, of course, our Afghan allies, something he said days earlier he'd never do. Joe Biden has turned the page. The mob and the media's turned the page. We will not -- we will remind everybody until they are home safely. Now, of course, this is one of many self-inflicted crises that Biden is unwilling incapable of resolving. Now, breaking earlier, more really bad news for Americans, the November jobs report was a disaster abysmal, falling way short of every projection."

That's 20, 25, 30 bucks more every time you fill up your tank. We're paying a fortune now to heat and cool our homes, and everything you buy in every store you go to is costing more because of Joe Biden's stagnant growth and now, it is getting worse. But don't take my word for it. Let's look at CNBC. The U.S. economy created far fewer jobs than expected in November and a sign that hiring started to slow ahead of the new coveted threat. But today, Biden proudly announced that this was quote incredible news and that our economic recovery is going strong. What world are you living in, Joe? Now, I thought Biden promised to shut down the virus, not the economy, what happened? Now one big problem for Joe is you just can't lie your way out of a crisis. Americans are suffering. Look at the Gallup poll today. We'll get into that in a minute. And the truth be told, it doesn't appear that Joe can do much of anything at this point in his life. He's frail. He's weak. He's confused. He's confounded. He's mumbling he's a bumbling cognitive mess and even a simple tree lighting, that became a massive struggle. You can't make this up either. Take a look."

But we also know that it's been less than a week since he was up in Nantucket shopping indoors, he had his mask pulled down at a place where masks were required. So it was worth asking and I didn't just ask him, I asked Jen Psaki about the COVID tests for the president and she said, well, he's tested positive -- or he's tested negative a few times in a row. I reminded her that she also tested negative a few times in a row before her positive test, but no changes to his schedule yet. The bigger thing though right now and we've all been living in this world for the last two full years almost, the instructions from the federal government, if you have any kind of a symptoms, whether you are vaccinated or not, regardless of a test that day, you're not supposed to go to work. And I get that the president has a home office behind us. He lives at work. But it was surprising to see him showing those symptoms out there. But we have been assured that he is okay and he's going to go to Camp David this weekend and then he's going to come back on Sunday to see the Kennedy Center honors where they're going to honor uh and celebrate Lauren Michaels and Bette Midler -- Sean."

      "utterance": "Peter Doocy, thank you at the White House. Yesterday, Biden's approval rating hit a new low in a morning console poll, and also a new low in the Trafalgar Robert Cahaly poll, 36 percent. Believe it or not, the numbers for his vice president, that's Kamala Harris right there, are even worse. As it turns out, Kamala Harris is not just hated by hundreds of millions of Americans, she's also deeply unpopular with her own staff. Things are getting worse every day. New reports out, a mass exodus is in the works. You have three top staffers that have already announced their departures from the office of the vice president. Many others are now worried about being permanently branded a Harris person which are fate -- I guess they view that as a fate worse than perhaps even death apparently. Some are being burned out from what they are describing as an extremely toxic work environment. Now, whatever is happening, it doesn't bode well for Kamala's presidential ambitions. Now maybe she should take some time away from the office, and maybe as borders czar, go visit the actual southern border, not where the action is, not someplace distant from where things are happening. Here with reaction, author of the brand new book \"Beyond Biden: Rebuilding the America that We Love\", FOX News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. You know, I've never really asked you this but I think it's time. Almost every night now, we're playing Joe Biden. For a period, I was -- I made fun of it. It's not funny anymore. He can barely form a sentence at times. It's incomprehensible at other times. Nancy Pelosi the same thing, you just heard what we played. Does America have to worry about two of the top leaders of this country in the free world being a cognitive mess?"

    {
      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "This is the most dangerous administration since Buchanan who was the president just before the Civil War. No one should kid themselves. The Chinese are developing a whole series of systems designed to defeat us. They have a very effective international diplomatic strategy. They're developing all sorts of new weapons. We've had a series of admirals tell us that we lose every single war game in which we try to take on communist China for Taiwan. We just had a leading general in the space command who reported that we are being attacked every day. We noticed, I paid attention. We're being attacked every day by the Russians and the Chinese in space assets. We are in a huge problem. We have a news media incapable of dealing seriously with the world and we have national leadership in the White House and in Nancy Pelosi and to some extent Schumer who are in incapable of the kind of changes we need. So I think we're now entering one of the most dangerous periods in American history, rivaling the period just before the civil war or the period of the Revolutionary War, and I think people need to understand how really deeply serious the crisis is going to become, and all of our opponents as you just said all of our opponents are watching Biden fall asleep. They're watching Kamala Harris laughing and they're thinking themselves, this is the executive branch leadership? This is the commander-in-chief? Those are signals of weakness that are extraordinarily dangerous when seen by people as tough as Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Look, Putin obviously sees an opportunity I would argue. That's why he is now building up troop strength on the border with Ukraine. President Xi, I don't think, gives a flying rip what Joe Biden has to say as he's flying his fighter jets in Taiwan airspace and threatening reunification with Taiwan. Then you have to ask the question if they're compromised because the Bidens did a lot of business, had a lot of business dealings with both China and Russia. So I think those things come into play. And look at the Canadian economy is thriving but our economy is a disaster under Biden and the people that are being hurt the most are the poor and the middle class, because of the 31-year high in inflation, and the higher cost of energy."

Her new book \"Laptop from Hell\" is unbelievable and you cannot read that book and not reach a conclusion that President Biden knew what his brother and his son were doing and that it involves a level of corruption that I think we have never seen. A corruption which involves Ukraine, Russia and China is clearly a national security crisis explains a lot of the timidity that Biden has towards dealing with China. In terms of the impact of inflation which is in essence a tax. This administration, the fact is big government socialism does not work. We're watching it in inflation. We're watching it in unemployment, we're watching it in energy prices, we're watching it at the border, we're watching in our school systems. And I think this is all going to come crashing down next year and I think we may have a historic sweep on a scale that even you and I and we were together in 1994 when we picked up 53 seats, John Boehner picked up 64 seats. I think this could be a sweep that far exceeds those because I think people are going to form a -- this ain't working coalition. That's more than just Republicans. It's going to be Republicans, Democrats, independents who look around and go, \"This ain't working\"."

And remember, an investigation into the shooting is ongoing and many legal experts are warning that it may have been a mistake for Baldwin to speak out and explaining that his comments could end up being used against him in criminal or civil proceedings. We'll follow that story. And also tonight, out in the great city of Chicago, the trial of hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett, well, that kicked off this week. Prosecutors detailed his alleged efforts to use the staged attack where the actor said he was targeted by Trump supporters in Chicago as a ploy to demand a higher salary on the show \"Empire\". And we also learned that Jussie Smollett apparently set up a dry run of the fake attack the day before with his two alleged accomplices now Smollett is facing six counts relating to the false statements he made to police. And don't forget, this scandal is also a media scandal and is the media mob along with Democrats like, oh, Kamala Harris amplified Smollett's lies with breathless hysteria, despite no facts to ever back up the story. Remember, Kamala Harris tweeted back in 2019, quote, this was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or the color of their skin. We must confront this hate. Completely shameless, completely clueless, completely fake news. Here with reaction all of this, the host of \"Justice,\" Judge Jeanine Pirro, along with FOX News contributor Joe Concha. Let's start with what happened with Alec Baldwin, Judge and I watched him and Leo 2.0 Terrell, very smart attorney, he's been a civil rights attorney his whole career, first thing he said is there's no way he did that interview without being coached and without being prepared by lawyers. I would have to believe that's probably true, we don't know. And then you got to remember he's an actor, and then you got this whole other side with ABC playing that ridiculous music.

      "utterance": "Okay. First of all, there is no doubt in my mind, I would -- I would gamble my house on this one, that he was prepped that they went through many sessions on how he would respond number one. There is still a possibility of his being charged criminally. Number two, he is going to be sued up the kazoo by so many people and number three he's got a future career he thinks that he's got to worry about. So this was not something he decided to just do on the fly. Let me make one thing clear. The fact that so many weeks have passed since Halyna Hutchins was killed tells me that he has had now a chance to assess everything, make a decision as to what he's going to say, what his story is, and this whole thing about how I'm not responsible somebody else is. Look, it's his production company. He was in charge of hiring those people who worked on that set and for him to absolve himself and to somehow claim that he's a victim is contrary to what the facts and the evidence will show in this case ultimately. And his -- his desire to be seen as a victim and as a pathetic guy who looks so horrible is countered by the evidence."

But now that I've had a chance to watch it, I will tell you -- Mika Brzezinski is right.

And as for Baldwin, the judge is exactly right. He attempted to throw everyone else under the bus, all while somehow playing the victim. Baldwin's saying, I didn't pull the trigger -- well, okay, who did? The sheriff in this case is correct. Guns don't fire themselves. Baldwin when asked, do you feel any guilt? He answers bluntly, no. That's not good. So, look this was a PR stunt to try to curry public opinion in Baldwin's favor clearly and after 90 minutes, we're only left with more questions and answers and it seems the more this actor speaks the more questions are raised, Sean."

And then, Kamala Harris, as usual, rushing to judgment. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of skin. We must confront this hate. Now, I'll say this about Alec Baldwin, some people may not like it. I stay consistent -- due process, presumption of innocence, let this play out in a court of law as it will.

But I'm telling you what this and this is what I've said on my show repeatedly, I believe in the jury system, the jury will get it right, the left and those people in the mainstream media will buy into it, but we don't.

Remember when he took office, he told you the American people, it would only be a hundred days of masks. Then he said, oh, you can vax, or you can mask. And then he claimed to -- at the debate with President Trump, any president who oversaw 220,000 deaths had, quote, no business being president. You still stand by that, Joe? Because during your time as president, over 355,000 Americans have died of COVID. More people now have died in 2021 than 2020. And during the campaign, Biden also claimed he had a secret plan. He's going to shut down the virus. Obviously, another lie. And get this, now, Biden wants even more travel restrictions for you, the law-abiding American citizens, and foreign travelers. But guess what? Preferential treatment, that exists. If you're an illegal immigrant, you come across the border, you don't have a COVID test, there's no vaccine mandate and you got free transportation to the state of your choice. Does that make sense to you? Ask yourself, why does the Biden administration seem to think that COVID can spread everywhere except the southern border? Whatever happened to follow the science consistently? Anyway, here with reaction all this, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. You know, Senator, basically, it's become follow the science only when convenient because if we're following the science, the science out of Israel and I believe Qatar now is a second country, but the Israel case showing natural immunity was 27 times more effective in warding off the delta variant than the vaccine. That would be following the science, wouldn't it?"

The rapid test is accurate about between 30 and 50 percent if you don't have symptoms. So most people traveling if they know they're sick are going to not travel. So, most of the people we're talking about are traveling are without symptoms. The test is 30 to 50 percent accurate. The Omicron variant is already across the United States and across the world. No travel ban is going to stop it and no amount of testing is going to stop it. But think about this -- Fauci now says if you know someone's been vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask next to him. So you see him at one of these glittering Hollywood parties the other day, and it's like, oh, if I don't know the person, I put a mask on, if I know them. Well, he doesn't know their vaccine status, how idiotic is that? Oh, I don't know that person, so I'm going to put my mask on. But now I'm going to take it off because I know that person. He doesn't know who's vaccinated or not by looking at them. It's a ridiculous standard. But here's the bottom line people have been vaccinated or people who've gotten the disease naturally do have a semblance of protection and should feel comfortable going about their daily lives. Let's not live in fear because Dr. Fauci is promulgating things that are unscientific just to scare you. If you've been vaccinated or if you've had the disease, live your life and ignore this man and let's hope he can be gone as soon as possible."

Now we know from the NIH itself and we know from the 900 documents from \"The Intercept\", and we know from Fauci's own emails that, in fact, he knew damn well that coronavirus, gain of function research was being done at the Wuhan virology lab and that his NIH was funding it."

I would actually bet it's defunding the police, trying to dismantle the police, putting pressure on police never to do their job and making it incapable for them to do their job, and then I'd add those no bail laws that you commit a crime, you rob a bank, like this one guy in New York.

Louis Vuitton? I don't see people eating Louis Vuitton bags. That is a big lie. You have green lighted criminals to steal and to be released. It is not for food. It is to get high in jewelry to resell on the black market. It is a sham. And as long as Jen Psaki has zero credibility and she just basically lied when she told the American public is due to the pandemic. Pandemic is causing people to rob Louis Vuitton and Gucci bags. It makes no sense. All right. Let me just read to both of you this. The fraternal order of police revealed today that 58 police officers have been gunned down this year. It's the highest number of law enforcement officers shot and killed ever. Another 314 officers have been shot, ambushes have jumped 126 percent. For everybody at home, I want to ask yourself, do you know the names of any of these officers?

But today, Biden proudly announced that this was quote incredible news and that our economic recovery is going strong. What world are you living in, Joe?

As it turns out, Kamala Harris is not just hated by hundreds of millions of Americans, she's also deeply unpopular with her own staff. Things are getting worse every day. New reports out, a mass exodus is in the works. You have three top staffers that have already announced their departures from the office of the vice president. Many others are now worried about being permanently branded a Harris person which are fate -- I guess they view that as a fate worse than perhaps even death apparently. Some are being burned out from what they are describing as an extremely toxic work environment. Now, whatever is happening, it doesn't bode well for Kamala's presidential ambitions. Now maybe she should take some time away from the office, and maybe as borders czar, go visit the actual southern border, not where the action is, not someplace distant from where things are happening.

We have a news media incapable of dealing seriously with the world and we have national leadership in the White House and in Nancy Pelosi and to some extent Schumer who are in incapable of the kind of changes we need. So I think we're now entering one of the most dangerous periods in American history, rivaling the period just before the civil war or the period of the Revolutionary War, and I think people need to understand how really deeply serious the crisis is going to become, and all of our opponents as you just said all of our opponents are watching Biden fall asleep. They're watching Kamala Harris laughing and they're thinking themselves, this is the executive branch leadership? This is the commander-in-chief? Those are signals of weakness that are extraordinarily dangerous when seen by people as tough as Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping."

President Xi, I don't think, gives a flying rip what Joe Biden has to say as he's flying his fighter jets in Taiwan airspace and threatening reunification with Taiwan. Then you have to ask the question if they're compromised because the Bidens did a lot of business, had a lot of business dealings with both China and Russia. So I think those things come into play. And look at the Canadian economy is thriving but our economy is a disaster under Biden and the people that are being hurt the most are the poor and the middle class, because of the 31-year high in inflation, and the higher cost of energy."

Her new book \"Laptop from Hell\" is unbelievable and you cannot read that book and not reach a conclusion that President Biden knew what his brother and his son were doing and that it involves a level of corruption that I think we have never seen. A corruption which involves Ukraine, Russia and China is clearly a national security crisis explains a lot of the timidity that Biden has towards dealing with China. In terms of the impact of inflation which is in essence a tax. This administration, the fact is big government socialism does not work. We're watching it in inflation. We're watching it in unemployment, we're watching it in energy prices, we're watching it at the border, we're watching in our school systems. And I think this is all going to come crashing down next year and I think we may have a historic sweep on a scale that even you and I and we were together in 1994 when we picked up 53 seats, John Boehner picked up 64 seats. I think this could be a sweep that far exceeds those because I think people are going to form a -- this ain't working coalition. That's more than just Republicans.

And remember, an investigation into the shooting is ongoing and many legal experts are warning that it may have been a mistake for Baldwin to speak out and explaining that his comments could end up being used against him in criminal or civil proceedings. We'll follow that story. And also tonight, out in the great city of Chicago, the trial of hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett, well, that kicked off this week. Prosecutors detailed his alleged efforts to use the staged attack where the actor said he was targeted by Trump supporters in Chicago as a ploy to demand a higher salary on the show \"Empire\". And we also learned that Jussie Smollett apparently set up a dry run of the fake attack the day before with his two alleged accomplices now Smollett is facing six counts relating to the false statements he made to police. And don't forget, this scandal is also a media scandal and is the media mob along with Democrats like, oh, Kamala Harris amplified Smollett's lies with breathless hysteria, despite no facts to ever back up the story. Remember, Kamala Harris tweeted back in 2019, quote, this was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or the color of their skin. We must confront this hate. Completely shameless, completely clueless, completely fake news. Here with reaction all of this, the host of \"Justice,\" Judge Jeanine Pirro, along with FOX News contributor Joe Concha. Let's start with what happened with Alec Baldwin, Judge and I watched him and Leo 2.0 Terrell, very smart attorney, he's been a civil rights attorney his whole career, first thing he said is there's no way he did that interview without being coached and without being prepared by lawyers. I would have to believe that's probably true, we don't know. And then you got to remember he's an actor, and then you got this whole other side with ABC playing that ridiculous music.

First of all, there is no doubt in my mind, I would -- I would gamble my house on this one, that he was prepped that they went through many sessions on how he would respond number one. There is still a possibility of his being charged criminally. Number two, he is going to be sued up the kazoo by so many people and number three he's got a future career he thinks that he's got to worry about. So this was not something he decided to just do on the fly. Let me make one thing clear. The fact that so many weeks have passed since Halyna Hutchins was killed tells me that he has had now a chance to assess everything, make a decision as to what he's going to say, what his story is, and this whole thing about how I'm not responsible somebody else is. Look, it's his production company. He was in charge of hiring those people who worked on that set and for him to absolve himself and to somehow claim that he's a victim is contrary to what the facts and the evidence will show in this case ultimately. And his -- his desire to be seen as a victim and as a pathetic guy who looks so horrible is countered by the evidence."

But now that I've had a chance to watch it, I will tell you -- Mika Brzezinski is right.

And as for Baldwin, the judge is exactly right. He attempted to throw everyone else under the bus, all while somehow playing the victim. Baldwin's saying, I didn't pull the trigger -- well, okay, who did? The sheriff in this case is correct. Guns don't fire themselves. Baldwin when asked, do you feel any guilt? He answers bluntly, no. That's not good. So, look this was a PR stunt to try to curry public opinion in Baldwin's favor clearly and after 90 minutes, we're only left with more questions and answers and it seems the more this actor speaks the more questions are raised, Sean."

And then, Kamala Harris, as usual, rushing to judgment. This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of skin. We must confront this hate. Now, I'll say this about Alec Baldwin, some people may not like it. I stay consistent -- due process, presumption of innocence, let this play out in a court of law as it will.

And then he claimed to -- at the debate with President Trump, any president who oversaw 220,000 deaths had, quote, no business being president. You still stand by that, Joe? Because during your time as president, over 355,000 Americans have died of COVID. More people now have died in 2021 than 2020. And during the campaign, Biden also claimed he had a secret plan. He's going to shut down the virus. Obviously, another lie. And get this, now, Biden wants even more travel restrictions for you, the law-abiding American citizens, and foreign travelers. But guess what? Preferential treatment, that exists. If you're an illegal immigrant, you come across the border, you don't have a COVID test, there's no vaccine mandate and you got free transportation to the state of your choice. Does that make sense to you? Ask yourself, why does the Biden administration seem to think that COVID can spread everywhere except the southern border? Whatever happened to follow the science consistently? Anyway, here with reaction all this, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. You know, Senator, basically, it's become follow the science only when convenient because if we're following the science, the science out of Israel and I believe Qatar now is a second country, but the Israel case showing natural immunity was 27 times more effective in warding off the delta variant than the vaccine.

The rapid test is accurate about between 30 and 50 percent if you don't have symptoms. So most people traveling if they know they're sick are going to not travel. So, most of the people we're talking about are traveling are without symptoms. The test is 30 to 50 percent accurate. The Omicron variant is already across the United States and across the world. No travel ban is going to stop it and no amount of testing is going to stop it. But think about this -- Fauci now says if you know someone's been vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask next to him. So you see him at one of these glittering Hollywood parties the other day, and it's like, oh, if I don't know the person, I put a mask on, if I know them. Well, he doesn't know their vaccine status, how idiotic is that? Oh, I don't know that person, so I'm going to put my mask on. But now I'm going to take it off because I know that person. He doesn't know who's vaccinated or not by looking at them. It's a ridiculous standard. But here's the bottom line people have been vaccinated or people who've gotten the disease naturally do have a semblance of protection and should feel comfortable going about their daily lives. Let's not live in fear because Dr. Fauci is promulgating things that are unscientific just to scare you.

Louis Vuitton? I don't see people eating Louis Vuitton bags. That is a big lie. You have green lighted criminals to steal and to be released. It is not for food. It is to get high in jewelry to resell on the black market. It is a sham. And as long as Jen Psaki has zero credibility and she just basically lied when she told the American public is due to the pandemic. Pandemic is causing people to rob Louis Vuitton and Gucci bags. It makes no sense. All right. Let me just read to both of you this. The fraternal order of police revealed today that 58 police officers have been gunned down this year. It's the highest number of law enforcement officers shot and killed ever. Another 314 officers have been shot, ambushes have jumped 126 percent.
