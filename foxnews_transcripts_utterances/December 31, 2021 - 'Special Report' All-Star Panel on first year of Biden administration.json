But it's really been marked by just massive amounts of failure, whether it's the border, Afghanistan, inflation.

One was the big $1.9 trillion bill, the American Rescue Plan. Then that was going to be followed by an infrastructure bill, and then Build Back Better. And in between, because of the vaccines, the coronavirus by middle of July, Independence Day, would be behind us. And the plan didn't pan out, in part, because of some of the mistakes they made, but, in part, because the Delta variant came along and threw everything off course. And what has struck me is that they continue to stick to the plan even after some other administrations might have tried to call an audible, and they have not been able to finish the plan in the form of Build Back Better.",

When he came in, people were talking as though he would be the next FDR or LBJ, but he didn't have FDR or LBJ majorities. So now what's the most common metaphor used? It's Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is synonym for haplessness, with inflation. And I think Afghanistan was particularly brutal because it's not a right or left thing.

And in between, because of the vaccines, the coronavirus by middle of July, Independence Day, would be behind us. And the plan didn't pan out, in part, because of some of the mistakes they made, but, in part, because the Delta variant came along and threw everything off course. And what has struck me is that they continue to stick to the plan even after some other administrations might have tried to call an audible, and they have not been able to finish the plan in the form of Build Back Better."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Well, in her performance, she is the border czar who tries to stay as far away from the border as she can. And in some sense, I don't blame her. The vice president is supposed to be the chief salesman for the president's agenda. And the problem is that Joe Biden has not a good agenda. When he came in, people were talking as though he would be the next FDR or LBJ, but he didn't have FDR or LBJ majorities. So now what's the most common metaphor used? It's Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter is synonym for haplessness, with inflation. And I think Afghanistan was particularly brutal because it's not a right or left thing. I think a lot of people just have the impression that the job is too big for Joe Biden. He is not up to it."

But their best bet for their future political prospects is actually not to pass something, given that we already have such high inflation, which is caused by flooding the zone with trillions of dollars. Doing more of what has caused some of the problems is not going to help out the Biden administration. But it's also a good reminder that Nancy Pelosi has been doing no favors for Joe Biden. And the extreme way in which she is managing her caucus is not helping him at all."

They get it when they go fill up their cars and it's an extra 20 bucks. I would add foreign affairs. We have Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin really menacing, and we have Iran out there. And I don't think if these men looked at Afghanistan, they are going to take lessons, gee, better not mess with Joe Biden. He is going to be really tough."

He alone among most GOP leaders has seen that people don't want you to just fight Democratic policies but implement conservative policies, and he's done that brilliantly by keeping schools open, fighting vaccine mandates, fighting their hatred of Critical Race Theory and having Florida be a thriving economy. My loser is, really, the American people, but the prime cause of the wretched year that we have had has to lie Joe Biden, so he is my loser for the year."

My loser of the year is a collective one, the women of Afghanistan. Again, whether you are on the left or the right, the withdrawal of U.S. and other western forces from Afghanistan has left half that country, in the sense, at the mercy of the Taliban."

He has just marked a year in jail because he has been advocating for democracy. And what makes his story so incredible is that he was a multimillionaire who could have fled and kept his comfortable life, but he chose the jail cell of a Chinese dissident. My loser is a double hitter here, the Cuomo brothers. Just two years ago Andrew Cuomo and Chris Cuomo were at the top of the game. Everyone was lauding them and so forth. And both have now lost their jobs. Both face accusations of sexual impropriety, and so forth. It's been a sharp fall."
