Additional surveillance shows Piazza repeatedly falling, passing out, tumbling head first down a flight of stairs, then being carried back upstairs and place a couch by four fraternity brothers.

And Roger Goodell came out that he has asked for $49.5 million, a private jet for life, as well as healthcare for life. He got back to Jerry Jones and he said, whoa, hang on for a second, that should not be even contemplated. Let's slow this down. Let's all of us look at it. It takes 3/4 of the league to vote on moving the extra point from the two yard line to the 15 yard line, and Jerry Jones is saying we're going to give somebody a $50 million a year contract and six guys are going to decide it?

Some of this just lands on your plate. A lot of it has been very poorly handed. It spilled over into the public. And now -- just look at what the players have said about this. They're trying to have some form of unity with the players as they get ready to get into a labor negotiations here in a few years, and the players are unanimous today in their outrage over this type of compensation and they feel that they don't get health care for life. They barely get it while they're playing. Now the commissioner wants it for life? A contract that is quite frankly, you know, $50 million is obscene to most people. It's obscene almost to everybody. And particularly when they don't judge his performance as being great. So there's nothing they can do to Jerry Jones. Jerry Jones has done nothing wrong. He just says slow down the process.

And they say if it is real, it's not one of the master's best works because he rarely painted figures straight on, and was known for his movement in his painting.

Democrats have certainly enjoyed the last few days of watching Republicans twist in the wind over sexual misconduct allegations against Roy Moore, a candidate for office in Alabama. Today, we saw the #me2 movement actually strike a sitting senator, and this time he's a Democrat. As you noted, Al Franken has been leading as well the charge against Attorney General Jeff Sessions about whether he testified truthfully and acted appropriately in terms of contacts with Russia. Tonight, it's Franken who's apologizing after TV and radio personality, Leeann Tweeden, went public with two separate incidents which she says took place on a USO Tour back in 2006, including at least one that she classified as a sexual assault involving Franken before he was a senator. Here's what she said, the former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member did to her when they rehearsed a skit for the troops."

Franken put out a statement declaring he does not remember the rehearsal as Tweeden does. Nonetheless, he offered a full apology to Tweeden, as well as everyone on the USO Tour and his constituents from Minnesota. Franken added, he feels shame over the photo: \"I don't know what was in my head when I took that picture and it doesn't matter. There's no excuse. I look at it now, and I feel disgusted with myself.\" That's Al Franken. Now, Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer immediately called for a Senate ethics probe saying, \"Sexual harassment is never acceptable and must not be tolerated. I hope and expect that the ethics committee will fully investigate this troubling incident as they should with a credible allegation of sexual harassment. Franken said tonight he will cooperate with this ethics probe. But Politico is reporting tonight that some Democrats and Republicans are already privately whispering that Franken may have to resign because that photograph is so damning, Martha."

Now, the fact is, though, that some of these women were involved with him when and it wasn't actually a criminal offense, they were of the age of majority. A couple of them, at least, was too young and it would amount to a criminal defense. But these are four-decade-old allegations, Martha, and the evidence is flimsy. He has said -- he's accused -- he has said he did not do it. If there's no independent evidence to show that he did, there's not some sort of circumstantial evidence to prove that he did these things. That by definition, they're not provable. They didn't happen. And that's the problem the Senate has. And by the way, Alabamans feel at this point that The Washington Post and Gloria Allred are telling them not to vote for Roy Moore and that's a toxic combination."

But you're talking about elected officials, we invest our authority, we give then our vote, we -- I assume that they're looking out for our best interest as a community, as a nation. And so, we have to make a judgment about someone like Roy Moore or someone like Al Franken."

So, you see all the Democrats are able to, in essence, well, hide behind the claim that you know what, we're investigating, we're treating this seriously. I must say, this is wholly different than what's something that's going on the Republican side with Roy Moore. Something that is splitting the Republican Party.

Prosecutors say Menendez did political favors at the highest levels of government for a wealthy Florida eye doctor who's a long-time friend. In exchange, they alleged the New Jersey senator: accepted luxury vacations, private jet flights and nearly $700,000 in campaign contributions.

And the decision is going to be based on the length of the trial, the cost of a trial. These gentlemen were friends many years before this took place. So, that was -- the evidence, I think, was a little on the weak side. But the bottom line, maybe, the jury split. Was it 8-8? Or, I'm sorry, was it 6-6? Was it 9-3 in favor of acquittal, or 10-2 in favor of acquittal? That may be the bottom line in the decision made to retry him or not."

I think it's prosecutors who are having a hard time, and I think juries who want something very hard and firm. And I think that's a problem because you have to hold politicians accountable.

So, whatever the Senate does, they've got to first prove they can get 50 votes, and I encourage them, and I'm confident they'll get 50 votes on passing a bill up that achieves the same things we did -- and that's cutting taxes for families, making our country competitive again, bring in jobs back to America. And so, our bill does that. I would imagine as they pass their bill our, we'll get our conferees to go and figure out the differences, and we'll pass the final product."

A bracket that he says goes down on the average doesn't represent, for example, a two-income family living in New York City. A two-income, no children -- or maybe their children in college family living in California. There are a number -- a significant number in the millions of people, particularly in California, New York, New Jersey and states like that, who are going to actually have a tax increase. With 1.5 trillion being spent, if you will, to cut taxes, why do they have to increase taxes on anyone, and why did have it to be discriminatory toward a few states, especially when you consider the states that I just mentioned. We're donor states. We already give more money to the federal government than we get back. So, the test should, in fact, have not been one in which some states won and some lost. But I'm proud of those who crossed party lines to say this tax could have been fairer than it was."

One suggestion that Tom McClintock and I said, was, look, if you put a provision in that says, you will not pay a higher tax than you currently pay, which is what they imply in the last segment. Let CBO score it and find an offset for that. I'm not saying you have to give back salt, but I am saying that none of my constituents should pay more in what is, in fact, a $1.5 trillion tax cut, but that is what we are going to do in many cases.

Remember, in early days of his presidency, the scuttlebutt was that, oh, he would want to be in New York all the time, D.C. would just be a day job for him. So, whatever you want to say about this president, one thing has become pretty clear, he certainly has plenty of energy for this job. So, what does that tell us?

This is a this is a clear violation of -- I mean, what is wrong -- and it tells us more about these people who are commenting on it. I mean, it was kind of charming, and then he had an exchange with the Rubio, Marco Rubio, who famously paused in his talk after Obama spoke and took a glass of water. The guy needs a glass of water. He's been working hard. He extended his trip, as you said. And by the way, I mean, that's a great intro. People thought he was going to be in Mar-a-Lago and New York, you know. It's just not giving up his lifestyle, he's radically changed his lifestyle. When he said he was going to dedicate himself to this job, he has, he went over there, it was a very productive trip to China experts I know. A little concerned about getting too close to China, but think that it's very good that he can talk to China and get them to do some things that we want. Look, I think even some liberals that I've listened to have said North Korea has calmed down, thanks to China's intervention and Trump standing up. Remember when people were comparing him to Kim Jong Un? You know, they were two peas in a pod, Trump and Kim Jong Un. Kim Jong Un, no missiles launched lately.

But, you know, the idea is when you think about back to the beginning, you know, when he came down to the escalator and everything, in fact, then people said, oh, it's a publicity stunt. You know, this is not a man that wants to go out the campaign in Wisconsin and places like Pennsylvania. Well, guess what? That's exactly what he turned out to love doing, Bill. And I just find the ethic of the way he goes about being president very interesting, and I think it is difficult for some people to believe and to swallow and to say, you know, that -- and to give him credit for it whatsoever. Just put up this poll for a minute, guys. The Quinnipiac poll on Trump media. Do you approve or disapprove of the way the news media has covered President Trump. Fifty eight percent disapprove, that might be for various reasons, right?"

It doesn't slow him down. We know he doesn't get much sleep. We know he's up early in the morning tweeting, and he's hard at work. This is an impressive presidency. And what about today? All of these sex accusations and all these stuff out there. But what the house did today was great. And if you get the senate and go to conference and get a real tax bill out of here, boy, you're going to hear about that. He's going to tell us he did it, and that's fine because he'll take a lot of credit. Ryan deserves a lot of credit, too. So will the senate. But this will be a real achievement.

Tim Piazza's blood alcohol level was four times the legal limit to drive, and the basement video apparently shows why. Prosecutor say Tim Piazza had 18 drinks in just under 1 hour and 22 minutes. And apparently, Piazza never obtained a single drink himself. They were being brought to him by his fraternity brothers. Additional surveillance shows Piazza repeatedly falling, passing out, tumbling head first down a flight of stairs, then being carried back upstairs and place a couch by four fraternity brothers. Videos also show him being slapped and doused with water. When Piazza started thrashing, one brother scream that his friend needed to go to the hospital, but that brother claim he was quickly confronted and told to shut up. It wasn't until 10:48 the next morning that 911 was called. Alcohol was mentioned, but there was no mention of falling several times, including down a flight of stairs. Listen to part of the call."

Jim Gray, our good friend, joins us moments away on that after this. Stay with us with more."

      "utterance": "So the NFL is getting hammered by decline in ratings, and players protest, and new internal war that is making headlines. This time around it is pitting the league and its commissioner against one of football's most powerful owners, the Dallas Cowboy's Jerry Jones. The league is now suggesting that Jones is acting in a way that's detrimental to pro-football after Jones attacked plans to offer Commissioner Roger Goodell a hefty new contract. And now the report suggest that Jones is punching back, calling for a meeting with his fellow owners. Jim Gray, Fox News sports analysis is here tonight. Jim, good to see you. So explain the nature of the dispute between Jerry Jones and the rest of these owners."

      "speaker": "JIM GRAY, FOX NEWS SPORTS ANALYSIS",
      "utterance": "I think that Jerry Jones and a consortium of owners, there're some others who are with him. They're just not publicly stating it because they feel they're not running a political campaign and they don't have to be there publicly. But he's alone, but he's in the forefront of trying to slow down a new contract to give to Roger Goodell. They decided 32-0 to authorize this compensation committee to go ahead and negotiate a contract and to get back to him. And Roger Goodell came out that he has asked for $49.5 million, a private jet for life, as well as healthcare for life. He got back to Jerry Jones and he said, whoa, hang on for a second, that should not be even contemplated. Let's slow this down. Let's all of us look at it. It takes 3/4 of the league to vote on moving the extra point from the two yard line to the 15 yard line, and Jerry Jones is saying we're going to give somebody a $50 million a year contract and six guys are going to decide it? I don't think so."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "How much of this comes from the controversy over kneeling on the side line, and the way that Goodell has handled so much of what has -- he has to confront as commissioner of the NFL. It's been a tough time."

    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of it comes from what has gone on in the past several years from Tom Brady, and Ezekiel Elliot, and the national anthem, to the massive failure of judgment on domestic violence. The relocation of franchises. There's just been a lot of controversy that has surrounded. Part of this is just the process of being the commissioner of the National Football League. Some of this just lands on your plate. A lot of it has been very poorly handed. It spilled over into the public. And now -- just look at what the players have said about this. They're trying to have some form of unity with the players as they get ready to get into a labor negotiations here in a few years, and the players are unanimous today in their outrage over this type of compensation and they feel that they don't get health care for life. They barely get it while they're playing. Now the commissioner wants it for life? A contract that is quite frankly, you know, $50 million is obscene to most people. It's obscene almost to everybody. And particularly when they don't judge his performance as being great. So there's nothing they can do to Jerry Jones. Jerry Jones has done nothing wrong. He just says slow down the process. Let's see if in fact we want to keep this guy. And if we want to keep him, let's get it in line with something much more reasonable."

      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "I think it will be decided probably in the December meetings or in the March annual meetings in Orland, but not before then, no."

      "utterance": "So we'll leave you with this. Last night, this 500-year-old painting by Leonardo da Vinci sold for $450 million. It's the most expensive painting ever sold in auction. It is called, Salvator Mundi, savior of the world, it depict Christ holding an orb. Some critics question whether or not it's real. And they say if it is real, it's not one of the master's best works because he rarely painted figures straight on, and was known for his movement in his painting. They said whoever bought it overpaid. I think that's probably safe to say, right? But it is beautiful. So what do you think? Tweet me @marthamaccallum using #thestory. Have a great night everybody.
