We're going to take you inside this week's historic meetings, and we're going to cover also another wide range of topics. The fight for the border wall, Michael Cohen's testimony, the Mueller report that so many report will be out next week, what is the Democrats' despicable and politically motivated sham of a hearing.

He has a willingness to walk away from a bad deal. By the way, it's a key principle in his best-selling book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" And if only the media care to understand who he was, maybe they'd read it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When it comes to North Korea -- well, the president's mission has always been clear.

Now at the time Reagan, he was excoriated for not reaching a deal at Reykjavik. When he first ran for president, so many on the left suggested that Reagan was a California cowboy who's going to lead us towards a nuclear holocaust and economic disaster. In the end, just the opposite happened. In the case of Reykjavik, Reagan prevailed. The Cold War ended without a single shot being fired. The Berlin Wall came tumbling down.

Clinton sent billions of dollars in resources to North Korea. He promised the American people this was a good deal for the American people. They still developed a robust nuclear program in spite of the money, he attempted bribe, Obama, as we all know, $150 billion in cash and other currencies, cargo planes right there on the mullahs of Iran, front door. And now, the deal is totally debunked. Iran never stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon. Never stop funding terror all over the world. And unlike these deals, President Trump is more interested in protecting the country than just having a feel-good signature moment based on what is at its core a hollow, unenforceable agreement that in the end would be meaningless. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You would think, when the denuclearization of a rogue dictatorship was on the table, you would think this is a moment when all Americans would want to back the president's efforts, hope that he could make a great deal. You would think they would encourage his efforts to make the world a safer, better place for our kids and grandkids. You would think that they cared about world peace. They profess to. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No, that's not the case because yesterday, in our nation's capital, at the very moment, the very day the president was meeting with Kim Jong-un, Democrats, they scheduled a public hearing with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in what was nothing more than a political stunt, a circus, all designed to embarrass the president during his crucial and historic trip to Vietnam. Naturally, the hate Trump media mob, they towed to the Democratic line: predictable. Look at last night, coverage on fake news CNN, conspiracy TV MSNBC. It was an utter embarrassment. They ought to be ashamed but they never will be. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president conducting this historic meeting, negotiating peace with North Korea, and extremely rare and important summit, huge, life altering implications to literally millions and millions and millions of people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the hate Trump mob, media totally obsessed with the congressional testimony from Michael Cohen, who we all know was just convicted of lying to Congress and will be headed to jail for three years. Now, when we were showing last night the images of the president and Kim Jong-un at this all important meeting, well, fake news CNN, MSNBC, they barely covered this historic event at all. Look at this from NewsBusters today. CNN, NBC dedicated a whopping 428 minutes of prime time coverage to Michael Cohen. They spent only 12 minutes -- 12 minutes -- on the summit in Vietnam. Now, CNN and MSNBC, they pretend to be news organizations. They claimed that they are objective. It's a joke. They are just merely, as we have been telling you for a long time, an extension of the radical, extreme Democratic socialist party, which is why they echo the claims from Democrats that Cohen, who they have all hated and said everything they could possibly say against this guy for such a long amount of time, now he's totally reliable. Now, he's their best friend, and in spite of all that is happened with the IRS and bank loans and so on and so forth, lying to Congress.

Coming up tonight, my exclusive interview with the president. We're going to take you inside this week's historic meetings, and we're going to cover also another wide range of topics. The fight for the border wall, Michael Cohen's testimony, the Mueller report that so many report will be out next week, what is the Democrats' despicable and politically motivated sham of a hearing. We'll ask about the green new deal and much, much more. That interview in just minutes. Now, without a doubt, one of President Trump's greatest strengths, in my opinion is, he's a good negotiator. He has a willingness to walk away from a bad deal. By the way, it's a key principle in his best-selling book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" And if only the media care to understand who he was, maybe they'd read it. When it comes to North Korea -- well, the president's mission has always been clear. That is a full, complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

But one year later -- well, he got the deal that we wanted that was good for the country and a few years after that, the Soviet Union collapsed, and as we say, the rest is history. Take a look."

Appeasement, bribing dictators doesn't do very well, doesn't come up with the Clinton's and Kim Jong Il or the Iranian deal with the mullahs in Obama's time. Now at the time Reagan, he was excoriated for not reaching a deal at Reykjavik. When he first ran for president, so many on the left suggested that Reagan was a California cowboy who's going to lead us towards a nuclear holocaust and economic disaster. In the end, just the opposite happened. In the case of Reykjavik, Reagan prevailed. The Cold War ended without a single shot being fired. The Berlin Wall came tumbling down. Freedom for millions won the day. And meanwhile, the appeasement, the bribery strategies that we see invoked by the left so often, Democrats trying to lecture Donald Trump about -- they were lavished with praise when you look at Clinton and Obama from the mainstream media. Clinton sent billions of dollars in resources to North Korea. He promised the American people this was a good deal for the American people. They still developed a robust nuclear program in spite of the money, he attempted bribe, Obama, as we all know, $150 billion in cash and other currencies, cargo planes right there on the mullahs of Iran, front door. And now, the deal is totally debunked. Iran never stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon. Never stop funding terror all over the world. And unlike these deals, President Trump is more interested in protecting the country than just having a feel-good signature moment based on what is at its core a hollow, unenforceable agreement that in the end would be meaningless. You would think, when the denuclearization of a rogue dictatorship was on the table, you would think this is a moment when all Americans would want to back the president's efforts, hope that he could make a great deal. You would think they would encourage his efforts to make the world a safer, better place for our kids and grandkids. You would think that they cared about world peace. They profess to. No, that's not the case because yesterday, in our nation's capital, at the very moment, the very day the president was meeting with Kim Jong-un, Democrats, they scheduled a public hearing with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in what was nothing more than a political stunt, a circus, all designed to embarrass the president during his crucial and historic trip to Vietnam."

But the hate Trump mob, media totally obsessed with the congressional testimony from Michael Cohen, who we all know was just convicted of lying to Congress and will be headed to jail for three years. Now, when we were showing last night the images of the president and Kim Jong-un at this all important meeting, well, fake news CNN, MSNBC, they barely covered this historic event at all. Look at this from NewsBusters today. CNN, NBC dedicated a whopping 428 minutes of prime time coverage to Michael Cohen. They spent only 12 minutes -- 12 minutes -- on the summit in Vietnam. Now, CNN and MSNBC, they pretend to be news organizations. They claimed that they are objective. It's a joke. They are just merely, as we have been telling you for a long time, an extension of the radical, extreme Democratic socialist party, which is why they echo the claims from Democrats that Cohen, who they have all hated and said everything they could possibly say against this guy for such a long amount of time, now he's totally reliable.

Because their quest to malign and embarrass president Trump, that means everything to them. And what did we learn? Pretty much nothing, pretty much nothing new, except things that the Democrats in these so-called news agencies won't focus on. Michael Cohen talked about there was no Russia collusion that he saw at all. No crimes committed by the president, and the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for a Russian dossier was chock-full of plenty of lies, lots of lies even about Michael Cohen himself. What did Michael Cohen gain from this hearing? That the Democrats -- did he gain their friendship? No, he gained absolutely nothing. No one who truly cared about Cohen and his family would have ever let him participate in the stunt. And as a result, as I predicted right here on this program, because of his testimony, now Michael Cohen is facing even more legal trouble. Today, Congressman Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows each sent new criminal referrals to thee.

And on the other, you had a Democratic party, nonstop scheming to smear, slander the president at all costs, no matter how many lives are ruined, how many people are besmirched in the process. Now, sadly, this is nothing new. It's a year's long political war. Frankly, it's gone on since he came down the escalator in 2015. And breaking today, just a few weeks, we're going to learn more about how Democrats and their friends in the media -- well, how well they worked to smear Trump in 2016 with the Clinton bought and paid for dirty dossier. Very good news tonight for those of us that want the truth out because they judge just granted a motion in Florida to unsealed documents in the Trump dossier defamation case against BuzzFeed, including a deposition from Hillary Clinton's foreign agent that used his Russian sources, Christopher Steele. Remember, in Great Britain under oath, in an interrogatory, I have no idea if any of this is true, it is raw intelligence. This will be important. Stay tuned. OK. We'll have my one-on-one with the president, all those topics are mentioned coming up. But, first, joining us now with reaction on our other top stories, we have President Trump's intelligence advisory board member Dan Hoffman, Fox News contributor Dan Bongino and \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. Before we get to you guys here, I want to start with John.

As of this hour, I've talked to 12 separate witnesses who claimed that Michael Cohen repeatedly, incessantly lobbied for a White House drop and complained when he didn't get one. They ranged from Dave Bossie, the deputy director of the transition, down to a pastor in Ohio who was a friend of Michael Cohen's, a guy named Darrell Scott, who is a friend that said, I can lie for my friend. He asked me several times to ask the president, can he have a job in the White House. This is the sort of perjury trap that the Democrats did not want to set for their star witness.

He's done this before making up conspiracy theories about Fox News and your favorite hosts. On his show last night, and I have met Don Lemon, I really actually like him in person.

He needs an airplane, somebody buy him an airplane. All right, this show, please tune in tomorrow night. And we're going to show you the question that I asked.
