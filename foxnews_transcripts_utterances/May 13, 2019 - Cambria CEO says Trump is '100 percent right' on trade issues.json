It's commonly agreed upon. There is a legitimate question to ask, why are we trading with them at all. They are a geopolitical adversary who intends to destroy what we care about the most, freedom. They want to dominate. Now during the Cold War, we didn't do business with the Soviet Union and that was smart. So, I have a question. Where all the liberals who supposedly care about human rights?

Stated pledge to dominate major industries, pretty much every major industry by 2025. They're well on their way in space weaponry and artificial intelligence. This my friends is a toxic mix for anyone who loves freedom. Trump properly assessed the threat to the entire world where China controls all steel production. Now, think about national security issues at play here and get this, 90 percent of the world's printed circuit boards are manufactured in Asia and more than half in China. And as if the prospect of American weapons dependent on Chinese made parts isn't bad enough there are already worries that Chinese made electronics may be infected with computer viruses that would let China spy on or disable U.S. military, commercial or consumer products.

Investigators say a Houston based criminal enterprise would charge foreigners up $70,000 to be set up with a fake spouse, complete with a fake wedding album. And once they tied the phony knot, the group would submit fraudulent paperwork to immigration authorities, including tax and employment documents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which headed up the investigation, says despite the fake documents, the spouses do not live together and do not intend to live together. Quoting here, \"The spouses only met briefly, usually immediately before they obtained their marriage license, or not at all.\" And the U.S. citizens who agreed to the sham marriages received a portion of the proceeds. And the more money the immigrants paid, the more benefits they got, including admission into the United States and full lawful permanent resident status. ICE says the alleged ring leader, 53-year-old Ashley Yen Nguyen ran the whole thing out of this Houston area home, but she had help from associates across Texas and Vietnam. Finally, we should note that in its newly released annual report, the U.S. Sentencing Commission said that immigration crimes accounted for 34.4 percent of all sentencing cases. That's up from 30 percent last year. And the ring leaders of the marriage fraud could be looking at decades behind bars. Those involved in the actual fake marriages could get five years each.

Attorney General Bill Barr as I just mentioned has just launched a new investigation into the probes, the original origin of, of course the Russia probe, the spying on the 2016 Trump campaign. Now we know why the Dems were trying to destroy the Attorney General. So, how deep will this investigation go and how high will Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton be implicated. Ken Starr and John Yoo with their answers in moments. Plus, we debut our 2020 clown car segment. Should illegals receive free health care. Oh, why not. And some old Biden comments on immigration that might just surprise you, Bongino and Hahn debate it all. And Harvard Kansas Dean to appease their woke students. While Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib sparks yet another Israel controversy. Alan Dershowitz is here on both. Don't want to miss that. But first, Trump, the cleanup man. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. On Friday after trade talks broke down with the Chinese, President Trump raised tariffs on some Chinese goods to 25 percent. Now today, the Chinese retaliated threatening to hike tariffs on 5,000 U.S. products. While the media went into instant and totally predictable meltdown mode."

Presidents since George Washington have recognized the power and importance of tariffs to protect American interests. Facing China's gross trade abuses, we'll get that in a moment. Trump is wisely using tariffs to punish China for bad behavior. What's the alternative? With Trump in the White House, China knows the days of exploiting the American market with impunity are over. Now, talks broke down when the Chinese reneged on their promise to change their laws that required American companies doing business in China to do what's called technology transfers of their trade secrets and their intellectual property, it's outrageous. This begs the question why did any U.S. president ever allow China, a communist government, to hold our companies at gunpoint this way. Stripping them of their innovation in order to turn around and then just do what. Well, use American engineering and knowhow to dominate the market themselves. Now, I still remember this. I remember this really well back in 2000 when Bill Clinton urging China's admission into the World Trade Organization made all sort of promises to the American people."

In 2018, U.S. exports to China, 179.3 billion seems like a lot. But Chinese imports to the United States were $557.9 billion. Do the math. That means the U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China was a whopping 378.6 billion in 2018. That was up 10 percent from 2017. So, it's been a very good deal for China. Last year, U.S. imports from China were up 427 percent from 2001. That was pre its admission to the World Trade Organization."

That just facilitated the rise of a rapacious communist regime. Now, I think with all that we know now about how China operates. It's commonly agreed upon. There is a legitimate question to ask, why are we trading with them at all. They are a geopolitical adversary who intends to destroy what we care about the most, freedom. They want to dominate. Now during the Cold War, we didn't do business with the Soviet Union and that was smart. So, I have a question. Where all the liberals who supposedly care about human rights? They protested apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s. But are they OK with the Chinese in the 2000's. We have a million Muslims. We have Christians and political dissidents' tonight being held in internment camps in China. There is no real life outside the state in China. There is no freedom of thought. There is no freedom of conscience. There is no freedom of political assembly of religion and you add to that they're predatory trade practices and their pledge. They're being very obvious about this. Stated pledge to dominate major industries, pretty much every major industry by 2025. They're well on their way in space weaponry and artificial intelligence. This my friends is a toxic mix for anyone who loves freedom. Trump properly assessed the threat to the entire world where China controls all steel production. Now, think about national security issues at play here and get this, 90 percent of the world's printed circuit boards are manufactured in Asia and more than half in China. And as if the prospect of American weapons dependent on Chinese made parts isn't bad enough there are already worries that Chinese made electronics may be infected with computer viruses that would let China spy on or disable U.S. military, commercial or consumer products. Oh, that's all and by the way, our leaders do finally some of them seem to be waking up under Trump."

But as it relates to the long-term interests of our government and our country, President Trump is 100 percent right. I think he showed great courage. He said at least three, probably four administrations and the Congress who basically swept this under the rug for 20 years and even prior to 2000 when they went into the WTO. So, I think he's done - he and his team have done a tremendous job. They see this for what it is. He said it, they understand it and they're going to deal with it.

He's the first President Obama said, he was going to - he's going to be tough on China. Bush promised the world with permanent trade relations status with China, said China would become likely freer that all these doors would be open, American companies going into China. But the numbers do not lie. We have a $380 billion, up 10 percent year-to-year with China. How is that fair knowing what we know about China? I know it's good for you because you can make cheap stuff in China and bring it back to the United States. I get it.

What are the chances, both of you can answer this of an inflation raging through our economy? Because if you're saying this is going to destroy the economy, we've got to see real signs of inflation.

First of all, China doesn't - China comes at our market and hijacks American capitalism with the keenness of a government that's run by a political dictatorship. It's a command economy. They don't play in our structure, but they harvest the fruits of our structure. They do it with very overt manner. They're aggressive they're predatory. And this has been going on. It's not new. The Clinton administration trade people. Very shortly after, Clinton orchestrated the WTO proposal with China. Their advisory people and their analysis pointed out what could happen. And then there was a great article written in 2000 by Robert Scott of The Economic Advisors that laid out exactly what could and probably would happen when we put him in the WTO. Clinton orchestrated it. Bush furthered the orchestration and sustained it. So, it's not political. It's policy. And the Congress got it wrong. Over half of them. And they allowed China to come into the United States playing by their rules and really throw a Hail Mary for the Communist platform to survive by harvesting the fruits of American democracy, free enterprise, competition and capitalism."

They would get rich, they'd be affluent, they'd be westernized and then they would - it would be no problem. Then we were told that deficits really are not that bad for us and surpluses are not that good for them. Of course, they disagreed obviously. And then we were told if we were magnanimously, they would help out in Iran and North Korea and they would appreciate that magnanimity and return it in kind. None of that turned out to be true.

As Judge Starr said, there is already an Inspector General investigation going on. That's going to come to a conclusion. That's what you would do if you were just interested in reforming the way the department does things. The way decisions were made. But you wouldn't go with a U.S. attorney like Durham, someone of his stature unless the Attorney General thinks actually something criminal might have happened that someone might have violated the law that there might have been malfeasance that people at the FBI and the Justice Department were acting out of partisan motives not just out of incompetence or stupidity or they were duped by the Russians or steel or the English or by the Clinton campaign.

So, if the Steele dossier, which we now know was completely made up, was used as a basis for a FISA application and you have someone who is high up in the FBI had to approve that. Someone high up in the Justice Department had to prove that. Ultimately, the Attorney General has to approve that. And then, a second thing we haven't touched on yet is, it appears that the FBI try to send an undercover informants and agents to try to infiltrate the Trump campaign. There is a whole another set of laws that are called the Attorney General guidelines which were supposed to only allow that in very, very rare circumstances. So I assume the attorney general the deputy attorney general and maybe the FBI Director Comey all had to sit in on that decision and approve it. All of their decisions should be looked at by the -- and I think again, as you were saying, some people are going to be in a lot of trouble because lying to a federal court, lying to a federal court under oath is a perjury."

And what they do is they use the family units to divert Border Patrol to rescuing 200 people or 10 people or 12 people, then they do the drug drop four miles down the river. We saw it last week.

And now of course you get fired, and he was fired from his job as dean, for representing a controversial and unpopular somebody who has been charged with rape. The students claim that they feel unsafe. It's a nonsensical argument, feeling unsafe with a professor. The same professor represented a double murderer a couple of years ago. The same students didn't feel unsafe.  This is political correctness run amuck. These are students who don't care about due process, don't care about free speech. The only thing they care about is getting their way. They don't like the fact that he's representing somebody who they don't like. They claim he has been away too often.

      "utterance": "Hi Laura. Of the 96 people so far indicted, 50 are currently in custody in this marriage fraud scheme that dates back to the summer of 2013. This is really the immigration version of the college admissions scandal. Investigators say a Houston based criminal enterprise would charge foreigners up $70,000 to be set up with a fake spouse, complete with a fake wedding album. And once they tied the phony knot, the group would submit fraudulent paperwork to immigration authorities, including tax and employment documents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which headed up the investigation, says despite the fake documents, the spouses do not live together and do not intend to live together. Quoting here, \"The spouses only met briefly, usually immediately before they obtained their marriage license, or not at all.\" And the U.S. citizens who agreed to the sham marriages received a portion of the proceeds. And the more money the immigrants paid, the more benefits they got, including admission into the United States and full lawful permanent resident status. ICE says the alleged ring leader, 53-year-old Ashley Yen Nguyen ran the whole thing out of this Houston area home, but she had help from associates across Texas and Vietnam. Finally, we should note that in its newly released annual report, the U.S. Sentencing Commission said that immigration crimes accounted for 34.4 percent of all sentencing cases. That's up from 30 percent last year. And the ring leaders of the marriage fraud could be looking at decades behind bars. Those involved in the actual fake marriages could get five years each. Laura?"
