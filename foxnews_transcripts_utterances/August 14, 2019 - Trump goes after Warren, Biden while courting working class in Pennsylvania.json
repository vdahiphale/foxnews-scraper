It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We now know why the jail guards never checked on Jeffrey Epstein before he apparently committed suicide. It was because they were sleeping on the job. The two guards reportedly fell asleep for three hours when he is believed to have died. They then falsified the logs to cover it up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This comes as federal investigators, including a suicide reconstruction team are on the scene today at the Manhattan jail where the convicted sex offender was found dead.

I want to point out a couple things for the viewers about what we opened with, which was the jail situation. The standard -- you and I talked about a little bit about this the other day.

I got to counsel him because I was subscribed or circumscribed by the precedent of his union which these guys are a member of too. And there is a 14 percent reduction of that union that's why it is so understaffed. So like everything, we can't oversimplify and there is a lot of problems in that toxic system, but certainly in terms of what repercussions we could see relating to the actual death itself, it likely won't be that big until the results of the investigations come out systemically.",

And even unions have peeled away that support from the Democratic Party and the Democrats were caught totally flat-footed in 2016 and now they are playing defense of their own rust belt. On the border, Trump has protected the American worker from cheap labor that drives those wages down and steals American jobs. And the Democrats have decided to side with foreign workers and against the American worker, and the American worker does not like that.

It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We now know why the jail guards never checked on Jeffrey Epstein before he apparently committed suicide. It was because they were sleeping on the job. The two guards reportedly fell asleep for three hours when he is believed to have died. They then falsified the logs to cover it up. This comes as federal investigators, including a suicide reconstruction team are on the scene today at the Manhattan jail where the convicted sex offender was found dead. And the mystery is growing on the whereabouts of the British socialite who allegedly helped Epstein recruit young girls. Reports claim Ghislaine Maxwell is hiding at a secluded mansion in New England but the homeowner tells Fox News she's not there. Greg, does it surprise you that prison guards fell asleep for three hours and never checked on this guy?"

If this were a movie, we would be rolling our eyes. You have a sleeping guard, two sleeping guards and a high-profile case. The cameras aren't working. The roommate is suddenly removed, but they coordinated decoy ambulances. This is less realistic as a movie than \"Lord of the Rings,\" and that had hobbits. And hobbits aren't real. But I guess the point is and I said this yesterday and I'll say it again, incompetence looks like corruption. You can't tell. And the fact is, you know, the post office lost $8 billion or $7 billion this year. Bureaucracy is pretty bad. So, this is just another example of a large business that's run terribly."

And I think they didn't do their job, to underline that point, if their job was just to watch the prisoner. They just thought, well, it's late at night. I'll do what I want to do.

Remember where there was a time when that was considered out-of- bounds. Oh, and I think that's the way they're going to view adult men and teenage girls in the future. And I think, boy, these people have such a perverse sense of morality and I think it comes from the same kind of entitlement and privilege that has protected Epstein and other rich men who act in a predatory manner with regards to sex."

In James Stewart's article, as well as Charlie Gasparino's from Fox Business Network and others that we know that there is apparently a trove of additional corroborating evidence and photographs and the like. So certainly, none of those co-conspirators or actors are safe if there is direct evidence for that. I want to point out a couple things for the viewers about what we opened with, which was the jail situation. The standard -- you and I talked about a little bit about this the other day. The standard for the estate to sue a guard for basically you should have been watching this inmate and he committed suicide, you failed all of your duties. That is deliberate indifference. That's much higher than negligence and it's a really hard bar to cross. And then in terms of falsifying documents, how it's been, oh, it's a federal crime. I mean, I had an employee who falsified a document, which is yes, technically a felony. I got to counsel him because I was subscribed or circumscribed by the precedent of his union which these guys are a member of too. And there is a 14 percent reduction of that union that's why it is so understaffed. So like everything, we can't oversimplify and there is a lot of problems in that toxic system, but certainly in terms of what repercussions we could see relating to the actual death itself, it likely won't be that big until the results of the investigations come out systemically."

Who exceeds him? Bernie. His small donors are somewhere like between 60 percent and 70 percent, which says he is the guy to galvanize the Trump opposition. In my opinion, no one has his support or his authenticity. But, you know who else has 60 percent plus donors? Liz Warren. So Liz and Bernie are essentially the same candidate which means when one drops out it absorbs the other."

And Bernie Sanders who is now carping about even the liberal press is the one who is following. And part of this is, as I said before, it feels like I've seen this movie before when it comes to Bernie. I've seen a lot of the kind of rhetoric. I've seen a lot of the attacks. And so, you know, it doesn't have any freshness. Elizabeth Warren with all of her ideas, I've got a solution, I've got a plan, and her energy, it has just been something.

      "utterance": "Yes, really dumb comment from Sleepy Joe. The American worker has shifted from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party under Trump for three reasons. One, Trump's focus on trade, immigration, and energy. And the Democrats have capitulated on all those things. If you think about America first or made in America and the attack on NAFTA and the attack on China, that kind of economic nationalism has really galvanized wage growth and really seen an explosion in manufacturing in this country that's focused on U.S. steel, U.S. autos. And even unions have peeled away that support from the Democratic Party and the Democrats were caught totally flat-footed in 2016 and now they are playing defense of their own rust belt. On the border, Trump has protected the American worker from cheap labor that drives those wages down and steals American jobs. And the Democrats have decided to side with foreign workers and against the American worker, and the American worker does not like that. And then thirdly, just Trump's focus on American energy independence, American energy dominance, talking about re-establishing drilling and exploitation for natural gas and re-emerging coal in West Virginia. And instead, what the Democrats have done, the Democrats have said OK, we are going to get rid of coal and oil and gas in our first term as president, and that would just completely destroy the U.S. economy. So, you got to give Trump some credit but you also have to blame the Democrats too."

And stalwart Republicans like Ronald Reagan and both Bush's were never able to carry that super, heavily pro-union county until McCain in 2008 secured it for the GOP. And not because he was really likable, but because the policies he was running against were so liberal. And since then, Republicans obviously have been winning by increasing margins there. But I think Joe Biden over anyone else is the only Democratic candidate that actually has a chance of carrying those counties surrounding Pittsburgh because it harkens back --"
