Its agents can legally break down your front door and shoot you. Its investigations can destroy your life even if you are innocent. It has happened to a lot of people recently.

I don't know how that's even possible. But Tucker, get a load of this one. Bill de Blasio has defied the laws of statistics and is polling at a phenomenal zero percent. How that's possible, Tucker, I don't know. You and I both know, if were to substitute a teacher's class, Tucker, and walk into a class and say, \"Kids who wants homework?\" There's always that one kid who says yes.

Ladies and gentlemen, clearly you have not done your homework on socialism. You know, the little things like a hundred million dead -- the death, destruction, starvation.

You've been all over this. I've been all over this. I got an e-mail today that really disturbed me. It's from a friend of mine up on Capitol Hill who is knee deep in this.

He gave U.S. Attorney General William Barr broad authority to find and release any documents related to domestic surveillance -- spying -- by American Intelligence agencies over the course of the 2016 campaign. You'd think everyone would like this. You'd think it would qualify as Donald Trump's least controversial decision as President. Everyone in Washington says, \"We love transparency.\" \"Democracy dies in darkness,\" \"The Washington Post\" reminds us every morning. Even now members of Congress are calling for the impeachment of the President because portions of the Mueller report were redacted. \"Let's see everything, they're telling us.\" Okay. Let's do that. The President suddenly appears to agree with them. \"Let's see everything.\" So how did the left react when he suggested that? Not well. Watch this."

When another two FBI agents were caught talking about an insurance policy against Trump becoming President, and then promising to stop him -- that wasn't politicizing the Justice Department either according to them. Neither was the fired head of the FBI leaking memos to the press through a sympathetic left-wing law professor to make a political case. None of that was politicizing the Justice Department. But an Attorney General declassifying documents that already exist, that he had nothing to do with creating, \"Well now, we've gone too far.\" CNN trotted out former Director of National Intelligence and serial liar Jim Clapper to let viewers know really this could be dangerous."

The FBI has a lot more power than any single government agency. Its agents can legally break down your front door and shoot you. Its investigations can destroy your life even if you are innocent. It has happened to a lot of people recently. So the FBI absolutely must be above suspicion. If you sincerely cared about preserving our democracy as they claim they do, then you would immediately disinfect the FBI with sunlight. But James Clapper has no interest in doing that, neither does the rest of official Washington. The only principle they care about is self-preservation and they will say anything in its service. Congressman Adam Schiff of California responded to the declassification order this way, quote, \"While Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction of justice, Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies. The cover-up has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American.\" End quote. Got that? Declassifying information is now a cover-up. It's un-American. Keep in mind, this guy is the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Adam Schiff is a complete nut case. His allies in the media though are certainly more subtle than that. They know that cover-up isn't a plausible way to describe declassification. It's laughable. So instead, they are going with the term \"distraction.\" Watch."

In some cases, they are full blown crises. They need solutions and serious people to think about those solutions. Every day this farce about Russia and cover-ups continues is another day that America gets weaker and more divided. After a while, you begin to conclude it must be intentional.

It seems like political games, but there is nothing more important right now that our focus should be on but this issue, did our Federal government -- those in charge of using extraordinary powers under the FISA rules and using the FISA Court -- did they abuse it? So first we should be. But there are two other groups that should be very concerned. Those that were involved in the process of getting a warrant using the FISA Court if they did so without justification or if they did so without following the rules or they knew that there was some aspect of the information they were providing that was not credible, they should be concerned, and we should be digging into that. The second group is certainly those that may be -- may have been in Congress.

The President didn't just say, \"Release it,\" and by the way he has absolute authority to control what is classified and what is not classified, and here, he has asked the Attorney General to work with the heads of the Intelligence community, including the Director of National Security to look at these documents, redact what needs to be redacted and release what can be released. I see that as a thoughtful approach to the classification issue."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So if you are the head of one of these agencies, if you are Chris Wray for example at FBI, apparently, he is fighting against any declassification efforts, that's kind of the classic posture of a Washington bureaucrat, of an agency head. He wants to protect his own people and his own fiefdom. So why should that -- we consider that meaningful? Like in the end, who cares whether his agency is embarrassed? Doesn't our right to have confidence in our government override those concerns? Shouldn't it override those concerns?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "You are exactly right. In 2003, I was in the United States Senate. I was responsible for helping get the reauthorization of the Patriot Act done and I recall Jim Comey then, the Deputy Attorney General, Bob Mueller, the Director of the FBI giving assurance to Congress as we expanded their power under the Patriot Act and we expanded the rules of the FISA Court and its application giving assurances that it would not be utilized against American citizens. And if it was, it would be because they had salute evidence of that citizen's work with an agent of a foreign power. That's not what appears to have happened. So are we entitled to have answers? We are and we shouldn't care whether or not -- and I know Chris Wray, we were U.S. Attorneys at the same time, and I have a lot of respect, but with all due respect, our need to know is greater than any need to not be embarrassed."

The heads of all the different Intelligence services are going to take a chop on this. They're going to redact what needs to be redacted, and the bottom line is, the American people own this information and they have the right to know what's in it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, exactly. So that's funny, you anticipated my next question, which is, as someone who worked inside an Intel agency for as long as you did in, in the Federal bureaucracy for as long as you did, do the people who run these agencies remember that they're working on behalf of voters, that they're accountable to voters through their elected representatives, and that all of the information they gather belongs to the public and not to them? Do they keep that in mind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRIAKOU",
      "utterance": "No, they don't quite simply. You know, the thing about these intelligence agencies and not just the intelligence agencies, but the FBI as well, is when people finally make their way to the top or into the mid- level leadership positions. It's because they've been there for 20 years, or 25 or 30 years and they know that they cannot wait Presidents. Presidents come and go and they are there always and most of the time, they think that they can just wait out this President and he will leave and somebody else will be President and by then, they're going to be okay again. So no, they don't consider the voters. They don't consider even the wishes of the President. They just want this problem to go away, and they think that if they stonewall long enough that it will go away."

      "speaker": "KIRIAKOU",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say that he has something to hide and he is afraid that a true transparent investigation is going to reveal whatever it is that he has to hide. Remember, John Brennan is not an old man. He is still young enough that he has -- or at least he thinks he has something of a future in Washington. He is the kind of guy who is not shy about telling people here in town that he wants to be Secretary of Defense in a Democratic administration. Now, if there's an investigation and information is developed that he was, in part responsible for spying on the Trump campaign, or for encouraging FISA warrants to be issued against an innocent American, Carter Page, maybe he is not going to be the Secretary of Defense. And I think that's what he is worried about."

He is trying very desperately, I think, in his own way to deescalate. But he really has to pull the Carrier Battle Group out of the Persian Gulf. He needs to get it out of there, put it out in the Arabian Sea, even put it in the eastern Mediterranean, but get it out of the Gulf. That's the real trigger right now.

You have on the one side, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and the Gulf, who are trying to escalate the tension and the conflict by dragging us in. We are there ostensibly to protect them. But in reality, they would like to drag us into conflict with Iran. Obviously, the Israelis would appreciate that as well. But it's primarily right now Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arabs, they're unhappy with what's happened in Yemen with the fact that the Houthis haven't all committed suicide yet.

So they are going to do whatever they can to advocate for conflict. That's the problem. The team of one sits there and says, \"Wait a minute. Why?\" I mean, we've been through this process in the past. There is no evidence that Iran had anything to do with the attacks on the tankers, far from it. In fact, anybody who knows the Iranians knows that if they were actually trying to sink those ships, they'd have done it. So that looks like another false flag designed once again to create tension and drag us into the fight."

You know, these kinds of things keep happening over and over and over again, I think President Trump knows better. But he really needs to get involved personally, de-escalate this thing. The Iranians are trying very hard to communicate with us through intermediaries. I think we should talk to them privately, quietly in a third country, and sort out some of these differences, but we should not be in the intra-Muslim war. It's not our war."

And in his speech, Newsom submitted that business leaders in California are distressed, some of them are angry, some of them are fleeing the state entirely and not coming back.

Now, we'd like to think that we have enough power to convince people of things that aren't true, to work our voodoo, but we're not capable of doing that. What we've done instead is just show people what's happening in the largest state in the union, in California. And every day we do that. And every day the message is the same, homeless encampments in downtown Los Angeles; San Francisco, filthy, prettiest city in the continental United States -- destroyed, Sacramento. Across the state, same story -- piles of needles, mounds of garbage and human waste. It's ridiculous. And then the absurd laws, bans on plastic straws or preventing authorities from reporting illegal immigrants to I.C.E. How does that help anybody? It doesn't help a single American citizen. Then the sky high taxes and housing costs that make the place unlivable for the middle class. You don't take our word for it, because we've had video and statistical evidence for everything we say, obviously. But let's be serious. Nobody in California needed us to tell them their state is in freefall. They see it every day themselves. The question is, does the Governor care? He doesn't appear to. As California declines, its housing crisis seems worse in its most affluent towns. It's interesting paradox. Mountain View, California is the home of Google, the world's most powerful tech company. Apartments rent in Mountain View for more than $4,100.00 per month, on average. The average home cost more than $1.8 million, and these are ranch style homes. These are not big. You wouldn't want to live in one, trust me Now, homelessness, not surprisingly, is exploding in Mountain View, hundreds of people living out of RVs. The city's solution -- kick them out. The city councilors enacted a ban on RVs parking in the city overnight. This is a story that tells you a lot about a lot. To respond to it tonight, we've asked, Jason Nichols, Professor of African-American Studies at the University of Maryland to join us. Professor, thanks very much for coming on."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So there's a paradox here. Mountain View, one of the richest places in the world, also one of the most liberal. And yet, it's a city that's really defined by its income inequality. And it's not alone in that. In fact, across the country, the places with the greatest divide between rich and poor, are almost exclusively left-wing places. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICHOLS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that it goes beyond this kind of political divide that we're talking about. I think that actually, we're seeing gentrification around the country, in red states and blue states and red cities and blue cities. This is just a matter of income inequality altogether. The fact that the price of housing is rising much higher and much faster than the wages. Wages are rising it about 3 percent right now, which is a good rate. We have a strong economy, but housing prices are rising by about 5 percent and have been for several years. So I think that this is more than just political and I think we need to come in as Americans and come to some positive solution."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It is. I agree -- I agree with that. But I don't agree that this is happening in red cities and blue cities. It's just happening in blue cities. I don't think that there is a red state in this country, a place controlled by conservatives that has this level of income inequality. No place in Wyoming, for example, has this. Rural Alabama doesn't have this. It's San Francisco. It's New York. It's Seattle. It's Portland, Oregon. It's Los Angeles. These are the most liberal places in America, and yet they have the most homeless. I mean, at some point, you have to ask, what is going on?"

      "speaker": "NICHOLS",

And unfortunately, you know, I want to give a shout out to everybody in Wyoming, but there are many people who don't want to live in Wyoming or don't want to live in rural Alabama. But many people, particularly people with lots of money, want to live in places like San Francisco and that leads to a push out, and people end up without homes and prices actually because the demand is so high, the supply is low."

So if you're in Mount -- you know, if you're the founders of Google and you are progressive icons, and you really believe you're a good person, because you help so many people. Why aren't you doing something to help people right on the sidewalk in front of your mansion? Why isn't Nancy Pelosi doing something about homelessness in her city? I don't get it. I honestly don't get it."

      "speaker": "NICHOLS",
      "utterance": "Well, no, I would agree that there are many things that politicians need to do on both sides of the aisle in order to, you know, deal with this crisis, but I would say again, I would also go with the fact that the leader of HUD, who is you know, my old friend, Dr. Carson, is someone who is rising rents on some of the poorest people in the country right now. They're doing some good things at HUD, and I'm not so sure that Dr. Carson is the guy to talk to, but there are many people over there who are also rising rents on people who can't afford it and that's leading to more of a push out. Of course in California, you have eight in ten people actually live outdoors. So people in RVs are actually somewhat fortunate in that circumstance. So I think it's -- it's both sides of the aisle, Tucker."

If you can -- if you find -- I hope you'll come back if you can find a city of over a hundred thousand people in America, run by conservatives that has the same problem with homelessness or income inequality. I just don't think there is one, but maybe there is and I will stand corrected if you can find it. Professor, thank you very much."

That still doesn't happen though because elites don't actually care about democracy. They're happy to ignore it when it doesn't affirm their wishes. So yesterday, the British public voted in the European Union elections. The top party in the polls is Nigel Farage's Brexit party and that's running on a very simple platform, \"Get Britain out of the E.U.\" Now that idea is against the left's agenda, so much like in America they've responded with violence. The new fad in Britain is leftist throwing milkshakes at people they don't like. Nigel Farage was attacked on Monday."

An 80-year-old military veteran in Britain was also attacked since he was a supporter of Farage's party. Physically attacking people for their beliefs, of course, is fascism and an actual attack on democracy. So what has the response been from powerful people in Britain? Well, of course, they support it. A columnist for \"The Guardian\" called it justifiable political theater. Burger King's U.K. Twitter account tweeted this quote, \"Dear people of Scotland, we're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun.\" Little woke capitalism for you, and the founder of Chorlton Brewing Company in Manchester said that throwing milkshakes was not enough instead, quote, \"Hit them over the head with a brick as is traditional.\" No one should be surprised though, the left stop caring about democracy long ago. What they want is power and any behavior is justified if it gets them more of it. Understand that and you will understand them. It's getting hard to keep track of all the things that are racist these days. Jefferson statues, milk, not wanting African-Americans to abort their children. That's racist. Now add another one to the long list -- cauliflower is racist. In a video posted on Sunday, young pioneer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, explained to her followers that it is deeply problematic to grow cauliflower in urban gardens."

And it actually hurts the environment to have the same old same old, so the core in the cauliflower is colonialism.

      "speaker": "AREU",

So if we grow new things, so forget the tobacco, forget the cauliflower, we need the new yucca, we need the fiddleheads. We need the new -- different -- plantains.

But the simple fact is, our animals are important to us. When it's important to us, when it's something that matters to us, that's what's the most fun to take away, because it's the exercise of powers and about making a better society. Take a look at America over the last 20 years. How did Iraq work out? The collapse on Wall Street. Obamacare. Failure after failure after failure.

No one brings me drinks in the woods, so I don't want to be there. But other people think differently. Other people like to hunt. It's important to them. It's important to the way they build their communities and their families and their cultures. You go out to like Michigan and they'll close the schools, so families can go out and hunt deer. That makes it even more of a target because our coastal urban elites can boss around a bunch of people they think are knuckle dragging, Jesus, gun people.

They worship their own dogma. They worship their own moral superiority over us. And if we won't comply, if we dare to worship God or Allah or go to the synagogue or do whatever, it means we're not worshipping them. It means we're not acknowledging their moral superiority.

      "utterance": "Tucker, always great to be back with you. Here are my three biggest hits of the week. Story number three: Bill de Blasio defies the odds again. Bill de Blasio has been a favorite of yours and mine, Tucker. I know the failed socialist mayor of New York City who has approval ratings that are somehow in the negative. I don't know how that's even possible. But Tucker, get a load of this one. Bill de Blasio has defied the laws of statistics and is polling at a phenomenal zero percent. How that's possible, Tucker, I don't know. You and I both know, if were to substitute a teacher's class, Tucker, and walk into a class and say, \"Kids who wants homework?\" There's always that one kid who says yes. There's never zero percent in anything, except Bill de Blasio. It's just amazing. It's phenomenal, isn't it? Aren't you impressed?"

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Oh, he's peachy. We love him. All right. Story number two. This, I love this one. Forty percent of Americans are embracing and giving a hug to socialism. I think the alternate headline is probably more appropriate here, Tucker. Four in ten Americans have no idea what socialism is. Ladies and gentlemen, clearly you have not done your homework on socialism. You know, the little things like a hundred million dead -- the death, destruction, starvation. Mao's China, the Great Leap Forward, which is really a huge leap backwards. Kind of a big deal. You may want to crack a textbook before you answer that poll question next. I'm just saying, throwing that out there for you. Now, on a serious note, story number one, the biggest story of the week. It broke last night while you actually handed off the toss to me when I was filling in for Sean, this declassification story. Let me just tell you this Tucker. Americans need to know the truth. You've been all over this. I've been all over this. I got an e-mail today that really disturbed me. It's from a friend of mine up on Capitol Hill who is knee deep in this. You know what he said to me, Tucker? He said, \"We're at a really dangerous inflection point now, Dan.\" He said, \"The Democrats have completely forfeited Western values. This spy thing is a big deal. We need to get to the bottom of it.\" Huge story, my number one story of the week."
