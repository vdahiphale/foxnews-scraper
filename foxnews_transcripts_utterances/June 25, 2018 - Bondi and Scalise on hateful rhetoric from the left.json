They don't like his success. That's why it's getting louder and more insane by the day. And the left is actually now targeting those who actually work and support President Trump.

Last week, we first reported the president's 12-year-old son the target of a vile attack just like Secretary Nielsen on Twitter from Peter Fonda. Yes, Hanoi Jane's brother.

Where's the compassion of the left? I thought the Democratic Party had a monopoly on love and peace and compassion. Apparently not. Now, of course, you wouldn't know the extent of this vitriol if you only watch the mainstream media. Check this out. In fact, according to a report, NewsBusters, your establishment, corrupt, destroyed Trump media in America totally ignored the story about Trump's four-year-old granddaughter.

That was law was passed by Congress, signed into law by another president.

The magazine cover, like so much in the news today, is a lie, and Time, believe it or not, it's standing by their cover for sale now at a bookstore near you.

You wonder why Americans don't trust you? now the truth is so many in the left-wing media, they're not fair, they're not balanced journalists as they claim to be. Instead, they are shills. They're an extension of the Democratic Party and that's plain and simple. And the agenda for the Democratic Party, by the way, if they get elected, it's pretty simple. It's not a shock here. It doesn't matter whether the Democrats running from California, West Virginia. They're all working toward the same thing, what would they do? We're go to impeach Donald Trump but we're not going to tell you. Please, Maxine, just stop saying it, we're going to do it, just don't say it. And, then, of course, they want to keep Obamacare and open borders. Oh, and, yes, they want you didn't want their crumbs back.

And in the crazy season, they used same playbook and that is a campaign of identity politics to convince you Republicans are evil. They claim Republicans are racist and sexist and misogynist and xenophobic and homophobic and Islamophobic, that Republicans want dirty air and water, that they want to kill your children. And, by the way, if you have a grandmother, they want to throw her over the cliff. Now, to demonstrate this absolute fact -- well, tonight's a \"Hannity\" history lesson to bring you back. Let's take a look back through time at example after example of example of Democrats using race and gender to divide this country so that they can convince you Republicans are all evil.

But these tactics, we'll have a \"Hannity\" history lesson tonight, are nothing new and in a few minutes, we're going to give you that history lesson into how Democrats use identity politics to divide rich versus poor, old versus young, and along racial lines and everywhere in between. We've got the evidence. And also, we have highlights from the president's latest political rally which you just saw. Plus., we have so many developments to bring you surrounding Mueller's witch-hunt, along with really bizarre behavior from actor Tom Arnold and more from Rosenstein's ongoing obstruction. And breaking tonight, The Hill's John Solomon is now reporting James Comey personally killed an immunity deal with Julian Assange -- in other words, the one guy that could have given us evidence, where did the emails come from, Russia or somewhere else? Apparently, he's saying he could have proved it. Sit tight. Monday's almost over and it's time for our very important breaking news opening monologue."

Here is why -- let me explain -- why this is all happening. The left not only -- they never expected Donald Trump to win, they never thought he'd be this successful. He is a threat to everything wrong about them. His success is the left's worst nightmare. In other words, they need Donald Trump to fail if the Democrats ever want to regain power -- well, that one's their power they're hoping for, they have to pray for failure. That means you fail, that means America fails, that means the forgotten men and women will continue to be forgotten. You know, Bill Maher, probably the only honest one, he's hoping for a recession. Really? Doesn't affect him. Now, here we are one and a half years into the presidency of Donald Trump, what do we see? In 500 days the economy is booming, record unemployment rates in 14 states. We have more jobs than people on unemployment. We have literally the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women in the workplace. We have the highest GDP growth in over a decade. We have the lowest tax cuts, the biggest tax cut we've ever had. We've had a demolishing of burdens and regulations. We had successful negotiations so far that are ongoing with North Korea, ISIS is defeated and on the run, the Iranian stupid deal of Obama's dead, Jerusalem promised by so many presidents is now the capital of Israel and so much more. With each success, the Democrats' dreams of kicking Trump out of office becomes more faint and more remote and now, they feel it and they're lashing out. They don't like his success. That's why it's getting louder and more insane by the day. And the left is actually now targeting those who actually work and support President Trump. Look at this, New Jersey so-called senator, president wannabe, Cory Booker, is calling for Americans to confront Trump officials. Look at Maxine Waters. Well, she's been calling for Trump's impeachment since it's almost his first day in office. Well, Maxine Waters is urging supporters to accost Trump allies wherever they go. This is dangerous.

They stopped me. So, he came up then and stopped them, so then we went into theater thought it was diffused, we're up getting popcorn at the concession stand, and they came up again, just every curse word in the book and they're this far from my face, one spit on my head.

And this goes for all people regardless of politics. Some have chosen to push hate and vandalism against the restaurant that I was asked to leave from. A Hollywood actor publicly encouraged people to kidnap my children. And this weekend, a member of Congress called for people to push back and make clear to those serving their country in this administration that they are not welcome anywhere anytime for anything.

Last week, we first reported the president's 12-year-old son the target of a vile attack just like Secretary Nielsen on Twitter from Peter Fonda. Yes, Hanoi Jane's brother. And he tweeted in part, quote: We should rip Barron Trump from his mother's arms, put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if the mother will stand up against the giant blob that she's married to. Now, President Trump's four-year-old granddaughter was also threatened on Twitter by a Canadian writer now both these people, OK, they apologized for these horrific threats, where are the arrests? You know what? You're not allowed to threaten the first family. What about Madonna? You're thinking an awful lot about blowing up the White House? Secret Service never talked to her. Where's the compassion of the left? I thought the Democratic Party had a monopoly on love and peace and compassion. Apparently not. Now, of course, you wouldn't know the extent of this vitriol if you only watch the mainstream media. Check this out. In fact, according to a report, NewsBusters, your establishment, corrupt, destroyed Trump media in America totally ignored the story about Trump's four-year-old granddaughter.

That was law was passed by Congress, signed into law by another president. But he did sign an executive order halting any separation of families until Congress can step up, do their job and change the law as they should have done a long time ago, but that didn't stop many of these crazies on the left from demonizing Donald Trump. Many cheered, for example, this Time Magazine cover. You see that? There's the big bad horrible president and a little girl who's crying because that little girl, according to Time Magazine had been separated from her mother and father. Well, the only problem is the girl was never separated from her mother or father, ever. The magazine cover, like so much in the news today, is a lie, and Time, believe it or not, it's standing by their cover for sale now at a bookstore near you. And then the media wonders why the American people call them fake news, why they chant \"CNN sucks\". You wonder why Americans don't trust you? now the truth is so many in the left-wing media, they're not fair, they're not balanced journalists as they claim to be. Instead, they are shills. They're an extension of the Democratic Party and that's plain and simple. And the agenda for the Democratic Party, by the way, if they get elected, it's pretty simple. It's not a shock here. It doesn't matter whether the Democrats running from California, West Virginia. They're all working toward the same thing, what would they do? We're go to impeach Donald Trump but we're not going to tell you. Please, Maxine, just stop saying it, we're going to do it, just don't say it. And, then, of course, they want to keep Obamacare and open borders. Oh, and, yes, they want you didn't want their crumbs back. Remember, you got the biggest tax cut ever in American history and Nancy Pelosi called the crumbs? They want the crumbs back so they can spend your money. Now, that's why what we're now heading into and we're going to have a lot of coverage on this, this is the most important midterm election in modern history, and like every two to four years, the Democrats were now in the crazy season. And in the crazy season, they used same playbook and that is a campaign of identity politics to convince you Republicans are evil. They claim Republicans are racist and sexist and misogynist and xenophobic and homophobic and Islamophobic, that Republicans want dirty air and water, that they want to kill your children. And, by the way, if you have a grandmother, they want to throw her over the cliff. Now, to demonstrate this absolute fact -- well, tonight's a \"Hannity\" history lesson to bring you back. Let's take a look back through time at example after example of example of Democrats using race and gender to divide this country so that they can convince you Republicans are all evil.

You got senior justice officials having very constructive conversations with Julian Assange his lawyer and all of a sudden Jim Comey is having a side bar with Senator Mark Warner and he passes his message along to Senator Warner saying cut off the investigation, tell that lawyer to stand down. We don't want Assange here. We don't know the reasons why. And the consequences go even beyond Russia.

We should expose these people for what they are. There should be total transparency.\" I agree with the president. So Strzok is going to get to hide behind closed doors.

He gets up every day cheerfully because he loves this country. However many disagreements I might have with him on minor things, he is fundamentally committed to making sure that we, our country that protects our sovereignty and protects our borders. And he is willing to absorb those slings and arrows of being called a racist and a xenophobe and a nativist and somebody who doesn't care and who is heartless.

Do you -- I'm to the getting to the point I'm worried somebody of these really going to get hurt or get killed here. Am I overreacting to what I'm seeing?"

You had the wonderful and brave and so inspiring Steve Scalise on your show. There's been a number of people who have been targeted. You had, you know, conservative political organizations whose offices have been targeted. Death threats. It's something that I've had to deal with. Anybody in public life. And you know what? It is going to backfire. It is going to backfire. Maxine Waters, keep slapping your mouth open."

It is no secret he is going to hammer the issue of immigration right up until the midterm elections coming up this fall. And even with families being separated with their children at the border, the president believes this issue is a winner for the Republican Party. As you could hear behind me, Wolf, the crowd is very fired up, we have about couple thousand people in this room. So far they are letting the press corps here know exactly how they feel about what we're doing here, Wolf."
