Russia continuing its brutal assault on Ukraine but it comes with heavy losses. NATO's top commander now saying that Russia may have lost as many as 15,000 troops so far.

Kamala Harris was going to go and make the announcement and it was going to happen and the night before or day and a half before, Biden changed his mind. Now that might be fine and we might look back and say he probably, maybe that was a good decision. But they sent her there was nothing and then she didn't have a great performance, but that's typical, so then she has nothing to say -- to deliver. It is interesting how he wants to be the leader of the free world, but he's also been in the backseat. He was dragged into the sanctions by Europe and by -- and then by Congress, right, on the oil part of this equation. So, what do they deliver here? If they can deliver some sort of way to say we have intelligence that says Putin is going to draw back and say that partial victory because they're not going to be in NATO. Is that a way to end things? OK, fine. If Ukraine says if that happens, we got to have some sort of security guarantee for our people so we can rebuild this place, can Biden to that? Yes, maybe, that might be something he could do. And then the other thing that they have to do is figure out a way to collect more intelligence on Putin's plans because that is actually been something that our intelligence community has done very well. Penetrated into the Kremlin and they are confused, they are not sure who is telling people what and so I will continue to try to drive that wedge if they can, I'm not talking about regime change but letting the generals know that, like we're on to you and you are losing these many people and it could even be more than that.",

When you consider the fact that the Russians have lost 15,000 troops so far which is more than they lost in the war in Afghanistan. They have soldiers regularly turning themselves over to the Ukrainians. They're suffering from frostbite, they're frozen. They don't have the appropriate equipment to do this. The sanctions have been incredibly difficult, obviously for the everyday Russians but have hit a lot of these oligarchs who apparently turning left and right on Putin. There was a rumor I don't know if it has been confirmed yet, that one of his very high-ranking generals has actually turned around and said I'm not interested in this. And in terms of real on the ground deliverables, Jake Sullivan was briefing the press on the plane heading over to the NATO summit. He said that the U.S. is coming with more humanitarian aid which is something they desperately need, and also refugee assistance. And that's where I feel like the U.S. has dropped the ball in all of this. It's something insane like only 11 Ukrainian refugees have been allowed in since this war started. They're only basically letting people who were here before the war started stay. And that's a huge dereliction of duty. You cannot have what's going on with Poland, whether taking millions and millions and millions and not step up to the plate there. Calling it a war crime, big deal from Secretary Blinken today. And also, I wanted to mention that Madeleine Albright passed away today as well, which is incredibly sad event. I don't know, I was thinking of Blinken talking about war crimes and then Madeleine Albright have been through. Anyway, I think that we are doing a lot. And I think that the intricacies and how complicated this is to unite western countries, we all say we're united. We're all democracies. We are very different types of countries who get our gas, our oil, our food from very diverse places. And I think that Biden is doing a hell of a good job actually in keeping the wheels running on this. And we'll see what he says at NATO but the Ukrainians are getting a lot of help from us.",

I didn't have to go to the doctor or hospital about it.

So everyone was bringing them back for Delta and then for Omicron. And he just said, no, it's done here. He had never understood outdoor mask mandates. And actually gotten a little fight with the governor of New Mexico, because New Mexico brought the mandates back, and he just said, I don't see the science behind this.

But the witness cyclists who saw this apparently saw this Lauren, cross the street, the 26 year old and then call her name that began with B and then shoved her from behind. The Prosecutors allege that they -- she shoved her from behind, the 87 year old victim falls and almost bleeds out, ends up dying five days later in the hospital. This Lauren, the 26 year old, the tide turn, when she didn't go to help her. She didn't call the police. She instead has a fight with her fiance seven minutes later, she stands in the background like any criminal or returns to the scene of the crime, watches the ambulance come, does nothing and does all of that stuff which shows consciousness the guilt. So here's the question, will she be convicted of manslaughter and the second degree for which, you know, she faces a manslaughter, first, she faces 25 years, possibly. But the jury is going to be asked is a push enough for death. She's not charged with murder, they may end up with a crim neg. I'd like to know what's wrong with this 26 year old, what her motive was.

I mean, this was an emergency a long time ago. We waited so long it could have occurred before the war because we could see it coming. We knew there were problems. Those troops are amassing since April of last year. I'm going to go back to what I said before and you echoed it, which was Trump was pretty good at the stuff.

To think about the Russian side, we tend to rule things out, they don't rule things out. You know? That's their thing. But I don't have confidence in Joe. I don't think he has an original thought. He might -- he is good at saying good job to other people in the room but he can't just say, come on, man to Putin when he's not even there or he doesn't take your calls. So, I think the one thing he's got to say, this is when my expertise comes in, stick to one essential truth. The invasion was a clear violation of international law. Don't start talking about protecting liberal democracies because places like China and Russia they don't draw that line. It's not that important to them."

Kamala Harris was going to go and make the announcement and it was going to happen and the night before or day and a half before, Biden changed his mind. Now that might be fine and we might look back and say he probably, maybe that was a good decision. But they sent her there was nothing and then she didn't have a great performance, but that's typical, so then she has nothing to say -- to deliver. It is interesting how he wants to be the leader of the free world, but he's also been in the backseat. He was dragged into the sanctions by Europe and by -- and then by Congress, right, on the oil part of this equation. So, what do they deliver here? If they can deliver some sort of way to say we have intelligence that says Putin is going to draw back and say that partial victory because they're not going to be in NATO. Is that a way to end things? OK, fine. If Ukraine says if that happens, we got to have some sort of security guarantee for our people so we can rebuild this place, can Biden to that? Yes, maybe, that might be something he could do. And then the other thing that they have to do is figure out a way to collect more intelligence on Putin's plans because that is actually been something that our intelligence community has done very well. Penetrated into the Kremlin and they are confused, they are not sure who is telling people what and so I will continue to try to drive that wedge if they can, I'm not talking about regime change but letting the generals know that, like we're on to you and you are losing these many people and it could even be more than that."

We got to provide money to rebuild, we've got to take care of the refugees. Maybe a world global famine now out in terms of food? And I keep going back to my thought which is this, get the NATO country to stand there with Zelenskyy with three leaders every day. Get the pope. If Pope Francis is upset about it, Pope, with all due respect, stand there with Zelenskyy. Get the Russian patriarch the great Orthodox Church, as well as the head of the great Orthodox Church.

      "utterance": "I don't know. It seems like a pretty tremendous effort has been made. When you consider the fact that the Russians have lost 15,000 troops so far which is more than they lost in the war in Afghanistan. They have soldiers regularly turning themselves over to the Ukrainians. They're suffering from frostbite, they're frozen. They don't have the appropriate equipment to do this. The sanctions have been incredibly difficult, obviously for the everyday Russians but have hit a lot of these oligarchs who apparently turning left and right on Putin. There was a rumor I don't know if it has been confirmed yet, that one of his very high-ranking generals has actually turned around and said I'm not interested in this. And in terms of real on the ground deliverables, Jake Sullivan was briefing the press on the plane heading over to the NATO summit. He said that the U.S. is coming with more humanitarian aid which is something they desperately need, and also refugee assistance. And that's where I feel like the U.S. has dropped the ball in all of this. It's something insane like only 11 Ukrainian refugees have been allowed in since this war started. They're only basically letting people who were here before the war started stay. And that's a huge dereliction of duty. You cannot have what's going on with Poland, whether taking millions and millions and millions and not step up to the plate there. Calling it a war crime, big deal from Secretary Blinken today. And also, I wanted to mention that Madeleine Albright passed away today as well, which is incredibly sad event. I don't know, I was thinking of Blinken talking about war crimes and then Madeleine Albright have been through. Anyway, I think that we are doing a lot. And I think that the intricacies and how complicated this is to unite western countries, we all say we're united. We're all democracies. We are very different types of countries who get our gas, our oil, our food from very diverse places. And I think that Biden is doing a hell of a good job actually in keeping the wheels running on this. And we'll see what he says at NATO but the Ukrainians are getting a lot of help from us."

What I find so incredible is that she is so willing to look for every excuse she can to get out from under sentencing guidelines as it relates to child porn.

I think that there are a lot of people who say obviously this is ridiculous and the Republicans are blowing this out of proportion. However, parents aren't going to see it that way. They're not going to hear it that way and parental involvement in their children's lives is the a, number one issue in all of these swing districts and the swing states. So, let's just say you're in a tough district and you thought you were going to run on the fact that Joe Biden had just nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court the first black woman and this is going to be something to be celebrated.

And no one told me to put it on until we actually boarded the plane. So I kind of was putting mine on and Emma didn't put it on at all. Not very compliant. And she was scolded, but gently.

But when I get onto the flight JetBlue was a little bit more persnickety. They are and it wasn't a personal announcement. It was the over the intercom announcement.

I didn't have to go to the doctor or hospital about it. But the person I think has been the most interesting on this is the governor, the Democratic governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, because after the first wave of mask mandates went away, he never brought them back. So everyone was bringing them back for Delta and then for Omicron. And he just said, no, it's done here. He had never understood outdoor mask mandates. And actually gotten a little fight with the governor of New Mexico, because New Mexico brought the mandates back, and he just said, I don't see the science behind this.

Prosecutors say that after pushing the victim to the sidewalk and leaving her there bleeding from the head, the suspects spent almost a half hour in the area and even watched as an ambulance came to help.

We don't know what caused this. What instigated it, not as though, it's not like there's a justification. But the witness cyclists who saw this apparently saw this Lauren, cross the street, the 26 year old and then call her name that began with B and then shoved her from behind. The Prosecutors allege that they -- she shoved her from behind, the 87 year old victim falls and almost bleeds out, ends up dying five days later in the hospital. This Lauren, the 26 year old, the tide turn, when she didn't go to help her. She didn't call the police. She instead has a fight with her fiance seven minutes later, she stands in the background like any criminal or returns to the scene of the crime, watches the ambulance come, does nothing and does all of that stuff which shows consciousness the guilt. So here's the question, will she be convicted of manslaughter and the second degree for which, you know, she faces a manslaughter, first, she faces 25 years, possibly. But the jury is going to be asked is a push enough for death. She's not charged with murder, they may end up with a crim neg. I'd like to know what's wrong with this 26 year old, what her motive was. But anyone who understands criminal law knows the motive is irrelevant. She pushed her, she shoved her. The woman died. That's the clear and tenseless she shoved her. And, you know now the defense attorney Arthur Aidala who's excellent, guy's brilliant. He's saying, you know, she shouldn't even be, you know, in jail.

And the Vice President was reportedly furious over the photo that Vogue used when she was featured on the cover wearing Converse sneakers. But Biden's team told her to back down because it was, \"a first world problem.\" We don't have a ton of time. So I'm going to lead with the example I care about most which is the Vogue cover. And I agree with her on this. I don't know Dana, what you think?"

So if you don't want to be filmed -- and just wanting photographed wearing your sneakers on the front page of Vogue don't wear them, don't ever do it and that you could blame her staff if she wants to blame somebody else. Don't blame Anna Wintour, whatever. She should blame her staff. If you want to look a certain way you have to dress a certain way. The other thing is, I don't -- I'm just trying to remember, I don't believe that you stand for the Vice President when he enters the room. I know -- I don't, I love Dick Cheney. I don't believe we ever did. If it was -- if it's just him if the President's coming in with him. Yes, you do. But no, I don't think so."
