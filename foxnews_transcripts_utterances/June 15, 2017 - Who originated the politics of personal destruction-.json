Are conservatives the ones shouting people down on campus? Are conservatives blockading offices and physically attacking speakers? Are conservatives rioting after elections? Are conservatives harassing professors for calling out racism? Are conservatives stabbing police horses? Are they throwing urine on young women? This attack on discourse is not a right wing thing, it's a left-wing thing who perfected it for decades, seeking to subvert the West. I don't know one righty who wears a Che shirt. But I remember Bill Ayers. He set off bombs. Whose side is he on again? It's the same side targeting descent with violence now. The premise is simple: If they think you are evil, not just wrong, then there can be no dialogue and only violence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, there's the rub: If a person agrees with you that it's time for calmness, then they aren't the problem. It's the people who embrace violence who are. I'd ask them to stop right now but I don't think they watch \"The Five.\" Juan, Nancy said it. I will start with the Clintons. Do you think that's accurate? I mean, don't you think the '70s -- it started before that with the Vietnam War in demonizing -- I would say, my theory is it started with Nixon and blaming him for the Vietnam War and calling all those soldiers baby killers. I think that's where it came. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I would go forward Greg from there to the 2,000 election and the kind of acrimony and accusations about cheating in the election and the Supreme Court decision.

      "sentences": "You made that great point last night, this is just in their bloodstream, it's what they do. So, Juan's point about the personal destruction of the 90s. I think it was Bill Clinton who destroyed his own presidency by making a dumb personal decision. So, let's just make sure we have that clear. Nancy Pelosi is politicizing an assassination attempt against her own colleague. She didn't even wait 24 hours. The guy is still in the hospital. She's pointing fingers at Republicans after a Democrat pointed a gun at Republicans and squeezed the trigger? I think right now what you're seeing is, the media and the Democrats have almost accepted death and violence in the political discourse. And when celebrities go out there and they talk about killing and assassination and blowing up the White House, no one in the media draws the line for them. They don't say stop. So, they don't know where the line is. And, you know, you didn't have a thousand newspaper reporters, thousands of TV personalities, five networks and all this mainstream media constantly trying to destroy President Obama and trying to impeach President Obama. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You didn't have that. And right now you just have an avalanche of negativity. You don't have Republican politicians going out there and saying that, you know, President Obama kills people and he's a killer. You have that right now against President Trump. So, I think one of the real reasons the left is so bloodthirsty is because Trump threatens their existence. If he succeeds and America first succeeds, their credibility and their coalitions, they're done. So, this is life and death for the Left. And I think the more Trump does succeed, I think the more violent it's going to get. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And basically, if you look at what happened then from the media standpoint, once talk radio sort of comes into play and FOX News is susceptible, you saw the left gets really resentful that there were successful media outlets that were providing this counterweight to what had been out there for so long and never been challenged. Now, with social media, you actually are taking a lot of the networks in the newspapers out of the equation.

Are conservatives the ones shouting people down on campus? Are conservatives blockading offices and physically attacking speakers? Are conservatives rioting after elections? Are conservatives harassing professors for calling out racism? Are conservatives stabbing police horses? Are they throwing urine on young women? This attack on discourse is not a right wing thing, it's a left-wing thing who perfected it for decades, seeking to subvert the West. I don't know one righty who wears a Che shirt. But I remember Bill Ayers. He set off bombs. Whose side is he on again? It's the same side targeting descent with violence now.

I think it was Bill Clinton who destroyed his own presidency by making a dumb personal decision. So, let's just make sure we have that clear. Nancy Pelosi is politicizing an assassination attempt against her own colleague. She didn't even wait 24 hours. The guy is still in the hospital. She's pointing fingers at Republicans after a Democrat pointed a gun at Republicans and squeezed the trigger? I think right now what you're seeing is, the media and the Democrats have almost accepted death and violence in the political discourse. And when celebrities go out there and they talk about killing and assassination and blowing up the White House, no one in the media draws the line for them. They don't say stop. So, they don't know where the line is. And, you know, you didn't have a thousand newspaper reporters, thousands of TV personalities, five networks and all this mainstream media constantly trying to destroy President Obama and trying to impeach President Obama. You didn't have that. And right now you just have an avalanche of negativity. You don't have Republican politicians going out there and saying that, you know, President Obama kills people and he's a killer. You have that right now against President Trump. So, I think one of the real reasons the left is so bloodthirsty is because Trump threatens their existence. If he succeeds and America first succeeds, their credibility and their coalitions, they're done. So, this is life and death for the Left. And I think the more Trump does succeed, I think the more violent it's going to get."

You know, for President Trump, you are racist, you're sexist, anything that you can think of they have said. But how did the Democrats explain all the middle-class and working men and women that came out and voted for President Trump? Are all of those people bad too? I think they forget. Because they're in the sort of like, very vocal minority bubble of extremist language and alt-left, that they might be actually offending a large number of hard-working voting Americans out there who aren't spewing stuff but they are listening and hearing what's been going on.

Basically none of us are about to go out and shoot somebody because of their views might be opposing to ours. On the Ben Shapiro show today, he was talking about that the roots of this actually go all the way back with the Left demonizing the right during the JFK assassination. And basically, if you look at what happened then from the media standpoint, once talk radio sort of comes into play and FOX News is susceptible, you saw the left gets really resentful that there were successful media outlets that were providing this counterweight to what had been out there for so long and never been challenged. Now, with social media, you actually are taking a lot of the networks in the newspapers out of the equation. Most people get their news online. And a lot of this, I think one thing is very sad, and we haven't had a lot of reporting about this yet. But a lot of these people like Hodgkinson, the shooter, when he's on those websites, you know, wanting to destroy the Republican Party or whatever that was that he was part of a Facebook group, a lot of that content is fueled by fake newser, that actual fake news coming from Russia and Macedonia. People that are actually wholesale making up stories and trying to stoke anger and trying to figure out a way that they can actually make money because of the clicks. So, there's a whole different sort of media thing that it's happening, that wasn't there 60 years ago but that it's building. And now it's like basically throwing fuel on the fire."

A photo of Scalise then appeared on the jumbotron as a member of the Republican team. And Democrats and Republicans alike all rose in 42 seconds of a standing ovation. A few minutes later, an email update came from the hospital where doctors say that Scalise is going to be there for some time that he has improved in the last 24 hours. MedStar Hospital which is about five miles from Nationals Park also announced tonight, the House Majority Whip had a second surgery today for internal injuries and for the broken bone in his leg. And for the first time since yesterday's ambush in Alexandria, one of the men who helped stop the gunmen, Capitol police officer David Bailey appeared here using crutches to get to the mound at the center of the diamond before dropping one of his crutches and tossing a first pitch straight to the catcher, Roberto Clemente, Jr. The entire crowd erupted in some of the loudest applause that you would hear. A few minutes after that, President Trump did go on the video board with the somber message about the importance of playing tonight's game. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner are here in attendance. And I can tell you from my spot here, in center field in the outfield that when President Trump was done talking, there was loud applause on the Democratic side over on the Left field bleachers and on the Republican side or on the right side bleachers -- Dana."

Not to that level but I mean those moments where you grip the nation. Jesse Owens of the Olympics.

And I hope he continues to fight through, it is very difficult when you have an injury like that and just in terms of the bullet not exiting the body, and they're none of damage to internal organs, and they tried to stabilized so that then they could do some follow-up surgeries to help them and pick his lay again. You know? So, you know, he's got a long road ahead of him. But obviously a tremendous amount of support which is fantastic. And this was very moving. I thought the President making the comments and doing this. I know he would have like to go but he couldn't because of the security issue, not enough timing, that that was nice that Jared and Ivanka went and his comments yesterday as well.

By the way, if you actually have ever read or viewed Julius Caesar, things don't turn out so great for the people who are involved in the assassination. The director of the play in defending it says this is an opportunity to chew over politics in a way that allows us to not be engaged in violence but to actually be thoughtful about it. That is what art is. That's why the First Amendment exists. I don't think that people who are my conservative friends who always are objecting to folks who would shut down discussion and debate on a college campus, would say now I want to shut down the theater and it's a Shakespearean play, it's not even some new play.

      "utterance": "Good job, good game. If I can say -- I do think that people should look at -- back to the topic at hand. Karl Rove was a target of Patrick Fitzgerald for a long time even do, and so was Scooter Libby, even though Patrick Fitzgerald knew on the first day that the underlying issue of who has (inaudible) Valerie Plame's name (ph) was done by Dick Armitage, the deputy secretary of state. And there were other people in Washington including people senior at the state department who knew about this and still said nothing and let people twist in the wind like that. I can understand the concern. However, I don't think \"The Washington Post\" story should be a cause for concern for the president. And I also think that Bob Mueller is a guy, whose basically character is being attacked right now, and he is not a showboat like Jim Comey, that was the accusation about him. He's keeping his head down. You don't see him out there defending himself. I'm sure that he wants to wrap this up as soon as everybody else does."

      "utterance": "It's not a good look for the investigation. It does not reflect well on the investigation. Let's just put it that way. And it raises questions again of impartiality. But if you look at what you just said earlier, actually yesterday, I think this is just the first normal step in the investigative process where you ask people what happened. It looks like a fact finding investigation. There have been a lot of leaks that have turned out to be wrong though. I think in one week alone in May, \"The Washington Post\" had four stories all turned out to be wrong. Deputy attorney general threatened to quit, wrong. FBI Director Comey fired after asking for more investigative funds, wrong. Trump revealed classified information to the Russians, wrong. Republicans treat rape as a pre-existing condition, wrong. Also suspicious timing on the announcement of \"The Washington Post\" story. So, I think we just have to wait until the facts come out."

I think the politics here and politics -- how it impacts the press, I think there is a legitimate reason for Jesse to say, is it right or wrong for Trump to question? I don't know about the witch hunt stuff. I think this is pretty serious because today, Vice President Pence went and got his own lawyer. This is not something that would say, oh, what's the big deal? All of a sudden the vice president gets his own lawyer."

So originally, it was going to be collusion. That fell apart. Immediately, everybody rushed to obstruction. But you can't obstruct a false narrative. I mean, it can't happen. So when that falls apart, we need to predict what the next charge is going to be. Will Donald Trump be accused of building a time machine that took them back to the '90s and he set Monica Lewinsky up with Bill Clinton?"

Raising money a lot of money for a very worthwhile charity tonight. Obviously everyone thinking about Congressman Scalise. When \"The Five\" returns, the father of Otto Warmbier, the American held captive by North Korea, lashes out at the brutal regime that just sent his son home in an unresponsive state.

Mr. Warmbier tormented a brutal (ph) regime for taking his loved one hostage, brutalizing, terrorizing him, finally sending him back to America in an unresponsive state. Fred Warmbier thanked the Trump administration for all it did to secure Otto's release. He also had some words for the previous administration."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, right? That's what he's saying. Look at his son. Look at the evidence. Look at the state in which his son returned. I'm sure they made efforts. Just to try to be able to get from all the reports and information is that they were -- this administration was quite forceful in using our envoy to be able to negotiate this and try to bring some resolution. And then also, the medical condition that Otto was in. Obviously, the last thing they want is if he passed away there instead of being here. It's just horrible. But obviously, what they did, what North Korea did to this -- to me, that's a war crime. To do this to that young man, who is very healthy, a great athlete, smart and kind, beloved by so many that knew him, and to put him through that torture and that abuse? I mean, if anything says that Kim Jong-un should go, it's this."

This is degrading. This is dehumanizing. I'm sickened by it. I'm disgusted by the fact that North Korea would send this guy back in this second state. It's disgusting. I hope the Trump administration punishes North Korea as severely as they possibly can. I know you can't do much in that kingdom. It's so isolated. But this is totally unacceptable."

I think that other regimes that are holding some of our hostages like for example we have Americans who are being held in very tough prison in Iran. Those are deteriorating situations as well. And so I think this shows that the administration is on top of it. It's not that the previous administration wasn't. I don't want to go that far. I do know that the North Koreans rejected all requests since March of 2016 until just recently. I think that is because of the worsening condition of this young man."

That's how I feel. I agree with everybody here that I think this is an act of war. This is like an ISIS execution."
