They have to make difficult choices every single day about groceries and gas. And on the security side, the physical security, Democrats pro-criminal policies have put -- have literally made our cities war zones. If you look at for instance the congressman's own state, New York City, they are experiencing a crime epidemic because of cashless bail, which he supports. You look at my city of Minneapolis. Minneapolis has already had 6,000 assaults were reported since the beginning of the year. And look, it's about the southwestern border being run over by cartels who are terrorizing American citizens, about every community in this country having to deal with the fentanyl crisis and parents wondering if their child is going to be the one that dies next. This is a security election. It's about groceries and gas. It's about being safe and secure in our homes and communities.

Inflation will come down with those gas prices but it is still too high. That's right. But the other side has no plan, of course, to reduce inflation. They have a plan to win power for themselves. And, of course, we're the ones that are lowering prescription drug costs by finally taking on big drug companies, capping seniors' out-of-pocket costs.

The point of the speech is that mainstream Republicans and Democrats agree on things like it's wrong to attack United States capital, to spread a pernicious lie about the election being stolen, to steal our nation's secrets and keep them down there at the motel Mar-a-Lago. I mean, Republicans and the Democrats are in large part in agreement.

I mean, Bill Barr, for goodness sake, knows right from wrong here. So this isn't just President Biden. This is mainstream versus MAGA. And we have a duty to defend American democracy. Look, we just lost 50 years of reproductive freedom because the runaway MAGA Supreme Court tore up Roe v. Wade. And every candidate -- your next guest is running for office -- supports tearing up Roe v. Wade. We're going to defend Roe v. Wade and reproductive freedom that all of us used to take for granted in America. So that's the movement that will take away your political freedom.

If you care at all about marriage equality, if you care about your reproductive choices like in vitro fertilization, or if you care about birth control, for goodness sake, these are the privacy rights we used to have in the Constitution that the MAGA -- MAGA Supreme Court just tore up and threw away.

Anyone who's read it knows that it meant there was a balancing test, it was a compromise between viability, early on in pregnancy, and later in pregnancy, and that was the common sense of that framework. What the MAGA crowd has done is rip away that decision from women and their doctors, take it out of the Constitution, and now, every state in the country can ban abortion. And if they get control of Congress, they will ban it in all 50 states.

They have to make difficult choices every single day about groceries and gas. And on the security side, the physical security, Democrats pro-criminal policies have put -- have literally made our cities war zones. If you look at for instance the congressman's own state, New York City, they are experiencing a crime epidemic because of cashless bail, which he supports. You look at my city of Minneapolis. Minneapolis has already had 6,000 assaults were reported since the beginning of the year. And look, it's about the southwestern border being run over by cartels who are terrorizing American citizens, about every community in this country having to deal with the fentanyl crisis and parents wondering if their child is going to be the one that dies next. This is a security election. It's about groceries and gas. It's about being safe and secure in our homes and communities.

Also this week, a \"Wall Street Journal\" poll has Democrats up three points over Republicans on the generic ballot. Republicans are up by five points in March.

Right now, we are almost seven points better on the generic ballot than we were just two years ago. In fact, on Election Day in 2020, Democrats on the generic were a +6.5, and I will remind her that we not only held ever Republican incumbent for the first time since 1994, but we picked up 15 seats in an environment where it was productive we were going to lose 15. The other thing you should look at is my counterpart announced a huge media buy last week.

That being said, if Democrats want to make abortion the main issue when every poll we have seen says that the economy and the cost of living is the number one issue, good luck to them trying to defend their extreme position. Every one of them voted for what I call the Chinese genocide bill, which would allow abortion up to moments before a child takes its first breath.

The raid on the former president's home is not only unprecedented, it's outrageous. And by the way, this double standard is why so many Americans are pissed off about this, Republicans, Democrats, independents, because while they go after Donald Trump and suggest that he's de something which they've been doing for years, I would say that they lost their credibility six years ago with the Russian collusion hoax.

If you think about it, every American who either chose to go into a trade or go to work, or went to college and paid off their debt like a responsible American is now going to pay $2,000 for someone else's debt. So, blue-collar American and responsible Americans are going to pay $2,000 for somebody else's college debt. They're not happy about it. Bu the way, look at a poll in New Hampshire in the past week because I know there's been a lot of mixed messaging about this.

I want to make sure it's effective, not just in teaching us what went right, what went wrong, but also that it can be a tool for future governors, future administrations. I hope, frankly, it's a trigger for Congress to take a similar step to look at the national response. But no, COVID, sadly is still with us. It will continue to be with us. But we can't wait until the last case to do that review, and we won't. We'll be doing something, starting something soon."

We know the mental health stress on everybody, kids in particular, educators, families. I would say this, particularly early on, but frankly when the variants -- the Delta variant and others kept coming back, when we had so little knowledge about this pandemic and about this virus, we had no other choice, sadly. But we will be laser-focused on closing those gaps which we know exist. I've just become the chair of the National Governors Association. My Chairman's Initiative is focused on the mental health of our students for this very reason. So it's real, we know it. It's up to us now to close those gaps."

      "utterance": "Yes, it was a -- very good discussions. New Jersey is short, I think the entire country is short. Some of the things that we've done, I think flexibility, Mike, has to be the name of the game. For instance, we've done something which allows retirees to come back in without upsetting their pension reality. We've made it easier for substitute -- qualified substitute teachers to come in. We're trying to get that common ground of making certifications more streamlined and easier without giving up the quality, the high quality. We are blessed with the number one public education system in America. That begins with educators. We don't want to mess that up. We had a great discussion with the first lady and others on apprenticeship programs. I want to see us do more of that in New Jersey. We've got a grant program for diversity and extending diversity among our educators, but I'd love to see a broad-based apprenticeship program like exists in places like Tennessee. So there's -- we're doing stuff, but there is still more work to be done."

Listen, I think the president has had a heck of a run here. I saw him the other day and told him that. And whether it's Congress getting stuff passed that he has signed, his own leadership, sadly, for the wrong reasons of what the Supreme Court did with reproductive freedoms, there's no question about it, the Democrats have momentum. And I would say, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican in this case, as Americans we have to call out extreme behavior; we have to call out behavior that undermines institutions; that we need to trust, not undermine -- like our Justice Department, FBI; that needs to respect results that we see in elections. So I think that's more of an American reality than it is one party or the other. I think reasonable people in this country, and thank God there are hundreds of millions of them, would come to the same conclusion."

Assuming he does run, he'll have no bigger backer than yours truly. And I think that's really the base case right now. And in the meantime, I'm going to have my nose pressed against the Jersey glass. And hopefully, whether it's through the NGA or the DGA, pick up some good playbooks from other states and other places in the nation, and try to give a Jersey flavor to them and, again, keep moving forward."

We want it to be the state of opportunity. And I'm proud to say that the American dream, that's our goal. That's the reality, that the American dream is alive and well in New Jersey.

We do have a couple of political vehicles that I'm thankful are well-funded that focus on, frankly, mostly getting the word out in terms of what we've done here, drawing a line. We inherited a state that in many respects was broken. And so, we've gotten ourselves back up on feet. I don't ever want to see us go back. So a lot of the focus of our political operations, if you will, is to get that megaphone out there and say, this is now accepted behavior in New Jersey, no matter who the governor is.

And it's time now for our Sunday group: USA Today White House correspondent Francesca Chambers; former State Department spokesperson and FOX News contributor Marie Harf; former Chief of Staff for Vice President Mike Pence Marc Short; and host of \"Media Buzz,\" Howie Kurtz. Welcome to all of you. So, Howie, the president gave a feisty speech in prime time, the broadcast networks did not take it. Who did he reach? HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, \"MEDIA BUZZ\": Well, he reached his base. But, you know, this was billed as an official White House to vent, non-political. Even after the speech White House officials insisting it was non-political. And it was blatantly partisan, attacking Trump by name and I lost track of how many times he attacked MAGA Republicans. And at the same time though, Donald Trump is out there talking about, for example, blasting Biden now as the enemy of the state, which is interesting. Enemy of the people, we usually -- journalists have that distinction. Also talking about he should be reinstated, there should be a new election. He's thinking of pardoning January 6th people convicted in the Capitol riot. So Trump keeps making it about himself and 2020. Biden would love to make it about Trump. And even some of Trump's advisers and former advisers tell me this is not helping the GOP because the GOP wants to move forward and not relitigate the 2020 election."

      "utterance": "Well, I do not think that this should be viewed as a partisan speech. Joe Biden went out of his way to say this isn't all Republicans, this isn't about Democrats versus Republicans, this is about a former president and his supporters saying, as Howie just mentioned, he will pardon people that attacked our Capitol, just blocks from where we are sitting today, Mike, who he said that his political opponents were enemies of the state. He has used this kind of language for years. And we have seen the repercussions. He has encouraged political violence. He has undercut the legitimacy of our elections. And so this isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. President Biden has a duty to stand up on those stages, to use his platform to say American democracy is worth defending. A lot of Republicans agree with him. And that this election coming up isn't about parties, it's about our democracy and those principles. And a lot of people I think on both sides of the aisle are happy that President Biden is finally willing to step up and say very clearly that Donald Trump and his supporters are a threat to our democracy, period, full stop. And that's what's at stake here."

And second, if, in fact, he sort of stood over scores of boxes not really knowing what was in them and said, I hereby declassify everything in here, that would be such an abuse that -- and show such recklessness that it's almost worse than taking the documents."

But certainly, and we heard this from a former president last night, it is something that would be a central focus of any 2024 presidential campaign. And he again suggested last night that he could run again. Now whether or not even then this is an issue that would propel most Americans to vote for the former president of United States, we saw him focus on those kinds of grievance political issues in 2020, and that just wasn't enough for him to be able to beat Joe Biden."

And i think it's important for Pennsylvanian voters to know whether Fetterman is up to this task physically as well. And so I think there will be plenty debates in the process moving forward."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Howie, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has complained about a candidate problem, candidate quality issue in some of the Senate races. Senator Rick Scott, who is leading the Senate Republican campaign committee, firing back very publicly saying, quote, \"When you complain and lament that we have bad candidates, what you're really saying is that you have contempt for the voters who chose them. Much of Washington's chattering class disrespects and secretly or not so secretly loathes of Republican voters.\" Have you ever seen this kind of spat?"

I mean, Rick Scott wrote this blistering piece in the Washington Examiner essentially while not naming McConnell but everybody knew he was talking about, essentially saying that this was treasonous, McConnell should shut up. It's really quite a spectacle. If I could just circle back for one minute to the DoJ investigation of Donald Trump, and that is everybody in the press now is saying, well, he's going to be indicted, he's going to go to jail, you know, lock him up. I think he may well not be indicted unless -- just unclassified documents unless Merrick Garland has something else showing overt actions to harm national security. So I think it's very difficult for him to bring charges just on the classified documents given leniency in the past towards some prominent Democrats."

I think that in 65 days we are going to have a decisive victory if we are talking about crime in Joe Biden's America, if we're talking about a crisis at the border, 200,000 illegals crossing every month, if we're talking about inflation, if we're talking about the reality that we are going into a deeper recession and will be by November. If instead we are about -- taking AOC talking points about defunding law enforcement or pardoning criminals, then that's going to get us off message. If we are talking about Joe Biden, which I think he did with that terrible speech the other night that certainly was political, then I think certainly in my mind, remembers the notion of Hillary Clinton calling millions and millions of Trump-Pence supporters \"deplorables.\" That in essence is what he's done again by calling us semi-fascists, then I think that's going to rally a lot of Republicans in November."

      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",

But when it comes to advertising, any -- there's no amount of money that you can spend to essentially introduce candidates to voters in the amount of time that they have between now and Election Day who are politically inexperienced. And that's an issue that Republicans are running into this cycle when they are competing against Democrats who have a record, who have run statewide. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the Democrats on the ballot this year outperformed President Joe Biden in 2020. And so sometimes those records can work against Democrats for sure, but at the same time, that is something that Democrats see as working in their favor this election cycle."

      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, I think increasingly Democrats want to make it about what President Biden and Democrats in Congress have gotten done. You heard Sean Patrick Maloney say that earlier. The infrastructure deal, burn pits and health care for veterans, for example, negotiating prescription drug prices. And so I think Democrats want to say, look, this is what we've done when we've been in charge. And in all the states, whether it's Herschel Walker in Georgia or Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania or J.D. Vance in Ohio, these are extreme candidates. And for Republicans who have spent so much time calling my party socialist, communist, anti-American, anti-Christian, to suddenly be clutching their pearls because Joe Biden says democracy is worth defending? That's a message Democrats are willing to take to every state, especially when it's extremist candidates on the other side in all of these states. Democrats feel good today, Mike."
