Jeff Sessions is a fine and honorable man, and that honor was used against him by people who believe in this Russia conspiracy theory to get him to recuse himself. And he didn't need to do that, and he was way too naive to believe that that was even a reasonable thing to do. Americans believe that law enforcement agencies and police forces shouldn't be rogue, that they should have civilian accountability over them, and it's good to have someone in place who can do that."

      "utterance": "It's one day after the midterms and we are already back into whittling this down into more special counsels and more controversy. This is generally the pivot where we've got to be right now, which is we've now got a Democratic majority in the House. There's a chance for some bipartisanship on both sides. Are we going to go down the rathole of having all the expanding probes and more special counsels, more controversy, or are we going to try to see whether the two sides can actually work together and do what the American people said they wanted them to do, which is to unite and try and get some things done."

Why is the president making this change and who has the authority over the special counsel Mueller's investigation? We will be holding people accountable.\" And Mollie, you think that he will be holding people accountable?"

      "utterance": "Yes, I happen to ride the train down from New York to D.C., and Jerry Nadler in my presence talked with a friend about how Democrats now taking over Congress plan to do investigations leading to potential impeachment for Justice Kavanaugh and that they are all in on the Russia investigation. So you might wish that Democrats would actually work on legislation instead of continuing on some of these endless probes, but the executive branch needs to be smart about this and they need to not be as naive as they were at the beginning of the administration."
