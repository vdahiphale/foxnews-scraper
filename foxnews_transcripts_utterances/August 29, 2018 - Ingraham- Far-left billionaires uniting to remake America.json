And what former Trump official is unveiling a new musical off-Broadway? I will give you a hint - it will have a short run. Raymond Arroyo joins us with that and more in Seen and Unseen and some exclusive details from inside that Bruce Ohr hearing yesterday. Former Prosecutor Andy McCarthy is here. But first, far left billionaires uniting to remake America. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Remember when the Democratic Party had a shred of a belief in freedom and democracy? The far left Bernie Sanders contingent used to be existing kind of only on the fringes. While more establishment figures, like Hillary Clinton and so forth, they ran the show. But no more. Big Democratic donors have begun to support some of the hard left socialist candidates that have emerged on the scene recently. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last night's election told us a lot. Top Democratic billionaires, Tom Steyer and George Soros, put their money behind far left Tallahassee mayor, Andrew Gillum, for Florida governor. Defying expectations, he pulled off our primary victory last night against six other candidates. Gillum is the African-American male version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He's young, he's kind of dynamic, and he's running on a platform of universal Medicare, legalize marijuana, and abolishing ICE. Exciting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And he is viewed by hard left Democrats as kind of a savior from the stranglehold of the party's establishment has had on their desires, hopes, and dreams. They picked the perfect guy. His city hall under investigation, FBI, corruption, and Tallahassee boasting Florida's highest crime rate three years running. Good going, guys. That is something to run on. But let's look at who his supporters are. Of course, many of you will be familiar with George Soros, the billionaire who has funded the Liberal Center for American Progress, moveon.org, and his Open Society Foundation, which spreads money all over the place, globally by the way. In the 2016 campaign cycle, \"The New York Times\" magazine reports that Soros spent $25 million on that loser campaign of Hillary Clinton and other leftist candidates' causes. This year, he's already blown $15 million to support Democratic candidates and other causes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Gillum knew a good deal when he saw it. So last year, he courted Soros' organizations and spoke at a number of their gatherings. Then when they met at San Francisco, Soros promised to back his gubernatorial run. He was impressed with Gillum. Billionaire San Francisco financier and philanthropist, Tom Steyer, also bankrolled Gillum's campaigning and he saw him as basically a new and almost improved version of Obama because he was more left wing. Now, remember, Steyer is the activist who just finished up a 30-city town hall tour. And you know, he is contemplating his own 2020 run for president. That's part of what he's doing here. And he's not letting the grass grow underneath him. Steyer is running as encouraging people to sign a Trump impeachment petition. Steyer himself is kind of the impeachment pitch man. He's openly urging the president's removal from office. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And it gives Nancy Pelosi, and even Schumer, Swalwell, those types, kind of plausible deniability. That's not us. That's Tom Steyer.

That's what this is really all about. It's about 2020. But here's the irony, both Soros and Steyer, of course, made all of their dough being aggressive capitalists, global capitalists. Remember, Soros got all that money over in Eastern Europe where the Soviet Union fell, big money, that he shorts the dollar, and then these guys have an inside deal on the hard-core capitalism. But now that they have their billions, they want to spread the gospel of socialism, that's devastating countries like Venezuela. Two million people have left Venezuela, a huge health crisis in Venezuela, and also now in Nicaragua. We have 200,000 who fled Nicaragua. I'm going to tell you more about that story as the weeks go on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Even Europe is beginning to reject the old socialist way. In fact -- this is kind of funny -- George Soros' former protege, Viktor Orban, was just reelected prime minister of Hungary earlier this year and Orban ran against Soros' old buddy. So this is, like, anti-Soros mania. They had big billboards up and he won big in Hungary. The Soros-backed Open Society Foundation, in fact, had to close its Budapest offices less than a month after Orban, his former protege, got re-elected. I love that story. Back here in the United States, it would be so foolish for us, the Republican Party, among conservatives, to just kind of dismiss this as a bunch of billionaires wasting their money. Sometimes they have wasted their money, like on Hillary. But this is not a passing fad. This is a direction the Democrats are going in. They got all these young people. They think socialism is just kind of a social club. They don't know the history of socialism. So conservatives better redouble their efforts to educate the young about the false promises and the dangers of socialism. We know they are not being properly talked about the perils of socialism in the public schools, private schools either for that matter, and the universities. So we have to do it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we have to commit real dollars to social media campaigns, exposing what socialism is doing, make them cool, make them sexy looking, make them educational. We got to plaster social media with that. And we have to support conservative candidates who are good or great in front of the camera to repel the leftist advance. If we don't act now, you can expect Tom Steyer's impeachment petition to grow, grow longer and longer.

All right, Schlapp, let's start with you. I've heard some conservatives kind of -- oh, I hope they do just waste their money. But when you see that Steyer -- it's really Steyer, lesser extent Soros -- Steyer has picked this guy out as the person most likely to push forward the socialist agenda in the state of Florida. That is not an exaggeration.

This is 'The Ingraham Angle' on a very busy Wednesday night. Another black eye for CNN. Do they have any other eyes other than black eyes at this point? Now, it's not just those stories they're getting wrong. Now they're defending one of the most violent groups in the country. A former CNN contributor is here to tell us what the heck is going on. Plus some interesting excuses from Catholic leadership as a sexual abuse scandal widens. And what former Trump official is unveiling a new musical off-Broadway? I will give you a hint - it will have a short run. Raymond Arroyo joins us with that and more in Seen and Unseen and some exclusive details from inside that Bruce Ohr hearing yesterday. Former Prosecutor Andy McCarthy is here. But first, far left billionaires uniting to remake America. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Remember when the Democratic Party had a shred of a belief in freedom and democracy? The far left Bernie Sanders contingent used to be existing kind of only on the fringes. While more establishment figures, like Hillary Clinton and so forth, they ran the show. But no more. Big Democratic donors have begun to support some of the hard left socialist candidates that have emerged on the scene recently. Last night's election told us a lot. Top Democratic billionaires, Tom Steyer and George Soros, put their money behind far left Tallahassee mayor, Andrew Gillum, for Florida governor. Defying expectations, he pulled off our primary victory last night against six other candidates. Gillum is the African-American male version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He's young, he's kind of dynamic, and he's running on a platform of universal Medicare, legalize marijuana, and abolishing ICE. Exciting. And he is viewed by hard left Democrats as kind of a savior from the stranglehold of the party's establishment has had on their desires, hopes, and dreams. They picked the perfect guy. His city hall under investigation, FBI, corruption, and Tallahassee boasting Florida's highest crime rate three years running. Good going, guys. That is something to run on. But let's look at who his supporters are. Of course, many of you will be familiar with George Soros, the billionaire who has funded the Liberal Center for American Progress, moveon.org, and his Open Society Foundation, which spreads money all over the place, globally by the way. In the 2016 campaign cycle, \"The New York Times\" magazine reports that Soros spent $25 million on that loser campaign of Hillary Clinton and other leftist candidates' causes. This year, he's already blown $15 million to support Democratic candidates and other causes. Now, Gillum knew a good deal when he saw it. So last year, he courted Soros' organizations and spoke at a number of their gatherings. Then when they met at San Francisco, Soros promised to back his gubernatorial run. He was impressed with Gillum. Billionaire San Francisco financier and philanthropist, Tom Steyer, also bankrolled Gillum's campaigning and he saw him as basically a new and almost improved version of Obama because he was more left wing. Now, remember, Steyer is the activist who just finished up a 30-city town hall tour. And you know, he is contemplating his own 2020 run for president. That's part of what he's doing here. And he's not letting the grass grow underneath him. Steyer is running as encouraging people to sign a Trump impeachment petition. Steyer himself is kind of the impeachment pitch man. He's openly urging the president's removal from office."

So we have to make sure this president doesn't use pardons to cover up crime. If you agree that a president should not be allowed to pardon himself or his associates, join us at needtoimpeach.com.

But listening to that impeachment commercial for a second, he thinks about the Democratic establishment, right? They've tried to keep the impeachment talk at arm's length. Well, what they are really doing is letting the billionaires boys club do their dirty work for them because they know that this mobilizes the far left base, keeps them kind of happy. And it gives Nancy Pelosi, and even Schumer, Swalwell, those types, kind of plausible deniability. That's not us. That's Tom Steyer. And Steyer has promised to spend at least $30 million to elect progressives this campaign season. This means, by the way, that he -- not Soros so far -- is the most important Democratic donor the United States. But like Soros, Steyer is not content to support any Democratic -- anyone who is running, any Democratic establishment person who comes along. His is bankrolling far left radicals who will upend the political system. That's where his mind is. He was at that -- I like the call it the not roots convention -- not roots convention -- all of those far lefties -- I got to -- crash that. It match left. We got to correct that someday, Matt.

I have a question, did you think like Maxine Waters is out of town that day? It's like no one was talking about impeachment. Some of them are. Anyway, Steyer is using his billions to ensure the candidacy of these newly minted socialists who he hopes will swamp America, the whole electoral landscape for the Democrats. And Florida is a great place to start because if you can flip Florida, keep it blue or get it back to where they think it should be blue, they think they can take the presidency as well. That's what this is really all about. It's about 2020. But here's the irony, both Soros and Steyer, of course, made all of their dough being aggressive capitalists, global capitalists. Remember, Soros got all that money over in Eastern Europe where the Soviet Union fell, big money, that he shorts the dollar, and then these guys have an inside deal on the hard-core capitalism. But now that they have their billions, they want to spread the gospel of socialism, that's devastating countries like Venezuela. Two million people have left Venezuela, a huge health crisis in Venezuela, and also now in Nicaragua. We have 200,000 who fled Nicaragua. I'm going to tell you more about that story as the weeks go on. Even Europe is beginning to reject the old socialist way. In fact -- this is kind of funny -- George Soros' former protege, Viktor Orban, was just reelected prime minister of Hungary earlier this year and Orban ran against Soros' old buddy. So this is, like, anti-Soros mania. They had big billboards up and he won big in Hungary. The Soros-backed Open Society Foundation, in fact, had to close its Budapest offices less than a month after Orban, his former protege, got re-elected. I love that story. Back here in the United States, it would be so foolish for us, the Republican Party, among conservatives, to just kind of dismiss this as a bunch of billionaires wasting their money. Sometimes they have wasted their money, like on Hillary. But this is not a passing fad. This is a direction the Democrats are going in. They got all these young people. They think socialism is just kind of a social club. They don't know the history of socialism. So conservatives better redouble their efforts to educate the young about the false promises and the dangers of socialism. We know they are not being properly talked about the perils of socialism in the public schools, private schools either for that matter, and the universities. So we have to do it. And we have to commit real dollars to social media campaigns, exposing what socialism is doing, make them cool, make them sexy looking, make them educational. We got to plaster social media with that. And we have to support conservative candidates who are good or great in front of the camera to repel the leftist advance. If we don't act now, you can expect Tom Steyer's impeachment petition to grow, grow longer and longer. And that's \"The Angle\".\" Joining me now for a reaction is Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union; Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and Eric Johnson, attorney and Democratic strategist. All right, Schlapp, let's start with you. I've heard some conservatives kind of -- oh, I hope they do just waste their money. But when you see that Steyer -- it's really Steyer, lesser extent Soros -- Steyer has picked this guy out as the person most likely to push forward the socialist agenda in the state of Florida. That is not an exaggeration. And by golly, he won the primary."

That's just what we have to account for with record-keeping. We don't know what they are spending and they are dead serious that they want to spend their billions to really retake these seats. I think you're right. It's not just about winning these governor races or the Senate races or House races. It's about taking back the White House and completely stopping the Trump agenda. One final thing, the Republican Party's platform is actually pretty popular, but sometimes our leaders are worried to embrace it. The Democrat -- when the American people really know what the Democratic Party is, it is frightening. It is left wing and it is radical. And so, to a certain extent, I'd like to see this completely exposed."

So, they don't have sterling ethical records. But the point is, the Democratic Party of Humphrey, JFK, or even Bill Clinton no longer exists. It's a pyramid with a few grandees on top that have enough money they can be immune from the consequences of their own ideology and then a group on the bottom who depend on subsidies and they have alienated the middle class. A lot of this passion comes from misreading the two elections of Barack Obama. They felt that that was a trajectory that was going to be permanent and create a progressive future. And really, it was unique to Obama and Hillary Clinton inherited all the downsides of losing the middle class under Obama, who, after all, lost the House and Senate in a thousand local races. But she got none of the upside, that is record minority turnout and block voting. And finally, they've so delegitimized Trump or at least attempted to and demonized them, but socialism is sort of -- is portrayed as a legitimate opposition to an abnormal situation. So, we usually -- and America don't like socialists. But if we create enough chaos, analogous to the 2008 election or the Watergate, then socialism looks sober and judicious as a foil."

Thousands and thousands of Cubans have died at sea trying to flee socialism, trying to come to the United States of America. You have Venezuelans, 2 million have left their country in the last three years alone. And so, what you're seeing is a mass exodus away from socialism, yet they are some -- I want to be clear, I think most Democrats are honorable, good people. But I think there are some within the party that are trying to infiltrate democratic socialism and they are trying to confuse people by making them think that it is what the system that they have in Denmark.

Joining me now to explain is former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy. With me here in the studio, former DOJ attorney James Trusty. Andy, let's start with you. What can we conclude now about Ohr? Then we're going to move on to the Sessions and the Donald McGahn issue."

He was in communication with Christopher Steele, who is the author of the dossier, throughout the period of time that the dossier was being written and compiled by Steele, and it seems that Ohr is an important person because he's really at the nexus of the Fusion GPS and the Justice Department, FBI side of what I think is actually the most interesting collusion we have seen so far."

Meanwhile, meeting with Christopher Steele, and now apparently seeing a widening circle of people involved in this. What is your initial take on this?"

But I think that the whole circumstance of sitting down from his position with Christopher Steele a dozen times, with the FBI taking notes and creating a report, is just unheard of. I have to think, we'll find out eventually maybe, but I have to think it's freelancing, that he's on his own frolicking detour with the FBI, with nobody supervising, nobody looking at it, and we all find out --"

They've got to keep this thing going, keep this thing going in order to get the surveillance to continue, the FISA warrant to continue against poor old Carter Page, the affable Carter Page, a sweet guy. But the whole thing, it's like, we've got to hold onto something. Christopher Steele, we are not supposed to talk to him because he's already talking to the media, the explicitly axed him out, but I can still have these backchannel conversations with him. That can't be ethical, is it?"

When you are the Department of Justice, I was there for a long time, Andy was there for a long time, in main justice, although there some wonderful people that work in international affairs that choose to work there, there is no bigger sign of purgatory then being sent there against your will. So the fact that Bruce Ohr is an international affairs means that he is not an favored status. He's hanging by a thread. The cumbersome process of discharging a federal employee is very long, but that's a clear sign that he is not in cahoots or in step with the leadership there. They are not looking to keep them there."

Democrats are now kind of rushing -- sometimes with Jeff Sessions, they don't like him on any policy, but you get the sense that if Trump is mad at Jeff Sessions, Democrats want to embrace Sessions. What is happening there?"

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "It's hard to know, Laura, because in terms of what we are talking about tonight, we haven't seen anything happening. Sometime ago, the attorney general -- this is months ago -- said that he was referring this sort of investigation of the investigators to both the inspector general at the Justice Department, Mike Horowitz, and also to John Huber, the United States attorney for the district of Utah, who is supposed to be taking an independent look at this, as if he were a special counsel but one who is in house in the Justice Department rather than brought in from outside, like Robert Mueller. That all sounds great. In fact, it is along the lines of what I and a number of other people recommended. The bizarre thing is we haven't heard a thing about it. And I'm all for investigative integrity and investigative secrecy, but at a certain point I think we are entitled to know what are they looking at, what have they come up with, and can we get some kind of an interim report of where they're at. We haven't heard a word."

I never heard these people more willing to protect Republicans in my life."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "It is unusual stretch. How often have we seen a president basically publicly ridiculing the attorney general and the deputy attorney general? We are pretty far removed from John and Robert Kennedy at this point. But the bottom line if it is, the president is entitled to have faith in the people that he puts in those positions. He clearly has problems with him. What I think is kind of interesting is you're starting to see little bits of backlash in very subtle ways from either the attorney general or the DAG, where they are getting very fatalistic, the deputy attorney general. They've just being very fatalistic. If you are going to fire me, fire me, and that's kind of the tone they are taking. But they are still chugging along and doing their business. So a lot of politics do it, but in terms of the day-to-day operations of the department, I think it is going to keep going."

According to the most recent evidence, the Wahhaj family has been using their compound as a terrorist training camp for the 11 children they were holding. Agents found these handwritten letters titled \"Phases of a terrorist attack,\" which detail the steps to a successful suicide attack in the name of Allah, yes, in the United States of America. Despite all of that, a judge in New Mexico today decided to release three of the five defendants, ruling authorities violated the state's 10-day rule. How do you botch that? Andy McCarthy is back with us. I'm so glad you stayed, Andy, because this also has an interesting connection to the case that you worked on, the '93 World Trade Center bombing. We're going to get to that in a moment. But explain how we could get to this place where three of the five defendants are released."

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

And what I sense happens was they decided that two of these characters were the ringleaders, and they appear to have ratcheted up the charges on the two of them. And then decided perhaps that they couldn't make the case and the other three, so they didn't go forward on those. That doesn't mean that they can't at some future time indict them, but that seems unlikely to me."

      "utterance": "Right. They had already been sprung on bail to begin with, which was I think in some ways more outrageous than what happened today, because if what happened today they didn't have enough evidence to go forward that's one thing. But letting any of them out I think is insane."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Laura, the father of the ringleader runs a fairly notorious mosque in Brooklyn. His name is also Siraj Wahhaj, and that mosque hosted the blind sheikh who I prosecuted in the early 1990s in connections with the World Trade Center bombing and a plot to bomb New York City landmarks. He actually appeared, that is, the eldest, Siraj Wahhaj, as a character witness for the defendants in the trial. So we are seeing a guy who was enmeshed in this ideology back when, and here you have the results of it."
