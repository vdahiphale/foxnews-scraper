Plus, Raymond Arroyo is going to be here to reveal a few more important moments that I bet some of you might have missed.

They're the journalistic watchdogs for America doing their fact checks on Trump, but it was off-the-record and somehow it was then told to The New York Times. The Ingraham Angle and Howie Kurtz have done some sleuthing and we have some news to bring you. Plus, if Rachel Maddow is the queen maker, kingmaker of the left and she invited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her show to respond to the President's remarks last night. To her vile comments about ICE and the Border Patrol agents reflect the mainstream now of the Democratic Party. An important segment. You're going to want to stick around for that one. But first, Trump shuts down the media. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Last night, I told you how the President exposed the Democrats' true shutdown motives namely. The Democrats love the partial government shutdown, because they think it helps them politically, which is why they refuse to move even an inch on the issue of wall funding. Well today, the President exposed the media's motives in this drama as well. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now rather than giving us in-depth objective reporting on the effects of illegal immigration on average Americans, all of you out there on your jobs, on your schools, on your safety and on your health, the media spend their airtime parroting Democrat attacks on the President's character and motives. His whole frame around this entire debate, the entire shutdown, the entire government is shut down over a scam. This is not a border security crisis that merits a wall, it's a humanitarian crisis where the President was incredibly disingenuous, because he said that the shutdown that - shutdown is because Democrats will not fund border security. That's just false. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, before the President's speech last night, the media vowed to do their insta fact checking.

Well, their latest tactic and we're going to see more of it in the coming days is to re-feature the sob stories of government workers, who still by the way have not missed a paycheck. Well, watch carefully on what they're doing here. Rank emotional manipulation pure propaganda. Now, how many of these segments did they do over the years on American workers who pushed out in - or pushed out of entire industries as unscrupulous employers hire them for cash or at a fraction of the salary.

Look at the front page of today's New York Times, which sought to frame the President's address this way. Well, see the photo.

Well, at least they have that nice widescreen and they could enjoy it on that. But perhaps the voters after watching all this, hearing all of it are not so easily manipulated. A morning console poll found that a plurality of Americans, 42 percent believe the situation at the border is a crisis including 72 percent of Republicans obviously far fewer Democrats. Now, Trump has successfully shown that the Democrats are not substantively engaged in problem solving on this issue of the border. But still the media continues to carry the water for them.

The deceivers know the truth and they're lying to the American people. The American people have to understand that the illegal immigrants in this country today, by my own calculations and the Yale study of September 21st of last year, says there are 25 million to 35 million people in this country, the low number could be 17, the high could be 35. Let's call it in the middle, 25. That's seven percent to eight percent of the entire American population is here illegally, Laura. And the reason the deceivers, the Democrats and the mainstream media have this manufactured cover-up is because they want another 10, 15, 20 million to continue to pour in to where they turn those into votes one day and they control the country and they move our country to the left.

Last year, over 500,000 people crossed the border illegally between San Diego and Brownsville, about 300,000 in Texas. Law enforcement will tell you we get one out of 45.

And it's the best he's had in some time and ahead, we're going to explore how the visuals of last night's shut down, the big fight over the shutdown might have given the President the upper hand. Plus, Raymond Arroyo is going to be here to reveal a few more important moments that I bet some of you might have missed. That's going to be seen and unseen. And I have a question, who the heck leaked details of the President's off- the-record meeting with all those ethical reporters yesterday. They're the journalistic watchdogs for America doing their fact checks on Trump, but it was off-the-record and somehow it was then told to The New York Times. The Ingraham Angle and Howie Kurtz have done some sleuthing and we have some news to bring you. Plus, if Rachel Maddow is the queen maker, kingmaker of the left and she invited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her show to respond to the President's remarks last night. To her vile comments about ICE and the Border Patrol agents reflect the mainstream now of the Democratic Party. An important segment. You're going to want to stick around for that one. But first, Trump shuts down the media. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Last night, I told you how the President exposed the Democrats' true shutdown motives namely. The Democrats love the partial government shutdown, because they think it helps them politically, which is why they refuse to move even an inch on the issue of wall funding. Well today, the President exposed the media's motives in this drama as well. Now rather than giving us in-depth objective reporting on the effects of illegal immigration on average Americans, all of you out there on your jobs, on your schools, on your safety and on your health, the media spend their airtime parroting Democrat attacks on the President's character and motives. His whole frame around this entire debate, the entire shutdown, the entire government is shut down over a scam. This is not a border security crisis that merits a wall, it's a humanitarian crisis where the President was incredibly disingenuous, because he said that the shutdown that - shutdown is because Democrats will not fund border security. That's just false. Now, before the President's speech last night, the media vowed to do their insta fact checking. Well, they wanted to do this in real-time."

Well, first of all, what happened to the fact check, it's like well he said thousands of people are coming, they just devolved into well, he looked tired. Well, their latest tactic and we're going to see more of it in the coming days is to re-feature the sob stories of government workers, who still by the way have not missed a paycheck. Well, watch carefully on what they're doing here. Rank emotional manipulation pure propaganda. Now, how many of these segments did they do over the years on American workers who pushed out in - or pushed out of entire industries as unscrupulous employers hire them for cash or at a fraction of the salary. How many close-up interviews of victims of illegal alien crime did they do? By the way, those people aren't experiencing a temporary loss of income, but a permanent loss of a family member. Look at the front page of today's New York Times, which sought to frame the President's address this way. Well, see the photo. It's a photo of migrants, you can see it there, it's getting smaller, but migrants at a Tijuana temporary kind of migrant shelter. Now, once again the media focusing on that, interviewing people at the shelter, putting the feelings and the concerns of non-citizens over those of actual citizens. Well, at least they have that nice widescreen and they could enjoy it on that. But perhaps the voters after watching all this, hearing all of it are not so easily manipulated. A morning console poll found that a plurality of Americans, 42 percent believe the situation at the border is a crisis including 72 percent of Republicans obviously far fewer Democrats. Now, Trump has successfully shown that the Democrats are not substantively engaged in problem solving on this issue of the border. But still the media continues to carry the water for them. But when reporters begin acting like pundits, Kellyanne Conway showed us yesterday exactly how they should be treated."

Not going to cover it, but we get to play the pundit game with the President. Trump is dominating rhetorically and substantively. Tomorrow he heads to the border where he's going to, again, I predict take control of the news cycle. Well, today he actually went to Capitol Hill and he met with congressional leaders at the White House before that.

The Democrats just aren't operating in good faith here, so the President walked out refusing to be part of their shutdown soap opera. He wants to get to yes. They want to stay at no. Of all the media outlets out there though, the AP was one of the few to properly frame the situation in a tweet they wrote. Democrats put the blame for the shutdown on Trump, but it takes two to tango. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for his border wall is one reason for the budget impasse. The Democrats refuse to approve the money is another. Well, guess what the AP was lashed by liberals for doing that. That little tweet. Just look at the online reaction. Looks like my Twitter feed. AP fact check, Hindenburg was a very fine blimp and Democrats failed to appreciate it because it takes two to tango. AP fact check, authorities put the blame for Hannibal Lecter's murder spree on the serial killer himself. But it takes two to tango. Amazing. Well, Trump continues to be a powerful political astringent as I like to say and the face of politics as usual is feeling the sting, especially the ones we saw last night. Well, it isn't pretty. The real collusion my friends is in Washington and it's the one that Trump has so masterfully exposed. It's the collusion between the American media and the open borders Democrat Party and that's the Angle. Here now, Howie Kurtz, Fox News Media Analyst and Host of Media Buzz, Sundays on Fox News, Joel Rubin, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Obama and Michael Goodwin, New York Post columnists and Fox News contributor. Now, Michael I start with you. You just wrote a piece about how the Dems intransigence on this issue shows that they're still kind of not able to get over the 2016 election. Couldn't the same though be said for the American media?"

Look, I think that what we saw with the dueling speeches yesterday was on the surface it looked like well they should be able to just kind of cut the difference here, split the difference and reach a deal. That's what they're supposed to do. But in fact, because the Democrats view themselves having an advantage in the shutdown, they are loathing to give the President anything, they don't want to give the President anything that he could claim as a victory, because they still do not view him as a legitimate President. So many members of the Democratic Party, the far left especially and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are afraid of those people. Their jobs are on the line if they cross the far-left wing of their party and so they are going along with this resistance. I mean had they negotiated with the President for the last two years, they could have gotten a lot of things done for this country.

So, when they reported 25 and they're ended up being eight. I'm sure they're going to be a lot of reports tomorrow saying that they were wrong.

And Nancy Pelosi will start off by saying, I'm for border security and the President will say, OK, how can you say you're for border security. I need funding for border security. And she will not agree to a dime. And so, last week, the only time she's ever put an alternative on the table was when last week she jokingly Laura said, she'd support a dollar.

I was working with his team before. I'll him tomorrow. But it's a manufactured cover-up. The mainstream media, MSNBC, CNN, the print media and the Democrats are in one of two groups. They are deniers or they're deceivers. The deniers won't accept the truth or they are quite frankly not smart enough to figure it out. The deceivers know the truth and they're lying to the American people. The American people have to understand that the illegal immigrants in this country today, by my own calculations and the Yale study of September 21st of last year, says there are 25 million to 35 million people in this country, the low number could be 17, the high could be 35. Let's call it in the middle, 25. That's seven percent to eight percent of the entire American population is here illegally, Laura. And the reason the deceivers, the Democrats and the mainstream media have this manufactured cover-up is because they want another 10, 15, 20 million to continue to pour in to where they turn those into votes one day and they control the country and they move our country to the left. I have seen it, Laura, firsthand in Texas, 200,000 illegal immigrants arrested, charged with over 700,000 crimes. We have 100,000 gang members in Texas. We caught 94.5 pounds of fentanyl, our state troopers last year, and that works out to 21 million doses on the street. We have an opioid crisis."

In fact, I was in La Jolla, Texas, a couple years ago, and La Jolla is west of McAllen where the current fence, we have 54 miles of fence along that area, where it ends. And this Democrat mayor said to me please extend the fence. Why? Because the fence was keeping people out. They came around into his community. We need fences, Laura, or a wall, call it what you want. We need barriers to key people out from Brownsville to something called Falcon Lake. That's the main area were more than half of the people come into this entire country. Last year, over 500,000 people crossed the border illegally between San Diego and Brownsville, about 300,000 in Texas. Law enforcement will tell you we get one out of 45. If we caught 500,000 just last year, that means somewhere between a million, a million-and-a-half and 2 million were not copyrights."

I kind of give her credit for that. She's young. She's in her 20s. She is like, let's go for broke and let's put it out there.

But of course, word leaked out to \"The New York Times,\" and now the president is saying \"Gave an off the record luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition. And who would believe with how bad it's gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers. It quickly leaked, of course, the content for that meeting. I read it a little out of order (ph). But you get the point. That's all the time we have tonight. Ed Henry is in for our own Shannon Bream.
