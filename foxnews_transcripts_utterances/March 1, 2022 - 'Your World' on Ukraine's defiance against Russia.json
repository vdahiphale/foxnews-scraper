Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And we have got you covered on some very quick and startling developments here, what's happening in Ukraine and the response to the Ukraine. For example, just seconds ago, we got word that Apple is now officially banning all product sales in Russia, this on the heels of DirecTV dropping all Russian programming on its service to Russia, ditto Netflix and Facebook and TikTok that are also getting rid of any Russian media on their European feeds. And on and on we go. We have got you covered with Trey Yingst in Kyiv, and also Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon on what to make of talk that some of those Russian soldiers have had it with their assignment. We will get into that in a second. First to Trey in Kyiv. Hey, Trey.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling this undisguised terror and a war crime. He also spoke tonight from his bunker in the Ukrainian capital about NATO and the efforts he's making to try to get international support. Take a listen. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As far as a no-fly zone is concerned, it would have helped a lot. This is not about dragging NATO countries into war.

However, I should tell you that Putin does not hesitate to fire at civilians, peaceful civilians. Russian occupation troops are hitting residential -- residential neighborhoods.

And this is really serious. This is real blackmailing. But given the fact that he's a madman, he's absolutely crazy, he can actually do it. So, I'm addressing U.S., as a NATO country, a NATO member. Given the fact that nuclear weapon might and will destroy not only Ukraine, but other NATO countries, there is no time to hesitate. Please input more serious sanctions on Russia. And, please, actually start having no-fly zone above Ukraine. Russia hits Ukraine heavily from air, and the nuclear power will come from air as well. So there is no more time to hesitate. You should do no-fly -- no-fly zone over Ukraine now, until it's not too late. Your intelligence knew that Putin will invade in Ukraine a month-and-a-half ago. But you waited until -- until Putin started killing innocent people before you imposed sanctions. And we are thankful for the sanctions, but please don't hesitate anymore.

And some have seen that as a threat that he would actually use these nuclear weapons. I want to pick up on that theme with Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon.

We have seen no signs that they have moved any of their tactical nuclear weapons toward Ukraine, but it is part of their doctrine to escalate in order to de-escalate. So that is of concern, and it's being watched very closely. What's most notable to U.S. defense officials that I speak to is how slow- going the progress is for the Russian military. There are indications that Putin is frustrated as well, the way he's been dressing down his defense minister and his top general in public; 80 percent of Russia's pre-staged combat power, those 160,000 forces that he had on the edge of Ukraine, are now deployed inside Ukraine. And yet they have not taken any large cities. Some Russian units have been captured, officials tell us. They have evidence that some Russian soldiers have surrendered even without a fight. The main advance on the capital, that 40-mile-long convoy, shows no appreciable movement in the last 24 hours. The convoy stretches bumper to bumper halfway to the Belarusian border. It may be because of Ukrainian resistance, fuel and sustainment issues. They are having problems feeding their troops, we're told. They are running out of food. Could be also an intentional pause. They may be regrouping, reevaluating. There are reports that Russian soldiers are punching holes in their own fuel tanks to stop their vehicles from moving forward. And U.S. officials say they have no reason to doubt those reports. According to a U.S. defense official I spoke to, be -- well, because of the slowed progress, NATO officials worry that Putin may authorize more lethal weaponry, not necessarily nuclear weapons, but these thermobaric vacuum bombs that we're hearing about. U.S. officials assess that the Russians have moved launcher systems that can be used for thermobaric weapons, those fuel air explosives, fired by rocket into Ukraine, but have not seen evidence that the weapon has been used yet. This footage is from 2014. The Russians still don't control the airspace over all of Ukraine. Ukrainian air and missile systems remain intact and viable. Zelensky, President Zelensky, has command and control over his armed forces. And he is exercising that control, but the question is for how long. The Russian forces, many of them are conscripts. Some weren't told where they were going. Another sign that things aren't going as planned, the Kremlin ordered one of the few independent radio stations off the air today, Moscow's Ekho Moskvy. So, many Russians are not seeing or hearing what is happening on the ground in Ukraine, Neil.",

In 2021 -- take a look at this graph -- the U.S. imported an average of 670,000 barrels a day from Russia. The Keystone XL pipeline, which President Biden shut down, would have allowed access to about 830,000 barrels a day, allowing us to be a net exporter.

And I tell you, it does something to you to see these magnificent buildings turned into rubble. This, to me, is just crazy stuff. And I have been saying for a long time that Putin sees himself as Hitler, and we ought to recognize that. He wants to put that old Soviet Union back together. I was there when it was won back in the 1970s. And he was -- had been very upset that all of that failed economically.

Truman pushed for integration. His numbers went way down. That -- we know what's happening here.

However, I should tell you that Putin does not hesitate to fire at civilians, peaceful civilians. Russian occupation troops are hitting residential -- residential neighborhoods.

Given the fact that nuclear weapon might and will destroy not only Ukraine, but other NATO countries, there is no time to hesitate. Please input more serious sanctions on Russia.

You should do no-fly -- no-fly zone over Ukraine now, until it's not too late. Your intelligence knew that Putin will invade in Ukraine a month-and-a-half ago.

We have seen no signs that they have moved any of their tactical nuclear weapons toward Ukraine, but it is part of their doctrine to escalate in order to de-escalate. So that is of concern, and it's being watched very closely. What's most notable to U.S. defense officials that I speak to is how slow- going the progress is for the Russian military. There are indications that Putin is frustrated as well, the way he's been dressing down his defense minister and his top general in public; 80 percent of Russia's pre-staged combat power, those 160,000 forces that he had on the edge of Ukraine, are now deployed inside Ukraine. And yet they have not taken any large cities. Some Russian units have been captured, officials tell us. They have evidence that some Russian soldiers have surrendered even without a fight. The main advance on the capital, that 40-mile-long convoy, shows no appreciable movement in the last 24 hours. The convoy stretches bumper to bumper halfway to the Belarusian border. It may be because of Ukrainian resistance, fuel and sustainment issues. They are having problems feeding their troops, we're told. They are running out of food. Could be also an intentional pause. They may be regrouping, reevaluating. There are reports that Russian soldiers are punching holes in their own fuel tanks to stop their vehicles from moving forward. And U.S. officials say they have no reason to doubt those reports. According to a U.S. defense official I spoke to, be -- well, because of the slowed progress, NATO officials worry that Putin may authorize more lethal weaponry, not necessarily nuclear weapons, but these thermobaric vacuum bombs that we're hearing about. U.S. officials assess that the Russians have moved launcher systems that can be used for thermobaric weapons, those fuel air explosives, fired by rocket into Ukraine, but have not seen evidence that the weapon has been used yet. This footage is from 2014. The Russians still don't control the airspace over all of Ukraine. Ukrainian air and missile systems remain intact and viable. Zelensky, President Zelensky, has command and control over his armed forces. And he is exercising that control, but the question is for how long. The Russian forces, many of them are conscripts. Some weren't told where they were going. Another sign that things aren't going as planned, the Kremlin ordered one of the few independent radio stations off the air today, Moscow's Ekho Moskvy. So, many Russians are not seeing or hearing what is happening on the ground in Ukraine, Neil."

Obviously, all of this back-and-forth and the growing angst and concern that things are ratcheting up whipsawed oil prices today, skyrocketing to levels we have not seen since 2014. And that drove stocks down. Right now, a Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, has said we need to drill for more oil here, especially if Russian oil completely leaves the market. We need to make up for it. What does Senator Mark Warner think of what his fellow Democrat is saying? We will ask him -- after this."

The White House, along with other world powers, would be releasing 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves to tamp down on prices, with the price of crude soaring at over $100 a barrel. But there is now growing concern, growing frustration at home even among Democratic lawmakers that sanctions around -- against Russia allowed for carve-outs for energy purchases and that the president has also not taken steps to ramp up domestic energy production to offset all of this. In 2021 -- take a look at this graph -- the U.S. imported an average of 670,000 barrels a day from Russia. The Keystone XL pipeline, which President Biden shut down, would have allowed access to about 830,000 barrels a day, allowing us to be a net exporter. Senator Joe Manchin today called on the president to change that."

But inflation is also a problem here at home. It is, as you know, at a 40- year high. The president in his State of the Union address is expected to call for increased manufacturing to help bring down the prices of goods, but, at least so far, that same logic does not seem to apply to energy costs -- Neil."

If you would have told me then that we would have the Germans take the lead on shutting down Nord Stream 2, that we would have actually sanctioned Vladimir Putin personally, that we would have had the Europeans take the lead on kicking Russian banks out of SWIFT, that we would have the Central Bank of Russia sanctioned, that we would have the Germans actually step up and meet their defense commitments, that we would have Sweden and Finland sending arms to Ukraine, and even the Swiss getting off the neutrality piece and weighing in, I would have said, that's unbelievable. And that's happened of, one, because of the courage of Zelensky and the Ukrainian leadership and the fight of the Ukrainian people. But it's also happened because Joe Biden has helped rebuild NATO and put this alliance back together. And we have got not America acting alone.

I think we can do more, in concert with our European allies, because one of the things, if we're going to stand up for democracy, we have got to make Putin pay.

I have been, frankly, surprised the Ukrainians -- I mean, the Russians haven't shut down the power, the water, the Internet, the videos that are coming out that are so powerful. So do I have confirmation they're following every move of Zelensky? No. Would I suspect or be surprised that they're following every move of Zelensky? I wouldn't be surprised at all, because, unfortunately, they have penetrated for years so many of the Ukrainian systems.

We have the reason to fight. They don't. They're not in their land. They are conquering who? They are conquering free people. They're trying to invade the country which was getting much better in terms of prosperity. There was -- it was growing much faster than Russia is growing. And they just couldn't have it, I mean, or Putin couldn't have it. So that's why he invaded. And he needs Ukraine to be a bizarre country, unstable, so then he could show to the Russians that this is the Western world. That's how it looks like. It's disastrous. Don't even try to think of going there. So that's the main part here, where the propaganda level in Russia is just through the roof. He's trying to sell him to people that we are all here neo-Nazis and fascists and that we are hiding behind women and all that stuff. Well, I traveled through my country. I was crossing the border on foot just about 48 hours ago. And I have traveled through Ukraine 700 kilometers. And the level of motivation throughout the country of people who are trying to defend themselves, they're organizing themselves into small groups to overwatch their own cities, villages, roads. They put roadblocks on the roads. It's remarkable. And I do believe that, basically, predominantly, it all comes from the president, Zelensky, who stayed inside the capital while it is surrounded by Russian tanks. He doesn't leave the country here, I would say, the first president who is ready to risk his life for his beliefs and for the country. And it's really admirable."

But, in general, the countries which could help Ukraine to overcome this battle -- and they could have done it years ago, actually, already -- they are silenced -- or not really silenced, but they're not so keen to do something particular. Let's put it that way. They're happy to arm us. They're happy to give us this and that, but we need some small things, like close down the air over the Ukraine. Just give us that chance to fight on the ground. Don't give them the superiority in air, which we don't have it. And it's obvious. And we will never have it, not in the future. Even if European Union is going to give us 100 airplanes, we just don't have so many pilots. So, we need -- we need this fighting edge, which at least will tilt the advantage or at least level the field for us, because they are a 140 million country. We are just 14 million-strong. And in terms of the size and the military experience, we're not there yet. But we have higher motivation because we are on our land, and they are not in their land. They came to conquer. Their motivation will always be less. And I see from the battles which are happening here they're not motivated. They don't understand why they're there."

Meantime, you have major car companies halting sales, Ford just announcing that a few minutes ago. GM is pausing on their 3,000 cars that they ship each and every year, Volvo, Daimler Truck doing the same, and Mercedes looking at ways to exit its joint venture. Also HOG, Harley-Davidson is pausing on their bikes sales there, and from law firms to shipping to wireless services, the list of sectors pulling back from Russia is long and it's growing. You have Hollywood also shutting down the big screen, pausing on big movie releases, including the new Batman reboot, Disney's new animated film \"Turning Red,\" and big tech pulling back on their services, social media giants Meta, formerly known as Facebook, along with Google's YouTube and TikTok now silencing Russia state media companies like Russia Today and Sputnik. Meta also says that they are demoting links to Russian state media and Facebook on Instagram as well, so both on Facebook and Instagram, while Google just confirmed that they are removing them off the Google News site. And there's a spending live maps in Ukraine, limiting access to Google Pay in Russia. And, Neil, just this afternoon, a few hours ago, you have Apple confirming to me that they are pausing all product sales in Russia. They are limiting Apple Pay. Russian state media apps are not available outside of Russia on the App Store. And they're disabling live maps in Ukraine.

      "utterance": "Well, thank you very much for having me. I do not get too far into foreign policy issues. I don't go to all these super secret, top-secret meetings, because I do not wish to be curtailed in any way in what I want to express for programs like this. So I do not attend these meetings. So I don't know what unclassified information they may be getting. So I'm not going to say what the president should or should not do when it comes to foreign affairs. I will say this. I am standing firmly in support of what our allies are doing, not just NATO, but I consider Ukraine a part of that. I have been to that country. And I tell you, it does something to you to see these magnificent buildings turned into rubble. This, to me, is just crazy stuff. And I have been saying for a long time that Putin sees himself as Hitler, and we ought to recognize that. He wants to put that old Soviet Union back together. I was there when it was won back in the 1970s. And he was -- had been very upset that all of that failed economically. But he has taken the track that will put them back into economic -- in the economic basement. And I don't understand why he doesn't understand that."

      "utterance": "I think the president needs to keep pressing forward. He is doing what's right for the country. You have heard me say this before, I think. I'm a Truman guy. Truman did what was right for the country. And I saw what it did his numbers. Now people look back on Truman and says, he is one of the best presidents we ever had. What was his numbers like? Because he integrated the armed services, people didn't like him. Strom Thurmond stormed out of the party, started the state rights parties. And Truman's numbers went way down. Truman pushed for integration. His numbers went way down. That -- we know what's happening here. If you look at the fact that the president's numbers have fallen among African-Americans by 20, 25 points, is because of a lot of the misinformation that is out there. If we do a good job of telling people what it is to that this president has done and is doing, his numbers would be better. But he needs to keep pressing forward, doing exactly what he's doing, because what he's doing is what the country needs done. It may not be popular with everybody."

They give him low marks, many, a majority now, convinced he hasn't done anything for them. I'm wondering if, on the energy stuff or any of this, he has to maybe open himself up to drilling, has to open itself to things like that, because he appears to be floundering?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLYBURN",

    {
      "speaker": "CLYBURN",
      "utterance": "Well, we have not passed a lot of stuff that he's got for energy production. We want to increase energy sources like solar, like wind. We got a big wind facility taking place down there in Charleston, with Clemson University. We need to do more of that, which will generate affordable energy."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But can you do all of the above, Congressman? Do you think he should advocate, I'm not really for traditional fossil fuels, but I'm all in on everything to get us over this hump? Would you support that?"

      "speaker": "CLYBURN",

A lot of people say, had it not been for his help in South Carolina, we would not have a President Biden today. Congressman, thank you. To Lucas Tomlinson right now in Lviv, Ukraine. Again, we're getting these reports of throngs of Russian soldiers, most of them heading toward the capital, this 40-mile-long caravan, tank caravan, but Lviv isn't out of the woods either, of course, a key point in the western part of the country, where those who want to get out and those outside from Poland who want to get in and help, it is a key, key destination. Lucas Tomlinson has more -- Lucas."

The father cannot leave, part of President Zelensky's decree that no military-age males can leave the country. He has to stay and fight."

      "utterance": "Air raid sirens heard throughout the city a few hours ago, Neil, sending people scrambling for shelters. This war rapidly creating the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe this century. In Southeast Ukraine, the Russian Defense Ministry claims the land bridge from the Donbass to Crimea along the Sea of Azov, one of Putin's military objectives, of course, is now complete, following this amphibious assault with some 2,000 Russian Marines. The Ukrainians deny the takeover is complete. They say the strip of land along the coast remains contested. And shelling continues in Kharkiv to the northeast days after that Russian special forces unit was annihilated. Some think the shelling the civilians could be revenge. Now, here on the ground, Lviv, we're under a curfew and martial law. This is what war looks like during Putin's invasion of this country -- Neil."

      "utterance": "You have always told us what it's like at night, because I imagine it's scarier at night. People hear things, and they are very real things. They are explosions and the like. How are people holding up there as we go into day seven tomorrow?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOMLINSON",
      "utterance": "Neil, people are holding up, but they're very nervous. For a long time, people on the ground here denied this invasion could take place. Now they're just absolutely shocked. So many people are clutching their phones, even people walking on the streets. You can tell they're just searching for news, want to hear from loved ones. Speaking of the night, Neil, it's very interesting. It does not appear that the Russian forces are fighting at night. None of the Russian soldiers that we see images of on the screen have night-vision goggles. We don't see a ton of flying around. We do see some of those missile strike, some 400 missiles launched in this country. That is one thing worth pointing out, Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, I'm also curious, Lucas. We hear these reports, they might be sporadic, and they might only apply to a few Russian soldiers, that some of those soldiers are not keen on this assignment. First of all, a good many of them didn't know what the assignment was when they discovered that they were going to lead a brigade to attack Ukraine, a friendly neighbor and one with whom very few Russians had any problems. They're putting down their arms. They're trying to slow or stop tanks or other military vehicles. I don't know how widespread that is, but do you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOMLINSON",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, about a third of these Russian soldiers are conscripts, OK? They're not here by choice. And it's a very different military, the Russian forces vs. the American forces. There's not as much communication between the officer ranks and the enlisted ranks. And so what we're hearing is the only people that knew about this invasion were Vladimir Putin and some of his top cadre, top officers, and of course, his defense minister. In terms of some of the officers on the ground, it's one of the reasons why we think there was no real OPSEC, if you will. People were allowed to walk up, film these tanks and Russian soldiers before they invaded. They let people do this. They didn't even think they were coming down. You will remember there were some 30,000 troops in Belarus in the north taking part in joint military exercises. And while the Pentagon and White House were warning of an invasion, I think a lot of Russian troops didn't know they were going to be a part of it, Neil."

As we continue following this, the effect here in the United States is real, something the president will address in his State of the Union, as gas prices, oil prices soar, and just the cost of living everywhere follows suit.
