JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": I took that he is on a very different page from Donald Trump, which we already knew, but I think in several ways it was reinforced in that interview. It's quite clear that Christopher Wray wants to suggest that the cultural problems at the FBI are a relic of an earlier time. That is not why President Trump believes. That's not what people in President Trump's inner circle believe. They believe that there needs to be major, major changes in the FBI, and they do not believe that Christopher Wray is the man to do it. President Trump has been contemplating firing him for a number of months. I don't know whether he'll pull the trigger on that, but I thought your interview revealed the hesitancy and some of the divisions that clearly exist between him and the president.",

I think the problem is that he hasn't up until now owned it, and he finally kind of did that today and said this is not behavior that is appropriate at the FBI, and it shouldn't happen again. And that's an important message for Americans. And it's related to the Flynn decision today as well, too, in that what we had was a federal court who said, yes, the Department of Justice might be trusted to know when it has veered off course.

Flynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to the FBI but withdrew his latest plea earlier this year, arguing misconduct on behalf of the Justice Department and FBI. Flynn's legal team claims these heavily redacted notes were written by former FBI agent Peter Strzok and the notes point to a meeting between then President Obama, Vice President Biden and FBI Director Comey in early January 2017. According to the notes, President Obama allegedly said, make sure you look over things and have the right people on it and is there anything I shouldn't be telling the transition team?

And they do it not just through traditional government officials which they certainly do, but also through what we sometimes call non-traditional collectors which can be businessman, high level scientists, high level academics, people like that.

Up next, the panel on my interview with the FBI director and the order to dismiss charges against Michael Flynn, plus what's happening with police reform. First, Beyond our Borders tonight, at least six people are dead following a magnitude 7.4 earthquake that rocked southern Mexico Tuesday. Hundreds of homes damage, almost 2.5 million people lost power. Pakistan's aviation minister says the pilot of a Pakistani airliner that crashed last month were distracted and preoccupied as they talked about the coronavirus pandemic while preparing for an initial failed attempt to land. Ninety-seven people were killed when that plane crashed May 22nd in Karachi. Two people on board survived. Russia Victory Day parades taking place in several cities despite the coronavirus, Russian officials insisting all necessary precautions were taken to protect troops and ensure safety of veterans and foreign guests. Several other regions canceled planned celebrations. Just some of the other headlines and stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back."

      "speaker": "WRAY",
      "utterance": "I think the FBI has a job to do and we are going to do our jobs. But I also think that people rightly expect from the FBI that we are going to be utterly apolitical, no nonsense, grind it out professionals, just the facts, balls and strikes."

      "utterance": "FBI Director Chris Wray there from my interview, another part of it. Let's bring in our abbreviated panel, Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios,\" Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Jonathan, what did you take from that? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": I took that he is on a very different page from Donald Trump, which we already knew, but I think in several ways it was reinforced in that interview. It's quite clear that Christopher Wray wants to suggest that the cultural problems at the FBI are a relic of an earlier time. That is not why President Trump believes. That's not what people in President Trump's inner circle believe. They believe that there needs to be major, major changes in the FBI, and they do not believe that Christopher Wray is the man to do it. President Trump has been contemplating firing him for a number of months. I don't know whether he'll pull the trigger on that, but I thought your interview revealed the hesitancy and some of the divisions that clearly exist between him and the president."

Here's Flynn on Rush Limbaugh's show."

      "utterance": "It's a good thing for me, it's a good thing for my family, but it's really great boost of confidence for the American people in our justice system, because that's what this really comes down to is whether or not our justice system is going to have the confidence of the American people in it."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And just new evidence today coming to the forefront. Kimberley? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. Bret, by the way, congrats on that interview, because it was news breaking, and in this regard. The problem and the frustration with Wray up until now has not been his actions, which as he has noted, all of the bad behavior people who were involved in 2016 are gone and under his watch, and they have accepted every reform that has been offered at them. I think the problem is that he hasn't up until now owned it, and he finally kind of did that today and said this is not behavior that is appropriate at the FBI, and it shouldn't happen again. And that's an important message for Americans. And it's related to the Flynn decision today as well, too, in that what we had was a federal court who said, yes, the Department of Justice might be trusted to know when it has veered off course. It clearly did here, and so the judge's responsibility is to accept that motion to dismiss and move on."

And you're going to wait until the election to get more. OK. Well, why wouldn't you take the 80 percent now, see if you can win the election and add on the other 20 percent? You've got to be kidding me."
