So we do have options to try to take action against the North Koreans. We can do special operations options. We've had that on the books since the '90s.

JOY VILLA, SINGER/SONGWRITER: Here is today's final word. Why do I love President Trump so much? First of all, we finally have a warrior in the White House. He is not afraid to say what he means and mean what he says. He says he's going to deliver jobs, he delivers jobs. He says we're going to increase security, we increase security. He upholds the constitution and protects religious freedom. People don't understand how easy it is to be misaligned and looked over when you have a president who doesn't care about your needs. But in America, we have so much freedom because Donald Trump is in the White House. Our commander in chief is not only a warrior in the White House, but he is a lion in the White House.

We're following three major breaking stories, a battle brewing between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell as he calls out the Senate majority leader for saying his expectations are actually too high. Also, President Trump firing back against the destroy Trump media, Democrats over their Russia hysteria and meltdown. It is a brutal takedown! And also tonight, the president issues a statement of fact, a dire warning to North Korea and Kim Jong-un that he will no longer be held hostage. The world will not be held hostage. This after the rogue regime threatens an attack on Guam. And if Pyongyang -- if they don't get their act together, they will face dire consequences. Tonight, the options America has to stop North Korea's growing aggression. We'll get into all of this in this breaking news \"Opening Monologue.\" The president -- he continues to slam who I called the weak, the spineless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for complaining that, quote, \"Trump has excessive expectations.\" Take a look at the president from earlier today."

      "utterance": "The president's comments come in response to Senator McConnell whining like a 5-year-old, complaining, making excuses to his constituents in Kentucky that the president's expectations are just too high to pass repeal and replace after eight months! Here's a news flash for Senator McConnell. Get to work, Senator. You don't seem to get that you and your fellow Republicans -- you are the ones that set those excessive expectations. Republicans -- they're the ones who were promised over and over and over and over again for seven years they're going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Like Senator John McCain -- he cast the deciding vote that literally derailed this effort to get rid of ObamaCare when it really mattered, not a phony vote. So if senators like McConnell, McCain, and you can throw Susan Collins of Maine in, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in, who voted not to get rid of what they promised to get rid of. These Republicans -- if you can't get your job done, then it's time for you to step aside, get out of the way. We need new people in those positions. Americans are suffering every day because of this! So it's time to clean house, put leaders in charge who are going to listen and serve the American people. And while we're at it, as the president mentioned today, it's time for those senators, yes, to lose their chairmanships if they are going to hold the whole party hostage! If Senator McConnell wants to make excuses and whine constantly about President Trump being too demanding -- Senator, time to retire. And you know what else? It's time to drastically cut Congress's vacation time. Seriously? They're on vacation? Get this. In the month of August, the Senate will be in session for a whopping three days. Wouldn't you all like a month off? I would. And for the year, the Senate -- well, they're off for a total of 69 days. That's over three months! Most of you, including myself, watching this program, what do you take, two, three weeks a year, maybe a couple of long weekends? And senators like McConnell -- they don't show up for work for 69 days and then complain when the president is calling them out for not keeping their promises and getting the job done? It's time for Mitch McConnell to get it together or go home, retire, play golf, have a good -- go on a fishing trip. Also tonight, President Trump firing back at the destroy Trump media and Democrats who claim that he's going to fire the special counsel, Robert Mueller. The president also slammed this Russia, Russia, collusion, hysteria and breathless reporting. Watch this."

But I also want the Senate and the House to come out with their findings. Now, judging from the people leaving the meetings, leaks, but they leave the meetings all the time and they say, No, we haven't found any collusion. There is no collusion. You know why? Because I don't speak to Russians."

But I've always known he's a good man. I thought it was a very -- you know -- they do that very seldom. So I was surprised to see it. I was very, very surprised to see it. I've always known Paul Manafort to be a very decent man. And he's like a lot of other people, probably makes consultant fees from all over the place. Who knows? I don't know. But I thought that was a very -- that's pretty tough stuff."

Take a look."

And it's about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn't tough enough. What they've been getting away with is a tragedy. And it can't be allowed. The people of our country are safe, our allies are safe -- and I will tell you this. North Korea better get their act together or they're going to be in trouble like few nations ever have been in trouble in this world."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody's seen before, what will happen in North Korea. It's a statement. Has nothing to do with dare. That's a statement. He's not going to go around threatening Guam and he's not going to threaten the United States and he's not going to threaten Japan and he's not going to threaten South Korea. No, that's not a dare, as you say, that is a statement of fact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let's show you exactly what North Korea is threatening against Guam. A top military general put out a statement last night saying that the rogue regime is drawing up a plan due to be completed by mid-August which calls for North Korea to launch four missiles into the waters off the coast of Guam. Earlier today, the president -- well, he also addressed the policies of appeasement and capitulation that were carried out and championed by Democrats the last 25 years when it comes to North Korea. We don't learn from history, we're doomed to repeat it, right? For example, former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice writing an op-ed for The New York Times today, suggesting that America, quote, \"may need to,\" quote, \"tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea the same way the U.S. did with the former Soviet Union\"? Remember, it was 1994, the Clinton administration. They cut a deal with Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong-il, giving North Korea $4 billion in energy aid in exchange for the promise that the rogue regime would freeze and eventually end its nuclear weapons program. Bill Clinton said this was a good deal for the American people. Take a look."
    },

      "speaker": "BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Predictably, the deal turned into a complete and utter disaster, and it's a direct reason why we are in the situation we are in on the edge, the world being on edge tonight with North Korea. Earlier today, the president called out President Clinton's foolish mistakes. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

      "utterance": "The president clearly is not going to repeat the policies of appeasement of the past. As we have now been saying on this program for years and years and for the past couple of nights, there really are not any great solutions when it comes to North Korea. Last night on this show, however, the deputy assistant to the president, Dr. Sebastian Gorka -- he hinted perhaps there are. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "There are numerous scenarios that do not involve the use of force or some kind of conflagration on the Korean peninsula. There are covert means. There are means that we don't discuss on television that can incapacitate a regime's capacity to use its military."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And earlier this week on this program, the former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich -- he gave a brilliant assessment of how to deal with the North Korean threat by building a strategic defense system that President Reagan proposed. And that gives us, what, 10, 20, 30, 40 chances if, God forbid, an ICBM is headed to the United States, instead of just one or two shots at getting it out with a THAAD missile system, anti-missile system. All right, joining us now, FOX News military analyst General Jack Keane. General, I've been saying on the air, no real good solutions. I'm listening to the president today, and I don't think the president could be any stronger -- the likes of which we've have never seen. And maybe what he said the first day wasn't even strong enough. And this is a statement, a fact, not a dare. This will happen. Your thoughts."

      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. I mean, clearly, the president is totally fed up now that he has all the facts in terms of what the last 25 years have been like with the Kim dynasty. He knows full well that his predecessors, through policies on negotiations, diplomacy, appeasement and accommodation have brought the Kim dynasty to the point now where they're nuclearizing ICBMs that threaten the American people. And that certainly has frustrated him and he's fed up with it. And he's clearly sending a signal to this leader that, I intend to deter you because I have -- one, have the capability to destroy you, and I have, two, the intent to do it. You are -- I am not going to permit you to do harm to the American people. He wants to get inside Kim's head and make certain he clearly understands that and that the policies of the past are flat over."

Are we dealing with somebody that's capable of understanding that this country would be incinerated, that many would die? Is it -- and this is the danger as we just played, Bill Clinton. Oh, this is a good deal for the American people. It wasn't a good deal for the American people. Just like the Iranian deal, as the president said today, is not good for the American people. What is it about this inability of some on the left to understand you cannot negotiate and bribe, you know, these rogue regimes and dictators, that they don't keep their word?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes. The Cold War is very instructive to us because the cold war was very successful in using deterrence against the Soviet Union. And to have effective deterrence, Sean, there's two things you got to have. You have to have, number one, real military capability. Your adversary's got to understand that that capability is there. And we have that. Number two, your adversary's got to understand that you intend to use it. He's got to believe that, that there is political will and there's commitment to use that force if necessary. The Soviet Union understood that clearly and understood it very dramatically when President Reagan was president. What we've had recently is appeasement, accommodation. And that is what has generated -- I think it's a rational decision on Kim's part to nuclearize ICBMs, put the American people at risk and guarantee forever then that the United States would never do regime change, which he's paranoid about. That is a rational strategy he actually has, not irrational. It's rational. His bellicose language and his verbosity and his tendency to say that, I'm going to destroy the American people -- certainly, that..."

I think this president will keep us out of that war because the Chinese are believing that this president is sincere about what he intends to do to protect the American people. And the Chinese, at the end of the day, while they have been gaming us for years and they've playing this president a little bit -- step one, and it's only step one, was the U.N. resolution that the Chinese backed. There's more to be done on their part. The president is..."

      "utterance": "Look, it's as dangerous as ever by the fact that we've allowed this to linger since 1954. And the fact is this. The biggest danger to actual armed conflict, Sean, is miscalculation. General Keane just laid out the essence of what we're facing now. We have to actually go about doing what we have to find a way to convince the North Koreans that the idea of appeasement, of buying you off is going to end. The current problems go back to 1994, to October '94, when we entered into this so-called Framework agreement that President Clinton put us in. And Sean, let me tell you something. We knew back then that they had five nuclear weapons. The very premise of the concept was flawed from day one. And it's only gotten worse. So we do have options to try to take action against the North Koreans. We can do special operations options. We've had that on the books since the '90s. Look, we've done effective things against the Iranians using advanced technology, cyber operations, information operations. That's another option. And frankly, the last one we have right now is to make a show that shooting your missiles will be completely feckless by the fact we have the THAAD and the Aegis systems right off the coast. We could knock those missiles down, if we so choose. So the president does have some options short of going to war to show that we mean business."

I'm not confident -- I mean, you know, what this would look like is essentially our stealth capability, our cyber, our electronic warfare capability going in early to take down his air defenses so that we then have the follow-on bombers that could get in and get to his missile sites and get, hopefully, him and his command and control infrastructure. But while that is happening, keep in mind they've dug these things in for 50 years into the sides of mountains, into bunker complexes.

And that's why I think clear statements from the president are important. There are two elements here. One is if there's an attack from North Korea on Guam, that's American soil. The citizens of Guam are American citizens. And at that point, you don't even want to think about what the retaliation would be. That's clear, and I think stating that is important so that there's no misunderstanding. The second issue, though, is whether or not the president should strike preemptively. And I think on that score, there's a legitimate debate, but I think people have to ask themselves whether they're prepared to see North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons as far as the eye can see.

But he conducted a one year investigation on each of the topics you raised the 33,000 you mentioned are personal, non-State Department related emails that were deleted, which everyone in Washington who has personal emails would agree they are not the subject of a subpoena about State Department official business, classified information mishandling.

So my audience is listening to you, and this is what they are thinking, Lanny, like I am. Lanny is a nice guy.

She wore a \"Make America Great Again\" dress to the Grammys. Tonight she will explain why she supports the president. She gets the final word. JOY VILLA, SINGER/SONGWRITER: Here is today's final word. Why do I love President Trump so much? First of all, we finally have a warrior in the White House. He is not afraid to say what he means and mean what he says. He says he's going to deliver jobs, he delivers jobs. He says we're going to increase security, we increase security. He upholds the constitution and protects religious freedom. People don't understand how easy it is to be misaligned and looked over when you have a president who doesn't care about your needs. But in America, we have so much freedom because Donald Trump is in the White House. Our commander in chief is not only a warrior in the White House, but he is a lion in the White House. And I, for one, feel better about being an American. That has been today's final word. I'm Joy Villa."

That is all the time we have left for this evening. As always, thanks for being with us. This show will always be fair and balanced. We will never be part of the establishment, destroy-Trump media. This is your alternative voice. We appreciate your support. We'll see you back here tomorrow night."
