President Trump calls it a revolution, and we've got a candidate for governor helping lead the charge. Plus, the \"Angle\" digs up the truth on whether the catch and release policy by border patrol agents is really over. Meanwhile, Jim Comey's whiny tour of leftist media outlets makes him sound like a mean girl who was dumped by the president. And you will see where rare footage, yes, of an actual exorcism. Raymond Arroyo has a must-see interview with Exorcist Director about his chilly new documentary on the Vatican's legendary exorcists. Also, the William Friedkin about his chilling new documentary on the Vatican's legendary exorcist. Also, the president fields questions ranging from talks with North Korea, to whether he will fire the special counsel.

That is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Never has a request to use the bathroom caused so much havoc. Last week, two black men were awaiting a meeting at a Starbucks in Philly. They asked to use the bathroom, but they were told no. Because it was reserved for customers, and they had bought nothing. So, they returned to their seats and because they had purchased nothing, they were then asked to leave. Well, they didn't, and the manager called 911. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

President Trump calls it a revolution, and we've got a candidate for governor helping lead the charge. Plus, the \"Angle\" digs up the truth on whether the catch and release policy by border patrol agents is really over. Meanwhile, Jim Comey's whiny tour of leftist media outlets makes him sound like a mean girl who was dumped by the president. And you will see where rare footage, yes, of an actual exorcism. Raymond Arroyo has a must-see interview with Exorcist Director about his chilly new documentary on the Vatican's legendary exorcists. Also, the William Friedkin about his chilling new documentary on the Vatican's legendary exorcist. Also, the president fields questions ranging from talks with North Korea, to whether he will fire the special counsel. Mike Huckabee will give us his usual insightful analysis. But first, Starbucks and black and white. That is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Never has a request to use the bathroom caused so much havoc. Last week, two black men were awaiting a meeting at a Starbucks in Philly. They asked to use the bathroom, but they were told no. Because it was reserved for customers, and they had bought nothing. So, they returned to their seats and because they had purchased nothing, they were then asked to leave. Well, they didn't, and the manager called 911."

That's not good for business. The call to the cops seems like overkill, but again, we don't know the full story. As a Starbucks faced these demonstrations all over the country, there was a rush to judgment on the company quickly jumped on it and a lot of people went overboard. Rather than just apologizing and disciplining and out of line employee, Starbucks announces that it was closing 8,000 stores for one day in May, and on that day, they will force 170,000 of its employees to undergo racial bias training. According to The Washington Post, the sessions will include training in something you might not know of, but it's called unconscious bias, where apparently you are unaware of your inherent bias, you displayed no overt racism, but you are biased nonetheless. The training will be guided by, wait for it, former Attorney General Eric Holder, the NAACP, and anti-defamation legal officials. What could possibly go wrong?

One employee in Philadelphia calls the cops on a pair of black men and employees across the nation are kind of assumed to be latent racists. Starbucks is one of the most liberal companies in the world. You think Ben and Jerry's, here on the level of left wing, Starbucks is up here. Look, they support Planned Parenthood. They've hired refugees with the protests against President Trump's policies. They forced baristas to address race relations with customers a few years back. They were made to scrawl that #racedtogether on coffee cups? But if the coffee chain thought it was going to inoculate itself against liberal ire by being left-leaning, they were wrong. There is progressives, supposedly inclusive identity just made them an easy target for protesters. By the way, a comedian, I did not know this. I thought it was for real earlier today.

And will this actually strengthen race relations, or could it actually deepen divisions between the races. If we are not careful, and if we don't refuse to get all of the facts, and if we don't refuse to be bullied by activists, who jumped to the worst motive, worst conclusions about people right off the bat, well, we may just end up doing the opposite of what we actually want to do.

HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR OF PROJECT 21: Racial separatists are doing everything they can to exploit anything that they find. This is an example of the emperor's new clothes. We don't have to have real, conscious misbehavior. We have unconscious bias. We have implicit bias. I want to make some news tonight. Our organization this week is going to be contacting the EEOC and the Department of Justice and we are going to ask them to see to it that any employer that is going to punish, penalize, or in any way interfere with the right of their employee to operate without detecting whether or not they have some unconscious bias, will be found in violation of Title VII.

Let's debate these developments in the golden state with Republican candidate for Governor John Cox and the Border Angels founder, Enrique Maroney. It's great to see both of you. All right. Enrique, let's start with you. On this issue of the National Guard at the border, not all governors are wild about it, I'm sure. But initially, Jerry Brown said 400 troops would take part in this effort, but he made it clear that there's no wall. I guess, they are not going to build a wall, but they are not going to enforce immigrations laws and now this whole thing has reached a fever pitch.

Remember, he said I want to say what I said about Hillary, which will be illegitimate if he wins. Guess what, that is exactly the boat that Trump is in by virtue of Comey not disclosing to the public about this investigation. I'm sorry, Dan, I agree that Comey had an obligation to level with the public. He was going to level with them about Hillary, he had to level with them about Trump and he didn't."

All right, guys, fantastic, love you both, by the way. And the man who made \"The Exorcist\" movie, that smash hit new documentary is coming out, and it's going to show you the real thing, yes, a true case of demonic possession, when we come right back."

Oscar-winning director William Friedkin terrified the nation in the 1973 with his film \"The Exorcist.\" Now he is exploring the real thing. FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo recently interviewed the director about his new documentary. Raymond, tell us about it."

He went on to do \"The French Connection,\" of course \"The Exorcist.\" In many ways he comes full circle in this project which examines the rite of exorcism and possession. Here's what you can expect from the film."

Father Gabriele Amorth has been the exorcist for the diocese of Rome for 31 years. He has exorcised Christina eight times without success. This will be her ninth."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Mr. Friedkin, 45-years after \"The Exorcist,\" here you are back looking at exorcism. You said, I found this quote from an interview, I would never do anything with demonic possession or exorcism in it. So why do this? Why do this documentary now?"

      "utterance": "It was an accident, Raymond. I was in a little town called Lucca in Italy getting the Puccini prize for my work in opera. I wrote to a friend of mine who is a Catholic theologian named Andrea Manda, and I asked him if he could give me a meeting with either the Pope or Father Amorth. And he emailed me back immediately saying Father Amorth is available, would be happy to meet you. So I went to meet him."

      "utterance": "He agreed to let me witness one, and I pushed my luck and ask him if he would let me film it, not knowing what I would ever do with it. But the head of the order wrote back and said, you can film it but alone with no lights and no crew."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDKIN",

And they said, while everything originates in the brain, this is not a problem of her brain. The psychiatrist, four of the leading psychiatrists in the country, including the editors of the DMS-4 and the DSM-5, the psychological manual of medicine, they now recognize exorcism. They call it dissociative identity disorder, demonic possession."

      "utterance": "There was no other explanation for what was going on. I always thought, there is probably some medical or psychiatric term for this. There isn't. There's a psychiatric term for it that involves possession. So if someone comes to a psychiatrist and says they are possessed, they don't say, no, you are not possessed. Here are some medication and a little therapy, you'll be fine. No, they bring in an exorcist now, which they did at Columbia University where I filmed these guys."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Fantastic. Thank you so much. Let's talk about President Trump's style here. He is down there in Mar-a-Lago. I guess they didn't come to any great conclusion about exempting Japan from tariffs, meaning Japan didn't give enough to the United States in order to be exempted from tariffs, so I love that Trump is holding firm on that. But on this issue of North Korea, this is just, this is just so classic Trump. He says he wants to be flexible but this thing isn't going the right way, he's out of there. What do you think of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "He is a guy when he plays his cards never really give his cards away. So what he's doing is saying OK, Pompeo came. We had a great visit. Things went well. The set up is there. But he wants to make it very clear he has some expectations. Will his expectations be mapped? Probably not, not completely. But it's historic in that he is bringing North Korea closer to behaving like a real country than anyone in our lifetime has been able to do. And that really is progress. But he is just making it clear, Laura, that he's not going be played the chump like other administrations of been played."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And what is your sense on the Democrats? Blumenthal came out big time against Pompeo today. Obviously he had been confirmed as CIA director, but now in this pivotal moment for the United States, pivotal meetings with North Korea, he is running into trouble, may not have the votes to get out of committee, and might have his full confirmation in jeopardy. What does this tell you about the state of politics in the United States?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "It tells you, for one thing, the Democrats have lost any perspective of the constitution. Jeanne Shaheen in fact said she wasn't going to vote for him because of his pro-life views, the fact that he was just a little too Christian, had views that were Biblical. Think about that for a minute. There is a constitutional prohibition about putting a religious test on public office, and that's exactly what she has done. Now, if the Democrats want to play this game, then I hope they are expecting that when Republicans are in a position to confirm a Democrat president's appointee some time, they just say blanket no. This guy is pro-abortion, so we're not going to confirm it. I will tell you this. I like Rand Paul a lot, but Rand Paul needs to vote to confirm Pompeo for a simple reason. Had Rand Paul been elected president, he would've wanted his team to be confirmed. And a president has a right to put people on the field that he wants to put unless there is something morally repugnant about them or unless they are horribly unqualified."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Pompeo, they say he's a warmonger, he's too interventionist. Well, they are about to meet with North Korea to avoid a confrontation. He already met with Kim Jong-un. This is crazy town stuff. Very quickly on the Mueller probe, the president tonight said basically this thing has gone on too far, I hope it's coming to an end. They say are you going to fire Rosenstein and Mueller? He said they keep saying that. Months have gone by and it hasn't happened. The left is begging him to fire Mueller. They are desperate for him to fire Mueller. They have been going on and on about this. Governor, close it out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "The only person who is really talking about firing Mueller are the Democrats, the never-Trumpers, and the Trump haters. He's never given any indication that he is going to and he's telling people he's not. He knows it would be disastrous. He's not going to do it. It's a false type of sleight-of-hand of the Democrats and it's just beginning to look pathetic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Again, it's their way of not discussing the issues, not debating the issues that matter, and they are just proving themselves to be completely without substance. Governor Mike Huckabee, always fantastic to see you, who was populist before populism was cool. We'll be right back."
