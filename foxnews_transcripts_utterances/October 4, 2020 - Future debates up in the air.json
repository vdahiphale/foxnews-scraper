Some of these conversations are important about the debate room, where you saw several people come out. The debate prep for President Trump, several people have now tested positive.

We review and debate every finding, compare to existing science and literature, weighing the risks and benefits of every intervention, the timing, as well as any potential impacts a delay may have. Over the course of his illness, the president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation. We debated the reasons for this and whether we would even intervene. It is a determination of the team based predominantly on the timeline from the initial diagnosis that we initiate dexamethasone. I would like to take this opportunity now, given some speculation over the course of the illness, the last couple days, update you on the course of his illness. Thursday night into Friday morning when I left the bedside, the president was doing well with only mild symptoms and his oxygen was in the high 90s. Late Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, the president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94 percent. Given these two developments, I was concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness. I recommended the president we try supplemental oxygen, see how he would respond. He was fairly adamant that he didn't need it. He was not short of breath. He was tired, had the fever and that was about it. After about a minute, on only two liters, his saturation levels were back over 95 percent. He stayed on that for about an hour, maybe, and was off and gone. Later that day, by the time the team here was at the bedside, the president had been up out of bed, moving about the residence, with only mild symptoms. Despite this, everyone agreed the best course of action was to move to Walter Reed for more thorough evaluation and monitoring. I would like to invite up Dr. Dooley to discuss the current plan.",

In response to transient low oxygen levels, as Dr. Conley has discussed, we did initiate dexamethasone therapy and he received his first dose of that yesterday.

He is in very good shape, according to the doctors. Dr. Sean Conley, the president's personal physician, much more explicit at this news conference, saying that late Friday morning the president developed a high fever. His oxygen level dipped below 94 percent. That is considered a key benchmark for whether you need supplemental oxygen. Dr. Conley said he recommended that oxygen. The president said he didn't feel that he needed it. Nevertheless, it was administered. He also said that -- in a tone of regret, I think that Dr. Conley said that he had been trying to convey an upbeat attitude yesterday. It came off. It was not his intent that the president -- that they were trying to hide something, that certainly was not his intent. I think today's session was more effective at clearly communicating the state of the president's health, and as I say, very good news, much more upbeat reception and much more definitive reception. Please stay tuned to this Fox News channel and this Fox station for continuing coverage of this story. I'm Howard Kurtz in Washington. And we're back with our Fox News audience and back with the panel. I want to go around briefly to everybody on what we just heard. It was interesting to me that suddenly we're hearing specifics about the levels of oxygen, all questions that Dr. Conley had declined to answer yesterday. I think perhaps there was a reassessment of how forthcoming to be or how detailed to be with the American public. Mollie Hemingway, quick thought.",

What they're to do is get some answers, in my view, about what is the state of president's health. PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAAL UNDER HILLARY CLINTON: I agree, Howie. I mean, it is never good when half of a medical press conference is spent on correcting your tone of voice and how you presented information yesterday. If I heard him right, the president was on oxygen two days ago and that's something that they omitted yesterday. Now, if reporters are pressing him, god forbid reporters should ask follow-ups, because the first answers are always we are so proud to be part of the team, the president wanted to tell us. Mollie, if it was Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton, you would not be upset about how hard the press is asking. The press took the Trump campaign's lead and wants to know if Joe Biden would take some sort of add your analysis or inspection of his ears. You can't possibly say that they are out of line, especially since the Trump campaign, the Trump White House, and Donald Trump's credibility on medical information is about as low as you get. I will say that one thing that he suffers from on top of all this is micromania (ph) as does Hogan Gidley.

I want to take a moment to wish the president and first lady a speedy recovery. And Mollie, in light of this sad news, is it fair for journalists and commentators to pound away at the president's past downplaying of the virus or his mixed messaging on masks, or does that come across as insensitive?"

He's an advocate of masks. He wears one all the time. He shut down the state. And nobody said -- nobody drew any similarities between the way he ran his state and him getting that diagnosis or said, like, obviously these things don't matter. Unfortunately, the media seem to be unable to leave aside their just unchecked hostility. This is a very important time for them to be reporting facts. Instead, they seem to be trying to drum up scandal, foment instability. And just in general, behave hysterically. It is very disappointing to see that they can't set aside that hatred even for a few days. And it comes through particularly loud and clear while the president is hospitalized."

      "speaker": "JEDEDIAH BILA, FOX AND FRIENDS WEEKEND HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, you have to remember. Right now, the president has the virus. He's in the hospital. So this should be handled delicately, because it's a deadly virus. We've seen how many Americans die from this thing and many others get sick. So regardless, the media should be approaching it from that angle. I would like to think that we still have some degree of compassion left in us. With that being said, I do think some of these conversations about rallies, about, for example, the Rose Garden ceremony where you now see eight people that have tested positive. Some of these conversations are important about the debate room, where you saw several people come out. The debate prep for President Trump, several people have now tested positive. And you know that people were not wearing masks in there. These questions have to be answered because the goal here is prevention. The goal here is to prevent as much as we can, to prevent the spread of the virus. So have you to be able to look at circumstances and learn from them. And say maybe in hindsight this wasn't the best thing. There was a recent report that came out of about this rapid testing that was being used with respect to the Rose Garden, saying, well, that doesn't do so well at detecting people who aren't symptomatic. This is all valuable information. So I think you have to tow the line. You don't want to say the president deserved it. I mean, that's a ridiculous -- a heartless comment. But you also want to be able to look at these things objectively and say maybe some of these decisions haven't been so wise. Let's change them."

And we should stand together as a nation. And maybe this awful problem will help to pull us together, ironically. I find most journalists that -- I've seen responsible journalists outside of this sensationalist press had tried keep that same balance, wishing the president, while pointing out that the president did not only didnŸ_Tt wear a mask but ridiculed reporters and others who did. ThatŸ_Ts the kind of double message we've been getting from White House. And looking forward, we all have a responsibility to say, hey, how did the virus spread in the White House? What kind of policies are they doing? How can we change them? That's our job."

      "utterance": "So the media are repeatedly making the mask-wearing and the mask- messaging a major issue. You mentioned Virginia Governor, Ralph Northam, getting the virus despite the fact that he always wore a mask. So do you think there's too much press attention to this question of masks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Just in general, I think the press take too much of a side on this issue of whether the response to the global pandemic is to shut down the country, ban children from schools, keep people from going to church, have people be masked constantly, versus this idea that you do want to, you know, respond with appropriate concern to the pandemic without destroying your life. The media are clearly on the same side of this issue as Joe Biden, just as they are on the same side of every issue with Joe Biden. And that comes through loud and clear. There is a fundamental debate about how to respond to something like this, whether you put your entire country on hold, whether you, you know, stay in your house and you don't campaign, whether you, you know, who you think is essential and who you think is not or how you respond to these things. And we have just not seen, in any way, a good debate on that topic within the media. They have all agreed that they think sort of drastic lockdowns and very serious measures, keeping children out of school, are the right thing to do, even though there is not a lot of scientific evidence in support of this, although they assert that there is."

Now, Dr. Conley gave a generally upbeat assessment of the president's health, which came as a relief. But literally moments later, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, on background at the time. But it's now been widely confirmed that it was in actually in video of him saying to reporters. I want to go off the record with some of you all, was not as optimistic, saying the president's vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning, and the next 48 hours would be critical, journalists now saying totally conflicting messages from these two different senior officials. And isn't that affair assessment in light of the way this played out yesterday?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILA",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, that is a fair assessment. And I myself was trying to follow this in real-time. And was having a -- it was challenging to figure out what was actually going on. That should not be the case. When it comes to something as important as the president's health, he's not like everybody else. He's not like every other private citizen in this country. People are all plugged in. He's the leader of the free world. And I think people have a right to consistent information. And there's been an argument made. Well, some information is shielded initially. That's up to the administration. I actually really believe in full transparency on this issue. And there's a big difference between shielding certain information and providing contradictory information. ThatŸ_Ts a problem. The media's job here is to figure what that information is to get a consistent message from the administration and the medical community thatŸ_Ts treating the president, and then disseminate that information. And I just -- I found, as a member of the media, it was even hard for me to do that yesterday, just look objectively. I didn't know what was true. I had to sift through it. That's very, very problematic. And we saw even right from the start, Howie, when that timeline came out from the doctor. He had to go back and correct it, because the initial timeline suggested that President Trump had been infected before he actually was. So this is all a problem. They need to really get on this. And in the future, they need to really do this right, right from the start."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I was on the air yesterday after the Walter Reed news conference. And I noted that Dr. Conley had said 72 hours, the president had gotten the diagnosis 72 hours earlier, which was totally conflicted with the official announcement by the president on Twitter. And about 10 or 15 minutes after I noted that, Dr. Conley put out a clarification, saying he hadn't meant to say 72 hours. I think somebody might have been watching Fox. Clarence, the White House is drawing flock -- flak, excuse me, for not disclosing that White House aide Hope Hicks had tested positive. That story was broken by Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs. We also have White House reporters saying that West Wing staffers, many of them routinely donŸ_Tt wear masks. Kelly Anne Conway, as I mentioned and a half dozen others, were at the event at the White House, many not wearing masks for Amy Coney Barrett, now testing positive. Does the administration need to do a better job of putting out information and answering reporters' questions."

      "utterance": "Yes. And Howard, you and I have been through a number of crises like these. And you know what breaks out is what I call the fog of breaking news. We're still in that fog now for the last 48 hours. I think back to when President Ronald Reagan was taken to George Washington Hospital after having been shot. And he and his staff did a great job of covering up the fact that he had actually been shot and collapsed when once he got inside the hospital doors. That came out later. This kind of thing happens. Our job is to try to find out what is really happening. And Trump tried to clarify it, because the secrecy is necessary when dealing with the president's security and the nation. It leads to conspiracy theories, et cetera, et cetera. We need to be as straightforward as we can. And one more word on masks, wear a mask, ladies and gentlemen. Because look around the world. Why is this country behind everybody else in making masks a partisan issue?"

It had not been disclosed on the way to the hospital. So, you know, these questions always come up. We have a brief time left, Mollie. Leaks to news organizations about the impact on the campaign, an advisor telling the New York Times, a Trump advisor, political disaster, an advisor to Axios likely hurts Trump, points to the failure of his deep denial approach. These are his own people being quoted, but of course anonymous, Mollie."

In general, I find that prognostication by our pundits and reporters has been you abysmal for about the last five years. And they should have a little bit humility. They said four years ago that they knew how this campaign was going to go, that it was lights out for Trump, that there was no way he could defeat Hillary Clinton. Now, they seem to be doing this again. Nobody has gone through something like this in the closing days of a campaign. They should just be calmer about it."

Joining us now is Hogan Gidley, National Press Secretary of the Trump campaign, and the former Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary. Hogan, we all wish the president and the first lady a speedy recovery. Much of the media are saying this hurts the campaign, not just because the candidate has to be quarantined and is off the trail for some period of time, but because it puts the pandemic, including his early downplaying of the virus, and the fact that he's battling it right now back at the top of the media agenda, your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple of things. First of all, I appreciate the kind words about the president. I know he's doing well. The video he released shows exactly the kind of leader he is. Even at Walter Reed, he is focused on making every single American life better. He's done so with his policies in the first four years of his term. He's going of to do that in the next four years. I would quibble with, obviously, the characterization you just put forward about the president downplaying the virus. He was the only one taking this seriously. In fact, he mentioned it in the State of the Union you address. We all know what Nancy Pelosi did with that. She promptly tore it to shreds. It was this president who shut down travel from China and from Europe. Joe Biden would not have done that. He said it was a bad move, said it was xenophobic, said it was fear mongering, said it was racist. And now, we know from Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Redfield, and others that that one move saved countless lives in this country. So the president has taken leadership on this and just about every other issue he's faced, and you see the results. This country, while impacted greatly and negatively by this China virus, is better off than so many other places around the world because of this president's leadership."

You had the president's personal physician, Dr. Sean Conley, not really giving a straight answer on whether he had received supplemental oxygen. You had an upbeat assessment from the doctor. And as we've discussed moments ago, White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, on background, saying that he was concerned about the president's vital signs over the previous 24 hours, next 48 hours will be crucial. You're a press secretary. Doesn't this kind of conflicting and confusing information undermine credibility and make it hard for people to figure out how is their president doing?"

      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "No. The president was very clear. He released his own video and talked about how he was doing. He was open and honest. You saw there was no teleprompter, no staffer handing him notes during the course of that video, which is more than I can say, of course, for Joe Biden. And look, the American people know that this president is in control of this country. And the doctors came out. They clarified their statements as well. People know this president is facing a serious illness, just like so many Americans across this country. He's fighting it. But as he also said in that video, he can't stay locked up in a basement forever. This country can't stay shut down. We have to get back out. We have to get our economy back up and going again, people back to work. Livelihoods matter. And when you have all of the death and destruction caused by this Coronavirus, and what China did to this country is unspeakable, what they have done and unleashed on the world. You need a leader in this time that not only fights this virus but fights back for the American people on all fronts. That's what this president has done. You saw that in the video."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I'll tell you what I kind off of thought and found about some of the conversations in the mainstream media and quite frankly some mainstream Democrats. It's disgusting what they're saying about this president. When you have a speech writer -- a former speech writer for Hillary Clinton saying I hope he dies, when you have MSNBC -- I was looking, saying man, if Trump and Pence go down, that would be great, because then we can get Nancy Pelosi. That doesn't bring anybody together in the country. You would think if the president of the United States, regardless of party, had any illness whatsoever, that the country could come together. The Democrats and the media, working in tandem as they always do, cannot help themselves. They don't like Joe Biden. They just hate Donald Trump. And they're going to do everything they can in their power to get him out of office, even if that means saying disgusting, reprehensible things about someone who is fighting an illness and is sitting in Walter Reed right now, still running the country and still doing a better job behind the walls of that facility than Joe Biden ever did in 47 years of failure in elected office."

I got about a half a minute, though. You spoke to him last night. Tell me about that. And also, why didn't the White House reveal that Hope Hicks had tested positive? And instead, this was broken by Bloomberg News, which made some people feel like the information was being held back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "A couple of things. I obviously can't speak to what the White House is doing. I don't work there anymore. I know that they have the best doctors on the planet in that facility, looking out for everyone's health. And I know that all the necessary precautions are taken every time someone is around the president. The people who are around him every day also have testing every single morning. So I know they've taken all the proper measures to make sure the president is healthy."

He's ready to get back on out on the trail and keep fighting for the American people, not just reminding them what he did the last four years and what he's going to do for the next four as well."

We'll bring it to you. And we're back in the meantime with Trump campaign's Hogan Gidley. Let me take you back to the debate, because the president, as you know, has been portrayed as having blown up that debate. As having shattered the rules, undermined democracy, and all that, fusing to stop interrupting Joe Biden who interrupted at times as well, your reaction to that coverage, and in light of the president's illness, do you believe at this point the other two debates will take place?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "I think they will. I hope they will. But, you know, Joe Biden back in 2012 interrupted Paul Ryan 82 times. We expected that to happen. It was actually Joe Biden who interrupted this president first. It was in his second answer. No one talks about that. So it was game on from then. The president is a counter-puncher. And you think he's aggressive? You better believe this president is aggressive. He's bold. He's decisive. ThatŸ_Ts why this president was able to get hostages back that Joe Biden could never get back. That's why this president was able to get trade deals that benefited American workers. Joe Biden could never do that. That's why this president's attitude and his style, able to do so many things towards the way of peace deals around the world, making this world a safer place. Joe Biden could never do that. So are there people out there who may or may not like every single tweet? Perhaps, but the fact is the results that this president has been able to deliver to the American people, regardless of race, religion, color, or creed, speak for themselves. Joe Biden could never do any of this, and he has a 47-year career of failure to prove my point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Just for the record, our Fox News analysis said the president interrupted either his opponent or Chris Wallace, moderator, 145 times to Biden's 67 interruptions. But the media have really continued to hammer the president, as you know, about his response to Chris Wallace's question about condemning white supremacists. Now, I know, as you're going to remind me, that three times the president said sure, but he didn't issue at that time a simple declarative sentence. In fairness, Thursday night, he went on -- he called into Sean Hannity's show. He said I condemn white supremacists. I condemn the KKK. I condemn the Proud Boys. Why didn't he do that at the debate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "He did it at the debate. You just said so, three times in one question. The media just keep trying to drive this narrative, because they know that Joe Biden and the Democrats are hemorrhaging African-American voters. President Trump came in and said what do you have to lose? And he delivered for the black community. Something Joe Biden hasn't been able to accomplish in his 47 years, nearly half of the century, and nothing to show for it in the African-American community. African-Americans are coming onto this campaign, because the president not only passed criminal justice reform, something Joe Biden didn't do. This president also made sure that the KKK was going to be prosecuted as a terrorist organization, something Joe Biden didn't do. This president got record high employment for African-Americans, as well. Joe Biden talks a good game, but he's been an abject failure at every level of government. And nowhere is that more obvious than what the African- American community. So I understand why they're trying to push this narrative. But the president has absolutely condemned white supremacists at every single turn. He's done it multiple times. But you notice Joe Biden won't condemn Antifa. In fact, he calls it a set of ideas, because he knows those people rioting, looting, smashing in store fronts, burning down churches, are all with his supporters. So he doesn't want to risk offending those who are destroying this nation and causing death and destruction in our cities because it would hurt him at the ballot box."

At a rally in Minnesota, the president said the media outlets are cheering violent demonstrations in the streets. He said CNN, New York Times. They think rioting is just OK. You can do whatever you want. Do you believe -- does he really believe that news organizations think rioting is OK?"

This narrative though that this was Trump interrupting, certainly he was interrupting, but it is important to note that he was not the first person to interrupt or the first person to interrupt repeatedly. In his second question, he was interrupted three times by Joe Biden. And then we had a moderator -- you know, we had moderation that was trying to keep control of the debate. I think it would have been good just if we could have more -- we clearly need to do something to just enable the candidates to speak to each other. I think partly the media were frustrated that Joe Biden hadn't been able to dominate in that same way that he did in 2012 when he debated Paul Ryan and he just interrupted him constantly. The media liked that when that happened. They didn't seem to like it when there were interruptions here."

Was there poor behavior on both parts at times? Absolutely. If I were Chris Wallace, I would have really wanted to be able to cut the mics. It left me feeling like the debate moderator should be able to cut the mics. Chris Wallace wasn't sent out there to be a hall monitor for a bunch of third graders. He was sent there to moderate a presidential debate. If you agree to the debate rules ahead of time and this goes for both parties, then you should be held to that standard. They are two adults. They should have followed the rules. What it prevented was people hearing about policy. You know, I have to say, you know, President Trump has to watch his tone sometimes. I think Joe Biden does, as well. People are there for the meat of the matter there. They want to hear you talk about health care, how you're going to lower their costs, what you're going to do about their taxes. They're trying to figure out who to vote for here and to look like you're dealing with two people who were toddlers. I mean, that is just not a good situation.

You got a big shouting match that broke down in two and it didn't serve anybody's purposes very well. I was most surprised with President Trump who normally is very conscious of how an audience thinks and feels, somehow thought that by yelling at Joe Biden and interrupting, he was going to expand his base. No. Right now is a time when President Trump needs to be able to reach out to those people who are the undecided voters, that 15 percent out there or whatever that's still undecided and most of those I talked to just thought a pox on both their houses, it was a big hot mess."

The Commission on Presidential Debates is considering that if there are two more debates, which we hope there are. But at the same time, the president and his team, his campaign team have ripped the commission, saying they're siding with Joe Biden and he won the debate and he doesn't want to change the rules in the middle of the game, so it's not clear how that will play out."

One is that there are a lot of things that the media just refused to talk to Joe Biden about and the only person in the entire country who might be able to press Joe Biden on those things is Donald Trump. So if he is constrained from being able to ask his opponent questions that the media refuse to ask, that is a pretty big liability against him. More than that, I think it's very much time for us to update how we do debates. There had been a flurry of pushing for Joe Rogan to moderate the debate, not because he's particularly like a policy wonk or has experience doing anything like that, but he does an interview style where he actually tries to get at what people really believe without judgment. And I think that there needs to be something to really update this. It's not doing what it's supposed to do and it's not serving the American people or just let the two candidates kind of talk to each other and go at each other and ask the questions --"

Yesterday's news conference created a lot of confusion. I am sure they would like to have a very simple, clear update on the medical condition of the president. Is he improving?

As with any illness, there are frequent ups and downs over the course, particularly when a patient is being so closely watched 24 hours a day. We review and debate every finding, compare to existing science and literature, weighing the risks and benefits of every intervention, the timing, as well as any potential impacts a delay may have. Over the course of his illness, the president has experienced two episodes of transient drops in his oxygen saturation. We debated the reasons for this and whether we would even intervene. It is a determination of the team based predominantly on the timeline from the initial diagnosis that we initiate dexamethasone. I would like to take this opportunity now, given some speculation over the course of the illness, the last couple days, update you on the course of his illness. Thursday night into Friday morning when I left the bedside, the president was doing well with only mild symptoms and his oxygen was in the high 90s. Late Friday morning, when I returned to the bedside, the president had a high fever and his oxygen saturation was transiently dipping below 94 percent. Given these two developments, I was concerned for possible rapid progression of the illness. I recommended the president we try supplemental oxygen, see how he would respond. He was fairly adamant that he didn't need it. He was not short of breath. He was tired, had the fever and that was about it. After about a minute, on only two liters, his saturation levels were back over 95 percent. He stayed on that for about an hour, maybe, and was off and gone. Later that day, by the time the team here was at the bedside, the president had been up out of bed, moving about the residence, with only mild symptoms. Despite this, everyone agreed the best course of action was to move to Walter Reed for more thorough evaluation and monitoring. I would like to invite up Dr. Dooley to discuss the current plan."

Regarding his clinical status, the patient continues to improve. He has remained without fever since Friday morning. His vital signs are stable. From a pulmonary standpoint, he remains on room air this morning and is not complaining of shortness of breath or other significant respiratory symptoms. He is ambulating himself, walking around the White House medical unit without limitation or disability.

His liver and kidney functions have remained normal. We continue to plan to use a five- day course of remdesivir.

Our plan is to continue that for the time being. Today, he feels well. He's been up and around. Our plan is to have him to eat and drink, be up out of bed as much as possible to be mobile. If he continues to look and feel as well as he does today, our hope is that we can plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow to the White House where he can continue his treatment course. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over to Dr. Conley for any questions."

As I said, we evaluate all of these and given the timeline where he is in the course of illness. We were trying to maximize everything that we could do for him. We debated whether we would even start it, the dexamethasone. And we decided that in this case, the potential benefits early on the course probably outweighed any risks at this time."

Minutes after your press conference, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president's vitals were very concerning over the past 24 hours. Simple question for the American people, whose statements about the president's health should be believed?"

What he meant was that 24 hours ago, when he and I were checking on the president, that there was that momentary episode of a high fever and that temporary drop in the saturation, which prompted us to act expediently to move him up here. Fortunately, that was really a very transient limited episode. Couple of hours later, he was back up, mild again. I'm not going to speculate what that limited episode was about so early in the course, but he's doing well."

There you have it. He is -- the fact of the matter is that he's doing really well. He is responding.

      "utterance": "Some good news. As we just heard from doctors at Walter Reed National Medical Center, President Trump's condition as he battles the coronavirus said to be continuing to improve. He is in very good shape, according to the doctors. Dr. Sean Conley, the president's personal physician, much more explicit at this news conference, saying that late Friday morning the president developed a high fever. His oxygen level dipped below 94 percent. That is considered a key benchmark for whether you need supplemental oxygen. Dr. Conley said he recommended that oxygen. The president said he didn't feel that he needed it. Nevertheless, it was administered. He also said that -- in a tone of regret, I think that Dr. Conley said that he had been trying to convey an upbeat attitude yesterday. It came off. It was not his intent that the president -- that they were trying to hide something, that certainly was not his intent. I think today's session was more effective at clearly communicating the state of the president's health, and as I say, very good news, much more upbeat reception and much more definitive reception. Please stay tuned to this Fox News channel and this Fox station for continuing coverage of this story. I'm Howard Kurtz in Washington. And we're back with our Fox News audience and back with the panel. I want to go around briefly to everybody on what we just heard. It was interesting to me that suddenly we're hearing specifics about the levels of oxygen, all questions that Dr. Conley had declined to answer yesterday. I think perhaps there was a reassessment of how forthcoming to be or how detailed to be with the American public. Mollie Hemingway, quick thought."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think it's very good to be as transparent as possible, something the American people need to know. Also, the media need to stop acting like a pack of hyenas about this asking -- the way that they demand the level of detail for President Trump in a way that they completely didn't with Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was dying of cancer or in the way that they ask no questions about Joe Biden's cognitive decline or other issues he's dealing with. We can see the disparity and that hostility really come through and it's not good for this time."

You heard yesterday's news conference, I am sure, or read about it. What do you think of Mollie Hemingway saying reporters are acting like a pack of hyenas? What they're to do is get some answers, in my view, about what is the state of president's health."

      "utterance": " I agree, Howie. I mean, it is never good when half of a medical press conference is spent on correcting your tone of voice and how you presented information yesterday. If I heard him right, the president was on oxygen two days ago and that's something that they omitted yesterday. Now, if reporters are pressing him, god forbid reporters should ask follow-ups, because the first answers are always we are so proud to be part of the team, the president wanted to tell us. Mollie, if it was Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton, you would not be upset about how hard the press is asking. The press took the Trump campaign's lead and wants to know if Joe Biden would take some sort of add your analysis or inspection of his ears. You can't possibly say that they are out of line, especially since the Trump campaign, the Trump White House, and Donald Trump's credibility on medical information is about as low as you get. I will say that one thing that he suffers from on top of all this is micromania (ph) as does Hogan Gidley. Hogan Gidley, I am (ph) with him for a moment, Hogan Gidley said -- there he is and we can't. He's the kind of leader that won't wear a mask. We know it. He's someone who dictated his own --"

If Donald Trump is in the hospital, if the commander-in-chief is taken to Walter Reed, then it is legitimate to ask then a separate set of questions, especially when you're making the doctors available and especially when the doctors are been contradicted by the own White House chief of staff. I mean, this is not the media. This is Mark Meadows saying one thing on background."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILA",
      "utterance": "Yeah, a bit of a walk-back for sure. I think that the doctors handled it much better today, no question, probably listening to people's feedback and deciding that they needed to be more transparent. When it comes to the questions, if you've had this virus, these questions are fair, and the reason is, when you get this virus, all you're told to do is monitor your oxygen, by the hour sometimes, and you do get odd symptoms of chest tightness. That is what you're told, your oxygen saturation is key in terms of what will happen in your body for the next few days. So I didn't find that questioning to be too invasive from media. I think it is pivotal to know that if the oxygen dropped, how much it dropped. I also say, this is going to be something we are going to follow for several weeks. This isn't going to be, you know, a few days and it is done because --"
