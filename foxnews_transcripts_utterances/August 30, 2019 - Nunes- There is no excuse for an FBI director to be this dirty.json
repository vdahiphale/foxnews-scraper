Florida is bracing for a direct hit, but exactly where in the Sunshine State remains a question.

      "sentences": "Hey, there, Trace. This continues to be a very challenging forecast for this hurricane. The thing that we know is going to happen. It is going to continue to get stronger, and you can see it there a very strong looking storm. And when you see a very defined eyewall like that, that means this is getting more and more powerful, it's big, it's strong, and that means trouble. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Winds at 115 miles an hour. Gusting already up to 140 miles an hour. This is the motion we're going to be watching over the next couple of days as this moves off towards the west. Currently at about 13 miles an hour. We do suspect this climbs up to a Category 4 hurricane before it runs across the Bahamas. And then, by the time you start to get the portions of Florida in your eye sights, you're getting into really late Sunday night Monday. And then, maybe even working its way into Tuesday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is running into Tuesday, you see a turn, then, early Tuesday morning, running north. Still staying a Category 2 storm all the way into Wednesday. That's this particular model, but there's still a lot of uncertainty with this. We're going to be tracking this storm, and we've got a pretty good idea running all the way up to the Bahamas, but then what happens? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Several of our models say this shoots across portions of South Florida into the Gulf of Mexico. Others say, running right up the middle of Florida and still more saying that perhaps it doesn't even reach the coast, it just sits a couple of miles off the coast and then runs up the coast dropping a whole lot of rain. It really slows down and moves that way. But these are all those forecast models. It said in good agreement running into the Bahamas. And then, look at this, Trace. All of a sudden, all of these models shooting off in different directions. Several again, right along the coast. Trace, it's still possible that this doesn't even make landfall in Florida. Just runs right along the coast could drop a ton of rain if that happens. This is going to be a tough one. But we do know, it's going to strengthen, it's going to be big, strong, mean, just where is it going to go?

She was walking in the Embarcadero with her dad, she was shot and killed, and the man on your right found a gun, he said, the defense said that he stole it, the gun, he said, accidentally went off. The defense said that he was handling it and it went off. Here's the bottom line: He had been deported five different times, and the fifth time they were about to deport him again, but the San Francisco local authorities would not turn him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of sanctuary city laws, and Kate Steinle ended up losing her life. Now, his gun charge has been thrown out. Meantime, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck was booed off the field after announcing his retirement. Was that fair or did the fans go too far?

And escalating concerns of life-threatening storm surges flash flooding, and even that the storm may spin off tornadoes. Florida is bracing for a direct hit, but exactly where in the Sunshine State remains a question. And forecasts say Dorian will likely strengthen even further, potentially, into a Category 4 hurricane, which could make Dorian the strongest hurricane to hit southeast Florida since Hurricane Andrew back in 1992. Meteorologist Adam Klotz has the latest on Dorian's movements tonight live in the Fox extreme weather center. Adam."

      "utterance": "Hey, there, Trace. This continues to be a very challenging forecast for this hurricane. The thing that we know is going to happen. It is going to continue to get stronger, and you can see it there a very strong looking storm. And when you see a very defined eyewall like that, that means this is getting more and more powerful, it's big, it's strong, and that means trouble. Winds at 115 miles an hour. Gusting already up to 140 miles an hour. This is the motion we're going to be watching over the next couple of days as this moves off towards the west. Currently at about 13 miles an hour. We do suspect this climbs up to a Category 4 hurricane before it runs across the Bahamas. And then, by the time you start to get the portions of Florida in your eye sights, you're getting into really late Sunday night Monday. And then, maybe even working its way into Tuesday. This is running into Tuesday, you see a turn, then, early Tuesday morning, running north. Still staying a Category 2 storm all the way into Wednesday. That's this particular model, but there's still a lot of uncertainty with this. We're going to be tracking this storm, and we've got a pretty good idea running all the way up to the Bahamas, but then what happens? Several of our models say this shoots across portions of South Florida into the Gulf of Mexico. Others say, running right up the middle of Florida and still more saying that perhaps it doesn't even reach the coast, it just sits a couple of miles off the coast and then runs up the coast dropping a whole lot of rain. It really slows down and moves that way. But these are all those forecast models. It said in good agreement running into the Bahamas. And then, look at this, Trace. All of a sudden, all of these models shooting off in different directions. Several again, right along the coast. Trace, it's still possible that this doesn't even make landfall in Florida. Just runs right along the coast could drop a ton of rain if that happens. This is going to be a tough one. But we do know, it's going to strengthen, it's going to be big, strong, mean, just where is it going to go? We're going to wait and see."

Adam Klotz, live for us in the Fox Extreme Weather Center. Adam, thank you. Well, Florida residents undoubtedly keeping a close eye on the forecast. This Dorian's path develops, getting ready for whatever may lie ahead. Fox News correspondent Ellison Barber, has that part of the story.

Flashlights and rain gear. This is just one of a few sections in this store that are completely empty it. It almost looks like Black Friday. We have seen people here buying flashlights, buying batteries, buying generators, buying plywood, gas canisters. They're not buying any of it because they want to buy it, they are buying it out of necessity. State officials are telling residents in the state of Florida to expect a major storm. To have food, water, and medicine, for seven days. To prepare for power outages and flooding."

I mean, when you're looking at a Category 4 type hurricane, if you're on the coast there, you know, for example, places like in Brevard County, you're looking at potentially life- threatening storm surge, and that is not something that you want to ride out."

The governor of Florida issued a state of emergency for all 67 counties. He says, he decided to do that because the precise path of the storm is still somewhat uncertain. However, the governor warned the intensity of the storm is fairly certain. Officials expect this to be a major storm. Most of the people we've spoken to today say they plan to ride out hurricane Dorian. Others say they will leave, but at this point, they say it's hard to know what part of the state is going to be the safest."

Joining us now, Mayor Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County, where, of course, it could be ground zero for a Hurricane Dorian, which is now a Cat 3. And Mr. Mayor, you've got your hands cut out for you here because -- or your work cut out for you because the bottom line in this whole thing, is at some point in time, you need to get your people out of danger's way. The question is, you never want to have people evacuate into an area where the hurricane might be going. So, so, how long can you wait before you actually have to make a decision?"

      "speaker": "CARLOS GIMENEZ, MAYOR OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "Well, we're going to wait until we, we get the watches and the warnings here in Miami-Dade County if they happen. With that comes some information from the National Weather Service that gives us information on some kind of storm surge that may happen in Miami-Dade. All of our evacuation orders are based on storm surge data, we don't have that yet. We still have time to do that tomorrow. We are going to be picking up all our special needs, residents that have registered with Miami-Dade, we're going to be putting them in a shelter. So, we're going to take care of that right away. And then, wait for that information, and then, make a determination of when if and when we issue evacuation orders. Here in Miami-Dade, we try to evacuate basically in place. You move from the coast, away from the coast. You try to go with some friends or some family members. We ask our -- all of our residents that live in evacuation zones at the beginning of the hurricane season to make those plans then. And then, we continually ask them, tell them, hey, if you live in evacuation zone, you got need to make your plan because you don't want to try to figure out where it is you're going to go if we order an evacuation. You need to know that way ahead of time and make those plans ahead of time too."

It could come directly across Miami-Dade. It could go up toward Central Florida, or it could miss the state all together going up and maybe stay out to sea. That's the best- case scenario. But if -- but if you're talking to your fellow mayor's around the state, they have all got to be saying, well, what do we -- what do we do?"

      "utterance": "Well, it is. Because this is a very strange storm. I mean, the spaghetti is going everywhere. I mean, it could hit Miami straight -- I mean, head-on, it could go, and it could miss Miami, it could miss the state, it could hit anywhere in the state. And so, yes, it's a -- it's a problem for us. But you know, we'd rather be safe than sorry. So, we are taking a very conservative approach to that. I know that you know, it may be that we inconvenience some people for some time if we have people evacuate and nothing happens. But, you know what, it's better than nothing happens. And so, you know, we make that call all the time down here. Last time that we had Hurricane Irma, we were looking at a 185-mile an hour storm. We'd never seen anything like that. We ordered six -- we ordered 600,000 people to evacuate, it ended up being a Category one when it came through -- you know, Miami. But, again, better safe than sorry."

I was the emergency manager of the city of Miami when Hurricane Andrew came through. So, we have a lot of experience here in Miami-Dade County with storms. We probably handle them better than anybody in the nation. I'm glad for all the support we're getting from the state and the federal government. We've had a lot of -- a lot of experience down here."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "And you are a seasoned veteran. I've read your background on this, Mr. Mayor. But there is a question about this storm, because every hurricane is different, and sometimes they pose wind problems, and they are water events. This could be all three. We're talking about when, we're talking about storm surge, and we're talking about potential of maybe 16-18 inches of rain once it gets inland. That is something that even the best departments have a difficult time preparing for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIMENEZ",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, this is, this is kind of reminiscent of what happened in Texas. You know, with that storm just lingered there for days and just dumped, you know, tons of water on it."

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "GIMENEZ",
      "utterance": "And so, in this case, we have wind and water. And then, if it just lingers, yes, that's a big problem. And, you know. as well as we can be prepared, it's going to be very difficult for us to deal with -- you know, a torrent of rain here that just stays, and stays, and stays. And we were already pretty saturated, we're way above our normal rain levels here in this -- in this County, actually around the state. And so, that poses another threat to us. But again, in terms of preparation, in terms of life -- you know, loss of life, you know, we were pretty good at what we do as long as our residents, you know, listen to what we ask them to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Right. GIMENEZ. We'll be -- we'll be OK. The aftermath, it all -- it all depends on what that is. Is it rain, is it wind, is it combination? You know, again, that's when we're going to put all our resources together with the state and the federal government, and respond as quickly as possible, and get back to normal as quickly as possible."

And Dr. Kaniewski, I mean, I've read your background as well and you talked a lot about preparedness, and infrastructure, and the way these communities need to be built solidly. But what is your advice three days out? I mean, those are plans that are good two years out, 10 years out, when we're three days out, what are you telling the people of Florida?

We're doing the same, if you see behind me, the federal family is putting those plans into action. As for Floridians right now, you need to have that kit, you need to have the food, the water, your medications, for several days. Just so you can be on your own in case help can't get to you right away. Also, make sure you're ready to evacuate. We don't -- as you just said, we don't know who's going to evacuate and when?"

The president was just saying a short time ago, they think the answer is going to come on Sunday, well, it might not come on Sunday because they might not know where this storm is going until late Sunday night early Monday morning.

And then, two, know what route you're going to take out of your location. You can do some of that planning right now. And three, make sure your car is fueled up.

We're kind of waiting for that. Home Depot has just wiped out. They've got us -- you know, as much trying to help as much as they can. But you know, people are making a run on these stores. You talk a lot when you talk about preparedness about financial preparedness as well. Doctor Kaniewski, give us an idea of what you mean by financial preparedness as this storm comes to shore."

Whether they're a homeowner, and have homeowner's insurance, or renters, and have renter's insurance, and everybody needs flood insurance. Flood insurance is not included in your homeowner's policy. Now, obviously, it's too late for those in the -- in this path of this storm to get flood insurance. There is a 30-day waiting period. But, that's financial preparedness. What you need right now to be financially prepared, is to have cash on hand. Make sure you go to an ATM. Have that cash, again, so you can evacuate quickly. You're going to have some expenses whether it be to buy gas or other expenses you might need over the next few days. Make sure you have cash. ATMs, credit card machines, they might not be working in the immediate aftermath. Quite frankly, we've seen this time and time again. The power goes out, communications lines go down, credit card machines might not work, and ATMs might not work. Make sure you got that cash on hand."

Imagine having any law enforcement agency, OK, I'm not even saying somebody from the FBI or the Director of FBI, somebody comes and meet you at your house and they say oh boy, you know, we've got this information that you were with prostitutes in Moscow, OK. Now, remember, at the time this happens, this is after eight months of this dossier. This is the last possible thing that Comey -- Comey knows the rest of the dossier is garbage, OK. They already have a wiretap on the campaign. And here you are going to brief the President on this crazy pee tape -- pee tape. I can't even say it so -- because it's so ridiculous. So here you have somebody sitting down with them -- sitting down in your house telling you hey, I'm your friend, I'm with you. I just want to make sure that nothing happened in Moscow.

I think we have to start building institutions again because if you look at the 60s and 70s, so many of these institutions were closed, and the people were just allowed to go on to the streets. That was a terrible thing for our country. They closed them. Cities couldn't afford them, and they closed them. A lot of our conversation has to do with the fact that we have to open up institutions. We cannot let these people be on the streets."

We didn't have that problem in the recessions in the 70s, '73 or early 80s. A lot of those people have mental -- the majority have mental health issues. So, a restoration of mental health facilities would really help that problem of homelessness. I think the president would be right. As far as these mass shootings, they are horrific, especially when they attack schools because parents are not supposed to bury their children, children are supposed to bury parents. We want to do something about it. When we look at the statistics, we have about 350 a year out of 11,000 lethal shootings. So it is less than three percent. We get to that three percent --"

If we look at people who have been convicted of domestic abuse or felonies and have a gun they shouldn't have, maybe we can save another 50. But that elusive 150 or 200 people who are dying are such a small percentage. We don't really know how to get at that because all the methods that people are proposing where there is a gun ban like Australia or 10- year assault weapons ban, they don't really have a clear record of success. We are losing 600 young people in Chicago a day. That's double in that city alone of the number who perish in these mass shootings as defined as four people killed in a 24-hour period. So, it's like airline or death. We stopped that problem. We haven't had one in 10 years."

But the key is that when you say mental health problem, does that mean a diagnosis by a psychiatrist or psychologist? Does that mean somebody had said some crazy things to classmates? That's where you get in the tricky grey area, whether you say, well, you know what? These young kids were talking about shooting people, let's put them in a mental institution versus this person is on medications, he is not reacting well. You shouldn't have a gun. We have to take whatever firearms he's had access away. It's a very tough issue. All of these issues are. It's an emotional one. We can't just say, Trace, well, there are only less than two or three percent of 11,000 people killed by guns each year, these mass shootings, and therefore let's not worry about it. That's callous."

Joining me now is Michael Knowles, host of the \"Michael Knowles Show\" for the Daily Wire. Michael, it is great to see you. Apparently, we have now given up on the treadmill, the shrimp on the treadmill, in favor of the Panamanian frog to the tune of about $463,000.

We have $21 trillion economy, the largest national economy in the world and it's been the largest national economy in the world for about 150 years. So we can take 400 grand for the frogs on the arm. What we cannot continue to spend on is our $4.1 trillion annual budget which is running $800 billion budget deficits, alongside $122 trillion of unfunded liabilities.

Rand Paul is saying, you know, improper Medicare payments of $48 billion, taxpayer dollars that are wasted on things like the Panamanian frogs, $50 billion. And as you said, we are talking about a $4.1 trillion budget. But still, when people see a couple of $100 billion here and a couple of $100 billion dollars here are wasted, you think, oh, my goodness, gracious, why is it we can just say, OK, look, we need to save this year, we need to save $800 billion? It just doesn't work like that. The money just despite the shrimp on the thing -- and you see it on reels all the time, it's on YouTube -- nothing ever happens, nothing ever gets resolved."

So, when we hear billion and we hear trillion, we don't really hear much of a difference. What I love about Rand Paul's study is, one, he does talk about the real physical problems we have, but he still puts it into perspective, which is maybe we can't conceptualize $800 billion, but we can conceptualize a million or $2 million being spent to study lesbian obesity or shrimp on a treadmill or Panamanian frogs or as we have seen, the Pakistani short film industry. And those of us who just go out and work for a living, we don't work for the federal government, we don't spend money to the tune of trillions of dollars, we think, gosh, look at what we could've done with $400,000. If we didn't send it straight to the Panamanian frogs, where can we have spent that money here in our own country? And maybe we could've let the taxpayers keep it for themselves."

We have the entitlement programs. We can't build the Golden Gate Bridge. We can't send somebody to moon anymore because we got so many entitlement programs that we cannot afford send somebody to the moon as we did 30, 40, 50 years ago."

We pay into Medicaid. And yet for a lot of millennials and Gen Z, we are looking down the road and we are saying, these programs are not sustainable, so I'm paying money now into social security and Medicare that I am simply not going to get, the money is not going to be there at the moment. The awful incentive here is that politicians can spend the money now and then they are out of office 10, 20 years before the bill comes due. So there is no incentive to get that fiscal house in order. If Rand Paul can call attention to it by talking about the Panamanian frogs, I think that is very important."

She is the San Francisco woman who was shot and killed at the Embarcadero in San Francisco. She was allegedly killed by the man on the right side of the screen. He is Jose Garcia Zarate. Well, he was declared innocent in her killing, not guilty in killing Kate Steinle. That was a trial that happened in San Francisco that we covered extensively. Well, now, a California state appeals court has now thrown out the only remaining conviction against Zarate, which is that the gun that he had, the gun charge was not valid because a judge failed to instruct the jury about his defenses. So it's a technicality. So not only is he found not guilty of the death of Kate Steinle, he is now found not guilty of the gun charge that led to the death of Kate Steinle. She was walking in the Embarcadero with her dad, she was shot and killed, and the man on your right found a gun, he said, the defense said that he stole it, the gun, he said, accidentally went off. The defense said that he was handling it and it went off."

There is no such thing as retiring early. Football and many patients take a great deal of mental, emotional and physical fortitude. Early is simply whenever the player decides that he has had enough. And so whenever two of those three are compromised, whenever you are struggling, you are in pain all the time, mentally you don't feel like you can get -- if you listen to Andrew's statement, he also said that, you know, he didn't think he could put into being the leader of that organization, a leader (INAUDIBLE) put into what he wanted to put into because of all the things he was dealing with.

I want to give you the other side of the equation here because Doug Gottlieb who works with our company at Fox Sports, he said this -- let us put it up on the screen -- he said, \"Retiring cause rehabbing is \"too hard\" is the most millennial thing ever.\" That followed by Steve Beuerlein who was a former football quarterback who won a Super Bowl at the Dallas Cowboys. He said, \"To do this to his teammates, organization, fans, and the NFL two weeks before the season is just not right. I love the guy but this will haunt him.\" I think, Benjamin, that Steve Beuerlein has somewhat of a point. It is not about the retiring. We get it. We know you're in pain. But two weeks before the season, maybe you could have thought about this two months to give your team a little bit of time to kind of get ready."

The fact that they've been around for sports as long as they've been around, the fact that a guy wanted to give a statement -- and by the way, it was released prematurely. So when we look at the fans booing, they didn't have a chance to digest what happened. So, for them to boo (ph) and not hear from him, I think it's problematic as well. But, look, that's Steve's opinion, but we can't take the agency away from the players. They are the ones going out there. Andrew was a guy going out there today. He felt like this was it for him, and it's his right to do so. People change jobs all the time. People stop and retire and stop doing something else all the time. This is a job. You know, the sooner we start looking at it that way, collectively, the more respect we will have for Andrew's decision."
