      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's a bewildering experience working in cable news right now. Fun, but pretty unbelievable. Just about every morning, as we're putting this show together, some story from the Biden White House crosses our screens and we think to ourselves, \"Come on, there's absolutely no way that can be real, please. It's just too crazy.\" And of course, pretty much every morning, what we had assumed was a joke turns out to be entirely real. It is actually happening. The Biden demonstration really is that crazy. They really are firing thousands of nurses in the middle of a pandemic, firing thousands of cops in the middle of a crime wave. No, they're not kidding, even in the slightest when they tell you, that's a genuine female four-star Admiral standing right there. Joe Biden isn't giggling. He tells you Rachel Levine's promotion is a victory for women everywhere, and he means it when he says it. He means all of these things, even the ones he doesn't understand, which is most. As the guy who runs \"The Babylon Bee\" told us recently, it is getting tough to run a parody site in this country. No matter how creative your jokes may be, it is almost impossible to be more ludicrous than reality already is. And yet, even by those impossibly high standards, we can confidently announce tonight that we have just read the single most deranged news story ever printed in this country. So, no matter what happens going forward, and God knows what that will be, this story will live forever as the high watermark of political lunacy. Mark your calendars. It's October 28, 2021. This is the day that things couldn't possibly get nuttier, and here it is. According to a piece in this afternoon's \"Wall Street Journal,\" the Biden administration has decided to pay reparations to illegal aliens. In other words, foreigners who came here without invitation, who came in willful violation of legal statutes passed by our Congress per our Constitution, those people are about to get a groveling apology and huge amounts of cash. Why? Because our government dared to enforce its own laws, which now apparently is immoral. So the Biden White House is going to pay criminals for committing crimes. It's almost impossible to believe that's real, but it is real. According to \"The Journal,\" the administration plans to, quote: \"Offer immigrant families that were separated during the Trump administration around $450,000.00 a person in compensation. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services are considering payments that could amount to close to $1 million per family.\" A million dollars per family for illegal aliens at exactly the moment that American families are becoming noticeably poorer by the day. You will be surprised to learn according to the paper that nearly a thousand reparations claims have already been filed. Why not? The total payout from all this, more than a billion dollars. So how much is that exactly? Well, let's see. If you're an American citizen who is killed in a war defending your country, our government promises to send your family $100,000.00. That is less than a quarter of what Joe Biden intends to give illegal aliens for the inconvenience of being deported. They are once again getting $450,000.00 a piece from your tax receipts. That's more than some of the 9/11 victims got. It's more than any ordinary American ever gets for anything from the U.S. government. Most people in this country, just give. Foreigners with no respect for our laws or systems, meanwhile, are hitting the jackpot. So, take three steps back. You've got to wonder how long this sort of thing can continue. How long before the people who make this country run -- who by the way, are not the same people who run this country, those are two very different groups -- but before the people who make this country run, decide they have had enough, and they're not going to take it anymore? Why pay your taxes at this point? Seriously? It's too insulting. It's too destructive. It is evil. Now, who knows how long it's going to take to get there. But at this rate, it's coming quick. In the meantime, what can we know? Well, we can be certain how the rest of the world is going to see this announcement. Why wouldn't you cross our border illegally at this point? You'd have to be insane not to. Joe Biden is literally paying people who do it. So not surprisingly, as FOX's Griff Jenkins just reported, new waves of illegal migrants are coming here as fast as they can. Here's one caravan. GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Chanting \"Liberty,\" the caravan charges through a checkpoint as the Mexican National Guard stands by watching, the migrants undeterred by Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcello Ebrard who says they are being deceived by the organizers. MARCELO EBRARD, MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): They tell them, let's go in the caravan. We get to the U.S. and they will let us pass. It's not true. You saw what happened with the Haitians. It's the same thing. JENKINS (voice over): But the warning isn't breaking the will of the migrants.",

      "sentences": "We act like this is an act of God, we just can't stop it. But that's not what's happening. The Biden administration is actively encouraging this. And more so even today, the legislative framework that Democrats released today would give amnesty to millions and millions of illegal aliens, the largest amnesty proposed in the history of this country. The Center for American Progress, which is of course closely aligned with the Biden White House released an analysis of this and it concluded that nearly seven million illegal aliens living here would get green cards under this proposal. Specifically, it with legalize anyone here illegally, as long as that person could show he or she arrived in this country -- follow this -- between January 1, 1972 during the first Nixon administration and December 31, 2009, that's the span of 47 years. Quite a strike zone. But what you ask about the millions of illegals who've come here since 2000? Well, they're fine, too, actually. The Biden administration has just put out a list of No Go Zones, not places that foreigners who break our laws can't go, they can go anywhere, especially where you live, but a No Go Zone on for Federal officers who are trying to enforce those laws. So I.C.E. agents, according to the Biden White House are no longer allowed to enter schools, hospitals, healthcare facilities, places of worship, playgrounds, childcare centers, crisis centers, homeless centers, rehab facilities, food banks, disaster relief centers, funerals, parades, and many other places. Basically, they are not allowed anywhere. So that's it for immigration laws. They're done. They're totally ignored. They're totally unenforced. The question is the one that's never asked by anybody is how exactly do American citizens benefit from these changes? Let's see. Here's a recent report from the State of Florida. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): When Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd discusses this horrific car crash that killed a five-year-old girl, the anger in his voice is hard to miss.",

      "sentences": "\"I don't count drunk driving as a felony.\" Well, that's a big change. Oh, that only applies to people here illegally, not to you. The Biden administration once again, is making this country poorer, more chaotic, and in many places much more dangerous. It's not an accident. Of course, it's being done on purpose. People who are close to it see it every day, James Chilton is close to it. Chilton is a fifth generation rancher from the State of Arizona. His property abuts a five-mile stretch of the Mexican border. Ooh, woe to him, because over the last few months, his ranch has been transformed into something unrecognizable. His ranch is now covered with garbage dropped by people coming into this country. Illegal aliens fire weapons at Border Patrol officers as they head back and forth into Mexico. So watching all this happen, watching his land be destroyed by foreigners, Chilton had an idea. So the Biden administration as you may have noticed, claims it cares deeply about the environment, about something called ecological justice, and this seemed in-just. So Chilton called the Forest Service for help. Maybe they would save his patch of the environment from being poisoned and destroyed. But no, they didn't. The Forest Service said they couldn't come to Chilton's ranch because the property was too dangerous to patrol. Federal agents can't even go there. This is America. Over much of the past nine months, a lot of this chaos has flowed northward over Mexico's border with Texas, unvetted for nationals for more than a hundred countries, thousands more every day. Several times in the show, we've asked what the State of Texas plans to do about this. How can Texas help to save the rest of the country? Well, tonight, we're happy to tell you that the Governor of the State of Texas, Greg Abbott has mobilized the Texas National Guard to protect the sovereignty of this country and of his state. The Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott joins us now to explain what he is doing. Governor, thanks so much for coming on. Thank you for doing this.",

So as the Biden administration has taken over, what Texas has done, we now have 6,500 National Guard and DPS Troopers on the border to help secure the border. And as we're talking right now, they are identifying locations on the border where they are laying down razor wire to secure all the possible crossings that these caravans may be coming to. And then in addition to that, beginning today, we begin dropping these large containers that you see on 18 wheelers that you also see on these ships that are going across the ocean, we're dropping them down on locations that could be crossings that would be used by these caravans to serve as a blockade to prevent them from coming across the border. And then on top of that, if they do, do come across the border, the National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety, they are authorized to arrest these people who make it through our blockade efforts and put them in jail for violating a crime of criminal trespass in the State of Texas. And Tucker, on top of that, Texas is stepping up and we are building our own border wall. That process has already begun. We're in the process of getting bids on it, and I'm told to expect part of the Texas wall to be completed before the end of this calendar year.",

      "sentences": "So last time we showed you a trailer for something called \"Patriot Purge.\" It's our new investigative documentary on what happened on January 6th. It debuts Monday on FOX Nation. This morning, we woke up to this tweet. It comes from Congressman Liz Cheney of suburban Virginia who for some reason represents the State of Wyoming in the House, quote: \"FOX News is giving Tucker Carlson a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on January 6th.\" At the bottom of her statement, Cheney made her point explicit, \"Make this man stop talking. Deplatform his show at once.\" That was the point of the tweet, and it was pretty amusing to read it. This is not CNN. We work for FOX News. Our bosses don't pull people off the air just because some screechy little politician doesn't like what we say. Sorry, Liz Cheney. Keep in mind that Liz Cheney has not even seen the film that she is so angry about, just the trailer, a minute and 42 seconds, pulled from three full episodes. Liz Cheney is not waiting for the facts. She knows for certain that we've got weapons of mass destruction, and she plans to invade. According to Liz Cheney, this show is dangerous because we dared to report on what actually happened on January 6th. This show is somehow, she says, abetting violence. Now, if that argument sounds familiar, there's a reason that it does. That argument is a staple of those hysterical purple haired college activists you see yelling at people in viral videos. Your speech is violence, they shout, our speech -- our violence is speech. So in other words, burning down America's cities is a civil rights protest, shooting an unarmed female Trump supporter to death is an act of courage, but objecting to racist propaganda being imposed on your kids in school, that's terrorism, lock those parents up. Now that is the official position of the Democratic Party and has been for at least a year. What's interesting is that suddenly it is Liz Cheney's position, too, and in some ways, you can see why Cheney was so enraged by our trailer. Until yesterday, she and Nancy Pelosi had a monopoly on how Americans were allowed to understand January 6th. It was a racist insurrection, they told us with straight faces. It was the single worst day of political violence since 9/11 and the Civil War. That was their often repeated storyline, and they were entirely in charge of that storyline. No questions were allowed. But unfortunately for them, that is not how a free society works. Politicians don't get to put parameters around your thoughts or conversations. Free People are permitted to ask any question they want. They can follow the facts to their own logical conclusions, and that's exactly what we set out to do months ago when we began reporting out the story. We spoke to dozens of people who were directly involved in the events in January 6th. We screened hundreds of hours of relevant videotape. What we found in the end bore no resemblance whatsoever to the story that you have heard repeatedly from Liz Cheney and from Nancy Pelosi, as well as from their many obedient mouthpieces in the media. They were lying. We'll have all the details for you next week. In the meantime, by the way, we had hoped very much to speak to Liz Cheney directly tonight. Sniping over social media can be amusing, but it's not really the way adults communicate with each other. So, we called Liz Cheney's office this morning to invite her on the show, but she emphatically refused to come. It turns out that Liz Cheney is not simply a liar, she is also a coward. It's not really surprising neocons usually are cowards. In any case, our offer stands. Liz Cheney is always welcome on the show, anytime. On the way out tonight, we want to show you again, what we've been working on. It premieres Monday. Here's what it looks like.",

According to news reports today, the former Governor of New York -- recent former Governor Andrew Cuomo could be arrested next week. A criminal complaint was filed against him apparently for groping a former aide in the Executive Mansion.

His wife who is a doctor isn't wearing a mask -- she should know better.

Leilani Lutali has kidney failure and desperately needs a kidney transplant in order to stay alive -- to save her life. In September, the Colorado Health System, UC Health, took Lutali off its kidney transplant list. The amazing thing is, unlike so many people seeking new organs, she had a donor lined up. But UC Health said she could only remain on the list if she and the donor, a woman called Jaimee Fougner got Joe Biden's shot. So they're not getting it. The two have now started the transplant application process at a different hospital located in the State of Texas. We are happy tonight to be joined by Leilani Lutali and Jaimee Fougner, both -- thank you both very much. This is such a sad story.

If you want somebody who has been trained as a prosecutor, on your candidate, and what we've seen in Virginia with a murder rate that over a two-decade high is a lot of politicians that have played a political games, far-left political games with our safety going back from our schools to these local Commonwealth's attorneys, these prosecutors that have been funded by these outside special interest groups. You have the Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney, you had a case where an individual had raped a five-year-old child over the course of a year, and that Commonwealth's attorney just decided, well, a life sentence without the possibility of parole is too difficult and too harsh for a child rapist, I'm going to give a reduced sentence, drop some of these harsher sentences, harder charges, just so this individual is now eligible for only a 17-year sentence. With geriatric parole, he is out in 10 years and you have a Parole Board that has had this criminal first, victim last mindset where they're letting out violent criminals back on our streets. People like David Simpkins who had 56 prior felony convictions, including 14 prior armed robberies, forcible sodomy, and abduction. Tucker, he was supposed to be in prison to the year 2066. They let him out 46 years early, and what did he do with his 56th chance to get his life straight? He committed his 57th felony by walking into a convenience store, putting on a ski mask and holding a gun up to the head of a young clerk. And as the prosecutor in that case noted, he should have never been in a position to harm other Virginians again, but he was because this far-left Parole Board let him out and Mark Herring stood by and did nothing to stop it. And then finally, you just have to see what's happening in Loudoun, our schools. It's not just the curriculum. These far-left monopoly in Richmond, they passed a bill that ended the mandatory reporting requirement of sexual assault in our schools. And we saw what happened in Loudoun. You had just this week, over 500 students walk out, saying our schools don't feel safe, because you had an individual that went in and a ninth grade girl went into a bathroom and was the victim of a violent sexual assault. And then the perpetrator then was transferred to another school where a second alleged sexual assault took place. So right now, you have right now parents who are saying, listen, this isn't really about left or right. This is just about commonsense. It's about right or wrong. The first step that parents should have, the first confidence is that they drop their child off at a school, that they're going to be safe. And so again, Mark Herring would rather focus on far-left politics. In fact, he brags that he's turned that Office of the Attorney General in Virginia as a progressive powerhouse. I want to take it back to a law enforcement focus. And that's why we are having so many Virginians come down and rally around this everywhere we go across the state.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's a bewildering experience working in cable news right now. Fun, but pretty unbelievable. Just about every morning, as we're putting this show together, some story from the Biden White House crosses our screens and we think to ourselves, \"Come on, there's absolutely no way that can be real, please. It's just too crazy.\" And of course, pretty much every morning, what we had assumed was a joke turns out to be entirely real. It is actually happening. The Biden demonstration really is that crazy. They really are firing thousands of nurses in the middle of a pandemic, firing thousands of cops in the middle of a crime wave. No, they're not kidding, even in the slightest when they tell you, that's a genuine female four-star Admiral standing right there. Joe Biden isn't giggling. He tells you Rachel Levine's promotion is a victory for women everywhere, and he means it when he says it. He means all of these things, even the ones he doesn't understand, which is most. As the guy who runs \"The Babylon Bee\" told us recently, it is getting tough to run a parody site in this country. No matter how creative your jokes may be, it is almost impossible to be more ludicrous than reality already is. And yet, even by those impossibly high standards, we can confidently announce tonight that we have just read the single most deranged news story ever printed in this country. So, no matter what happens going forward, and God knows what that will be, this story will live forever as the high watermark of political lunacy. Mark your calendars. It's October 28, 2021. This is the day that things couldn't possibly get nuttier, and here it is. According to a piece in this afternoon's \"Wall Street Journal,\" the Biden administration has decided to pay reparations to illegal aliens. In other words, foreigners who came here without invitation, who came in willful violation of legal statutes passed by our Congress per our Constitution, those people are about to get a groveling apology and huge amounts of cash. Why? Because our government dared to enforce its own laws, which now apparently is immoral. So the Biden White House is going to pay criminals for committing crimes. It's almost impossible to believe that's real, but it is real. According to \"The Journal,\" the administration plans to, quote: \"Offer immigrant families that were separated during the Trump administration around $450,000.00 a person in compensation. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services are considering payments that could amount to close to $1 million per family.\" A million dollars per family for illegal aliens at exactly the moment that American families are becoming noticeably poorer by the day. You will be surprised to learn according to the paper that nearly a thousand reparations claims have already been filed. Why not? The total payout from all this, more than a billion dollars. So how much is that exactly? Well, let's see. If you're an American citizen who is killed in a war defending your country, our government promises to send your family $100,000.00. That is less than a quarter of what Joe Biden intends to give illegal aliens for the inconvenience of being deported. They are once again getting $450,000.00 a piece from your tax receipts. That's more than some of the 9/11 victims got. It's more than any ordinary American ever gets for anything from the U.S. government. Most people in this country, just give. Foreigners with no respect for our laws or systems, meanwhile, are hitting the jackpot. So, take three steps back. You've got to wonder how long this sort of thing can continue. How long before the people who make this country run -- who by the way, are not the same people who run this country, those are two very different groups -- but before the people who make this country run, decide they have had enough, and they're not going to take it anymore? Why pay your taxes at this point? Seriously? It's too insulting. It's too destructive. It is evil. Now, who knows how long it's going to take to get there. But at this rate, it's coming quick. In the meantime, what can we know? Well, we can be certain how the rest of the world is going to see this announcement. Why wouldn't you cross our border illegally at this point? You'd have to be insane not to. Joe Biden is literally paying people who do it. So not surprisingly, as FOX's Griff Jenkins just reported, new waves of illegal migrants are coming here as fast as they can. Here's one caravan."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We act like this is an act of God, we just can't stop it. But that's not what's happening. The Biden administration is actively encouraging this. And more so even today, the legislative framework that Democrats released today would give amnesty to millions and millions of illegal aliens, the largest amnesty proposed in the history of this country. The Center for American Progress, which is of course closely aligned with the Biden White House released an analysis of this and it concluded that nearly seven million illegal aliens living here would get green cards under this proposal. Specifically, it with legalize anyone here illegally, as long as that person could show he or she arrived in this country -- follow this -- between January 1, 1972 during the first Nixon administration and December 31, 2009, that's the span of 47 years. Quite a strike zone. But what you ask about the millions of illegals who've come here since 2000? Well, they're fine, too, actually. The Biden administration has just put out a list of No Go Zones, not places that foreigners who break our laws can't go, they can go anywhere, especially where you live, but a No Go Zone on for Federal officers who are trying to enforce those laws. So I.C.E. agents, according to the Biden White House are no longer allowed to enter schools, hospitals, healthcare facilities, places of worship, playgrounds, childcare centers, crisis centers, homeless centers, rehab facilities, food banks, disaster relief centers, funerals, parades, and many other places. Basically, they are not allowed anywhere. So that's it for immigration laws. They're done. They're totally ignored. They're totally unenforced. The question is the one that's never asked by anybody is how exactly do American citizens benefit from these changes? Let's see. Here's a recent report from the State of Florida."

He didn't even have a driver's license. So after downing the equivalent of 16 regular sized beers -- 16 -- he killed a five-year-old girl in a car crash. So the question is, what will Joe Biden do about things like this? Well, nothing. We know that for certain because Biden has already announced that drunk driving is no longer grounds for deportation."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"I don't count drunk driving as a felony.\" Well, that's a big change. Oh, that only applies to people here illegally, not to you. The Biden administration once again, is making this country poorer, more chaotic, and in many places much more dangerous. It's not an accident. Of course, it's being done on purpose. People who are close to it see it every day, James Chilton is close to it. Chilton is a fifth generation rancher from the State of Arizona. His property abuts a five-mile stretch of the Mexican border. Ooh, woe to him, because over the last few months, his ranch has been transformed into something unrecognizable. His ranch is now covered with garbage dropped by people coming into this country. Illegal aliens fire weapons at Border Patrol officers as they head back and forth into Mexico. So watching all this happen, watching his land be destroyed by foreigners, Chilton had an idea. So the Biden administration as you may have noticed, claims it cares deeply about the environment, about something called ecological justice, and this seemed in-just. So Chilton called the Forest Service for help. Maybe they would save his patch of the environment from being poisoned and destroyed. But no, they didn't. The Forest Service said they couldn't come to Chilton's ranch because the property was too dangerous to patrol. Federal agents can't even go there. This is America. Over much of the past nine months, a lot of this chaos has flowed northward over Mexico's border with Texas, unvetted for nationals for more than a hundred countries, thousands more every day. Several times in the show, we've asked what the State of Texas plans to do about this. How can Texas help to save the rest of the country? Well, tonight, we're happy to tell you that the Governor of the State of Texas, Greg Abbott has mobilized the Texas National Guard to protect the sovereignty of this country and of his state. The Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott joins us now to explain what he is doing. Governor, thanks so much for coming on. Thank you for doing this."

    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",
      "utterance": "I'll tell you exactly what we are doing, but I want to emphasize a phrase you used earlier, and that is the Biden ministration is actively encouraging this, which is in contrast to what the Trump administration did. So as the Biden administration has taken over, what Texas has done, we now have 6,500 National Guard and DPS Troopers on the border to help secure the border. And as we're talking right now, they are identifying locations on the border where they are laying down razor wire to secure all the possible crossings that these caravans may be coming to. And then in addition to that, beginning today, we begin dropping these large containers that you see on 18 wheelers that you also see on these ships that are going across the ocean, we're dropping them down on locations that could be crossings that would be used by these caravans to serve as a blockade to prevent them from coming across the border. And then on top of that, if they do, do come across the border, the National Guard and the Texas Department of Public Safety, they are authorized to arrest these people who make it through our blockade efforts and put them in jail for violating a crime of criminal trespass in the State of Texas. And Tucker, on top of that, Texas is stepping up and we are building our own border wall. That process has already begun. We're in the process of getting bids on it, and I'm told to expect part of the Texas wall to be completed before the end of this calendar year."
    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Amen. When the country falls apart, states have to act like a country. So, you're the chief executive of a state whose sovereignty is being violated by foreign nationals, many of whom are not even from nearby country, not even Latin American, they're from around the world. It seems you're doing the sensible thing, the only thing -- what kind of pushback do you expect to get from the Biden administration for doing this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",

Among other things that I did, Tucker, I issued an order preventing any of the NGOs or other assistant aides in the State of Texas from transporting or moving any illegal immigrant within the State of Texas because of healthcare reasons, because of possible spread of COVID. The Biden administration sued me. They went to Federal Court. They got a Federal Court to rule that my executive order was unconstitutional. I will continue to act, however, but it just goes to show the level of pushback by the Biden administration, even trying to deny me to protect the health and safety of my fellow Texans."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",
      "utterance": "So the best way we can do that is the strategies that we are employing as we speak right now, and that is to identify all of these locations where they may be coming across and they're called low water crossing areas, and then to serve as blockades in those regions so that we will be preventing the people from coming across the border."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",
      "utterance": "It is clear kind of what you were talking about earlier. Joe Biden believes in open border policies and his administration do, and they are truly trying to redesign the United States of America in a complete lawless way. They talked about this on the campaign trail when all the Democrats were on the same debate stage talking about quite literally the socialistic policies they would employ in the United States which mimic Ocasio-Cortez and her acolytes, and they are acting out on all those policies and promises they made during the campaign. That leaves it to the states now to step up and do everything we can to hold on to the United States of America until Republicans can regain control of Congress and the presidency."

    {
      "speaker": "This morning, we woke up to this tweet. It comes from Congressman Liz Cheney of suburban Virginia who for some reason represents the State of Wyoming in the House, quote",
      "utterance": "\"FOX News is giving Tucker Carlson a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on January 6th.\" At the bottom of her statement, Cheney made her point explicit, \"Make this man stop talking. Deplatform his show at once.\" That was the point of the tweet, and it was pretty amusing to read it. This is not CNN. We work for FOX News. Our bosses don't pull people off the air just because some screechy little politician doesn't like what we say. Sorry, Liz Cheney. Keep in mind that Liz Cheney has not even seen the film that she is so angry about, just the trailer, a minute and 42 seconds, pulled from three full episodes. Liz Cheney is not waiting for the facts. She knows for certain that we've got weapons of mass destruction, and she plans to invade. According to Liz Cheney, this show is dangerous because we dared to report on what actually happened on January 6th. This show is somehow, she says, abetting violence. Now, if that argument sounds familiar, there's a reason that it does. That argument is a staple of those hysterical purple haired college activists you see yelling at people in viral videos. Your speech is violence, they shout, our speech -- our violence is speech. So in other words, burning down America's cities is a civil rights protest, shooting an unarmed female Trump supporter to death is an act of courage, but objecting to racist propaganda being imposed on your kids in school, that's terrorism, lock those parents up. Now that is the official position of the Democratic Party and has been for at least a year. What's interesting is that suddenly it is Liz Cheney's position, too, and in some ways, you can see why Cheney was so enraged by our trailer. Until yesterday, she and Nancy Pelosi had a monopoly on how Americans were allowed to understand January 6th. It was a racist insurrection, they told us with straight faces. It was the single worst day of political violence since 9/11 and the Civil War. That was their often repeated storyline, and they were entirely in charge of that storyline. No questions were allowed. But unfortunately for them, that is not how a free society works. Politicians don't get to put parameters around your thoughts or conversations. Free People are permitted to ask any question they want. They can follow the facts to their own logical conclusions, and that's exactly what we set out to do months ago when we began reporting out the story. We spoke to dozens of people who were directly involved in the events in January 6th. We screened hundreds of hours of relevant videotape. What we found in the end bore no resemblance whatsoever to the story that you have heard repeatedly from Liz Cheney and from Nancy Pelosi, as well as from their many obedient mouthpieces in the media. They were lying. We'll have all the details for you next week. In the meantime, by the way, we had hoped very much to speak to Liz Cheney directly tonight. Sniping over social media can be amusing, but it's not really the way adults communicate with each other. So, we called Liz Cheney's office this morning to invite her on the show, but she emphatically refused to come. It turns out that Liz Cheney is not simply a liar, she is also a coward. It's not really surprising neocons usually are cowards. In any case, our offer stands. Liz Cheney is always welcome on the show, anytime. On the way out tonight, we want to show you again, what we've been working on. It premieres Monday. Here's what it looks like."

So what if you found a lot of facts that show that actually it wasn't. It was something else entirely. They wouldn't like that at all, and they don't. Well, here's an interesting story. According to news reports today, the former Governor of New York -- recent former Governor Andrew Cuomo could be arrested next week. A criminal complaint was filed against him apparently for groping a former aide in the Executive Mansion. He'd have to register as a sex offender if he was convicted, which would be pretty unbelievable. Meanwhile, he has not been charged for the things he actually did like causing the deaths of thousands of people in nursing homes across New York. He never will be. Francey Hakes is a former Federal prosecutor. She joins us tonight to try to walk through the complexity of future potentially sex criminal, Andrew Cuomo.

So I don't quite understand how that happened. I feel pretty certain the District Attorney would have made it very clear when she wanted the charges filed. So, that's the first thing that strikes me. And the second thing is the name of the charge. It's forcible touching. Of course, we all know what it means if you read the paperwork, it means a sexual assault.

They obviously find the victim to be credible. This is in effect, groping. He groped her sexually is what the charge is, and they say that they have swipes from cards of people going in and out of the Mansion. They have cell records. So they have obviously tried very hard to bolster or support what the victim was saying happen, but ultimately, it's a question of her credibility, because there were only the two of them in a room together."

Well, here is something we never thought we would say, in the State of Virginia, which is now essentially a Democratic state -- a state controlled by the Democratic Party -- polls show that the Republican, Glenn Youngkin has a meaningful lead in the race against Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic governor.

Polling from the group, Coefficient has Youngkin up by four points. Just two weeks ago, according to our polls, McAuliffe was leading the race by five points. So what happened? Well, here's part of what happened. Terry McAuliffe said out loud, the parents had no right to be involved in their own children's education. They're not really your kids, they belong to the teachers union. There wasn't a gaffe, he kept saying it. On MSNBC for example, McAuliffe just argued that parents who complain about their kid's education are racist."

Really what this comes down to is answering the question, right, is Jesus Lord or is Caesar king? And really what we're seeing play out is that tension between two competing authorities and what you see in Virginia, in New York City, in the Upper Northwest is school systems asserting authority that they do not rightfully have. Our children are not theirs. My wife and I are not in a throuple with the Federal government or the local government, and they need to realize that parents have rights. And what you see is these Mama Bears who are standing up and saying, you can't do the star kids. We don't want race essentialism. We don't want radical gender theory.

He has landed in Rome, Italy and immediately proceeded to conduct a super spider event. So, here is the sequence of events. Biden gets off Air Force One. He is wearing a mask. His wife who is a doctor isn't wearing a mask -- she should know better. But then Biden takes off his mask to wade into the crowd, touching people maybe on the backs of their necks, breathing on them, slobbering on them, maybe even as he did the other day, spitting on them maskless. What do we make of that? Only history will be able to explain it. Meanwhile, a profound and very sad story. Leilani Lutali has kidney failure and desperately needs a kidney transplant in order to stay alive -- to save her life. In September, the Colorado Health System, UC Health, took Lutali off its kidney transplant list. The amazing thing is, unlike so many people seeking new organs, she had a donor lined up. But UC Health said she could only remain on the list if she and the donor, a woman called Jaimee Fougner got Joe Biden's shot. So they're not getting it. The two have now started the transplant application process at a different hospital located in the State of Texas. We are happy tonight to be joined by Leilani Lutali and Jaimee Fougner, both -- thank you both very much. This is such a sad story. I'm not even sure I can add to it, and we want to -- if you wouldn't mind starting and just telling us what you faced. I mean, you need this to stay alive. What did they tell you?"

And then when I began probing to understand what my options might be, the gist of it was that they were trying to protect my health coming in and not being vaccinated that I would have a certainty of facing COVID post-transplant, which it's not a certainty, it's actually a probability. And having had COVID last July, I have natural antibody. So, I'd asked about whether or not that would count. They said no. I said, what about testing me 48 hours before my surgery? They said no. I said, What about a religious exemption? They said no, that only applies to employees. I said, what if I signed a waiver and understood -- you know, saying that I understand what the risks are that I'm taking, and they said no. So all avenues that I could think of were close to me."

      "speaker": "JAIMEE FOUGNER, ORGAN DONOR",

So their justification in that was that I could potentially give Leilani COVID in the operating room, and I just thought that was ridiculous because they're not even testing patients prior to surgery to even try and prevent you from bringing COVID into the operating room. Why wouldn't they do that? And again, it was as if it was a certainty that I would have COVID and I would give it to Leilani. Even if I tested negative, I could potentially have had a false negative test and still give her COVID in the operating room."

This hospital system which exists to save lives is basically saying, you will die -- certainly, you will die without this organ, unless you obey Joe Biden's mandate, a nonsensical mandate. I mean, how do you even digest something like that?"

I really had a lot to digest about what did that mean for my life? You know, would dialysis be available to me? So I did reach out to the same hospital system and asked if I would be allowed to receive dialysis without having the vaccine. And I was told yes, but that it was highly irresponsible of me."

      "utterance": "Tucker, thanks for having me. Listen, if you want somebody who has been trained as a politician, Mark Herring is your candidate. If you want somebody who has been trained as a prosecutor, on your candidate, and what we've seen in Virginia with a murder rate that over a two-decade high is a lot of politicians that have played a political games, far-left political games with our safety going back from our schools to these local Commonwealth's attorneys, these prosecutors that have been funded by these outside special interest groups. You have the Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney, you had a case where an individual had raped a five-year-old child over the course of a year, and that Commonwealth's attorney just decided, well, a life sentence without the possibility of parole is too difficult and too harsh for a child rapist, I'm going to give a reduced sentence, drop some of these harsher sentences, harder charges, just so this individual is now eligible for only a 17-year sentence. With geriatric parole, he is out in 10 years and you have a Parole Board that has had this criminal first, victim last mindset where they're letting out violent criminals back on our streets. People like David Simpkins who had 56 prior felony convictions, including 14 prior armed robberies, forcible sodomy, and abduction. Tucker, he was supposed to be in prison to the year 2066. They let him out 46 years early, and what did he do with his 56th chance to get his life straight? He committed his 57th felony by walking into a convenience store, putting on a ski mask and holding a gun up to the head of a young clerk. And as the prosecutor in that case noted, he should have never been in a position to harm other Virginians again, but he was because this far-left Parole Board let him out and Mark Herring stood by and did nothing to stop it. And then finally, you just have to see what's happening in Loudoun, our schools. It's not just the curriculum. These far-left monopoly in Richmond, they passed a bill that ended the mandatory reporting requirement of sexual assault in our schools. And we saw what happened in Loudoun. You had just this week, over 500 students walk out, saying our schools don't feel safe, because you had an individual that went in and a ninth grade girl went into a bathroom and was the victim of a violent sexual assault. And then the perpetrator then was transferred to another school where a second alleged sexual assault took place. So right now, you have right now parents who are saying, listen, this isn't really about left or right. This is just about commonsense. It's about right or wrong. The first step that parents should have, the first confidence is that they drop their child off at a school, that they're going to be safe. And so again, Mark Herring would rather focus on far-left politics. In fact, he brags that he's turned that Office of the Attorney General in Virginia as a progressive powerhouse. I want to take it back to a law enforcement focus. And that's why we are having so many Virginians come down and rally around this everywhere we go across the state."

Our documentary hasn't aired yet, but they hate it already. All the more reason to watch it. They are lying as you'll find out Monday. We will be back tomorrow. Sean Hannity takes over now."
