Six law-enforcement officers were shot in less than 48 hours. And today in New York, the NYPD honoring fallen Officer Jason Rivera who was murdered execution style along with his partner after they were ambushed by a felon with a massive rap sheet. The city's new police commissioner saying it's time to respect police again and push back against the anarchy that's being unleashed.",

      "sentences": "From your lips to God's ears. First of all, let me say that the speeches were powerful in St. Patrick's. When the widow of Jason Rivera got up and talked about her husband being tired of the loose laws especially of the new D.A., she got a standing ovation by the police, by the priest, by the cardinal. Everyone gave her a standing ovation. Here's the problem. We, the public have been silent, it's this minority that is just so loud that they are -- they are literally silencing the rest of us who are just kind of going along with our lives. Here's the bottom line, it's criminal privilege right now. There is a war on cops, you're absolutely right, but it's time to end it. And the way to end it is with governors to talk out of both sides of their mouths. Governor Hochul who said this funeral today, she says on the one hand I'm not going to change the bail laws so we're going to keep letting the criminals out, but I'm going to work with Mayor Adams. She's got to go. She takes one side or the other. Alvin Bragg, whoever the new governor is, hopefully we'll put him out of office. He does not deserve to be in office. But we have got to find tune into the individuals. The judge, there is a particular judge, Denis Boyle, who continuously lets out these young people who have gun crimes over and over, three times letting a young kid out on different gun crimes and then finally he ends up shooting a cop. These are the judges who have the power, but don't use it. It's time to find tune it because we're all going to lose. We can't survive in our society with this chaos. It is a turning point because we stand strong and I've stood in many of those lines. We are strong. We are united. That blue line isn't thin, it's a lot bigger than you think.",

Because we are in this memory erasing industry where one story knocks out another story like you're playing a game of pool. But you have to remember how we got here. There was almost a two-year demoralization of police, you know, champion by the media and by the activists. Right? Married to progressive policies and an ideology that we're in an oppressive society and therefore we, everything has to change. A year ago, if you turn on CNN or MSNBC, they would portray the police as basically MS-13 with better uniforms. They were demonized. So now, you turn, you flip around the channels today and you see on CNN and other places, they are covering the funerals, right? Because now cops are getting shot left and right and many -- some of them are dying, and so they realize that they created the atmosphere for random violence by basically negating the authority of the police. And so now they cover the funeral because they sense the tide is turning and they're caught in the undertow.",

Their own beliefs open the door to progressive disasters like the no bail, no cash bail, and you don't need context to cover crime, you only need two variables, victim and victimizer. The media hates that because that's too easy. They need to have context, which means root causes and systemic racism, and he was abandoned as a child and so suddenly the criminal is decriminalized, and the victim is forgotten, politics becomes the end game. That's where we're at. You know, we talked, we already covered CNN basically saying that our coverage of crime was an Instagram filter. I hope they Brian Stelter to the funerals and took pictures of the mourners and use the correct Instagram filter when they did it and maybe they got some good retweets out of it.",

I will tell you that on Thursday, five people were shot at a hotel, one of them fatally in Washington, D.C. So, crime, violent crime is a major problem there as well. To today's event I will say that Jason Rivera's widow was correct when she said that the system failed him, because in a poignant sense, his death is not only the responsibility of his killer, by which I mean at least a small part of the blame here goes to the city and to its leadership. I'm someone who usually looks to policy solutions for the nation's biggest problems, but fixing the policy here is only a small part of the solution. You know, decriminalizing violent crime is a real part of the problem, but you're not going to fix this until you get at the anti-police sentiment that is running rampant across the country. I don't know how you do that, but it takes all of us, meaning all, everybody in America, all of us Americans standing together to try and combat it. I think it's a tall order, but I think that's where the focus should go when you talk about moving forward. We all need to get involved.",

This widow's comments and her words and the energy and passion that she showed is going to be shown all across the state. To your point, to your point, Jesse. Those who willing to fund efforts to change communities, there should be an effort funded right now, let her words be the only words in the commercial to recall any D.A. that does not implement tough laws, any legislature that does not -- that does not reform bail reform. And let that be -- let those be the words to help energize, re-energize and rekindle to Gil Scott-Heron's comment about how we support police officers. I think every community in this city, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, all want to support and do support police officers. That -- that widow's comments should not only help do that, but you may get a little upset with me now, but two -- the gun that killed those two officers with the ghost gun from Philadelphia. We ought to figure out ways to enact smart gun laws, not only do we need bail reform. Not only do we need activists who want to reform police, police departments, we have to support our cops first before we can do any of this. And I hope those words today resonate not only with D.A. Bragg and the chief of police and the mayor of this town, but every D.A. in this country. And more importantly for those of us who want bail reform, every legislator in Albany. Legislator in Albany ought to have to listen to what this widow said today. No widow -- now woman should ever have to say those things. No wife or mom should ever have to say those things.

Now if it all -- if it all collides and you're helping people and you're doing those things, that's one thing, but it's a little bothersome and a little tiring to hear a progressive or a moderate talk about the other as if somehow or another they have the monopoly on being right. Politics again, it's about solving problems Democrats or Republican alike. And if Democrats whomever is in the majority don't accomplish those things they'd generally get voted out. Now this is not something that just goes with Democrats, you see on the Republican side. Liz Cheney is trying to be kicked -- they're trying to kick her out of the party in Washington and in her own state. And even Adam Kinzinger they are trying to kick him out as well. And if you don't recognize these things as a party that's in power, you're going to lose power. So, Democrats, if this is what we want the power but to all this (Inaudible) and fighting here in the middle of a time in which our president is in the low 40s or high 30s, then we deserve to be defeated in November. If we're serious about having the majority, then behave like it. Pass things that are going to solve people's problems from the border to crime to inflation. Pass things that people want to see you work on. If you pass things that people don't want to see you work on, then you're likely going to you lose the majority. And that's the path we find ourselves on.

When the widow of Jason Rivera got up and talked about her husband being tired of the loose laws especially of the new D.A., she got a standing ovation by the police, by the priest, by the cardinal. Everyone gave her a standing ovation. Here's the problem. We, the public have been silent, it's this minority that is just so loud that they are -- they are literally silencing the rest of us who are just kind of going along with our lives. Here's the bottom line, it's criminal privilege right now. There is a war on cops, you're absolutely right, but it's time to end it. And the way to end it is with governors to talk out of both sides of their mouths. Governor Hochul who said this funeral today, she says on the one hand I'm not going to change the bail laws so we're going to keep letting the criminals out, but I'm going to work with Mayor Adams. She's got to go. She takes one side or the other. Alvin Bragg, whoever the new governor is, hopefully we'll put him out of office. He does not deserve to be in office. But we have got to find tune into the individuals. The judge, there is a particular judge, Denis Boyle, who continuously lets out these young people who have gun crimes over and over, three times letting a young kid out on different gun crimes and then finally he ends up shooting a cop. These are the judges who have the power, but don't use it. It's time to find tune it because we're all going to lose. We can't survive in our society with this chaos. It is a turning point because we stand strong and I've stood in many of those lines. We are strong. We are united. That blue line isn't thin, it's a lot bigger than you think."

Because we are in this memory erasing industry where one story knocks out another story like you're playing a game of pool. But you have to remember how we got here. There was almost a two-year demoralization of police, you know, champion by the media and by the activists. Right? Married to progressive policies and an ideology that we're in an oppressive society and therefore we, everything has to change. A year ago, if you turn on CNN or MSNBC, they would portray the police as basically MS-13 with better uniforms. They were demonized. So now, you turn, you flip around the channels today and you see on CNN and other places, they are covering the funerals, right? Because now cops are getting shot left and right and many -- some of them are dying, and so they realize that they created the atmosphere for random violence by basically negating the authority of the police. And so now they cover the funeral because they sense the tide is turning and they're caught in the undertow."

Their own beliefs open the door to progressive disasters like the no bail, no cash bail, and you don't need context to cover crime, you only need two variables, victim and victimizer. The media hates that because that's too easy. They need to have context, which means root causes and systemic racism, and he was abandoned as a child and so suddenly the criminal is decriminalized, and the victim is forgotten, politics becomes the end game. That's where we're at. You know, we talked, we already covered CNN basically saying that our coverage of crime was an Instagram filter. I hope they Brian Stelter to the funerals and took pictures of the mourners and use the correct Instagram filter when they did it and maybe they got some good retweets out of it."

I will tell you that on Thursday, five people were shot at a hotel, one of them fatally in Washington, D.C. So, crime, violent crime is a major problem there as well. To today's event I will say that Jason Rivera's widow was correct when she said that the system failed him, because in a poignant sense, his death is not only the responsibility of his killer, by which I mean at least a small part of the blame here goes to the city and to its leadership. I'm someone who usually looks to policy solutions for the nation's biggest problems, but fixing the policy here is only a small part of the solution. You know, decriminalizing violent crime is a real part of the problem, but you're not going to fix this until you get at the anti-police sentiment that is running rampant across the country. I don't know how you do that, but it takes all of us, meaning all, everybody in America, all of us Americans standing together to try and combat it. I think it's a tall order, but I think that's where the focus should go when you talk about moving forward. We all need to get involved."

This widow's comments and her words and the energy and passion that she showed is going to be shown all across the state. To your point, to your point, Jesse. Those who willing to fund efforts to change communities, there should be an effort funded right now, let her words be the only words in the commercial to recall any D.A. that does not implement tough laws, any legislature that does not -- that does not reform bail reform. And let that be -- let those be the words to help energize, re-energize and rekindle to Gil Scott-Heron's comment about how we support police officers. I think every community in this city, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, all want to support and do support police officers. That -- that widow's comments should not only help do that, but you may get a little upset with me now, but two -- the gun that killed those two officers with the ghost gun from Philadelphia. We ought to figure out ways to enact smart gun laws, not only do we need bail reform. Not only do we need activists who want to reform police, police departments, we have to support our cops first before we can do any of this. And I hope those words today resonate not only with D.A. Bragg and the chief of police and the mayor of this town, but every D.A. in this country. And more importantly for those of us who want bail reform, every legislator in Albany. Legislator in Albany ought to have to listen to what this widow said today. No widow -- now woman should ever have to say those things. No wife or mom should ever have to say those things.

You do that, he won't, as a matter of fact, he'll have Republicans coming to his event if he is able to do this.

Politics is about solving people's problems, not advancing your own personal agenda. Not advancing your own personal brand of politics. Now if it all -- if it all collides and you're helping people and you're doing those things, that's one thing, but it's a little bothersome and a little tiring to hear a progressive or a moderate talk about the other as if somehow or another they have the monopoly on being right. Politics again, it's about solving problems Democrats or Republican alike. And if Democrats whomever is in the majority don't accomplish those things they'd generally get voted out. Now this is not something that just goes with Democrats, you see on the Republican side. Liz Cheney is trying to be kicked -- they're trying to kick her out of the party in Washington and in her own state. And even Adam Kinzinger they are trying to kick him out as well. And if you don't recognize these things as a party that's in power, you're going to lose power. So, Democrats, if this is what we want the power but to all this (Inaudible) and fighting here in the middle of a time in which our president is in the low 40s or high 30s, then we deserve to be defeated in November. If we're serious about having the majority, then behave like it. Pass things that are going to solve people's problems from the border to crime to inflation. Pass things that people want to see you work on. If you pass things that people don't want to see you work on, then you're likely going to you lose the majority. And that's the path we find ourselves on. I hope the president can rescue that from -- rescue us from that and I hope that Democrats in the House and the Senate, progressives and moderates alike learn how to work together."

And they're not afraid of him get it so he gets hospitalized. They're afraid of the talking point that is given to the people that are his opponents that are going to say, oh, well, he's vaxxed and boosted or oh, well, if he can get it, anybody can get it. How stupid is that? That's the reason why he's still in a basement strategy. The rest of the country is not in the basement strategy.
