      "sentences": "Hey, Tucker. Thank you. Great show. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up tonight. We have a ton of breaking news, and incredibly important issues to cover. I mean serious issues involving the rule of law, equal justice, equal application of our laws, our constitutional system. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, of course, we have more information about the Democratic Party that is completely imploding, their primary in utter disaster. Candidates are awful and terrible, and just trying to out-socialize each other. And, breaking tonight, Democrats are turning again to impeachment. That's how nuts they are. We'll explain all throughout the hour. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, we will show you the latest despicable, disgusting lies, the shameless pandering from former New York City, Michael Bloomberg, now trying to run away from his own words about minorities and tell us -- well, my own words don't mean anything, his long-held beliefs for 17 years. Really? It's frankly repulsive. It's a dishonest election year conversion for the history books. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And can you believe it? He's getting a free pass. Michael Bloomberg from the media mob and his fellow Democrats. Remember when the anti-Semitic members of Congress, they got a free pass from the mob and their fellow congressmen, people? Yes, more selective moral outrage as usual. And we'll have a lot more coming up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have a serious warning we begin with tonight. Please listen closely. You've got to understand right now, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican in the United States of America, you have every -- every single right to feel that you are not being treated fairly, that the justice -- that the justice issued in this country is not equally-applied, you have every right to feel that way, because it seems that in this United States, on this night, only conservatives, only Republicans, and especially people that like Donald Trump can get prosecuted, all while Democrats and the deep state can pretty much do everything without consequence, or if your last name happens to be Clinton. Let me explain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As we speak, Democrats have already begun what is their next dumb, psychotic, frankly insane, baseless witch hunt. They're actually now plotting yet another potential impeachment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Forget passing legislation. Forget improving the lives of the American people and serving the people that put them in office. No, petty Pelosi wants to round up another round of investigations over a tweet. A few days ago on Twitter, the president voiced his rightful outrage over what is an insane nine-year sentence that Roger Stone could receive because of process crimes. We will show you why that is so insane in a minute -- news and information you won't get from the hysterical media mob. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the president, he did not instruct the DOJ to reduce any sentence. No. He had no conversations with the attorney general as Attorney General Bill Barr confirmed today to ABC. In fact, the attorney general, he takes orders from no one. And, by the way, he shouldn't. He needs to remain independent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the president does have every right to be frustrated and we, as Americans, we need to be concerned tonight and we should also be frustrated about a lot of issues, a lot of unequal justice under the law, because we have an egregious nine-year sentence, Roger Stone. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, thankfully, the attorney general and the Department of Justice, they stepped in independently to amend what was a complete and total miscarriage of justice. And it gets worse. You have, for example, the corrupt compromise congenital while liar himself, Adam Schiff -- well, calling it a direct attack on the rule of law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I'll explain and education in a second, Congressman. You stand by. You need a little bit of a history lesson. You need to know how our justice system works a little bit better before you speak out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the other idiot Congressman Swalwell, who thought he was going to be president one day, said that impeachment is back on the table. This is insane. This is who they are and it doesn't stop there. Yes, Elizabeth Warren tweeting that Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless attorney general. No. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And former Obama attorney general -- yes, that guy that was held in contempt of Congress I think. That guy, Fast and Furious. Remember that guy? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yes, he said it endangers the fabric of our democracy. Actually, Eric Holder, you know what endangers the fabric of our democracy? Unequal justice under the law, unequal application of our laws, a dual justice system with politically motivated, abusively biased prosecutors, prosecutorial misconduct. All of these things, that is a real risk at this time in American history. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me remind everybody, you might not like to hear this. By the way, all you congress people that don't know the Constitution, pay close attention. The chief law enforcement officer in this country would be the president of the United States -- that's right, the president, who has not done so, by the way, who has not involved himself in these cases. He can absolutely, if he wanted to, tell the Department of Justice to start investigations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And a president also does not give up his or her rights to freedom of speech either. A president can tweet. A president can speak any time, any place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, let's go to where we are right now. Remember Roger Stone. First arrested. Another big predawn raid, 29 agents armed in full tactical gear. I don't blame the agents. They can't say no. But they were sent on a job to surround Stone's Florida home. Frogmen, armed and ready, apparently, he has water behind his house. And, by the way, CNN fake news reportedly tipped off. They were there to film it. Hmm, how convenient. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Stone was charged with nonviolent process crimes. Now, I'm sure he would have gladly turned himself in. All they had to do is call his lawyer and say, OK, we're going to have an arraignment at 9:00 tomorrow morning. He's got to be here at 7:30. If they give him an opportunity, by the way, as is customary with other nonviolent offenders in this country -- no, they wanted a show. He didn't even have an active passport. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, an army of stormed -- agents stormed into his house in the middle of the night because of orders from who? A team of Trump-hating bureaucrats, overzealous prosecutors, clearly abusing power, clearly wanting to send a message, clearly wanting to intimidate people in what is frankly a repulsive way. That is abusing power. And remember, the same exact thing happened to Paul Manafort. How convenient. Remember the armed agents? Predawn rain once again, putting a gun in his wife's face? He would have turned himself in also, like with everybody else with process crimes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Stone was ultimately convicted on seven counts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One count, obstruction of an official proceeding, aka, he lied to Congress. That's what they said. Five counts of making false statements to Congress, and one count of witness tampering. And, by the way, the witness defended Stone. He said, he's just a blowhard. I didn't take any of his comments seriously. When he heard that he might face jail time, he's wrote a letter to a judge, no, don't send him to jail for this. It's stupid. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But because of those process crimes, prosecutors recommended nine years behind bars for Roger Stone. Nine years. Now, here's what the media mob will never do. They will never help give you information to put that in perspective. We'll do it for them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As of 2018, the median time served for murder, guilty of murder, 13.4 years. Roger Stone is right there with that. He lied to Congress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The media time -- get this -- median time for rape, rape, sexual assault, 4.2 years, wow. Robbery, 3.2. Assault, 1.4. Now, prosecutors were originally recommending nine years for Roger Stone. For lying? What, you want the guy to die in jail? That's basically it. Now, you don't want him to ever see the light of day again as a free man. Now, do you understand why Attorney General Barr was frustrated? Now, do you understand why the president is rightly frustrated? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I'm frustrated. All of you should be frustrated, because what we have been telling you for three straight years -- well, these people are not being held accountable up until now. And it gets worse. We come to find out that the Stone case, look at this, the jury foreperson, a longtime Democratic activist, ran for Congress as a Democrat. She frequently tweeted horrible things about President Trump and his supporters. Apparently, they wiped that clean in the last 24 hours. She even tweeted, this is the jury foreperson, tweeted in support of the FBI's predawn raid at Roger Stone's house. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Earlier today, a spokesperson for Roger Stone told FOX News, quote: Mr. Stone and his defense team are diligently reviewing the newly reported information to determine any appropriate next steps. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, I don't trust that judge in that case, same one that Manafort had. It's clear the jury was tainted, and if justice is to exist in this country -- everyone pay attention to this -- this case needs to be thrown out immediately if we have justice in this country. You can't have a foreperson that is that prejudiced that is corrupt. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, by the way, the attorney general, he had done the right thing. He's under fire because, what, he looked at -- murderers only get 13.4 years, median time in jail. And, well, if you commit rape, only 4.2 years. Nine years for lying? The attorney general was right. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the attorney general, he said he will not be intimidated by the do- nothing Democrats in Congress. Here's what he said. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "And, by the way, so he shall. He's supposed to remain independent. He made it very clear tonight, he's staying independent. Now, this is as much ado about what -- this is more than a tainted jury. This is about a tainted and corrupt system that we have been showing you for three years. This is a system, as of tonight, where if you're a Republican and a conservative and you like Donald Trump, you get pre-dawn raids with CNN cameras up and ready, you get years in prison. And what about all these Democrats, deep state actors that are corrupt that get off scot-free? OK, Stone was convicted of lying, as corrupt as that jury appears to be. Well, you know who hasn't been charged with lying and we know they lied? Well, let's take a look at this extensive list we have here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Oh look at \"USA Today\", James Clapper's perjury and why D.C. made men don't get charged for lying to Congress. Wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } \"The Guardian\" pointing out, CIA Director John Brennan lied to you and to the Senate. Loretta Lynch, quote, lied during testimony about Hillary Clinton's investigation. That's \"The New York Post\". Eric Holder repeatedly lied to Congress about the Fast and Furious scandal. Lois Lerner lied to Congress about the IRS scandal. Cheryl Mills lied under oath about the Hillary Clinton issues. Huma Abedin made false statements to the FBI. Every time Andrew McCabe opened his mouth, he was lying. That's \"The Washington Times\". In fact, he was fired for lying, the FBI -- all of this is in the public, you can read it yourself, we put up the sources. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The inspector general found that, quote, he lacked candor in four separate cases. Lacking candor means he lied. Just like they accused Roger Stone of, and Paul Manafort of. And, of course, how could we ever forget super patriot Jim Comey lying to Congress about the timing of his decision to clear Hillary Clinton. Remember the timeline didn't add up. And, of course, so far, the people that seem to always get away with the most, committing numerous crimes as far as I'm concerned, associated with the mishandling of top-secret classified information on an illicit private server, that would be the Clintons, that would include the Espionage Act, 18 USC 793. And also, what about the campaign finance violation? Remember the money that -- for the dirty Russian dossier put together by a foreign national went to Perkins Coie, a law firm. They hired fusion GPS, an op research firm, and they paid Christopher Steele, the money for the dirty Russian dossier. It was then used later to spy on a president, transition team and presidency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Back to Comey, not only was he untruthful to Congress, but he also blatantly lied on FISA applications. We now know, so did McCabe, so did Rod Rosenstein, so did Yates, so did Boente. But remember, they signed off on an application says at the top of a FISA warrant application \"verified\". They swore the material was verified, true and accurate. And at the very same time, they had been all warned, all of them. The dossier, the very basis for the warrant, the bulk of information, was nothing more than salacious, unverified, campaign op research, bought and paid by Clinton, put together by a Trump hater by the name of Christopher Steele, that had an agenda. And that's not all, we know Comey was actually referred for prosecution by the inspector general for leaking highly sensitive government material. The inspector general found, quote: Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees and the many thousands more former FBI employees. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, despite these damning and unprecedented findings, Comey, well, he hasn't been charged with anything. No pre-dawn raid at Comey's house, no frogmen, no fake news CNN cameras either. And meanwhile, Paul Manafort, yes, he's rotting in jail for, let's see, not paying taxes, lying on bank loan applications. Roger Stone facing nine years, remember -- rape, median time in jail, 4.2 years. Wow, nine years for lying. Rape, 4.2 years. And, of course, we got Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. He lost his home. He couldn't afford to pay his lawyers anymore. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They actually made him plead guilty to lying after the people that interviewed him -- well, said, we don't think you're lying. And why did they do that? Because then they threatened to go after his son unless they made him lie when he said they didn't think he was lying. How sick is that? Now, if you go further, then you got George Papadopoulos. He's now a convicted felon because of a single count of line of the FBI. He spent time in jail, and countless other Trump campaign associates spied on, wiretapped, surveilled, generally stalked by the deep state, Comey's FBI henchmen, the president's campaign and transition team. Well, first, his candidacy, his own campaign, then transition team and deep into his presidency, he was illegally spied on. When are any of these people going to be held accountable? Here's the point -- this is serious because we're talking about a two- tiered system of justice. It has to be fixed. The frustration that I feel, the president feels, and I get the impression, I don't know because he's independent must remain independent, I do have faith in the attorney general, and I understand the attorney general saying that when the president talks about some of these cases, it makes his job harder, I understand that. The president I think feels like I do and many Americans do, all these people, they all get the books thrown at them. All these other people, they seem to always get away with it and nothing ever happens. That's how we feel, and I think we have a right to feel this way and unless we get this right I worry for the future of our country, because if not well you might as well rip up the U.S. Constitution, it would be meaningless that's how serious it is. I am hopeful that Durham and Barr, their probe, which is in progress, I hope we get to a quick conclusion here. I have faith in the attorney general and I have faith in prosecutor Durham. I have faith in the 99 percent of good honest brave men and women that served the FBI, the DOJ, and the intelligence community. The attorney -- the attorney general said the president, yes, is making his job harder -- I can understand why he says that, but I can understand the frustration because I feel it and so does every other American. When you look at the stark contrast here, it takes your breath away -- equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. The attorney general was clear: the president has not asked him to do anything and I'm certain the attorney general doesn't want any such appearance. I get it. The president tweets, if he's doing something, it might get in the way and people in the media mob that don't care about equal justice, they will take it out of context because that's what they always do. The double standard, the stench, it reeks to high heaven. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Only the president's people up to now been charged. Where are the indictments? When are they coming? When are we going to have to convene a grand jury? When are we going to show, we already know, we have all the evidence premeditated fraud on a FISA court, it happened. Lying to the FBI happened. Lying on FISA applications happened.

They are not used to -- certainly in his generation a politician, and certainly as Democrats -- are not used to actually running, to actually not having a next, to where you are not supposed to be ask these hard questions, because that way the people are kept kind of out about what is really about what is really going on. And I think, even the viewers of \"The View,\" certainly of the Internet, other programming, have become savvy enough to recognize the fraud that this is. That this really kind of laid out a template, in a way to come of how politicians like Joe Biden have gotten away with this kind of stuff for so long.

      "utterance": "Hey, Tucker. Thank you. Great show. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up tonight. We have a ton of breaking news, and incredibly important issues to cover. I mean serious issues involving the rule of law, equal justice, equal application of our laws, our constitutional system. And, of course, we have more information about the Democratic Party that is completely imploding, their primary in utter disaster. Candidates are awful and terrible, and just trying to out-socialize each other. And, breaking tonight, Democrats are turning again to impeachment. That's how nuts they are. We'll explain all throughout the hour. Plus, we will show you the latest despicable, disgusting lies, the shameless pandering from former New York City, Michael Bloomberg, now trying to run away from his own words about minorities and tell us -- well, my own words don't mean anything, his long-held beliefs for 17 years. Really? It's frankly repulsive. It's a dishonest election year conversion for the history books. And can you believe it? He's getting a free pass. Michael Bloomberg from the media mob and his fellow Democrats. Remember when the anti-Semitic members of Congress, they got a free pass from the mob and their fellow congressmen, people? Yes, more selective moral outrage as usual. And we'll have a lot more coming up. We have a serious warning we begin with tonight. Please listen closely. You've got to understand right now, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican in the United States of America, you have every -- every single right to feel that you are not being treated fairly, that the justice -- that the justice issued in this country is not equally-applied, you have every right to feel that way, because it seems that in this United States, on this night, only conservatives, only Republicans, and especially people that like Donald Trump can get prosecuted, all while Democrats and the deep state can pretty much do everything without consequence, or if your last name happens to be Clinton. Let me explain. As we speak, Democrats have already begun what is their next dumb, psychotic, frankly insane, baseless witch hunt. They're actually now plotting yet another potential impeachment. Forget passing legislation. Forget improving the lives of the American people and serving the people that put them in office. No, petty Pelosi wants to round up another round of investigations over a tweet. A few days ago on Twitter, the president voiced his rightful outrage over what is an insane nine-year sentence that Roger Stone could receive because of process crimes. We will show you why that is so insane in a minute -- news and information you won't get from the hysterical media mob. Now, the president, he did not instruct the DOJ to reduce any sentence. No. He had no conversations with the attorney general as Attorney General Bill Barr confirmed today to ABC. In fact, the attorney general, he takes orders from no one. And, by the way, he shouldn't. He needs to remain independent. But the president does have every right to be frustrated and we, as Americans, we need to be concerned tonight and we should also be frustrated about a lot of issues, a lot of unequal justice under the law, because we have an egregious nine-year sentence, Roger Stone. Well, thankfully, the attorney general and the Department of Justice, they stepped in independently to amend what was a complete and total miscarriage of justice. And it gets worse. You have, for example, the corrupt compromise congenital while liar himself, Adam Schiff -- well, calling it a direct attack on the rule of law. I'll explain and education in a second, Congressman. You stand by. You need a little bit of a history lesson. You need to know how our justice system works a little bit better before you speak out. And the other idiot Congressman Swalwell, who thought he was going to be president one day, said that impeachment is back on the table. This is insane. This is who they are and it doesn't stop there. Yes, Elizabeth Warren tweeting that Congress must act immediately to rein in our lawless attorney general. No. And former Obama attorney general -- yes, that guy that was held in contempt of Congress I think. That guy, Fast and Furious. Remember that guy? Yes, he said it endangers the fabric of our democracy. Actually, Eric Holder, you know what endangers the fabric of our democracy? Unequal justice under the law, unequal application of our laws, a dual justice system with politically motivated, abusively biased prosecutors, prosecutorial misconduct. All of these things, that is a real risk at this time in American history. Let me remind everybody, you might not like to hear this. By the way, all you congress people that don't know the Constitution, pay close attention. The chief law enforcement officer in this country would be the president of the United States -- that's right, the president, who has not done so, by the way, who has not involved himself in these cases. He can absolutely, if he wanted to, tell the Department of Justice to start investigations. And a president also does not give up his or her rights to freedom of speech either. A president can tweet. A president can speak any time, any place. And, by the way, let's go to where we are right now. Remember Roger Stone. First arrested. Another big predawn raid, 29 agents armed in full tactical gear. I don't blame the agents. They can't say no. But they were sent on a job to surround Stone's Florida home. Frogmen, armed and ready, apparently, he has water behind his house. And, by the way, CNN fake news reportedly tipped off. They were there to film it. Hmm, how convenient. Stone was charged with nonviolent process crimes. Now, I'm sure he would have gladly turned himself in. All they had to do is call his lawyer and say, OK, we're going to have an arraignment at 9:00 tomorrow morning. He's got to be here at 7:30. If they give him an opportunity, by the way, as is customary with other nonviolent offenders in this country -- no, they wanted a show. He didn't even have an active passport. And, by the way, an army of stormed -- agents stormed into his house in the middle of the night because of orders from who? A team of Trump-hating bureaucrats, overzealous prosecutors, clearly abusing power, clearly wanting to send a message, clearly wanting to intimidate people in what is frankly a repulsive way. That is abusing power. And remember, the same exact thing happened to Paul Manafort. How convenient. Remember the armed agents? Predawn rain once again, putting a gun in his wife's face? He would have turned himself in also, like with everybody else with process crimes. Now, Stone was ultimately convicted on seven counts. One count, obstruction of an official proceeding, aka, he lied to Congress. That's what they said. Five counts of making false statements to Congress, and one count of witness tampering. And, by the way, the witness defended Stone. He said, he's just a blowhard. I didn't take any of his comments seriously. When he heard that he might face jail time, he's wrote a letter to a judge, no, don't send him to jail for this. It's stupid. But because of those process crimes, prosecutors recommended nine years behind bars for Roger Stone. Nine years. Now, here's what the media mob will never do. They will never help give you information to put that in perspective. We'll do it for them. As of 2018, the median time served for murder, guilty of murder, 13.4 years. Roger Stone is right there with that. He lied to Congress. The media time -- get this -- median time for rape, rape, sexual assault, 4.2 years, wow. Robbery, 3.2. Assault, 1.4. Now, prosecutors were originally recommending nine years for Roger Stone. For lying? What, you want the guy to die in jail? That's basically it. Now, you don't want him to ever see the light of day again as a free man. Now, do you understand why Attorney General Barr was frustrated? Now, do you understand why the president is rightly frustrated? I'm frustrated. All of you should be frustrated, because what we have been telling you for three straight years -- well, these people are not being held accountable up until now. And it gets worse. We come to find out that the Stone case, look at this, the jury foreperson, a longtime Democratic activist, ran for Congress as a Democrat. She frequently tweeted horrible things about President Trump and his supporters. Apparently, they wiped that clean in the last 24 hours. She even tweeted, this is the jury foreperson, tweeted in support of the FBI's predawn raid at Roger Stone's house."

You can't have a foreperson that is that prejudiced that is corrupt. And tonight, by the way, the attorney general, he had done the right thing. He's under fire because, what, he looked at -- murderers only get 13.4 years, median time in jail. And, well, if you commit rape, only 4.2 years. Nine years for lying? The attorney general was right.

Now, this is as much ado about what -- this is more than a tainted jury. This is about a tainted and corrupt system that we have been showing you for three years. This is a system, as of tonight, where if you're a Republican and a conservative and you like Donald Trump, you get pre-dawn raids with CNN cameras up and ready, you get years in prison. And what about all these Democrats, deep state actors that are corrupt that get off scot-free? OK, Stone was convicted of lying, as corrupt as that jury appears to be. Well, you know who hasn't been charged with lying and we know they lied? Well, let's take a look at this extensive list we have here. Oh look at \"USA Today\", James Clapper's perjury and why D.C. made men don't get charged for lying to Congress. Wow. \"The Guardian\" pointing out, CIA Director John Brennan lied to you and to the Senate. Loretta Lynch, quote, lied during testimony about Hillary Clinton's investigation. That's \"The New York Post\". Eric Holder repeatedly lied to Congress about the Fast and Furious scandal. Lois Lerner lied to Congress about the IRS scandal. Cheryl Mills lied under oath about the Hillary Clinton issues. Huma Abedin made false statements to the FBI. Every time Andrew McCabe opened his mouth, he was lying. That's \"The Washington Times\". In fact, he was fired for lying, the FBI -- all of this is in the public, you can read it yourself, we put up the sources. The inspector general found that, quote, he lacked candor in four separate cases. Lacking candor means he lied. Just like they accused Roger Stone of, and Paul Manafort of. And, of course, how could we ever forget super patriot Jim Comey lying to Congress about the timing of his decision to clear Hillary Clinton. Remember the timeline didn't add up. And, of course, so far, the people that seem to always get away with the most, committing numerous crimes as far as I'm concerned, associated with the mishandling of top-secret classified information on an illicit private server, that would be the Clintons, that would include the Espionage Act, 18 USC 793. And also, what about the campaign finance violation? Remember the money that -- for the dirty Russian dossier put together by a foreign national went to Perkins Coie, a law firm. They hired fusion GPS, an op research firm, and they paid Christopher Steele, the money for the dirty Russian dossier. It was then used later to spy on a president, transition team and presidency. Back to Comey, not only was he untruthful to Congress, but he also blatantly lied on FISA applications. We now know, so did McCabe, so did Rod Rosenstein, so did Yates, so did Boente. But remember, they signed off on an application says at the top of a FISA warrant application \"verified\". They swore the material was verified, true and accurate. And at the very same time, they had been all warned, all of them. The dossier, the very basis for the warrant, the bulk of information, was nothing more than salacious, unverified, campaign op research, bought and paid by Clinton, put together by a Trump hater by the name of Christopher Steele, that had an agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And that's not all, we know Comey was actually referred for prosecution by the inspector general for leaking highly sensitive government material. The inspector general found, quote",
      "utterance": "Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees and the many thousands more former FBI employees. Now, despite these damning and unprecedented findings, Comey, well, he hasn't been charged with anything. No pre-dawn raid at Comey's house, no frogmen, no fake news CNN cameras either. And meanwhile, Paul Manafort, yes, he's rotting in jail for, let's see, not paying taxes, lying on bank loan applications. Roger Stone facing nine years, remember -- rape, median time in jail, 4.2 years. Wow, nine years for lying. Rape, 4.2 years. And, of course, we got Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. He lost his home. He couldn't afford to pay his lawyers anymore. They actually made him plead guilty to lying after the people that interviewed him -- well, said, we don't think you're lying. And why did they do that? Because then they threatened to go after his son unless they made him lie when he said they didn't think he was lying. How sick is that? Now, if you go further, then you got George Papadopoulos. He's now a convicted felon because of a single count of line of the FBI. He spent time in jail, and countless other Trump campaign associates spied on, wiretapped, surveilled, generally stalked by the deep state, Comey's FBI henchmen, the president's campaign and transition team. Well, first, his candidacy, his own campaign, then transition team and deep into his presidency, he was illegally spied on. When are any of these people going to be held accountable? Here's the point -- this is serious because we're talking about a two- tiered system of justice. It has to be fixed. The frustration that I feel, the president feels, and I get the impression, I don't know because he's independent must remain independent, I do have faith in the attorney general, and I understand the attorney general saying that when the president talks about some of these cases, it makes his job harder, I understand that. The president I think feels like I do and many Americans do, all these people, they all get the books thrown at them. All these other people, they seem to always get away with it and nothing ever happens. That's how we feel, and I think we have a right to feel this way and unless we get this right I worry for the future of our country, because if not well you might as well rip up the U.S. Constitution, it would be meaningless that's how serious it is. I am hopeful that Durham and Barr, their probe, which is in progress, I hope we get to a quick conclusion here. I have faith in the attorney general and I have faith in prosecutor Durham. I have faith in the 99 percent of good honest brave men and women that served the FBI, the DOJ, and the intelligence community. The attorney -- the attorney general said the president, yes, is making his job harder -- I can understand why he says that, but I can understand the frustration because I feel it and so does every other American. When you look at the stark contrast here, it takes your breath away -- equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws."

The double standard, the stench, it reeks to high heaven. Only the president's people up to now been charged. Where are the indictments? When are they coming? When are we going to have to convene a grand jury? When are we going to show, we already know, we have all the evidence premeditated fraud on a FISA court, it happened. Lying to the FBI happened. Lying on FISA applications happened. The Espionage Act was violated. Hillary obstructed by deleting those subpoenaed emails, using Bleach Bit and hammers. Again, it's about the Constitution of the United States, which is the foundation of all our laws. Otherwise, it's meaningless. We got to hold these people accountable, those that abused power, broke the law and were corrupt and lied. It's time to clean house, restore what are important principles of justice. All right. Joining us now House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Now, I understand the attorney general got in this late. He has to clean up a big mess here. There's certain information that we already do know -- we know that many of these people lied. We know many of these people lied but only the president's friends have been -- or supporters have been prosecuted. They want to put Stone in jail for nine years when the median time spent in jail for a rapist is 4.2 years?

That is what the Democrats only look at, because they don't just hate the president, they hate you, they hate me, they hate the viewers. They hate everything about us. And listen to what you just put up earlier, Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, this is -- all they know is impeachment. If they had spent any time with this attorney general, he has highest character I've ever been around. He is very independent. If you ever talked to him about any issue, I've never known a man more independent than him. You know what he came forward with, that they already made their decision before the president ever put out his opinion. You know about the president? He gives his opinion to the American public because he's more open and more transparent than any president that we had before. But none of this is going to stop.

And it is making some Democrats nervous, including James Carville, who Bernie criticized as a political hack. Carville isn't backing down, saying, quote: At least I'm not a communist. Ouch. Well, joining us with this edition, we call it \"Rove's Whiteboard\", the architect, FOX News contributor, Karl Rove. All right. What's on the whiteboard? What do we got tonight? What did you bring?"

      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, well, I brought two, because they wanted me to bring three. But I'm sorry, all I could bring is two. Let's think about is this, Sean. Delegates chosen by -- through March 3rd are going to represent 40 percent of the total at the Democratic Convention. And After March 3rd, are going to be 60 percent. Right now, we got, everybody sort of tight, we got two -- only two primaries, and one caucus, one primary behind us. But it's, you know, 22 for Bernie, and -- excuse me, 22-22, and then three others behind. But nobody is breaking -- both Buttigieg and Bernie are about 32 percent of the delegates selected so far. Let's assume by the end of March 3rd, and remember, Mike Bloomberg's put his spade on March 3rd. He's going to get a bunch of delegates. Let's assume somebody does have 35 percent of the delegates as of the end of March 3rd, that means they got 14 of the points necessary to get 50, being the majority at the convention. That would mean that they would need to get a remaining 60 percent of delegates. They need to win 60 percent of those to get 36 percent of the total delegates and get themselves to 50, as of -- as of the opening day in Milwaukee. That looks like it's going to be awful hard to do given how scrambled this field is."

    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "I'm not certain for sure, because it could be that, you know, somebody on March 3rd breaks through, and thereafter, they just simply start rolling it up and someone tosses in their cards at the end of April or early May. And so, the final primaries are essentially, you know, coronations."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "But if everybody stays in the fight, and look, Bernie is going to stay in the fight, because he's got the resources and enthusiasm. Bloomberg is going to stay in the fight, because he's got the money, let's see if he's got the enthusiasm. And somebody else might be able to stay in the race after the 3rd of March, provided they do well on March 3rd in a surprising way. But on March 3rd, we're going to have probably five candidates get votes, because Amy Klobuchar, she is not going to be the Democratic nominee in all likelihood, but Minnesota votes on the 3rd of March, so does Massachusetts, home state of Elizabeth Warren. And then you got Buttigieg and Sanders competing, and maybe Biden is back in the race by that day, if he wins South Carolina. But if you're splitting everybody up on March 3rd, between four candidates, that means we are going to have at least six candidates with delegates at the time of the Republican National -- Democratic National Convention, and getting that 60 percent out of the 60 percent of delegates left to get there, that's a high -- that's a real high bar."

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, absolutely. And, you know, I don't know where that came from, but I know that one of the beneficiaries is Joe Biden, who's hoping that he keeps the moderate lane in South Carolina, and the reminder of his comments is not going to be very -- it's not going to go down well with the majority of voters in South Carolina Democratic primary, who are African- American."

And, also, the host of \"Laura Logan Has No Agenda\", foxnation.com also, Lara Logan. All right. Lara, OK, let's begin with you. Please, Joe, can we help you? Here is a lifeline, Joe. We need you, Joe. Please? I say, I'm all for Joe. They can have Joe.

For organizations like ABC, who pride themselves on being objective, on being truth tellers, you know, on just providing the facts, showing both sides, they rarely -- they really can't claim that ground if they don't show both sides, and if they don't push back and if they don't really, you know, do their jobs and present other points of view and challenge the person they are interviewing. And this wasn't -- you know, this was a somewhat painful interview to watch, really, and I say that on a really compassionate, human level, right, because it's just so obvious that -- you know, that Biden is not where he needs to be right now on every level."

      "utterance": "Well, but see, they're not interested in that. And, you know, look, \"The Daily Beast\" had a headline on this, and they're not exactly, you know, right-leaning or conservative, saying that Joe Biden bombed on this program. So, there he has this friendly environment meant to lift him up. That is clearly a given. And he fails even in that environment. At one point, he expressed being confused and shocked that other candidates and people and other reporters, effectively, I guess, were asking about his record and the record of other people running, because you see, this is what's new. They are not used to -- certainly in his generation a politician, and certainly as Democrats -- are not used to actually running, to actually not having a next, to where you are not supposed to be ask these hard questions, because that way the people are kept kind of out about what is really about what is really going on. And I think, even the viewers of \"The View,\" certainly of the Internet, other programming, have become savvy enough to recognize the fraud that this is. That this really kind of laid out a template, in a way to come of how politicians like Joe Biden have gotten away with this kind of stuff for so long. And as you noted, look, Hunter is a 50-year-old man. This also speaks to our concern about, how do you go into public service and become filthy rich? And we've been wondering that, as the American people. That's why the story matters. That's why Hunter Biden matters. It's why Chelsea Clinton matters, as an adult woman, not as minor children, as they begin to play within the money that seems to be coming forth when you're a politician like Joe Biden. Americans care about that. It matters to us because it speaks to corruption and the nature of what government has become. And that's why we're in reformation we're in right now."

So if Hunter Biden is off the table, then Ivanka Trump and Don Jr. and all the others, then they're off the table, too.
