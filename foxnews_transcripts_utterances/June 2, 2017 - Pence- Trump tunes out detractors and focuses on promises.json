Now, later in the program, we're going to tell you who Kathy's actually blaming, playing the victim and who she thinks is trying to take her down. If it wasn't so downright pathetic, it's actually funny. And it's kind of insane, actually. But first, for decades both on radio and television, I have stood up for the fundamental principle of freedom of speech. And by the way, that goes for people I completely disagree with. Last night, I played you multiple examples going back many, many years of me defending people even like Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert, and they have said horrific things on their programs. I have simply told you, my viewers, if you don't like what they're saying, all right, hit the on/off button or change the channel. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I feel that way about Kathy Griffin. I think what she did is beyond offensive. It's despicable. It's disgusting. But this week, when she came under scrutiny, I never called for her to be fired or do I want people not to attend her show or boycotting her. And by the way, just one side note. It is kind of pathetic her so-called friend, co-host, Anderson Cooper over at CNN -- how weak, pathetic, disloyal -- he couldn't even stand up for his friend? Well, Anderson, you need to grow a spine. Now, in fact, I did just the opposite. Now, I don't like Kathy Griffin. She's not my cup of tea. But you know what? Kathy Griffin's being a hypocrite. You know, so she goes to this press conference today, shedding crocodile tears and calling on people to respect freedom of speech. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But here's the point. Has she ever stood up for a single conservative when they come under fire from the left? You know what? When they say things she disagrees with, has she ever said a word? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this week, liberal fascists -- well, they tried to take me off the air, silence my voice, get me fired. And so many of you have helped me out and come to my defense, and I thank you for that very much. Did Kathy Griffin? She ever speak out in my defense and say I had a right to voice my opinion? Not that I know of, not a peep. Now, in fact, we could not find and we looked really hard for a single example of Kathy Griffin ever standing up for a conservative voice that was under attack by the left. Now, this is the liberal double standard that we're talking about tonight. And we want to give you another example to help prove our point. Now, yesterday, President Trump -- he made the decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement -- by the way, a huge win for business, for people out of work, for workers, people in the energy sector, a huge win for America. And the commander-in-chief -- well, he showed true leadership. He fulfilled another campaign promise. And President Trump showed once again he's putting America first. Otherwise, we'd lose three million jobs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we're going to have more on that later in the program with Larry Elder, but first let's take a look how Democrats -- you know, these people in Hollywood, Learjet liberals, members of the destroy Trump media -- how they reacted. For example, Hollywood hypocrite liberal Michael Moore tweeted, \"Trump just committed a crime against humanity. Now, this admitted predator has now expanded his predatory acts to the entire planet,\" and then the hashtag Paris accord. He also went on to tweet, \"USA to earth, FU!\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Or how about this tweet from Bette Midler. Quote, \"There has never been in U.S. history been such a destructive megalomaniac in the White House. Thank you to the U.S. press and other numbskulls who put him there.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it wasn't just celebrities who are out there raging, I mean raging against the president. Now, we want to show you a cartoon that was published today in The Washington Post. Now, be warned. This cartoon is graphic and disturbing, like so many other things liberal put out there, showing the president sitting on the toilet. Pretty unbelievable, Washington Post -- really? A newspaper? Now, the media is also publishing headlines like this from The New York Daily News, \"Trump to the world, drop dead.\" Or this from a page from a German tabloid telling Trump to \"F\" you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, of course, there's the destroy Trump media. You got to watch this completely unhinged abusively biased rigidly left ideological coverage. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

A third of them did have an opinion, but they didn't express an opinion as to the degree of manmade activity, what to do about it, let alone whether to spend trillions of dollars, which is what this Paris agreement would have required. And remember when Al Gore goes over to Japan and he negotiated the Kyoto Accord? The Senate passed a resolution 95 to nothing they were not going to ratify this if that treaty excluded China and India, big polluters. Fast forward, the Paris accord gives a very easy pass to China and to India, big polluters. So it's dead on arrival, which is why Obama never submitted it to the Senate in the first place.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Freedom of speech is under attack! It is now open season on conservative voices all across the country! Michelle Malkin, Lou Dobbs, Larry Elder, Corey Lewandowski, Dr. Gina Loudon will all join us with reaction tonight. Now, also, we'll have tonight part two of my interview with the vice president, Mike Pence. How does he govern while all the media talks about is Russia, Russia? Also, comedian Kathy Griffin back in the public eye just days after this vicious, vile anti-Trump photo shoot went public cost her jobs. Now she's making a plea for 1st Amendment rights? Well, nobody's taking them away from her. The latest example of the left's free speech double standard, and we will explain this very important issue in tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, Kathy Griffin earlier this week on social media -- she did apologize for posing like an ISIS fighter with a mock bloody severed head that looks like President Trump. Now, today, the disgraced comedian held a press conference with her lawyers, where she made an impassioned plea for her constitutional rights, which nobody's tried to take away. Watch this."

The idea that this -- you know, many people think of this tragedy, have been touched by this tragedy, is horrifying and it's horrible. But I just wanted to say, you know, if you don't stand up, you get run over, and what's happening to me has never happened ever in the history of this great country. This is America, and you shouldn't have to die for it. The death threats that I'm getting are constant and they are detailed and they're serious and they're specific. And today, it's me. And tomorrow, it could be you. I believe so passionately about this, if I don't stand up and say this, I'm afraid there's going to be some 12-year-old nerdy girl like me in Forest Park, Illinois, who's going to maybe be watching me to see what I do. I've made fun of W! I made fun of Clinton. Oh, God, remember the Monica dress days? Those were the days! You could make dress jokes all day long, and nobody tried to kill you! You shouldn't have to die for this!"

      "utterance": "All right, that was only small part of her press congressman. Now, later in the program, we're going to tell you who Kathy's actually blaming, playing the victim and who she thinks is trying to take her down. If it wasn't so downright pathetic, it's actually funny. And it's kind of insane, actually. But first, for decades both on radio and television, I have stood up for the fundamental principle of freedom of speech. And by the way, that goes for people I completely disagree with. Last night, I played you multiple examples going back many, many years of me defending people even like Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert, and they have said horrific things on their programs. I have simply told you, my viewers, if you don't like what they're saying, all right, hit the on/off button or change the channel. Now, I feel that way about Kathy Griffin. I think what she did is beyond offensive. It's despicable. It's disgusting. But this week, when she came under scrutiny, I never called for her to be fired or do I want people not to attend her show or boycotting her. And by the way, just one side note. It is kind of pathetic her so-called friend, co-host, Anderson Cooper over at CNN -- how weak, pathetic, disloyal -- he couldn't even stand up for his friend? Well, Anderson, you need to grow a spine. Now, in fact, I did just the opposite. Now, I don't like Kathy Griffin. She's not my cup of tea. But you know what? Kathy Griffin's being a hypocrite. You know, so she goes to this press conference today, shedding crocodile tears and calling on people to respect freedom of speech. But here's the point. Has she ever stood up for a single conservative when they come under fire from the left? You know what? When they say things she disagrees with, has she ever said a word? Now, this week, liberal fascists -- well, they tried to take me off the air, silence my voice, get me fired. And so many of you have helped me out and come to my defense, and I thank you for that very much. Did Kathy Griffin? She ever speak out in my defense and say I had a right to voice my opinion? Not that I know of, not a peep. Now, in fact, we could not find and we looked really hard for a single example of Kathy Griffin ever standing up for a conservative voice that was under attack by the left. Now, this is the liberal double standard that we're talking about tonight. And we want to give you another example to help prove our point. Now, yesterday, President Trump -- he made the decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement -- by the way, a huge win for business, for people out of work, for workers, people in the energy sector, a huge win for America. And the commander-in-chief -- well, he showed true leadership. He fulfilled another campaign promise. And President Trump showed once again he's putting America first. Otherwise, we'd lose three million jobs. Now, we're going to have more on that later in the program with Larry Elder, but first let's take a look how Democrats -- you know, these people in Hollywood, Learjet liberals, members of the destroy Trump media -- how they reacted. For example, Hollywood hypocrite liberal Michael Moore tweeted, \"Trump just committed a crime against humanity. Now, this admitted predator has now expanded his predatory acts to the entire planet,\" and then the hashtag Paris accord. He also went on to tweet, \"USA to earth, FU!\" Or how about this tweet from Bette Midler. Quote, \"There has never been in U.S. history been such a destructive megalomaniac in the White House. Thank you to the U.S. press and other numbskulls who put him there.\" But it wasn't just celebrities who are out there raging, I mean raging against the president. Now, we want to show you a cartoon that was published today in The Washington Post. Now, be warned. This cartoon is graphic and disturbing, like so many other things liberal put out there, showing the president sitting on the toilet. Pretty unbelievable, Washington Post -- really? A newspaper? Now, the media is also publishing headlines like this from The New York Daily News, \"Trump to the world, drop dead.\" Or this from a page from a German tabloid telling Trump to \"F\" you. And then, of course, there's the destroy Trump media. You got to watch this completely unhinged abusively biased rigidly left ideological coverage. Take a look."

Where's the Clinton-Soros group that's been trying to get me fired now? Funny! They haven't said a word about those disgusting remarks or the abusively biased coverage on the left. On this program, by the way, no matter how ridiculous the left becomes, I'm always going to stick up for their right to spew their stupidity. We'll just point it out. Now, as we have seen over and over again, whether it's Kathy Griffin and her pleas for freedom of speech or Nancy Pelosi's constant defense of civil liberties, you know what? The left liberal in this country, they're such hypocrites. They always seem to be silent when any conservative comes under attack, not a peep! And by the way, that goes for some of my colleagues, liberals on cable television. They never spoke out in favor of Sean Hannity not being boycotted all in an attempt to silence me and get me fired. Now, that is the left's dangerous free speech double standard, and it is now more obvious than it's ever been.

But where are the honest, good faith liberals, all of the fair weather friends of free speech, to talk about and to use their own free speech to say, This is where we draw the line. We do not accept this? And you know, I've covered this. You know, part of the reason why I was chuckling was I wrote a book called \"Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild,\" 11 years ago! I had an entire chapter on assassination fascination and the left's sick fetish of using politically violent images to try and demonize and marginalize conservatives. And this is where the danger comes in because they, as a rule, as an ideological tool, have tried to criminalize conservative political dissent. That's what they've done to us! Look at, you know, the entire years of the Bush years or look even during the Obama years, when they went after Sarah Palin for using an innocuous target sign, to blame every last act of random violence on right-wing conservatives!

That came from a researcher who looked at thousands of climate papers, peer reviewed papers, two-thirds of which gave no opinion whatsoever about the extent to which they believe that man created climate change. A third of them did have an opinion, but they didn't express an opinion as to the degree of manmade activity, what to do about it, let alone whether to spend trillions of dollars, which is what this Paris agreement would have required. And remember when Al Gore goes over to Japan and he negotiated the Kyoto Accord? The Senate passed a resolution 95 to nothing they were not going to ratify this if that treaty excluded China and India, big polluters. Fast forward, the Paris accord gives a very easy pass to China and to India, big polluters. So it's dead on arrival, which is why Obama never submitted it to the Senate in the first place. So for all these people that are yelling and screaming about how there's this consensus and that most people in this country are concerned about it, it's nonsense. Look at the polls. Most people are concerned about jobs, jobs, and jobs. And this is a job killer. And I salute Donald Trump for fulfilling yet another campaign promise."

She wants to continue to campaign and raise money in California and Massachusetts and Vermont. Good for her. That's not how you win an election. She can blame everybody she wants. The bottom line is her friend, her president, Barack Obama, oversaw the Democratic National Committee for eight years, raised enormous amounts of money. She inherited what was supposed to be an amazing operation. Just think back four years ago. They blamed the Orca program which was Mitt Romney's data program as a complete failure.

Everybody knows it is impossible to actually diagnose someone -- speaking of Hillary, not Corey, of course -- everyone know it's impossible to diagnoses someone without seeing them clinically, Sean. But this is the same person who called her own party easily manipulated and stupid. And this is a sign of a narcissist and they tend to blame externally those closest to them.

We've never seen anything like -- Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, twenty-four-seven cable news now. And yet we're told there's no evidence at all of any collusion.

President Trump is one of the most resilient and determined people I've ever met in my life. I mean, he literally gets up every day facing a gale force wind of negative coverage in the mainstream press. And he just rolls his sleeves up and goes to work for the American people. I think the decision on the Paris Climate Agreement, the progress we've made rolling back an avalanche of regulation from the last administration, progress we're making to repeal and replace ObamaCare, the way he's reengaged the world to have our allies begin to live up to their commitments in our common security, all give evidence of the fact that while his detractors in the media will continue to come straight at this administration every single day, the president's focus, I can assure you, is on the American people, on their future, on their challenges, on their opportunities. And that's where it's going to stay."

But I want to stay on Clapper and Comey and Brennan and Admiral Rogers and even Maxine Waters, Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin have all said, even recently, no evidence at all to date Russia collusion. I guess the question is, when you see such breathless coverage every day, you know, I know the president is not shy about battling back against the media. I think that's probably his strongest quality is he fights for what he believes in, but it has got to get tiresome in there at some time."

I mean, whether it be the attacks on his family, which this week were just deplorable in some instances, and I think, you know, denounced by people across the political spectrum properly, or whether it's just the day-in, day-out drumbeat of the media chasing after whatever Washington, D.C., is talking about, this is a president who knows that this economy has been burdened under the weight of high taxes, regulations that have been stifling --"

Congress takes so many days off, it's unfathomable to me. That's my own personal -- I don't live my life that way. But my point is there's only 30-some-odd days on the legislative calendar. And you've got to finish with health care in the Senate, and in conference, and get it to the president's desk. You've got to get his economic plan, I would argue, this year. I know he has taken the regulatory steps towards energy independence. I think that's key. And I think that by the end of this year Americans are going to want to see part of that wall built.

And I see the sides moving closer to coming together with a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. I'll also tell you in House of Representatives, Sean, there's very detailed discussions on what could well be one of the largest tax cuts in American history. We're also looking at rolling back the onerous burden that Dodd- Frank placed on community banks around the country, drying up capital for small businesses to be able to grow. And the president's committed to an infrastructure bill. His number is $1 trillion to rebuild America's infrastructure so it will be the best in the world.
