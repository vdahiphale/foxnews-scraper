At the same time Sarah Sanders from the podium today couldn't point to any specific facts or issues inside that New York's Times piece that she had a problem with, in part from the president's lawyer. There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. This is Charles Harder quoted in the story. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate. Of course, the line between aggressive yet legal tax strategy and tax fraud and evasion are often a murky one and in the end, are decided by either a civil or criminal court. The undisputed fact is that Fred Trump, the president's father was a highly successful real estate investor, developer, and builder making a fortune in the boroughs of New York from the 1940s on. The New York Times raises questions about how Fred's fortune made its way to the now president without paying full freight on the inheritance tax. Some of the dozens of things laid out included by the -- by the age of three, Donald Trump earned a $200,000 a year salary from his father. By college graduation, that number went up fivefold. He received $5 million a year from his father into his 40s and 50s. The famed $1 million loan from his father then-candidate Trump talked about on the campaign trail was actually multiple loans over decades totaling $140 million in today's dollars. It also lists the use of allegedly fraudulent billing practices and other questionable accounting methods to transfer assets from Fred to his children. If true and again the White House has not taken issue with any of the specific facts of the New York Times laid out, it destroys the president's narrative that is a self-made billionaire real estate mogul. That is a question of public perception. Bill de Blasio, the Mayor of New York weighing in on the legal question saying that the city of New York is looking to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of the city of New York period. That for the legal question for the states of New York and the city courts there to figure out. So it is entirely possible that the story that the New York Times printed is factually correct and that the White House is correct that the president, Martha, didn't engage in any illegal behavior of tax evasion or tax fraud, a question for the courts.",

I mean, the fact is that there are a bunch of Senators who are sitting on the fence, and any excuse for them to vote against Kavanaugh is a mistake. So, the president -- you know, going out and doing this rally, obviously provides fodder for people on both sides of the aisle who want to avoid making the hard choice about Kavanaugh, and instead, just hope to dump on the president. So, I'm not sure that is politically smart by the president. I am also not a big fan of him ripping into Ford personally. But, is he correct that they're a bunch of holes in Ford's story yet?

The idea that certain rules should not apply to people on the basis of their genetics is -- that's obviously discrimination of the highest order. But this is the world in which we now live in which white men are presumed guilty because they are white men. Because they're supposedly in a position of privilege. I wasn't aware that Brett Kavanaugh forfeited his presumption of innocence or due process of law simply because of the color of his skin or the nature of his genetics."

And now, you've got Brett Kavanaugh in this unique position which I guarantee he never thought he would be in. Where he's kind of -- you know raising the flag for white men and saying that they like everyone else need to be treated on an individual basis on the facts that support them or the fact that go against them in every case."

And I think even in the end, you're going to have people who feel unsatisfied by the amount of information that they had to base their decision on. But for each individual, aren't they deciding in their mind whether or not they think he was guilty or innocent?"

Well, that basically rules out anyone who's ever going to have a job on the federal level because it's not hard to raise questions about people. The question is how we resolve those questions. This is not merely a job interview right now. This is a man who's been accused of attempted rape when he was 17 years old. If this goes the wrong way, it's not just that he doesn't end up on the Supreme Court. He probably loses his seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He probably never works again, and his family is destroyed. So, the Democrats have decided to play it this way. They have the opposition before, now they're just trying to ratchet it up obviously."

We'll see if he's right or not because that's really what it comes down to. I think, that there are a couple of red states, blue Senators who like Manchin, who are in trouble and may need to vote in favor of Kavanaugh if the FBI report comes back as clean as it's probably expected to.

From the looks of it, two Democratic swing votes in the Senate, Claire McCaskill, and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota could suffer among women if they vote no on Kavanaugh. You can see a majority of the women voters in those two states would be less likely to vote for them if they reject Kavanaugh. Here now, Kimberly Fletcher, she is a sexual assault survivor. And she's the executive director of the Moms March movement, a group that supports the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. So, I mean, Kimberly that's the first question for you. You're a survivor of sexual assault. We've seen this as a real bonding exercise among a lot of women who have suffered sexual assault who feel like it's finally their turn to stand up and be heard. Why do you not feel like that as someone who has been through this yourself?"

The idea that women never lie and men always do. That sets up our men and our sons for some disastrous effects in the future.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. At the same time Sarah Sanders from the podium today couldn't point to any specific facts or issues inside that New York's Times piece that she had a problem with, in part from the president's lawyer. There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. This is Charles Harder quoted in the story. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate. Of course, the line between aggressive yet legal tax strategy and tax fraud and evasion are often a murky one and in the end, are decided by either a civil or criminal court. The undisputed fact is that Fred Trump, the president's father was a highly successful real estate investor, developer, and builder making a fortune in the boroughs of New York from the 1940s on. The New York Times raises questions about how Fred's fortune made its way to the now president without paying full freight on the inheritance tax. Some of the dozens of things laid out included by the -- by the age of three, Donald Trump earned a $200,000 a year salary from his father. By college graduation, that number went up fivefold. He received $5 million a year from his father into his 40s and 50s. The famed $1 million loan from his father then-candidate Trump talked about on the campaign trail was actually multiple loans over decades totaling $140 million in today's dollars. It also lists the use of allegedly fraudulent billing practices and other questionable accounting methods to transfer assets from Fred to his children. If true and again the White House has not taken issue with any of the specific facts of the New York Times laid out, it destroys the president's narrative that is a self-made billionaire real estate mogul. That is a question of public perception. Bill de Blasio, the Mayor of New York weighing in on the legal question saying that the city of New York is looking to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of the city of New York period. That for the legal question for the states of New York and the city courts there to figure out. So it is entirely possible that the story that the New York Times printed is factually correct and that the White House is correct that the president, Martha, didn't engage in any illegal behavior of tax evasion or tax fraud, a question for the courts."

So you know, one of my big takeaways was that the Times is arguing exactly the opposite of what President Trump argued on the campaign trail. He said you know, he gave me a million dollars and I made it into this amazing fortune. The Times' piece says no, no, no. It was -- it was dad who was super successful and that he gifted a lot of this money to his children in order to prevent them from having to pay too much taxes on that transaction. Is that true?

So that is questionable right there. But whether or not the -- however they got the documents, let's talk about what they show. And in the law we -- there's something called puffery, you know. So someone can say something that they believe to you know, be -- it's just -- it's bragging, it's a puffery, it's not something that we would say, oh, you've been completely fraudulently dishonest, you know. And one thing we have to understand is since the beginning of the tax law code -- in fact, there's a famous case 1935 Gregory versus Helvering where Judge Learned Hand, one of the most famous jurists and all of American jurisprudence basically argued that there is no patriotic duty to prepare or pay more than you owe under the law.

So there were basically the Trump's estate passed and two major GRATs Mary's and Fred's, and the children had to pay one-third of the balance in an annuity payment. Any time you use a GRAT you're going to get these legal evaluations of massive deductions.

Now, Republicans have trailed Democrats on enthusiasm for several months now and so the Republicans have made up much more ground. And my sense is they could make up even more. In the Harvard Harris Poll, 37 percent of the people after the hearing last week said they favored the confirmation of Kavanaugh, 44 opposed, 18 undecided. They then asked what would happen if the FBI did an investigation and found no corroborating witnesses to the allegations. 60 percent would favor confirmation, 40 percent would oppose, and nobody lacked an opinion on it. 52 percent of -- excuse me, 58 percent of Independents would support confirmation and 40 percent of Democrats would support confirmation if the FBI background check found no corroboration."

If you're Republican, you think he should be confirmed. The people who are up for grabs aren't going to settle public opinion on this are people who are independents. And as we saw in the Harvard Harris poll, their attitude is, well, today, I'm sort of leading against it, but if there is no corroboration, then I am strongly fourth, 58 to 30 somewhat percent. Let me say one more thing about Donnelly. The reason that Donnelly -- he is in big trouble and has been so for a while. The Democrats over the last two or three weeks have spent an enormous amount of money in Indiana, and you can see how close it is, even though they have had a huge spending advantage for now going on two and a half weeks. Donnelly is putting in -- excuse me -- Braun is putting in some of his own money now. And so, the outside groups in the Braun campaign are going to equalize that spending. So, it strikes me that the Democrats have been giving it their best shot, and Donnelly could be in real trouble after the FBI report comes back because he jumped very quickly to say I want an FBI report and I'm against -- I'm against Kavanaugh."

So, I think that he has shown through his testimony and through the almost miraculous fact that he kept explicit records of what he did during that critical summer and where he was that he was very credible, that he was very believable, and we have a witness who has brought a very severe and damaging charge at a critical point in his life that lacked detail --"

I've always taught him treat women with respect, the same way with your mother, sister, and your aunts treated. With my daughter, when she went to college, I told her be careful.
