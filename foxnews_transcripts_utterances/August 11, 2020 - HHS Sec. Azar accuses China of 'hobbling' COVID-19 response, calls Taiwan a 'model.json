      "utterance": "Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is the breaking story tonight. The ticket is set. It will be Biden- Harris. Joe Biden has chosen Senator Kamala Harris, former prosecutor in California, Attorneys General. A matchup, in many ways, was imagined long ago. In fact, she was asked about it on the campaign trail when she was still in the race."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "With that, so back then Biden's campaign was nearly left for debt. But all that changed in South Carolina with an assist from Congressman Jim Clyburn. And at that time, Harris's rising stars buttered out for the moment. And now here we are, with the ticket in place, a choice that makes it clear, that among other things, the former VP was paying attention to this strong message and letter and warning yesterday. It was a letter from over 100 prominent Black men including Van Jones, Charlamagne tha God, Sean Diddy Combs and attorney Ben Crump, demanding, in fact, that Biden choose a Black woman for his running mate. The letter scolded those who had labeled contenders too ambitious, or asked them to, \"show remorse\" for political digs on the on the debate stage. A clear nod of support for Harris, who would, in fact, have been criticized for both of those things. So let's get right to the reaction tonight from Katrina Pierson, Trump Campaign Senior Advisor and A. Scott Bolden, Former Washington DC, Democratic Party, Chairman. Welcome to both of you. Thank you very much for being here."

What did you think about that? Did you think it was too heavy handed? And what do you think about the choice tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLDEN",
      "utterance": "I think that the - his choice was being made only by him. I would have had those communications with the campaign, but I would not have put them in writing, because I don't think the letter made that much of a difference to Joe Biden. Joe Biden is his own man. He's going to make that call. And she was let's be - let's face it. She was always the leading front runner once she dropped out of the race, if you will. It wasn't really an open secret, but she really was the safest, a very solid, smart, competent choice that could rally the base even without that letter. Many of my friends were on that letter. I'm not chastising them. I agree with it conceptually. I just wouldn't have been as heavy handed about it, because she was the leading candidate anyway."

There was a speculation that he met the other day with Gretchen Whitmer, and that maybe that letter was sort of a little bit of a - be careful message that was sent to him in case he was thinking about going that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLDEN",
      "utterance": "That message is inherent, given Clyburn, given what happened in South Carolina, given the 90 percent plus of African-Americans, voters who are going to back the Democratic nominee, and his early decision to pick a female Vice President on the ticket. And so, I just don't think it was really necessary. It may look like that. But I think party insiders on the Republican side and Democratic side note differently. It was a bit of overkill, or they thought it would be insurance. But I think Biden had Kamala Harris on his mind before this letter."

But when these markers are laid down. When he says, Oh, I'm going to pick a woman, and then he gets this pressure. Oh, I'm going to pick a Black woman. It's sort of checks those identity boxes. And I think in a way, as a woman, it takes away from some of the selection in some ways, doesn't it?"

      "speaker": "KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. But you know, I think Joe Biden's pick is actually a red flag for the Democrat Party, because this actually reinforces what the Trump campaign has been saying for months now, and that is that the polls are wrong. Because if he was truly leading by 10 points and had the Black vote locked up, he wouldn't go with the base choice. So Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as a Hail Mary, by choosing a hardcore progressive candidate who supports crazy things like the Green New Deal, and someone who wants to ban fracking and who publicly compared our brave law enforcement to the KKK. So Joe Biden didn't even remember Kamala Harris during the debates when he claimed to have the support of the only Black woman in the United States Senate. So I think that too, is key. Her record, as attorney general, is absolutely abysmal by fighting to keep inmates locked up in overcrowded prisons to be used as cheap labor, and the list goes on, Martha. And it absolutely takes away from the fact that she's a woman or even a woman of color, simply because he backed himself in a corner, and perhaps that's what he wanted."

      "speaker": "BOLDEN",
      "utterance": "I don't think that dog will hunt. First of all, she's not a - she's not to the Far Left at all. She's a former prosecutor, got high remarks for that. Secondly, any man that's offended at diversity or the fact that she's a history making nominee, because we have - we have never had an African- American or even an Asian - American of Asian descent - let alone, Jamaican descent, be on the ticket. This is a diverse country. That's smart politics given the bases. And I'll be honest with you, White voters have never voted in the majority since 1986 for a Democratic nominee for President. And so the cultural difference, but more important, those Black voting patterns for people of color, Black and Brown people, are super important to the Democratic Party, because they're not voting for the GOP in major names, because GOP doesn't really offer them anything to vote for. I mean, you talk about Biden's gaffes. Well, what about the intentionality of Donald Trump? I mean, he tweets out or retweets his supporters saying white power. That's not really welcoming to people of color. So this is a solid choice. She'll energize the base, but energize Biden's campaign as well. And I think she's going to be a solid choice as we get closer to the voting in November."

We went through this in 2016, because all women were supposed to vote for Hillary Clinton and that didn't work out so well either. But the Left will talk about the intentionality of a tweet, and we can talk about the actual facts. Joe Biden has spent half a century in public office decimating the Black community. We can talk about the Crime Bill."

He brags about being the author of the Crime Bill and actually bragged about locking people up for everything but jaywalking, Joe Biden's own words. So we at the Trump campaign are happy to talk about the facts. The Left can talk about intentions and, and unicorns and rainbows. But there's a very serious issue in America today and President Trump has been leading on the issue and failed. Joe Biden failed, where Barack - Barack Obama and Joe Biden failed and Donald Trump is picking up that mantle and leading the way. Our president has put out many policies that helped Black America, whether it's HBCUs, whether it's the economy and police reform, let's not forget about that. This is the issue of the day and President Trump was leading on this issue back in October 2019, and we're happy to have that discussion."

It's tearing - I'm just, I'm just so sad for the country. Like, no - where's the leadership that understands what's really happening? Yes, it's really sore in the urban communities, in the Black communities. But do you know, my young friend out there in Chicago, that school money was captured to build a skyscraper hotel for one of Rahm Emanuel's contributors. So, meanwhile, the kids in your school, it's 50 children to a kindergarten class. It's got nothing to do with Gucci. And if you're saying armed robbery, looting, breaking and entering is a way to feed yourself, then you're next and then don't bother calling the police, because you're going to get eaten up.

Look, forget Gucci for a minute. That rolling riot went down to some strip malls and took out mom and pops. Martin Luther King was a figurehead. Black Lives Matter where is it? Is that even a thing? Or is it a slogan? Because Martin Luther King condemned rioting, and he called it destructive and he called it nihilistic. He did say rioting is the language of the unheard.

Our whatever window was smashed in and got looted. And I had to go down there and defend my store with a cell phone in my hand, basically pretending that I was on the phone with the police, because the police weren't there. I know the police are in other parts of the city trying to do their best. But from what I understand, they're told not to engage and stop these things unless there's personal harm being threatened or done to individuals. So there's been no increased police presence that I've noticed in the past two and a half months since the first riots and there needs - that needs to happen. And I don't know, on the prosecution side, I've heard that they're not prosecuting them the way they should if that's true. That's ridiculous. People are committing crimes. They're smashing in our windows. They're taking our property that we've worked extremely hard for over 30 plus years to build up this business. And--"

And I'm sad to say that we have the same kind of boarded up windows here in New York and you wonder what's happening to America cities when the leadership doesn't protect people from lawlessness? It seems a pretty basic function of the leadership to protect people from lawlessness in their communities, regardless of the issues that people might want to protest, so this is a totally separate thing. Ken and Carrie, thank you very much. We wish you all the best. I hope you can come back in a month and tell us that things are looking up and that things are better. Thanks, guys. Good to see you tonight. All right. Let's switch gears here. As you know, the pandemic really changed the whole dynamic between the United States and China. And now it appears that there is no going back. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is angered by - he angered China, I should say, because he sat down with the President of Taiwan in a sign of unity. Communist China didn't like that. They sent two fighter jets overhead as a clear message to the Secretary. He's here next with his story after this."

This was the highest level meeting between our two countries in decades. China considers Taiwan to be a sovereign part of China, and firmly opposes any official interactions between the United States and Taiwan. So in answer to this meeting, China's sent fighter jets over the site of that meeting to send a very clear message. Joining me now is Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, fresh off of his historic trip. He's still there. In fact, he's heading back shortly. Secretary Azar, thank you very much for being here. So clearly, China. thinks that your visit was a provocative move. What do you say to them?"

So, what was the message? And also, you know, it said the president sends a strong support for Taiwan and China said that your visit endangered peace."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AZAR",
      "utterance": "Well, my visit is completely consistent with the U.S. has long- standing one China policy and is completely consistent with the precedent of senior level engagement between the United States and representatives of Taiwan. What the Communist Party of China should be more focused on is getting more transparent, more open and more collaborative on COVID-19 when they brought this upon us by concealing so much about this virus and its origins as well as the nature of the disease and preventing international observers in throughout. As I said in the speech yesterday here in Taiwan, if this virus had emerged in Taiwan or in the United States and open Democratic transparent public health system, we could have stopped it in its tracks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think everybody wishes that that's what happened. The language that you just used in that response that the United States continues to uphold the one China policy is obviously the phrase that China is looking to hear. That is the policy that they insist upon from everybody that does business with China essentially. And yet, we know that Taiwan is concerned that China might make even aggressive military moves against the country that you are in right now. We have also seen this national security policy in Hong Kong and how that's playing out. People are getting arrested and pulling out of newspaper offices. So why do we still have a one China policy given what you just said about China's behavior with this virus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AZAR",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm going to focus on health issues. You know, one of the things that we've seen is when President Tsai was elected here as part of a vibrant, Democratic process in Taiwan four years ago, she was first elected, the Chinese Communist Party went to the World Health Organization and said Taiwan can no longer participate in observer status which it had been for years. They bullied the WHO, they pulled Taiwan, they kicked Taiwan out. And the Trump administration and I, and Secretary Pompeo have been fighting to get Taiwan back in so that Taiwan can contribute with their excellent public health system that they've got --"

You know, they are one of only two entities under Macau and Taiwan that the State Department and the CDC now have a level one, the lowest level travel advisory for. They've done such a great job dealing with COVID-19 unlike China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "yes. I mean, the reason that China doesn't want them represented in the WHO among other things is that they don't consider them a country. So it seems like those two things are at odds to say that we still have a one China policy but to also say you want China -- you want Taiwan as a separate entity to be part of all of these international organizations because we still respect their democracy in the way they've handled this."

What people usually try to do when they pick a running mate, is that somebody will add something in terms of the electoral college. She comes to California. And if he'd nominated a bicycle as his running mate, the bicycle will win in California. So, she doesn't really add anything in that since, it would have been maybe smarter to pick somebody from a swing state, I suppose. The other thing about her is she seems to come across as a bit of a brazen (Ph) as the president mentioned it. I don't know if she can warm things up and be a little more charming.

Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, you've also got North Carolina, Arizona, some of these places where this election is going to be decided. Does Kamala Harris help to move the needle for Joe Biden in that regard?"

I think quite frankly, that this is going to be, because particularly because of the pandemic is going to be more of a base election than even 2016 was. And she is obviously targeted at the base. And you know, the goal -- the reason to have a black woman on the ticket is to energize, to bring back the Obama coalition that didn't come out for Hillary Clinton. And the problem that Joe Biden has right now is that he is doing worse with African-Americans than Hillary Clinton was. He is behind her nationally and when it comes to younger black voters, those 18 to 29, he's only got 68 percent support, which is 17 points behind Hillary Clinton in 2016. So, the question is does Kamala Harris help him win over African-American voters and not just support but their enthusiasm? Her record in the primary doesn't seem to indicate that it does. She was -- she never connected with African-American voters. She never was able to build that support. Ad so I don't know that she will deliver for him the main thing that she's been put on the ticket to do."
