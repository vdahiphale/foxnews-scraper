      "utterance": "Again -- look, there is some stuff in here that's good. Certainly stuff that's in here that's good for, you know, my husband and certain people in certain tax brackets. I don't think it addresses all of the concerns that the middle-class, especially the blue-collar working class that put Trump over into that White House with their vote. What do they want? They want jobs, they want to see money in their fists. They're not getting a check that's cut for $2,000. That's a whole different story when you break it down over 12 months. And when you look at the deductions, they are for the rich. What type of people are itemizing their deductions? Lower and middle-class Americans in this country aren't doing that. So I don't think it's going to help them in the midterm collections. I don't think the child tax credit is enough. Not just that. In addition to that that polls just show it's not as favorable to the American public. And at the end of the day, this is, hey, look, we finally did something for Republicans, but how much of it is politics so they can't even really pay for this, versus in the best interest of their constituents?"

If at the end of the day this does help the economy and those people do get some of those jobs and all you have a hard Democrats sitting on the sidelines and talking about class warfare, even though their economic improvement, situation has improved, and talking about Russia, Russia, Russia, I think it has a tremendous impact."

My worst enemies, they walk out, they say there is no collusion, but we will continue to look. It was great. He said very nice things what I've done for this country in terms of the economy. I don't want to talk about pardons of Michael Flynn yet. We will see what happens. Let's see."

And so he left all of his stinging rebukes for the upper echelons of the FBI on the White House lawn, which I thought was probably a smart way of handling that."

      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Yes, text messages, emails that they had to one another. The reality is that whether we work inside the beltway or outside, we have opinions, and we have political opinions and political leanings. And there are a lot of people I know, even Republicans who don't favor this president or some of the things that he says, but these individuals also bash Democrats, Eric Holder, Chelsea Clinton, the list goes on. The problem that I have with what we saw the montage and other things that the president has done is do you believe in then or do you believe them now, right? Because he's rebuking the FBI and then he stands there in front a law enforcement and talks about what a great law enforcement team as we have in this nation, as we do, and forgetting the FBI is part of the great big law enforcement team. The same thing with Roy Moore. I backed the guy. He denies it. He said he didn't do it. I backed the guy, rather have a Republican, you've got to concede. He flip-flops."

      "utterance": "I think the issue with the text messages is whether these private views, which I think virtually everyone agrees they are allowed to have, affected their judgments or their actions in carrying out the responsibilities as public servants. And I think there are texts that suggest they might. It's worth looking into. I don't think the president should have answered the question about a pardon for Michael Flynn the way that he did. It's not appropriate for the president of the United States to say he's considering a pardon for Michael Flynn even as he's saying he's not considering a pardon for Michael Flynn by saying yet. He should've just passed on the question, and he should do that next time he's asked because he'll be asked again. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
