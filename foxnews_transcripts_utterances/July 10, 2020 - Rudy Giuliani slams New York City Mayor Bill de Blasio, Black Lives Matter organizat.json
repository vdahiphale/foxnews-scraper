It's puzzling to me to see sort of a cognitive dissonance that exists when it shouldn't when it comes to the best interests of our students, of our children. Really need to put them first and look out for their best interests knowing the fact, knowing the science and the data they are less impacted compared to older populations.",

That's not just going to affect the child. It's going to affect the family. It's going to affect our economy. You really can devise a better plan to destroy this country, to thwart our economy from growing and coming back from the terrible virus, then keeping kids home from school. As the doctor said, we know it's manageable. We know children are low risk. They are not super-spreaders, as we once thought at the beginning of this virus. It's manageable. If there is an outbreak we're smart people, we can go back. We can say we're going to stay home for a couple weeks. But to start doing this, it's very clear to me that it's not teachers who are good. It's teachers unions who are filled with activists with a vested interest in seeing Joe Biden win and I believe they are doing this, they are pushing for closure of schools for very political purposes. For those people who might say, Jason, hey, teachers unions care about kids. These are the same people who tried to stop, you know, school choice and poor kids from going to better schools.

But most of all I think the president really felt as though this was not a fair trial in the District of Columbia. You know, frankly, good luck if you're a friend of Donald Trump trying to get a fair trial there where in the last election, more than 90 percent of the people voted in favor of Hillary Clinton, and a scant 4 percent for Donald Trump. It was underscored by the bias of the jury foreperson which emerged after the trial. She was virulently anti-Trump, communicating social media posts, accusing Trump and his supporters like Roger Stone of being racist, #klanpresident. And she had a powerful ability to influence and induce the entire jury to have a conviction against Roger Stone. The judge should have granted a new trial but said, oh, gee, it's your lawyer's fault they should have discovered the bias ahead of time. That's an admission that there was bias.

This is a 67-year-old man in the facility that he was headed to in Georgia just released report of 20 COVID positive inmates up from zero. And remember that the DOJ oppose this stay that his returnees had requested. So, in terms of a vulnerable inmate, again, what's the difference between this and the inmates that the left is crying out for being released? And that's why I have issue with Adam Schiff tweeted out for example when he said there's a different criminal justice system clearly for the president's friends. But if you look at it under the eyes of a simple inmate in a commuted sentence who is maintaining and waiting for his appeal, there is no difference. And final point, the White House articulation of why the president was undergoing this commutation in addition to the point that Gregg raised, they also cited as it became clear that the special counsel, that the investigation would not bear fruit, they, quote, resorted to measures essentially to give the appearance of criminality lurking below the surface.

What's the president's view on this? HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, it's a good move by the president, of course. Listen, so many people, so many good people were caught up in this Russian hoax. This was perpetrated by overzealous Democrats, partisan hacks trying to take on a president. We know that the campaign was spied upon, wiretapped, authorized by the previous administration. And we wouldn't have known of Donald Trump hadn't been elected that Comey and Clapper and Brennan were all lying in front of Congress and in other ways. We wouldn't know the names Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two lovers that conspired to take down the president with an insurance policy.

His policies are going to be so detrimental to this country. But let's be clear, we don't have to guess what a Biden economy looks like. We just lived through it for the past eight years -- 850,000 jobs were lost just from NAFTA alone, 70,000 manufacturing plants closed. Millions of jobs lost because of his relationship with China, because of his defense of China. We also don't have to guess how our cities and streets would look if Joe Biden were president. We saw rioters and looters drag innocent Americans just trying to defend their businesses out into the streets, beat them within an inch of their lives, left to lie in a pool of their own blood. Joe Biden said nothing when churches were burned, when stores were looted, riots across our city streets. He said nothing about that. So, you don't have to guess what would happen in this country.

It's basically saying that we're going to get zero emissions on fossil fuels, on carbon emissions which means fossil fuels will be illegal. No more fracking. Sorry, Pennsylvania. Sorry, Ohio. No more fracking. They're even talking about not letting the police carry firearms. It's not just defunding the police. It's now de-arming the police. They are even talking about reparations. So this is very, very radical stuff and the most radical piece of it is he's talking about buying American products to a larger extent from the federal government but guess what, those products can't be made in America when all those regulations that Trump got rid of come back on the books and he increases corporate taxes by another third.

They are so far to the left they are leaving the Democrats behind. This is something that's way out there. This is the \"Squad\" from the Congress that's out there and then you've got Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who are in there. They're having their fondest dreams put into place. And Joe Biden, who spent his whole career driving down the middle-of-the- road, just trying to move to the next office, is now going to be co-opted.

You can spit in each other's face, you can hug and squeeze and you're not going to get COVID-19. And their phony political party wants us to believe that this is based on science? Science? It's based on political phoniness. Also, Black Lives Matter -- Black Lives Matter is an organization run by three Marxists and financed by a convicted terrorist who I happen to have convicted who got 58 years in jail and got a corrupt pardon from Bill Clinton. This is not a benign organization. This -- I can't say yet that we can prove it's a terrorist organization. It's certainly a violent organization, and I believe in the course of time, it will be shown to be a terrorist organization. Well, one of the primary persons, Susan Rosenberg, who handles their finances, is a convicted terrorist who was involved with the Black Panthers who used to slaughter police officers. If you read what she's written, she's not terribly far from where she used to be. And if you read what those other women have written, that whites are horrible, whites are horrendous, whites shouldn't be allowed to have equal rights, they are a racist organization. They are actually participating in hate speech. And this man, because he went to Cuba on his honeymoon and he fought for the Sandinistas, I mean, this man, we always thought he was a communist but I think he wants to prove it to us."

Today, he issued a block by block crime reduction program that -- in which he didn't even talk to the police department and the police department's comments on it was no comment. So, we've got -- we've got a mayor who is alienated from the police department, not to mention for other reasons the governor hates him. And then he's putting Black Lives Matter in front of the president's personal residence. The president he wants to go to help bail out New York. Now, among other things, not only as a communist but is a stupid one. And the man should be removed by the governor. He should have been removed sometime ago and I believe -- there is no doubt that his incompetence has caused us many, many lives.

Instead, it's using their platform to advance a cause or in this case, to be a fifty- something president of the high school debate team in defending Black Lives Matter. So, Don Lemon was actually asked about this in a podcast interview a couple days later, and here's what he had to say, Jason -- my role as a journalist is to speak for my truth and my lens and from where I come from. Remember, this is an anchor saying this -- and I don't think those things or biases. Look, that's the very definition of bias. Whose truth, Mr. Lemon? I mean, who we're talking about here? Because your truth is subjective and therefore is something that isn't fact-based, it's something that you are coming from a certain perspective. So, for instance, if you support Black Lives Matter, as clearly Don Lemon does, then you therefore support defining the police. You look at many polls and most Americans don't support that. So, it's not the truth. It's your opinion, and it's an opinion not shared by many Americans that are watching out there."

They even got staffers at CNN complaining that Jeff Zucker f-ing tells us what to say to the exclusion of other things they think are important. And this is an organization back in 1997, 23 years ago, asked black teens and white teens whether race was a major problem in America. They both said yes, but then 89 percent of black teams said racism was either no problem or little problem in my daily life. In fact, more black teams than white teams had failure to take advantage of available opportunities is a bigger problem than racism.

The Democratic playbook is outdated and old. They think people of color and minorities are automatic Democrats. What you saw with Goya Foods in the Hispanic community, Trump might get 50 percent to 60 percent of the Hispanic vote. Don Lemon and the situation with that happened the other day, his personal opinion, as Joe was mentioning, Don Lemon doesn't have any working knowledge to give an opinion. He basically indicted Black Lives Matter as some type of extremist organization. It's not a civil rights organization. It's not an organization that helps people. It's an organization that's destructive. What the Democrats don't realize is that people of color are no longer loyal to the Democrats. They want the freedom, the independence, the self determination which is afforded in the Republican Party. And that's where the Democrats are going to lose in November.

Today, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported a new daily record spike in covid-19 cases but there is good news. A German biotech firm is working on a vaccine that may be ready for approval by December. And the antiviral drug remdesivir is receiving encouraging results on COVID-19 patients. And if you look at your screen right now, President Trump is returning to the White House after a trip to Washington -- to Washington. Joining us now with reaction is FOX News medical contributor, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, FOX News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, and former Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. As we look at this picture here, that being Marine One. President Trump is returning to Washington after a trip to Florida. I said to Washington, he's coming from Florida there, 9:40 on the East Coast. I would love seeing that Marine come down, this Marine pilot in the way they do business. Rain, snow, whatever it is, they do an amazing job. But the president returning back to Washington, D.C. we like to see him there and being safe as we watch the president exit here. We are going to talk over these pictures here and get onto the discussion about the students and going back to school. And, Doctor, I want to ask you about this because there is obviously a medical concern but there's also so many other factors like the mental health of the students and they really are in the lowest category of risk, right?"

      "speaker": "DR. JANNETT NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, you're absolutely right, Jason. You know, to the severity of COVID-19 in children is extremely low. The mortality rate under the age of 10 is less than 1 percent, and when a child is growing and their brain is developing, they require social engagement. They require routine and have it, they require an education. It's incontrovertible. So if you have a plan and a protocol in place, safe plan, then you can open. Little steps that you can take. Ensure that the children have temperatures checks. Space out desks. Maybe start out with class every other day. With a protocol and plan on following CDC guidelines, it can be done. It's puzzling to me to see sort of a cognitive dissonance that exists when it shouldn't when it comes to the best interests of our students, of our children. Really need to put them first and look out for their best interests knowing the fact, knowing the science and the data they are less impacted compared to older populations."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, they absolutely do. You're right, the doctor is correct. Children need to get back to school. Children are also part of the family and families can't work right now. Millions of families are being thrust into poverty if they can't get back to work because their kids can't go to school. Somebody has to stay home with them. That's not just going to affect the child. It's going to affect the family. It's going to affect our economy. You really can devise a better plan to destroy this country, to thwart our economy from growing and coming back from the terrible virus, then keeping kids home from school. As the doctor said, we know it's manageable. We know children are low risk. They are not super-spreaders, as we once thought at the beginning of this virus. It's manageable. If there is an outbreak we're smart people, we can go back. We can say we're going to stay home for a couple weeks. But to start doing this, it's very clear to me that it's not teachers who are good. It's teachers unions who are filled with activists with a vested interest in seeing Joe Biden win and I believe they are doing this, they are pushing for closure of schools for very political purposes. For those people who might say, Jason, hey, teachers unions care about kids. These are the same people who tried to stop, you know, school choice and poor kids from going to better schools. So spare me that comment."

So, yes, we got Joe Biden who wants open borders and closed schools. Then we got these liberal governors that you just mentioned, Inslee in Seattle and Washington state who let Seattle be overrun by these left-wing liberals. Then you've got Governor Whitmer in Michigan who wouldn't even let people go buy gardening tools during the COVID crisis. So I wouldn't trust either of them to decide when our kids to go back to school. And, by the way, Joe Biden wants to do away with charter schools. And President Trump believes that every child, regardless of income, race or zip code, deserves the best education possible."

For the most vulnerable, the older population that has other conditions, other extenuating circumstances, why not do everything we can to lock that down and make sure they don't get exposed to the virus. But for these younger generations, why do we have to treat them the same way we treat somebody who's 85 years old in the nursing home? I don't understand that."

So you're absolutely right. Let's focus on those most vulnerable groups, those who have heart disease and kidney disease or lung disease or obesity or diabetes. But we still have to ensure that our younger population are adhering to the CDC guidelines of physical distancing, wear a mask if you can't physical distance. Keep your hands washed and clean. Try to avoid large crowds, especially if there's an area of an outbreak. Just taking these simple measures, these common steps -- common sense steps to help protect everyone.

That's not overreaching and government shouldn't be forcing you to do that but you can do it. It's not -- you're going to help America. You're going to help your neighbor feel more comfortable and I think help yourself too. So, ladies, thank you so much for joining us tonight.

Thank you all three of you for joining us. Greg, I want to get right to you.

Compassionate, 67-year-old man not in the best of health, about to go to prison on Tuesday, in a prison system that is struggling to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus, especially virulent older Americans. But most of all I think the president really felt as though this was not a fair trial in the District of Columbia. You know, frankly, good luck if you're a friend of Donald Trump trying to get a fair trial there where in the last election, more than 90 percent of the people voted in favor of Hillary Clinton, and a scant 4 percent for Donald Trump. It was underscored by the bias of the jury foreperson which emerged after the trial. She was virulently anti-Trump, communicating social media posts, accusing Trump and his supporters like Roger Stone of being racist, #klanpresident. And she had a powerful ability to influence and induce the entire jury to have a conviction against Roger Stone. The judge should have granted a new trial but said, oh, gee, it's your lawyer's fault they should have discovered the bias ahead of time. That's an admission that there was bias. He did not get a fair trial."

So, what is the difference between this and the 8,000 scheduled prisoners to be released in California next week? What's the difference between this and the 16,000 release within four weeks of the national declaration of emergency after the COVID outbreak? This is a 67-year-old man in the facility that he was headed to in Georgia just released report of 20 COVID positive inmates up from zero. And remember that the DOJ oppose this stay that his returnees had requested. So, in terms of a vulnerable inmate, again, what's the difference between this and the inmates that the left is crying out for being released? And that's why I have issue with Adam Schiff tweeted out for example when he said there's a different criminal justice system clearly for the president's friends. But if you look at it under the eyes of a simple inmate in a commuted sentence who is maintaining and waiting for his appeal, there is no difference. And final point, the White House articulation of why the president was undergoing this commutation in addition to the point that Gregg raised, they also cited as it became clear that the special counsel, that the investigation would not bear fruit, they, quote, resorted to measures essentially to give the appearance of criminality lurking below the surface.
