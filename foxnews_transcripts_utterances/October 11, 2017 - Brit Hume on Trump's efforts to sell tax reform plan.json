You'll do your tax on a single piece of paper. H&R block will not like Donald Trump very much.

And it's not that easy with tax cuts to do that, but he made a stab at it today, and he -- you know, you heard him talking about, you know, the various tax measures that would benefit middle-class people and he talked about the reduction of the number of brackets and so on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All of those things have appealed to middle-class voters. The problem, politically always, Martha, with when you're cutting tax rates is that it's a mathematical fact that the more you pay, the more you gain from a tax cut-- that's just the way it works. We live in a country where what, some 70 percent of the taxes are paid by 10 percent of the people. So, you begin to cut the rates to 10 percent are bound to benefit. This opens the avenue for the perennial Democratic criticism that it's a tax cut for the rich. He's going to have to fight that the whole way. He made a start on it tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And it makes it, you know, it puts pressure on wavering Republicans in a situation like this, not to oppose this. The last big tax reform was passed in 1986 -- I remember, I covered it.

Pure fiction made up to demean NBC equal CNN.\" Then, he added, \"With all the fake news coming out of NBC and the networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their license? Bad for the country!\" Well, remember how Republican Senator Bob Corker said, it was Secretary Mattis among others who could be trusted to pull the president back from chaos.

The shooting ended at 10:15, although nobody knows why because police didn't arrive on the 32nd floor until 10:17, 18 minutes after the security guard was shot. MGM which owns Mandalay Bay is disputing that timeline saying, quote, we cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly, and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate. MGM is among those being sued by 21-year-old woman who was shot and injured. The sue alleges MGM didn't properly monitor who frequented the hotel and didn't respond quickly enough to the shooting. The suit also includes the concert promoter and manufacturers of bump stock devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at nearly the rate of an automatic. We've also learned that Stephen Paddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay Hotel three days earlier than police first thought. During the first days, he stayed in a room paid for by the hotel. Paddock then moved into a corner suite that he paid for where the shooting took place. Police say the autopsy shows Stephen Paddock had no brain abnormalities. And despite early reports to the contrary, police say Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, had no concerns about his mental health. Danley has also been placed on a government travel watch list, and she and Paddock's brother Eric have not been cleared of wrongdoing. Martha.",

That is to say, he is getting out, he's talking about specifics within it, he's making an earnest effort to sell it to people. And it's not that easy with tax cuts to do that, but he made a stab at it today, and he -- you know, you heard him talking about, you know, the various tax measures that would benefit middle-class people and he talked about the reduction of the number of brackets and so on. All of those things have appealed to middle-class voters. The problem, politically always, Martha, with when you're cutting tax rates is that it's a mathematical fact that the more you pay, the more you gain from a tax cut-- that's just the way it works. We live in a country where what, some 70 percent of the taxes are paid by 10 percent of the people. So, you begin to cut the rates to 10 percent are bound to benefit. This opens the avenue for the perennial Democratic criticism that it's a tax cut for the rich. He's going to have to fight that the whole way. He made a start on it tonight."

It's not easily done, but Reagan, certainly, was able to do and other presidents have as well. The president certainly has a chance to do that here. And it makes it, you know, it puts pressure on wavering Republicans in a situation like this, not to oppose this. The last big tax reform was passed in 1986 -- I remember, I covered it. It ended up with bipartisan support. That's not impossible here, although the atmosphere is much more poisonous and divided than it was then. But the point being here that this is a measure that can be solved. It's going to take some work, but it can be done."

And you know, Steve Bannon would argue even in the White House -- and we're going to talk about him in just a moment. But Victor Davis Hanson wrote about this phenomenon today, and he talked about the fact that the Republican establishment lamented that the Reagan Democrats and the Tea Party folks didn't stick with the party when John McCain ran and Mitt Romney ran. And he ends by saying this, \"Now, they're either worried or ashamed that the same swing voters came out in droves,\" and we saw it in Pennsylvania tonight. \"Unless the Republican Party is in a dominant position at local, state, and federal levels not seen since the 1920s.\" Speak to that, Brit.

It seems to me to be sort of ignoring the facts. It was a -- you have this razor-thin majority in the Senate, where one or two Senators can completely unscramble your majority and can send bills down to defeat. And you've got people like Rand Paul whose positions on these matters have been -- at least particularly on ObamaCare here -- utterly incoherent. And what are you going to do in a situation like that? The idea that Ryan and McConnell didn't work as hard as they possibly could to pass the undoing of ObamaCare is just nuts, that's what happens. What the Republican Party badly needs now is the unity, and the fact is, they have no reason not to stand with Mr. Trump on these measures because basically he's adopted their agenda."

They got elected into the majorities in 2010 and 2016 in order to bring change to Washington. And after both of those instances, the Republicans were told, the base was told, hey, just wait until we win the White House and then we'll get things done.

And let's put up the list of people running in 2018, and this is on the GOP side, which Steve Bannon has said they're coming after every one of these people except for Ted Cruz-- who actually did not vote in favor of Graham-Cassidy.

The broken status quo has been in charge of this town and in charge of American policy for a lot of years. So, my position is there are so inside the Republican Party that needs to be primary. It is a healthy thing. I am for term limits. This is one of the ways; primaries are a way to term limit people. You let the voters decide. So, finding candidates, good conservatives like Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, like Josh Harley in Missouri.

The president is so incensed today about that report; he's bruising over the first amendment to threaten to use the federal government's power to strip NBC of its broadcast license. After NBC's news division claimed its earlier report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had called the president a moron, came because the president allegedly used a big meeting the summer at the Pentagon to push a massive increase, as you noted, in America's nuclear weapons stockpile."

On the heels of the Bob Corker story where he goes to The New York Times and says, basically the Trump is bringing it up to the brink of World War III. Now, that's the puzzle. It fits as a perfect corollary to the old establishment GOP Senator calling into question the judgment and the poise and the knowledge of Donald Trump. And then, this comes -- and it's like clockwork. This is a hit job. It was done to amplify Corker and again plant seeds in the mind of the American public that we have a president who's not really tethered to reality, that doesn't really know what's going on. And Martha, let me just say that I know for a fact that when Donald Trump goes into meetings on the issues, you know, that I care about, trade and immigration especially, he is brutal and questioning everyone in that meeting -- whether it's the trade rep or whether it's the commerce secretary or everybody in between. He's engaged, he asked questions and sometimes there are questions that, you know, I certainly would know the answer too, and people who are new to politics would know the answer too. There's nothing wrong with that. He wants us to be the strongest, the best, the most powerful nation on the face of the earth on all levels. And so, he says he didn't say it. He says he wants us to be the strongest and the biggest. And I think a lot of journalists hear that, and I think they're horrified that how could Donald Trump ask any questions about that? And they're always going to paint it in the worst possible light. But this is more Washington intrigue and I really -- I don't think most Americans are paying much attention to it."

The shooting ended at 10:15, although nobody knows why because police didn't arrive on the 32nd floor until 10:17, 18 minutes after the security guard was shot. MGM which owns Mandalay Bay is disputing that timeline saying, quote, we cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly, and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate. MGM is among those being sued by 21-year-old woman who was shot and injured. The sue alleges MGM didn't properly monitor who frequented the hotel and didn't respond quickly enough to the shooting. The suit also includes the concert promoter and manufacturers of bump stock devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at nearly the rate of an automatic. We've also learned that Stephen Paddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay Hotel three days earlier than police first thought. During the first days, he stayed in a room paid for by the hotel. Paddock then moved into a corner suite that he paid for where the shooting took place. Police say the autopsy shows Stephen Paddock had no brain abnormalities. And despite early reports to the contrary, police say Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, had no concerns about his mental health. Danley has also been placed on a government travel watch list, and she and Paddock's brother Eric have not been cleared of wrongdoing. Martha."

Now we know that he was in the hallway, was shot, it was a blaze of gunfire that came out of there. And that 6 minutes later, the shooting began. We know that he called his security people and that we just heard the phone call to 911 from the guy in the hallway who also called. Those calls went out.

OK, and if the facts are, and I don't think they are, that the hotel found out about the shooting, did nothing, then it's a viable lawsuit. But that's not what I'm hearing happened. They must have called law enforcement. And the question is, what did law enforcement do, why did it take so long for them to get there? And could this have been preventable? Where I take the greatest exception is some of the plaintiff lawyer suggesting that hotel employees, including but not limited to housekeepers, should have done something more. This is where we part company. Somehow a housekeeper, whose expertise lies in changing soiled sheets and replacing shampoos, are supposed to ninja their way into that room and use their mop to somehow help out?"

Everybody's asking where it's coming from, where it's coming from? They don't know where the shooter is. And yet, 6 minutes prior to that, the shooter has been identified as being on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. So at the very least, we need to understand why the 911 call or the call to the Mandalay Bay security did not become an immediate all-points bulletin that everybody could be aware of, which is potentially could have saved lives, no?"

Let me ask you one other thing because Steve Wendt, interestingly, has established that a couple of years ago he brought in the highest level security people he could find. And he established a security protocol for his hotel that perhaps should've be repeated in other places. If you can establish that there's the knowledge and understanding of what should be done in these huge hotels in Las Vegas, for instance, that it is a better protocol to say if someone has a do not disturb thing on their door for more than 48 hours, you've got to make sure there's nothing wrong in there.

He let them know that he was with them, and didn't stood for the national anthem. Second of all, this is a private business. This man turned a $140 million investment into a $5 billion company, and we're America's team. And so what he is trying to do is protect his business. And businesses have a right to do that. And your constitutional rights do not apply to a private business."

I think those who believe that these players are unpatriotic still believe they're unpatriotic, and those who believe that these players are kneeling for oppression still believe that."

What I think is so sad is that being patriotic has become something that's either liberal or conservative. That's what I think is so sad about this, Richard."

And I think what has to happen is I think we've got to take a moment here and step back and just wear each other's shoes for a second. So I think those people who think these players are being unpatriotic, they've got to wear these players shoes and wear the black community shoes for a moment. And these players have got to wear the shoes of folks who."

And it's amazing to me to see all the celebrities that were once Trump supporters and went to dinner with him, now be so against him. And the reason is it's because they know it helps them politically. They become martyrs. All they have to do is attack the president, do something-- twitter war with him and you become famous and become a trending topic."
