      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a flowerpot is her hot tub, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" Islamic terrorists killed hundreds in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. But what's key beyond the horror was that the targeted country was aware of the threat. And this nugget from USA Today, quote, the country's prime minister and his cabinet were unaware of the intelligence until after the attacks due to political dysfunction -- political dysfunction, which is really code for deadly incompetence and taking your eye off the ball. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's something to remember, as our media invites us to chase phantoms of their own making, loss and fever dreams over collusion, obstruction, impeachment, hate hoaxes, Stormy and Avenatti, is that real evil still stalks this planet, and terror is liquid always seeking the path of least resistance. And that path is often carved by our own distraction sparked by those who see politics as far more important than our safety, which is why terror couldn't compete with the Mueller report even on Easter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Nothing matters except winning that news cycle. But, hey, it happened far away. And in America, it's a peaceful time but only because there are people you don't know making sure it's still peaceful, until one day when terror strikes as at home, as it has before. We can't forget that America is terror target number one and that our number one priority isn't impeachment but security, our borders, grid, landmarks, water -- food supply. Everything is up for grabs in a time where terror has smartphones too. And when something big finally strikes winning a news cycle looks more than petty, it's downright dangerous. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Emily, we've talked about this before. Al Qaeda can come and go. ISIS can be disappeared. But there will always be an ideology, and an ideology will always give birth to something new, I think?",

They didn't use Christians. They didn't say a lot of churches. They've actually said Easter worshipers were under attack. Now, you don't say -- you don't call Muslims Ramadan-worshipers. You don't call Jews pass-over worshipers. It's a made-up phrase. And I think why did they make up phrases like this? And this is one of the reasons why people don't trust liberals because they're not in touch with reality. They do this because they're pandering to Muslims because a lot of liberals feel that they are so obsessed with how other people think about them.

And remember, blame America first? They think Islamophobia causes radical Islam, so they do whatever they can to sanitize it. Now BuzzFeed actually came out, one of their editors, and said, wow, President Trump, imagine how outraged he'd be if whites were the victims of the Sri Lanka attack. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I just find that completely despicable to play the race card after a terrorist attack. It's what they did in Katrina. Remember, Bush? Oh, he would have acted faster if there were white victims in Louisiana. And when I step back and think about, conservatives are pretty color-blind when it comes to life. They don't talk about the different races, babies in the wombs. They want to protect all life. And it's a lot of conservatives in the media who talk about stopping the carnage in the south side of Chicago. So I think it's really unfair when the media always -- no matter who does it, if it's a white perpetrator, Muslim perpetrator, Hispanic perpetrator, they just take the violence and they tried to turn it against the president or his supporters and I think it's really -- it's shameful.",

And now his brother is going even further claiming that the disgraced actor is really an assault victim who has been falsely accused by police of making it up. Smollett's brother also saying, \"Jussie is as strong as iron. But following an attack like this, there is a normal and natural amount of post-trauma that mostly anyone should expect to suffer. I have literally seen him violently awakening from night terrors following the assault. Some of my siblings as well as Jussie's partner and closest friends have seen similar things.\" So what struck me about this in addition to just that ludicrous aspect of it was the fact that if they're trying to start creating a paper trail right now of their being a physical manifestation of damages, if they're laying the groundwork for some type of lawsuit by Jussie Smollett against the city of Chicago, I just hope that they're not.

But what's key beyond the horror was that the targeted country was aware of the threat. And this nugget from USA Today, quote, the country's prime minister and his cabinet were unaware of the intelligence until after the attacks due to political dysfunction -- political dysfunction, which is really code for deadly incompetence and taking your eye off the ball. It's something to remember, as our media invites us to chase phantoms of their own making, loss and fever dreams over collusion, obstruction, impeachment, hate hoaxes, Stormy and Avenatti, is that real evil still stalks this planet, and terror is liquid always seeking the path of least resistance. And that path is often carved by our own distraction sparked by those who see politics as far more important than our safety, which is why terror couldn't compete with the Mueller report even on Easter. Nothing matters except winning that news cycle. But, hey, it happened far away. And in America, it's a peaceful time but only because there are people you don't know making sure it's still peaceful, until one day when terror strikes as at home, as it has before. We can't forget that America is terror target number one and that our number one priority isn't impeachment but security, our borders, grid, landmarks, water -- food supply. Everything is up for grabs in a time where terror has smartphones too. And when something big finally strikes winning a news cycle looks more than petty, it's downright dangerous. Emily, we've talked about this before. Al Qaeda can come and go. ISIS can be disappeared. But there will always be an ideology, and an ideology will always give birth to something new, I think?"

And I agree with you that when you hoard information and when you have political infighting that prevents you from sharing that information, that cost lives. And we are on a dangerous trajectory as well, not to be a fear monger but we are as well. If this is the ball that some people are focused on, it should be security first, 100 percent.

And there were some suspicions going back to Notre Dame in Paris. Luckily, apparently, that's just -- that was an accident. But I will say this, when you hear people say, oh, ISIS is defeated. I worry about it -- why I worry? Because people who I think, well, then we don't have a threat, but we do have a threat. We have a threat, as you described it -- I think you've said, you know, water goes wherever there's an opening."

And we as Americans cannot lose sight of the fact that we're in an ongoing fight. And when the president boasts for whatever reason that ISIS is defeated, don't be fooled. We've got to keep up not only the attention but the fight. And with regard to the intelligence, we know there's all sorts of arguments about, did we know what was coming on 9/11. You know what? You can blame and you can say they're incompetent, they're not the U.S. government, not U.S. intelligence, not Israeli intelligence, they're not British, but the fact is the people responsible are the terrorists."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I have the Washington Post right here and it's just kind of disgusting, Christianity under attack? Sri Lanka church bombings stoke far right anger in the west. And it's a whole article, not about editorializing about radical Islam, murdering people. It's editorializing and saying, oh, Christians are upset that churches are being bombed. And they're making Christians and conservatives out to be the villains for reacting to terrorist attacks. Look at some of the leading Democrats, how they characterize it. They didn't use Christians. They didn't say a lot of churches. They've actually said Easter worshipers were under attack. Now, you don't say -- you don't call Muslims Ramadan-worshipers. You don't call Jews pass-over worshipers. It's a made-up phrase. And I think why did they make up phrases like this? And this is one of the reasons why people don't trust liberals because they're not in touch with reality. They do this because they're pandering to Muslims because a lot of liberals feel that they are so obsessed with how other people think about them. And if they're thought up to be insensitive, that drives them crazy. And second of all, they think their own rhetoric causes Islamic extremism. And remember, blame America first? They think Islamophobia causes radical Islam, so they do whatever they can to sanitize it. Now BuzzFeed actually came out, one of their editors, and said, wow, President Trump, imagine how outraged he'd be if whites were the victims of the Sri Lanka attack. And I just find that completely despicable to play the race card after a terrorist attack. It's what they did in Katrina. Remember, Bush? Oh, he would have acted faster if there were white victims in Louisiana. And when I step back and think about, conservatives are pretty color-blind when it comes to life. They don't talk about the different races, babies in the wombs. They want to protect all life. And it's a lot of conservatives in the media who talk about stopping the carnage in the south side of Chicago. So I think it's really unfair when the media always -- no matter who does it, if it's a white perpetrator, Muslim perpetrator, Hispanic perpetrator, they just take the violence and they tried to turn it against the president or his supporters and I think it's really -- it's shameful."

That the Republicans have egg on their face. You have former Speaker Newt Gingrich saying looking back on it might have not of been the best thing to pursue. Then you have the firebrands saying you don't understand that we want this. There was a little-bit of a -- it's survey monkey. It's not an official poll. But they've polled just Democrats, 800 Democrats. What do you think? Well, 51 percent of those saying -- who are very liberals say we want impeachment. Thirty one percent say it is worth the Democrats time to at least pursue. I think what could happen here is that you will get hearings and you'll have ongoing things in the walk right up to the line of impeachment and it will be like -- it will be harassment. It would be considered harassment from the president's perspective. But they won't quite actually go to impeachment because they know it won't pass in the Senate. The other thing I would point out is that -- in the commercial break we just saw that the House judiciary committee has just subpoenaed Don McGahn, the president's former lawyer who was at the question of the obstruction piece which probably prevented obstruction charge against the president."

Absolutely not. The colossal effort being undertaken right now by the House in terms of all the collaboration, the finance committee, intelligence, ways and means, 100-plus subpoenas out there, each or most of them, I should say, require votes of those committees to do so. They're subpoenaing the U.S. Treasury Department, Deutsche Bank, etcetera. All of that -- what are they not doing because of that? They're not legislating. So all of that effort is taken away from what we elected them to do. And when we talk about impeachment, it's not just the expected $2 million but all of those man-hours that again will detract from what I would love to see would be how about you guys work on building bridges for the next two years rather than continuing to burn them."

But what we're seeing is the arbitrary nation of the weapons being used to get rid of Trump, because they didn't get collusion, they're moving to obstruction. It really doesn't matter.

That's how I feel like this is. It's a total oversimplification and completely missing the point. So, when she talks about eradicating tuition, what do we think the majority of tuition covers. The pension and remember we've talked about this before the entire pension debacle that states bankruptcies are mired in. So, if she thinks that any type of unions would go for this or that it makes any fiscal economic sense that two plus two equals four, it doesn't in this case. In California for example, this generation is literally paying for the genius decision of 10 and 20 years ago to eradicate certain extra payments for their pension, whatever. It's basically it's so much more complicated than she's making it seem and its 100 percent doesn't add up. She should incentivize businesses to hire students to have interns to hire employees."

And when you think about this whatever she said I think it's by the way her plan is reasonable to my ears. But what strikes me is there is no plan from the Republicans. Right. The Republicans aren't debating it.

I have literally seen him violently awakening from night terrors following the assault. Some of my siblings as well as Jussie's partner and closest friends have seen similar things.\" So what struck me about this in addition to just that ludicrous aspect of it was the fact that if they're trying to start creating a paper trail right now of their being a physical manifestation of damages, if they're laying the groundwork for some type of lawsuit by Jussie Smollett against the city of Chicago, I just hope that they're not.

That's how I feel like this is. It's a total oversimplification and completely missing the point. So, when she talks about eradicating tuition, what do we think the majority of tuition covers. The pension and remember we've talked about this before the entire pension debacle that states bankruptcies are mired in. So, if she thinks that any type of unions would go for this or that it makes any fiscal economic sense that two plus two equals four, it doesn't in this case. In California for example, this generation is literally paying for the genius decision of 10 and 20 years ago to eradicate certain extra payments for their pension, whatever. It's basically it's so much more complicated than she's making it seem and its 100 percent doesn't add up. She should incentivize businesses to hire students to have interns to hire employees."

So, Greg was saying he wants to hurt the college, but I think the idea here is to help the students and in specific students who already have accrued substantial debt and are out of school. Their plans are now in places. Some people talking about them, Dana, among Democrats to help in the future, people who would incur future debt, but there is so many people right now struggling with student debt. And when you think about this whatever she said I think it's by the way her plan is reasonable to my ears. But what strikes me is there is no plan from the Republicans. Right. The Republicans aren't debating it. In fact, it seems to me Republicans have given up on the whole idea of running up crazy tax debts and deficits and all that because Trump has no plan and we see the deficit rising every day."

And now his brother is going even further claiming that the disgraced actor is really an assault victim who has been falsely accused by police of making it up. Smollett's brother also saying, \"Jussie is as strong as iron. But following an attack like this, there is a normal and natural amount of post-trauma that mostly anyone should expect to suffer. I have literally seen him violently awakening from night terrors following the assault. Some of my siblings as well as Jussie's partner and closest friends have seen similar things.\" So what struck me about this in addition to just that ludicrous aspect of it was the fact that if they're trying to start creating a paper trail right now of their being a physical manifestation of damages, if they're laying the groundwork for some type of lawsuit by Jussie Smollett against the city of Chicago, I just hope that they're not.

So, I can say, go, screw yourself. He has run up his victim debt card. You know everybody has got a little victim debt card.

Don't make - night terrors is when you come home from Iraq and Afghanistan. Not when you come back from subway in Chicago. I'm not going to make a request to make an analogy, because I requested this analogy before. Smollett is the media. They both perpetuated a hoax. They both got caught and instead of being contrite, they're doubling down on the hoax. These guys just need to lay low.
