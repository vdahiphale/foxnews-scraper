It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” This is a Fox News Alert. The autopsy report for Jeffrey Epstein has just been released. The New York City medical examiner saying it was suicide by hanging. This comes less than week after the convicted sex offender was found dead inside his jail cell here in Manhattan as he awaited trial. Bryan Llenas is standing by with brand new information. Bryan? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Hey, Juan. We have been waiting for this autopsy report since the autopsy was done on Sunday. The chief medical examiner here in New York said that they needed more information before coming with the result and this is what we know. The chief medical examiner is saying that this was a suicide by hanging inside of his jail cell inside of the Metropolitan Correctional Center. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A source telling \"The Daily Beast\" further details here that the marks left on Epstein's neck show that it wasn't marks from a rope but from a fabric which would be consistent with the reporting that we have been seeing here from \"The New York Post,\" which had reported that Epstein committed suicide by wrapping a bed sheet around his neck and tying to it a bed bunk. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now, we're going to get more details here as we move forward, but there was a lot of speculation over the last few days when the \"Washington Post\" had come out with their reporting that the medical examiner had found that there were multiple bones broken including the hyoid bone. And there are some speculations back and forth because that hyoid bone can be broken in hangings but it is much more clearly seen in situations in which somebody dies from homicide strangulations. So that is why there was back and forth here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We'll find out as soon as we get this autopsy report which bones were in fact broken. That's going to be important. But ultimately, this was one piece to this puzzle. Remember, there are multiple investigations here. This shows us the forensic evidence, but ultimately we've got the DOJ and the FBI looking into the circumstances of Epstein's apparent suicide by hanging. And we've got also the BOP, the Bureau of Prisons, that have sent an after-action team to review how the warden and the guards acted in this situation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we have a suicide reconstruction team which is also looking at how, in fact, he killed himself. But the chief medical examiner is saying Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, hanging himself in the special housing unit at the MCC, guys. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's not that you're not hanging from a high -- a really high part. So, there's a lot going on there. Because it has been officially ruled a suicide, it means the estate of Epstein can sue the federal government and the officers that represent the state in that case.

And further, \"The Daily Beast\" is now reporting that the marks on Epstein's neck looked like those from fabric which squares with the information that Epstein tied a bed sheet around his neck and secured to it to the top bunk, which is about 5 1/2 feet off the ground. There are reports that Epstein was found kneeling forward as if he lunged forward, kind of similar to the way Robin Williams killed himself a few years ago in Tiburon, California. We don't know if Williams broke his hyoid bone near the Adam's apple, but several medical examiners say lunging forward is as a rule, not enough force to break the hyoid. But remember, just because he was found on his knees, experts say it doesn't necessarily mean he didn't throw himself off the top bunk or roll himself off. But this is not likely really to sate the critics because many believe this was the perfect storm. He's placed on suicide watch. Then surprisingly, removed from the watch six days later. He's in a cell with no cameras but is supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes. Yet, on the night of his death, the guards reportedly fell asleep and leave Epstein alone for three hours. And then try on go back, falsify the records to cover it up. Finally, the injuries to Epstein's neck appear to be more severe than what normally happens in a suicide. Really more like a strangulation. We're not saying he was strangled because the medical examiner has made the conclusion. But consider in 2008, a Maryland teenager died of an apparent suicide in jail, but when he was found to have broken the hyoid, they changed the cause of death to homicide and it remains a mystery to this day, Emily.",

And so, he doesn't like going after President Trump on this is futile. If you're the Democrats and you're going to have to start answering, do you agree with them? Do you agree with them? Do you agree with them? And they're all going to be asked every single time. And I still cannot think of a single day since January 1st, when the Democrats have actually been on offense on a single media news cycle. Going into an election year with the President that said about 43 percent approval rating and they still can't do it. That's stunning.",

It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” This is a Fox News Alert. The autopsy report for Jeffrey Epstein has just been released. The New York City medical examiner saying it was suicide by hanging. This comes less than week after the convicted sex offender was found dead inside his jail cell here in Manhattan as he awaited trial. Bryan Llenas is standing by with brand new information. Bryan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRYAN LLENAS, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Juan. We have been waiting for this autopsy report since the autopsy was done on Sunday. The chief medical examiner here in New York said that they needed more information before coming with the result and this is what we know. The chief medical examiner is saying that this was a suicide by hanging inside of his jail cell inside of the Metropolitan Correctional Center. A source telling \"The Daily Beast\" further details here that the marks left on Epstein's neck show that it wasn't marks from a rope but from a fabric which would be consistent with the reporting that we have been seeing here from \"The New York Post,\" which had reported that Epstein committed suicide by wrapping a bed sheet around his neck and tying to it a bed bunk. And now, we're going to get more details here as we move forward, but there was a lot of speculation over the last few days when the \"Washington Post\" had come out with their reporting that the medical examiner had found that there were multiple bones broken including the hyoid bone. And there are some speculations back and forth because that hyoid bone can be broken in hangings but it is much more clearly seen in situations in which somebody dies from homicide strangulations. So that is why there was back and forth here. We'll find out as soon as we get this autopsy report which bones were in fact broken. That's going to be important. But ultimately, this was one piece to this puzzle. Remember, there are multiple investigations here. This shows us the forensic evidence, but ultimately we've got the DOJ and the FBI looking into the circumstances of Epstein's apparent suicide by hanging. And we've got also the BOP, the Bureau of Prisons, that have sent an after-action team to review how the warden and the guards acted in this situation. And we have a suicide reconstruction team which is also looking at how, in fact, he killed himself. But the chief medical examiner is saying Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, hanging himself in the special housing unit at the MCC, guys."

He has potential connections to some of the most distinguished and politically successful people in the world. We're talking kings and princes and presidents. And they have one job, to keep him safe and to monitor him and it's been a complete and utter failure. You're not supposed to have a bunk bed if you're fresh off suicide watch. You're supposed to have a cell mate. You're supposed to be monitored at all times by human beings and video. And the video didn't monitor him and the two guards didn't monitor him. And the two guards aren't even really guards. They are substitute guards. So many things went wrong. Yet, the left wants to put the government in charge of the entire U.S. economy. They want to put the government in charge of everyone in this country's healthcare. And they can't even watch one guy. So, how does that make everybody else feel that they can't do their one simple basic job, yet they want to have control over all of our lives? I don't think it's going to go very well."

He wants to figure out what's going on because he knows. Like, the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney's Office, they were the ones to be prosecuting this case and this happens on their watch. In some ways, like, if it had been homicide then you could say, okay. Now, the government wasn't as incompetent as it turned out to be. And this is just really high stakes. I feel bad for the victims, of course, terrible for the victims. I think that the prosecution, they're going to try to do other things. I think it's going to be really hard and we can turn to Emily on this. But, you know, now there are new lawsuits against the estate. There is multiple victims. Everything is going to get tied up and I anticipate that this will probably just be a really long, hard slog and that those victims will not get any sort of closure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, before we go to the legal aspects that remain, Emily, you've dealt with people in jail. Are you satisfied now that this was a suicide and that the conspiracy theories about the -- was it the hyoid bone -- really was, you know, a flight of fantasy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Sure. I mean, I accept the results of that -- of the autopsy 100 percent. And unfortunately, this is just one more case of an inmate killing themselves. I've seen them kill themselves with their own jeans, with gowns, with the sheet -- anything possible, and bones break because it's a really horrific way of dying. And it's certainly not optimal. It's not that you're not hanging from a high -- a really high part. So, there's a lot going on there. Because it has been officially ruled a suicide, it means the estate of Epstein can sue the federal government and the officers that represent the state in that case. The standard for that is deliberate indifference. I have read a million cases where it does not make it past the initial stage and the guards have fallen asleep and they fail to do suicide watch, et cetera, et cetera, because deliberate indifference is a really high standard. Secondly, those remaining legal cases, I think, you know, a lot are pretty obvious. But it's important to note that Ghislaine Maxwell might be a huge source of information for the government. And so rather than she being the next target, she might be the next very important figure that they want to keep happy and extract as much information as she can provide and she might get off with a lighter --"

I mean, just this week, Trump goes -- he went after the Federal Reserve, he went after, I think, he advised Israel to bar those two congresswomen from entering their country. Nobody ever saw a president ever do that before, you know. Even Republicans, Marco Rubio.

And with their heads in the past where they were playing it safe and falling in line, it was disaster with Kerry and Gore and Dukakis. Or maybe this time around, obviously, it's kind of a tossup what's going to happen in the general. And I think it's funny that people like Dick Harpootlian in South Carolina are hosting fund raisers and saying, \"well, something to be said for two white guys going at it. It's not about Medicare. It's not about the green new anything. It's about getting this juvenile narcissist out.\" They are freaking out.

And further, \"The Daily Beast\" is now reporting that the marks on Epstein's neck looked like those from fabric which squares with the information that Epstein tied a bed sheet around his neck and secured to it to the top bunk, which is about 5 1/2 feet off the ground. There are reports that Epstein was found kneeling forward as if he lunged forward, kind of similar to the way Robin Williams killed himself a few years ago in Tiburon, California. We don't know if Williams broke his hyoid bone near the Adam's apple, but several medical examiners say lunging forward is as a rule, not enough force to break the hyoid. But remember, just because he was found on his knees, experts say it doesn't necessarily mean he didn't throw himself off the top bunk or roll himself off. But this is not likely really to sate the critics because many believe this was the perfect storm. He's placed on suicide watch. Then surprisingly, removed from the watch six days later. He's in a cell with no cameras but is supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes. Yet, on the night of his death, the guards reportedly fell asleep and leave Epstein alone for three hours. And then try on go back, falsify the records to cover it up. Finally, the injuries to Epstein's neck appear to be more severe than what normally happens in a suicide. Really more like a strangulation. We're not saying he was strangled because the medical examiner has made the conclusion. But consider in 2008, a Maryland teenager died of an apparent suicide in jail, but when he was found to have broken the hyoid, they changed the cause of death to homicide and it remains a mystery to this day, Emily."

And now so there is the Trump part and people can look at the Trump part and they can argue about it. But again, what happened with President Trump is, he's not afraid about the blowback. Don't care. He's like I don't care. But now what is happening, we're actually talking about the specific issue, about the position that they take on Israel, on the BDS movement on that. And so, he doesn't like going after President Trump on this is futile. If you're the Democrats and you're going to have to start answering, do you agree with them? Do you agree with them? Do you agree with them? And they're all going to be asked every single time. And I still cannot think of a single day since January 1st, when the Democrats have actually been on offense on a single media news cycle. Going into an election year with the President that said about 43 percent approval rating and they still can't do it. That's stunning."

This video reveals a troop of kangaroos, that's a troop, not a herd or a murder, Emily, a troop. Mad because they want their food, so they're fighting. Do you know the Kangaroos favorite food Dana?"

Look at this picture. Hazel Kane walked into the McDonald's to buy more food after she ran out of the food, she prepared to feed hungry people on the street. Well, the food ran out and she bought $40 worth of hamburgers, but it still wasn't enough, so she asked if anyone on the McDonald's staff would help her out. Well get ready to smile folks. The store manager Matthew Ortiz threw in 20 bucks. The staff got together and all they got together 60 cheeseburgers to feed the homeless. Hazel said, the staff was just so great. Hazel, you're making us all here smile. Thank you."
