Nobody Fs for the Biden except for, let's see, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, every other OPEC nation. We'll explain in detail. Recently, Biden got on his knees, hands and knees, begging and pleading the Saudis crown prince to please produce more oil. He's been begging OPEC as well. The same crown prince in this case that Biden openly referred to as a pariah, that he accused of torturing and murdering the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Well, this week, Saudi Arabia, OPEC, they just announced today that they would be actually reducing oil production by a whopping two million barrels a day, that will artificially reduce supply and increase the price of a barrel of oil, which means you're going to pay a hell of a lot more every time you fill up yet again. Now, this is not only deeply humility humiliating for Joe Biden and the U.S., more importantly, it is painful to millions of Americans. Now, GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan is predicting OPEC's decision today will drive prices up 15 to 30 cents a gallon. Keep in mind, gas prices are already on the rise yet again. They're getting higher. Look at this, $5.99 a gallon in Reno, $6.42 in California, that's the average, $5.47 cents in Oregon, $4.51 cents in Arizona and here we go again. This year alone, American families, they are shelling out a whopping to cover costs associated all due to Biden's inflation, reckless spending and, of course, spiking gas prices. Seven thousand two hundred dollars per household. Now, this is beyond devastating to the poor the middle class and, of course, it's clobbering those people on fixed incomes. But remember, according to Karine Jean-Pierre, nothing is ever Biden's fault. He gets credit when gas prices go down but he doesn't take the blame when they go back up. Last week, they were lashing out, blaming oil companies. Now, they're accusing OPEC of colluding with Mother Russia. Take a listen.",

He now plans to beg another anti- American country, a dictator thug, to get more oil and has a new proposal to lift sanctions on Venezuela. In other words, they are more than happy to line the pockets of an evil dictator that hates us if there's a chance it could help salvage a few seats for the Democrats in the midterms. This is insanity, but it even gets worse.

Biden has almost completely drained the supply. We're now at a 40-year low. It is not a national emergency Joe that Democrats are likely to lose an election so you artificially raise the world's supply of oil in the lead-up to an election to lower the price to create a false perception that oh you've done something good. You're now creating a national security vulnerability because you're draining the very reserves before an election to reduce and lower prices. It's only a band-aid. I told you it was only a band-aid and you will only do it to election day and then, of course, you're going to have to pay the piper. And yet, gas prices continue to rise drastically and here's a news flash for the White House. There is a clear-cut way I'll give them the answer to increase America's supply of oil, gas and bring down cost. And it doesn't involve groveling to foreign dictators like Joe has been doing, or lifting sanctions on Venezuela and Iran or emptying our petroleum reserves. Right now, American companies with American workers, they can produce more oil and gas right here in America because we have hundreds and hundreds of years worth of resources. All they need Joe is your permission and commitment that you're not going to undercut them in a year from now after they invest hundreds of millions of dollars. So that's it. It's that simple. Approved federal oil leases are at a four decade low, domestic drilling and exploration restrictions are at an all- time high, and the U.S. Oil and Gas Association, they just tweeted, quote, the White House has one option left and it is the one option they should have never turned away from in the first place and that is the U.S.-based oil and gas industry. Now, sadly, that option would require logic and common sense that doesn't seem to exist inside the climate alarmist cult. For whatever reason, this religious cult and it is a cult, it gives Democrats a free pass to import oil from anywhere in the world so long as we don't produce it right here at home domestically and use American workers and give them high paying career jobs. That doesn't seem to make sense at all whatsoever. But remember, this is the same group of people that believe that every single weather event, if it's a hot day in the summer, if it's a hurricane during hurricane season, if it's snow in the winter, all of it is climate change. In fact, just today, Biden proudly announced that Hurricane Ian settled the debate surrounding global warming once and for all. I can't believe it but he said it. Take a look.",

So think about it, Joe Biden is so deeply concerned with climate change that he now refuses to produce oil and gas in the U.S. instead will try to import it from Venezuela. Let me ask, does it impact mother earth if you import oil from Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, OPEC countries or Russia? Does it have the same impact on mother earth? Now, this is a country in Venezuela that has almost zero environmental regulations especially on massive gas powered oil tankers across the ocean. The Biden White House is a disaster and I fear it's only going to get worse from here. Joining us now from the FOX Business Network, our friend Charles Payne is back with us.

It doesn't check any of those boxes in fact it makes every single one of them absolutely worse. And by the way, it's going to get a whole lot worse, Sean. You know, this conversation we're having right now we're going to have another conversation similar to this a year from now and two years from now and three years from now because the lack of investment in fossil fuels in this country is going to be cataclysmic to us. It is going to crush us. This whole notion that somehow we're going to flip a switch, no pun intended, and be on solar and wind in two or three years, it's mind-boggling, it's wrong.

Now, tonight, sorry to say and we'll talk to Geraldo in a minute, the polls say otherwise. The latest Mason-Dixon survey shows Ron DeSantis with a commanding lead, including historically high support among Florida's Hispanic voters. Now these same voters also overwhelmingly support Ron DeSantis and his decision to relocate the volunteers and the volunteer to go -- that he sent to Martha's Vineyard. They volunteered to go. Now, these voters also support the governor's tough on crime policies, including a recent arrest of any of illegal immigrants who are attempting to loot areas ravaged by Hurricane Ian.

Beyond what Republicans had before because Hispanic voters believe in rule of law and borders and equal justice. And what they see at our southern border is a complete abdication of retreat on the belief that we are a nation-state. So they support the idea that if you come to Florida illegally and you want to volunteer to go to a sanctuary state, go right ahead.

Law enforcement organizations, Sean, which have previously endorsed hers when she was that leftist judge now said, whoa, this is too much. Now, they have supported me the North Carolina Police Benevolent Association. The North Carolina troopers association. The North Carolina fraternal order of police, all organizations, Sean, which had once supported her, now they're supporting me. I'm grateful for law enforcement support.

Nobody Fs for the Biden except for, let's see, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, every other OPEC nation. We'll explain in detail. Recently, Biden got on his knees, hands and knees, begging and pleading the Saudis crown prince to please produce more oil. He's been begging OPEC as well. The same crown prince in this case that Biden openly referred to as a pariah, that he accused of torturing and murdering the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Well, this week, Saudi Arabia, OPEC, they just announced today that they would be actually reducing oil production by a whopping two million barrels a day, that will artificially reduce supply and increase the price of a barrel of oil, which means you're going to pay a hell of a lot more every time you fill up yet again. Now, this is not only deeply humility humiliating for Joe Biden and the U.S., more importantly, it is painful to millions of Americans. Now, GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan is predicting OPEC's decision today will drive prices up 15 to 30 cents a gallon. Keep in mind, gas prices are already on the rise yet again. They're getting higher. Look at this, $5.99 a gallon in Reno, $6.42 in California, that's the average, $5.47 cents in Oregon, $4.51 cents in Arizona and here we go again. This year alone, American families, they are shelling out a whopping to cover costs associated all due to Biden's inflation, reckless spending and, of course, spiking gas prices. Seven thousand two hundred dollars per household. Now, this is beyond devastating to the poor the middle class and, of course, it's clobbering those people on fixed incomes. But remember, according to Karine Jean-Pierre, nothing is ever Biden's fault. He gets credit when gas prices go down but he doesn't take the blame when they go back up. Last week, they were lashing out, blaming oil companies. Now, they're accusing OPEC of colluding with Mother Russia. Take a listen."

Joe Biden caused all of these problems when he abandoned the energy independence policies that he inherited from Donald Trump and, of course, capitulating to the Democratic Party's climate alarmist cult. So, now, what's Biden's response? Get this -- you're going to love this. He now plans to beg another anti- American country, a dictator thug, to get more oil and has a new proposal to lift sanctions on Venezuela. In other words, they are more than happy to line the pockets of an evil dictator that hates us if there's a chance it could help salvage a few seats for the Democrats in the midterms. This is insanity, but it even gets worse. Today, the White House announced another 10 million barrels of oil will be released from the strategic petroleum reserve despite promising to do the exact opposite only yesterday. Watch."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEAN-PIERRE",
      "utterance": "So, we're not considering new releases, releases from the strategic petroleum reserve beyond the 180 million which is what you're talking speaking about, about the 1 million that the president announced months ago. We don't have anything more to share or we're not going to be considering new releases."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, don't forget, the Petroleum Reserve, that is intended for national emergencies. Look at that, look at how much he has depleted those reserves. It's for an emergency. Biden has almost completely drained the supply. We're now at a 40-year low. It is not a national emergency Joe that Democrats are likely to lose an election so you artificially raise the world's supply of oil in the lead-up to an election to lower the price to create a false perception that oh you've done something good. You're now creating a national security vulnerability because you're draining the very reserves before an election to reduce and lower prices. It's only a band-aid. I told you it was only a band-aid and you will only do it to election day and then, of course, you're going to have to pay the piper. And yet, gas prices continue to rise drastically and here's a news flash for the White House. There is a clear-cut way I'll give them the answer to increase America's supply of oil, gas and bring down cost. And it doesn't involve groveling to foreign dictators like Joe has been doing, or lifting sanctions on Venezuela and Iran or emptying our petroleum reserves. Right now, American companies with American workers, they can produce more oil and gas right here in America because we have hundreds and hundreds of years worth of resources. All they need Joe is your permission and commitment that you're not going to undercut them in a year from now after they invest hundreds of millions of dollars. So that's it. It's that simple. Approved federal oil leases are at a four decade low, domestic drilling and exploration restrictions are at an all- time high, and the U.S. Oil and Gas Association, they just tweeted, quote, the White House has one option left and it is the one option they should have never turned away from in the first place and that is the U.S.-based oil and gas industry. Now, sadly, that option would require logic and common sense that doesn't seem to exist inside the climate alarmist cult. For whatever reason, this religious cult and it is a cult, it gives Democrats a free pass to import oil from anywhere in the world so long as we don't produce it right here at home domestically and use American workers and give them high paying career jobs. That doesn't seem to make sense at all whatsoever. But remember, this is the same group of people that believe that every single weather event, if it's a hot day in the summer, if it's a hurricane during hurricane season, if it's snow in the winter, all of it is climate change. In fact, just today, Biden proudly announced that Hurricane Ian settled the debate surrounding global warming once and for all. I can't believe it but he said it. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Explain all the hurricanes in the 1920s, '30s, `40s, `50s how does it explain that? So think about it, Joe Biden is so deeply concerned with climate change that he now refuses to produce oil and gas in the U.S. instead will try to import it from Venezuela. Let me ask, does it impact mother earth if you import oil from Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, OPEC countries or Russia? Does it have the same impact on mother earth? Now, this is a country in Venezuela that has almost zero environmental regulations especially on massive gas powered oil tankers across the ocean. The Biden White House is a disaster and I fear it's only going to get worse from here. Joining us now from the FOX Business Network, our friend Charles Payne is back with us. Charles, good to see you. Let's talk about the oil fiasco. Is he really going to make Venezuela rich again? We're going to reward this thug two-bit dictator?

It just it doesn't make sense on any level, from a humanitarian point of view, from an economic point of view, from a geopolitical point of view for the defense and safety of Americans and the world and the western hemisphere. It doesn't check any of those boxes in fact it makes every single one of them absolutely worse. And by the way, it's going to get a whole lot worse, Sean. You know, this conversation we're having right now we're going to have another conversation similar to this a year from now and two years from now and three years from now because the lack of investment in fossil fuels in this country is going to be cataclysmic to us. It is going to crush us. This whole notion that somehow we're going to flip a switch, no pun intended, and be on solar and wind in two or three years, it's mind-boggling, it's wrong.

Wouldn't that make America filthy rich also?"

Of course, they've scratched that they wouldn't build liquefied natural gas facilities. Now, they're trying to expedite them, takes years to build them. It's just a -- yet the suicide that we are seeing by Western nations all again genuflecting to this green utopia that they think is right around the corner but instead they're killing they're crushing their citizens. The big question mark going into Europe this winter is, how will they keep everybody warm? How would it get everyone heat and electricity? It's nuts and we're watching this and we're going down the same path. And here's the thing, we were blessed. We have this under our feet at this very moment. Very few countries have as many proven reserves as we do, the technology that we have, fracking is a technology miracle. And you know for anyone out there that thumbs their nose or, you know, suggests that somehow oil is evil, I guarantee you, they don't go an hour without using oil or oil byproducts in some part of their lives. So let's just stop with the games for a moment if you really think you're going to get to some sort of green utopia, at least be smart about it.

Now, tonight, sorry to say and we'll talk to Geraldo in a minute, the polls say otherwise. The latest Mason-Dixon survey shows Ron DeSantis with a commanding lead, including historically high support among Florida's Hispanic voters. Now these same voters also overwhelmingly support Ron DeSantis and his decision to relocate the volunteers and the volunteer to go -- that he sent to Martha's Vineyard. They volunteered to go. Now, these voters also support the governor's tough on crime policies, including a recent arrest of any of illegal immigrants who are attempting to loot areas ravaged by Hurricane Ian.

Now they volunteered to go, Pete, and all of them seemed pretty happy at the opportunity. PETE HEGSETH, CO-HOST OF FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND: They volunteered to go from a non-sanctuary state to a sanctuary state. Geraldo, my dear friend, you and others told us that that Donald Trump would bleed support amongst Hispanics because of his stances on illegal immigration. Instead they supported him in spades. Beyond what Republicans had before because Hispanic voters believe in rule of law and borders and equal justice. And what they see at our southern border is a complete abdication of retreat on the belief that we are a nation-state. So they support the idea that if you come to Florida illegally and you want to volunteer to go to a sanctuary state, go right ahead. And, oh, by the way, if your first action coming into this country was breaking our laws, which illegals are doing, then why wouldn't we think your second or third action might be, hey, if I break another law, I won't have consequences. Ron DeSantis is merely saying we believe in citizenship and laws in Florida. And if you don't want to play by those rules, go somebody -- somewhere else. We'll have to help you with is."

Now, of course, these are sick and pretty despicable comments and only a small sample of the kind of extreme candidate Mandela Barnes really is, and how he's repeatedly attacked police and repeatedly defended violent left- wing rioting. This is a must-win hold and Senator Ron Johnson is continuing to gain more and more momentum as more and more has learned about Mandela Barnes and Senator Johnson joins us now. Senator, great to see you. Let's see -- he wants to defund the police, he wants to open up the prisons. He believes that it legal immigrants should get in-state tuition and driver's licenses, supports every part of the socialist Green New Deal, even was part of the radical working families party. He wants to get rid of the legislative filibuster, no restrictions on abortion, legalized marijuana, he logged more than 10 times as many hours for personal security, even though he wants to defund the police and, of course, the Steve Scalise comments.

So he's in hiding. He doesn't want Wisconsinites to know who he really is. The ads he's running he's buying milk. You know, he's making a peanut butter jelly sandwich.

Anyway, here to try to answer that much more, Adam Carolla. You know, in the beginning when I was talking about Joe's -- Joe being weak, frail, and a cognitive mess, not many people were willing to go there. It's -- when he got to where's Jackie, I think we hit a tipping point. Let's get your take on Joe's cognitive ability."

He said nobody asks with a Biden like he was Tony Soprano. Think about that statement. Nobody Fs with a Biden and then he says I have no idea what my son's business dealings were, I have no idea what my brother's business dealings were, so they're doing business in Ukraine and China and Russia, and nobody Fs with a Biden but I've never spoken to them about the business? That doesn't make sense. The same mind wouldn't arrive at the same place."

      "utterance": "Adam, we have pictures of Joe and Hunter and his foreign business partners. We know of 14 specific meetings he had with Hunter's foreign business partners. You heard from Tony Bobulinski on Tucker last night. The guy -- he's -- they got him dead to rights but, of course, he's being protected by the politicized FBI and the weaponized DOJ. They're not touching them. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Nobody -- well, nobody would F with a Carolla if I was surrounded by FBI agents either. I mean, let's just put that on the record. I think Bobulinski is going to F with a Biden at some point. I think it's going to come down. But language aside, it's more -- yeah?"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "I mean, obviously, if you do this application to the Trump kids, essentially Hunter is doing every single thing the media accused the Trump kids of doing with no proof, except for now we have the proof and the media is not interested at all, and neither is big tech."

      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "Yes, that is true, but that wasn't the intent of the interview. I just wanted to interview him and then he came in with his talking points and he started bloviating and I started challenging him and he wasn't prepared for that. And because we're in a podcast forum, he couldn't escape and so I destroyed him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "That may be way more important than you think. We've invited Gavin on the show. Gavin won't come on the show, and I think and I'm predicting he's going to be the 2024 Democratic presidential candidate. You agree or disagree?"
