But the letter from the national board of school boards did use that language, did ask the Justice Department to do that. It was given to the White House, addressed to President Biden, and then a few days later coincidentally, the Department of Justice releases this memo saying that they're going to keep a closer eye on this despite the fact they haven't investigated whether these are federal crimes or not. They simply got this letter, as admitted to Merrick Garland today. And the broader question here is, President Biden said he wanted an independent Justice Department. Well, the sequence of events here doesn't indicate that. And more broadly speaking, the Department of Justice under Democrat presidents has a history recently of going after political opponents and using the federal government and law enforcement agencies to do that, whether it was IRS targeting of Tea Party groups in 2010, whether it was the FBI going after Trump administration officials and getting an illegal FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page.
