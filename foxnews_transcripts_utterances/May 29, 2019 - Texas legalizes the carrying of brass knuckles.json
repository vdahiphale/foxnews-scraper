It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” High drama in Washington as Robert Mueller breaks his silence, the special counsel making his first public statement since taking over the Russian investigation two years ago. On collusion, Mueller says there was insufficient evidence to prove a broader conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. And when it comes to obstruction, Mueller says that charging the president with a crime was, quote, not an option his team could consider. He explains why. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Later on, very unusual from the Mueller team, they released a document, and Jerry Dunleavy of the Washington Examiner shows it, showing the Mueller quote and the Barr quote, and basically saying there's no discrepancy here. They go out and say there's no discrepancy here, but there's more context.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” High drama in Washington as Robert Mueller breaks his silence, the special counsel making his first public statement since taking over the Russian investigation two years ago. On collusion, Mueller says there was insufficient evidence to prove a broader conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. And when it comes to obstruction, Mueller says that charging the president with a crime was, quote, not an option his team could consider. He explains why."

We did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. Under a long-standing department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge."

I am making that decision myself, no one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter. There has been discussion about it and appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. And beyond what I've said here today and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe that it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress."

The implication is Mueller thinks that it's possible that the president committed a crime. So this is a brand-new level of evidentiary, you know, requirement. It's not probable cause that a crime was committed. It's possible that the president committed a crime. It's possible that I'm going to grow another inch next year. It's possible that I, you know, I'm going to play for the Boston Red Sox. I think that it is really was a gratuitous statement, reminded me a lot of James Comey when he screwed Hillary Clinton in 2016. I don't know where it came from. It's almost as if he had to say something because he wasn't accusing the president of a crime."

    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, HOST",
      "utterance": "But it came directly from the report. So -- I think it was March 23rd or so when the report came out and Bill Barr provided the summary, not the whole report, the summary. That line was in there. It's actually in Bill Barr's original letter, that exact line that if they could have done this, they would've have done that. So I actually think, Jesse, -- I think there is more clarity here. I think that it shows a lot of the report is the report, you can read it or not, and sometimes a little bit of this stuff, because we're not lawyers, not all of us, it's like reading through gauze. I actually think that what Mueller was saying is don't -- you can subpoena me, but if I come out there, I'm just going to tell you to read the report. Everything that he said today it's actually in that report. So I think that he tried to really color inside the lines. He didn't try to go out of it. There is one other thing, though, there is this question all day long of whether there was a discrepancy between what Bill Barr said in terms of the obstruction case and that point and what Mueller said today. Later on, very unusual from the Mueller team, they released a document, and Jerry Dunleavy of the Washington Examiner shows it, showing the Mueller quote and the Barr quote, and basically saying there's no discrepancy here. They go out and say there's no discrepancy here, but there's more context. And a source close to the officials at the Mueller team said they don't think there's any conflict or daylight between Mueller and Barr, which I think is very good news if you're the Trump team."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

But then he moves onto the president and he basically says he's guilty until he's exonerated, but we're not going to do any process of exoneration, so I got to go, see you later. I'm out of here. I know that Trump isn't above the law, but he's also not below the law either. So you can't -- you know, you're not going to resolve this. You can't just throw that out there. I felt -- I mean, you know, he was supposed to be the dad that went upstairs to lay down the law to the kids, OK, no more pillow fights, lights out, everybody go to bed. That was kind of his role. And instead, he just walks in with a crate of Ritalin and threw it at them and said have at it for the next 18 months. I mean, to say he couldn't say an uncharged person was innocent, I mean, he also -- OK, we can't say he didn't do it. That's the same as saying we can't say he did do it. So just let it go. I think that he was goaded into doing this, right?"

The first was this summary that came out, the media spit it out. Then the second was the release, they spit it out. The third was having Barr come on, they spit that out. Now he's got this presser, they're not going to be happy with this. Why do we keep indulging this? I hope you're right. I hope it's over, but the media and the Dems are just going to spit this out."

He really should have lay that out. And there's a difference between describing someone's behavior and applying some sort of discipline for that behavior. And yes, I understand, he said, you know, under a long-standing department of policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he's in office, that's fine, but there's precedent for this. You have two other similar criminal investigations that lead to impeachment where they were much more forthcoming with the acts that the president committed while in office. And the other thing -- and I wish he had been more clear about that, because if the president had done something so bad that this was now pass to Congress, then he should have crafted a much better road map for --"

That is the legal system that we have in this country, whether you like it or not, no matter how bad the crime is that someone has committed. And here like in gymnastics, you do not start from zero and build your way up to a 10. You start from a 10 and work your way down. That's the opposite of how it works here. Here you start -- you're assumed to be an innocent person, and then you build a case upon that. And Geraldo was right, like it is conceivable.

But the leader of the pack, where he's at? Biden is hiding, unless you see the better strategy based on the Hillary formula, and that really work out for her. It's the opposite of Trump who happily owns the spotlight, gasps and all, he'll never fake a run, apologizes for being an a-hole. Instead, he'll turn it into pure entertainment. See this tweet about his previous scandalous comments on Biden and Kim. He didn't apologize, instead he said, quote, I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong-un called him a low I.Q. idiot and many other things, where I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer low I.Q. individual. Who could possibly be upset with that? I've got to hand it to him, no one does that.
