And yet reporters didn't talk to the former classmate, Max Stier, who is claiming that this happened, but to two officials who communicated with him. President Trump tweeted about the story this morning. \"Now, the radical left Democrats and their partner, the lamestream media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated horribly. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning liberal.\" And the president said, \"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now to analyze the coverage of this and other issues: Ben Domenech, founder and publisher of The Federalist; Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent of The Washington Examiner; and Jeanne Zaino, professor of media and government at Iona College. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ben, we haven't read the book, but is it fair for The New York Times to have the reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, drop this into an analysis piece, a charge of this magnitude against a sitting Supreme Court justice without the backup that ordinarily is required of a hard news story?",

      "utterance": "Breaking news on the Buzz Meter this Sunday: Two New York Times reporters say there was a second alleged incident of Brett Kavanaugh exposing himself at a drunken college party but without interviewing the source making the claim. President Trump calls the new account lies and says the Supreme Court justice should sue for libel. As ABC frames the democratic debate mainly around liberal issues, the pundits grudgingly call Joe Biden a winner and pile on Julian Castro for suggesting the former VP has a really bad memory."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And should the network be embarrassed that moderator Jorge Ramos was blatantly crusading for illegal immigration and denigrating President Trump? An all-out spin war as the president ousts John Bolton, his national security adviser, with leaks on both sides about the two men clashing on foreign policy."

      "speaker": "LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Was the press right all along about the former Fox News contributor being increasingly sidelined in the White House? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" This is a Fox News alert. The New York Times began by deleting a tasteless tweet about a book essay by two of its reporters on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination fight. It's an odd opinion section piece that waits until the ninth paragraph to describe what's called new information about the allegations by Deborah Ramirez. She is the woman who took six days to assess her memories before telling The New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale, which he has flatly denied. The Times's authors in their book say they spoke to seven people who heard about the alleged incident many years ago, and they published a second allegation about another drunken dorm party at Yale where Kavanaugh supposedly pulled down his pants and friends pushed a woman into touching him. And yet reporters didn't talk to the former classmate, Max Stier, who is claiming that this happened, but to two officials who communicated with him. President Trump tweeted about the story this morning. \"Now, the radical left Democrats and their partner, the lamestream media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated horribly. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning liberal.\" And the president said, \"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Joining us now to analyze the coverage of this and other issues",
      "utterance": "Ben Domenech, founder and publisher of The Federalist; Susan Ferrechio, chief congressional correspondent of The Washington Examiner; and Jeanne Zaino, professor of media and government at Iona College. Ben, we haven't read the book, but is it fair for The New York Times to have the reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, drop this into an analysis piece, a charge of this magnitude against a sitting Supreme Court justice without the backup that ordinarily is required of a hard news story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEN DOMENECH, FOUNDER AND PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not, Howie. There are a number of things that, frankly, they leave out. Things are in some cases included in the book in a very quiet way. They just kind of go right past the point that you made in your open that this accuser, the supposed second accuser, is not someone who actually is making this claim. This is being claimed by someone associated -- removed. They also don't make clear about who Max Stier is, mainly that he and Brett Kavanaugh have been on the opposite sides doing battle in the past. He is not just some --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Specifically how?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "They've been on the opposite side of the Clinton/Lewinsky battle where they clearly had, you know, an experience of opposition. That's something that should be included in any story of this magnitude."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Jeanne, you teach media in college. If the Times says that a former classmate, this guy Max Stier, is making this allegation about another drunken party -- remember, this is more than three decades ago -- and he refuses to talk and they talk to two people who talked to him, is that second-hand information enough to go with?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEANNE ZAINO, MEDIA AND GOVERNMENT PROFESSOR, IONA COLLEGE",
      "utterance": "It's not enough. You need at least two sources. They should. The second allegation is the one I have the problem with. They say there is this allegation out there but the person who's making it, we haven't been able to talk to, but we talked to officials who talked to this person. That is not enough to print it, particularly in the newspaper. Part of the problem here is they are taking an excerpt from a book, that they are advertising on behalf of these reporters, sticking it into the newspaper in the opinion section and using that as a basis to make these allegations. I think both of those things are problematic journalistically."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Susan, these may be lies, as the president says, but we don't know. The book hasn't been released yet. But it's two journalists reporting a book. Is the president on solid ground in saying first of all these are lies, second of all in saying that they are trying to intimidate Kavanaugh into what, making more liberal rulings, and finally in suggesting that a sitting Supreme Court justice sue for libel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, he's a public figure, Kavanaugh, so I don't know about suing for libel. But the president makes a point and that The New York Times or at least through this book is trying to again frame Kavanaugh as someone who was drunken, sexual offender in college. From what we can tell from the book so far, it's not backed up even in the book. I think that maybe why, you know, you and I are reporters, why did they write the story this way? Maybe it's so far down in the story because it's really not backed up by facts. It's just implied. Can you really make that kind of accusation against somebody without real facts, saying witnesses saw this? It's not there. So I don't understand why they framed it that way other than to back up what the president is saying, which is that they want to portray Kavanaugh as some kind of sexual offender."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I reached out to Kavanaugh for comment. His team is deciding not to comment at least for now. What I am surmising is they don't want to fuel this story, although the president has kind of done that for them. I obtained the relevant pages from this forthcoming book which is \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\" The woman, the alleged victim here, the woman who supposedly had to touch Kavanaugh's private parts at this long ago Yale party, she is named, by the way, although according to this telling she's a sexual assault victim."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here is what the book says",
      "utterance": "She refused to discuss the incident, though several of her friends say she does not recall it. Now, that was left out of what The New York Times published today. If this happened, wouldn't she be very, very likely to recall it? And how do you leave that out of an account about a Supreme Court justice, Ben?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "I just think that this is so irresponsible on the part of the Times. I mean, we kind of skipped past one of the things which is this was not a good week for The New York Times social media team in a lot of different respects. They had to delete and apologize for a couple of different tweets. But I think in the context of this story, what you're talking about is essential to be included in it. You can't just, to Susan's point, make this kind of implication, this massive kind of claim without including all the necessary facts that people need to know in order to make a fair assessment of it and to know what they don't know about the claim and what details have been left out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Jeanne, this woman, I'm not going to name her. The Times does identify her by name. The alleged victim here whose friends say she does not remember this long ago incident, she does have the Times -- the book by the two Times reporters, those \"written statement by her.\" It's not about this. It's about vouching for her friend, Deborah Ramirez, saying she's honest and has integrity. It is not clear whether the written statement was made to the authors or they obtained it from venue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And, you know, I think that, again, is part of the problem, that we haven't had the benefit of reading the entire book yet. I mean, you obviously have excerpts. We haven't read it. The Times pulled out sections of this book which to all of these points is the problem, because you have allegations that are unsubstantiated. I do think we have to differentiate between the first allegations for which there are apparently seven people who are corroborating and the second for which there is no corroboration. And to Ben's point, the tweet is absolutely despicable. They apologized. But to describe, if it happened, to describe it as harmless fun, to do that to a young woman, is absolutely unacceptable and the Times is going to have to take action on them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Just to be clear on the Deborah Ramirez original allegation, she of course did not end up testify in the hearings. The seven people, according to this book, have said they had heard about it, but they're not eyewitnesses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "They were not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And so I'm left thinking they don't have the classmate directly who is claiming this, and they don't have an on the record comment from the woman herself and her friends say she doesn't remember it. What do they have?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "OK, so it's the way you package the story. You write it as though it's fact and then you put the lack of facts further down the story where nobody reads it. So the public perception is that it's fact. I watched it all unfold last night on social media, the way it is going today. People are looking at this as yet another very likely true allegation against Kavanaugh backed up by zero facts. It's changing the narrative, and it's really about the media's own accountability here. Are we going to keep writing stories like this, reporting stories like this based on our own political biases to target people or support people depending on whether we like them or hate them? Reporters need to write about facts, and that's what they were supposed to do here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Obviously, many of us will have more to say after we've actually seen the book. Let me turn now to John Bolton, ousted this week after 17 months as President Trump's national security adviser, former Fox News contributor. Here's what the president said. He made pretty clear in speaking to reporters that he was unhappy with Bolton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "He made some very big mistakes when he talked about the Libyan model for Kim Jong-un. That was not a good statement to make. He is somebody that I actually had a very good relationship with, but he wasn't getting along with people in the administration that I consider very important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Ben Domenech, there's obviously been an avalanche of reporting and commentary about President Trump's horrible manager, this is his third national security adviser, almost everyone in his orbit flames out eventually. Has that overshadowed their fundamental differences on several foreign policy issues?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You know, it is always funny to me the way that these stories play out in the media because someone will join the White House team and immediately be criticized as a terrible choice, you know? John Bolton is this warmonger coming in, he is inconsistent --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The wild man."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "He's a wild man, he's going to lead us into war, and then as soon as he leaves, oh, strange new respect. It's, oh, no, he was a strong hand at the wheel, you know? The now the president is going to be even crazier. To me, it is kind of ridiculous. The president clearly has differences with a lot of different people that he brings around and adjudicating those differences is something that's very important for a manager to do. In this case, I think the problem wasn't just that John Bolton didn't see eye to eye with the president, it's that he had a difficult relationship with Secretary Pompeo and with other members of the president's team and that made things more and more difficult to function. But the way that this was depicted, whenever someone leaves, it always cracks me up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In particular, liberals were outraged by John Bolton's appointment because he does have this very hawkish record and all the things that he said on Fox over the years, former acting U.S. and ambassador. And now, many of the same liberals are saying this is a terrible thing that Trump pushed him out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You almost get whiplash, right? Because when he's appointed, it's bemoaning the fact that he would make this appointment of such a hawk and somebody who diametrically opposes him. And then all of a sudden, it's become being fired by the president is somehow a hallmark that you have moved up your status or retiring or resigning, however this came out. But, you know, to me, it's really a non-story. The story here should be a story about the impact on our foreign policy and Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy and leading the nation. That should be the story, not the comings and goings of Bolton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, in fairness, some have tried to deal with that. Look, if he does even a (INAUDIBLE) then he will be a hero to the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Look, the president has a lot of turnover in this White House, fact. The president does like to hire TV commentators, Larry Kudlow from CNBC. But Bolton has more aggressive approach than Donald Trump on Iran, on Russia, on Syria, and of course on Afghanistan summit at Camp David which got cancelled. It cannot have been a secret to Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "I was surprised when he joined the administration just based on what the president campaigned on; getting troops out of Afghanistan, more focus on the United States versus trying to change the world abroad. I was surprised. I didn't think he would last long based on that, I knew once they got to Afghanistan, things would really start to clash. But the president said something interesting this week. He said, I'm really easy to work for because I make all the decisions. It is a warning to whoever takes Bolton's place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But everybody wants the job. A little more on this after the break, and we'll also look at the coverage of the democratic debate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The democratic debate in a moment, but just to finish up our conversation here with the panel on John Bolton leaving the White House, the final straw, Ben, was Bolton being opposed to the president, inviting Taliban leaders to Camp David to sign a peace deal in Afghanistan. Of course, the president canceled it in the wake of a car bombing. At the same time, there were a lot of tensions about leaking to the press. When Trump met with the Kim Jong-un in the DMZ, Bolton who was off in Mongolia, disputed a New York Times story about an interim deal with North Korea. He said this publicly, some were trying to box in the president. Then Bolton was accused of leaking reporters' notes from an off the record briefing. There was a whole lot of (INAUDIBLE) press going on here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You know, I think that the president is certainly someone who dislikes people on his team leaking. I think that, you know, John Bolton, you know, whatever you think of him, is someone who has somewhat of a cozy relationship with a lot of people in the media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In the media for years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "In the media for years and you tend to talk to people like that. I think this is something that the president needs to be cognizant of when he's hiring people from the media to go into his administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Just briefly, I mean, the media establishing clearly disapproves of the way the president is constantly shuffling aides, but why shouldn't he have somebody who agrees with him on the major foreign policy issues and somebody who he's comfortable with? It's not like other presidents haven't dumped cabinet members and other top aides for various political and policy reasons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "Brookings has done a fascinating tracking of the amount of turnover in the administration. It is higher in the first and second year. We are in the third year. It's even lower than Obama. Presidents turn over staff. They turn over appointments. That is their absolute right to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The press is often accused, Susan, of palace intrigue. There are a lot of stories about tension with Bolton and the president and others. Washington Post reported on August 30th that the White House had sidelined Bolton on Afghanistan, that he trades relations with colleagues. An embassy spokesman at the Times said that this was a biased report based on unconfirmed leaks and there's more truth in the National Enquirer. Ten days later, he's gone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "This happens a lot, doesn't it, where the White House denies something only for it to really be confirmed later through the president's actions. I think their big problem with this president is so many leaks out of his own White House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It has been the problem since day one. I want to get to the debate. I think ABC's George Stephanopoulos and David Muir did a solid and substantive job at Jorge Ramos of Univision who was on that panel. Just take a look at a couple of the questions that he asked the candidates."

      "utterance": "Anyone who supports this is supporting racism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Do you think Trump supporters are racists? How is Jorge Ramos able to sit on that ABC panel and crusade? Is that kind of an embarrassment to the network?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You know, in 2016, I think everyone would agree that the most embarrassing debate moderation was done by John Harwood of CNBC. It was insulting. He talked to now-president Trump, saying he was running a comic book campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Jorge Ramos, I think, on the scale of 10 being Harwood, he was like a solid eight. It was a situation where he was saying all of these things that are so opinionated and so aggressive and suggesting, offering all these different defenses up. You can't put someone who is that strong of an advocacy role on a debate panel and expect it to go well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Jeanne, ABC certainly knew what it was getting with Jorge Ramos. I don't see virtually anyone in the mainstream media saying, you know, Jorge went too far, he's over the top, he's biased, he is supposed to be neutral. Remember, Fox can't host a DNC debate because it's so biased."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And, you know, I would even go further than Ben. My problem is having networks at all host these debates. There was a time when the league of women voters was hosting debates. And when they were pushed out of that position, they said this is a charade being pushed on the American public by institutions that are designed to make money. That is a problem. You need independent organizations running these debates, not networks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. My point is that Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum and Chris Wallace would be a lot more solid journalists than opinionated person like Jorge Ramos. Let me ask you, Susan. I thought maybe he would just make an attempt to tone it down through the duration of the debate since he was known as a crusader. You know, how dare the Obama administration enforce the law by deporting people who were here illegally, three million of them, your take?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "I think they wanted that. I think ABC was looking for some sparks, and they got them. I think the debates for the primaries, yeah, it is OK to have someone like him doing that. I mean, they don't hide it anymore. They don't hide the bias in these debates anymore. I say it all the time. It's fine when you're just talking just to Democrats. My concern is what's going to happen when we get to the general debate. That's when we need to be very careful who we put up there. I know there were accusations of bias last time. I say let C-SPAN do it this time. We need someone who is a real neutral person in there. That is the main problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It's a great suggestion. I don't see it happening. We have more to say about this. I don't think that everyone (INAUDIBLE) what Jorge Ramos did, but of course, the decision was made to put him on. Back in a moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The most talked about, most buzzed-about moment at the democratic debate, ABC in Houston, was Julian Castro taking on Joe Biden. We're going to play the exchange, and we'll talk about it on the other side."

We can debate that, but what also happened is that as we played at the top, the pundits just completely came down on Julian Castro for what was described as a low blow. Is this an example of journalists blowing the whistle as referees?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "I don't think they should have blown the whistle on this one, because I thought it was right for him to question what really is in his plan here. Do they have to buy in? You just said they didn't, but now you're saying they do. That's part of the problem --"

And there's clearly right now a divide between what Ambassador Bolton thought was the correct foreign policy particularly with respect to Syria and other Libyan or hot spots.

      "speaker": "SPICER",

But I think what press there was, was talking about the divergence that they had on the hot spots that currently exist particularly in North Korea and Syria and other places, Iran where Ambassador Bolton showed a difference of what he wanted or what he thought the right policy was. And the president deserves to have people around him that understand his agenda and are ready to implement and not go in a different direction. It's one thing to challenge him to challenge him and bring up new ideas, it's another thing to not follow through in the direction once the president hears you out and makes a decision."

The problem with the story as we talked about earlier is that the former classmate who is making this claim didn't talk to the reporters.

That seems problematic on its face that neither person who our primary sources in this particular story were spoken to that in itself. I, actually, Howie, will go, and I know it's getting lost in the coverage the tweet that the Times put out was unbelievably well beyond the word insensitive and I don't even know what words come to mind right now. But the idea that there is not outrage on the left. Where's Kirsten Gillibrand? Where is Hillary Clinton? The idea that they used the language that they did and I will not repeat it here on television, in that tweet and there's no outrage from these people who have stood up and talked about fighting for women and all of these inappropriate remarks is disgusting. The idea that other colleagues at the New York Times who sit there and watch this happen aren't speaking out and saying this is not acceptable at the times. Time and time again the New York Times has a pattern of doing inappropriate things. Last week, we saw the political editor reveal all of these anti- Semitic tweets and everyone at the New York Times that sits there and lets it goes by is complicit. So, for all the talk about what Donald Trump says and does that coming from the New York Times they need to mind their own house first. They've got a problem with anti-Semitic comments from their own staff. This was clearly a highly inappropriate tweet that was put out."

Let's call it -- let's look at their story. He lacked candor. He was faulted. That all of the buzzwords except for lying. Everyone in the Trump world is a liar but when they hire someone that lacked candor or they weren't fully -- all of these other buzzwords. CNN has two standards.

You read the comment from the New York Times knocking down part of the story that the Washington Post reported that the exfiltration was not the reason for the decision to remove the CIA source.

The president, I mean this was a bombshell from last weekend revealing that he canceled this planned summit with Taliban leaders at Camp David days before the 9/11 anniversary to basically sign a peace deal with the Taliban. That was vigorously opposed by John Bolton. It really was the triggering reason that the sort of final straw in him leaving the White House.

      "utterance": "Still to come, it was controversial for the New England Patriots to sign receiver Antonio Brown. How should the press cover this sexual assault lawsuit against the NFL star?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It was rather controversial with the New England Patriots signed Antonio Brown, probably the best wide receiver in the NFL whose off-the-field clashes with coaches and teammates let his last two teams to dumped him but suddenly it became far more than a sports story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "We begin this morning with a bombshell, though, in the world of sports. One of the most prominent wide receivers in the NFL Antonio Brown has been accused of rape in a new lawsuit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "This complaint from this woman against Antonio Brown is explicit, it's graphic, it sounds violent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And joining us now is Britt McHenry, a former ESPN reporter who hosts \"Un-PC\" on Fox Nation. So, how should the press cover this explosive lawsuit by Antonio Brown's former trainer Britney Taylor, incidents that she says happened in 2017, 2018 that just happened to be filed like the day after he joined the Patriots. And Brown, of course, is denying these allegations and through his lawyer says there was at one encounter that was consensual."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRITT MCHENRY, FOX NATION HOST",
      "utterance": "I think they need to stick to statements that have been said, to the facts of this case as they unfold. I would like to believe and what I've noticed from several of my former colleagues in sports media is that they have done a good job up to this point. I wasn't satisfied with some pregame coverage today. I think the NFL network was talking about how much of a great target he'll be for the New England Patriots, that's the team that's won six championships. Did they even need him? No. ESPN got it right when (Inaudible) said, as a former captain of the Patriots I would not be happy with this man just coming on to the team and still playing and being in that locker room. And I agree with him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, the NFL is investigating. The New England Patriots are waiting on that investigation so Brown is eligible to play today. Here's a quick bite of Coach Bill Belichick kind of dodging the question."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Were you aware of the lawsuit when you signed Antonio Brown?"
    },

      "utterance": "When we know more, we'll say more."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What about the way in which the whole sort of Brown saga has been covered all of the past problems and altercations but now this very serious allegation of rape and other forms of sexual assault?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "yes. It's been nothing short of a circus since he was what now seems campaigning actively to leave Oakland with his juvenile antics. I think the press as a whole could have been better at that time. It was an example of Twitter journalism where each insider wanted to break the next story and where is he going to next, does he is going to stay there. I think in this case as I said, there's been thoughtful reporting about Britney Taylor's allegations. She speaking to the NFL tomorrow. They are fast tracking that."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "-- to have been sent by Antonio Brown to his former trainer. So, Washington Post sports columnist Sally Jenkins says it's hard to give Brown the benefit of the doubt when he texted this woman that she was a weak b___h and a fake hoe. USA Today cites a lot of the incidents including shoving to the ground the mother of one of his children. So, it's hard for the press, I think to separate his controversial history with whether these particular allegations are true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "He set himself up to really have a wrestling heel persona in the worst kind of way leading into a very serious situation now. So, yes, I agree with you, Howard. He has not put himself in a great light. It's disappointing. I think, personally, the Patriots could have decided to sit him for the game today at least until the woman is able to testify in front of NFL officials. He won't get the benefit of the doubt in the media. He hasn't so far. But again, I think it's important for people not to speculate one way or the other and just report the facts."
