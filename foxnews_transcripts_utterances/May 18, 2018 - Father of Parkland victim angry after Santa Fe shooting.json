There was also some fear that explosive devices were hidden around the school property. So a large perimeter has been set up, established and it is still being reinforced at this hour.

We saw tonight the suspect in that case, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who was arraigned on capital murder charges. You see him here. This is the first time we are seeing him after the shooting. He was arraigned in Galveston County Jail and he elected to get a court-appointed attorney. We saw him here standing quietly and nodding his head at points. You couldn't get sight of his face there as families reel in the wake of what happened today. Ten people so far dead in that school, 10 others injured. The community trying to figure out where to go from here. We also got a statement from the school a little while ago saying, we know that our students and staff are going to need counseling to help them grieve. They're also going to need an outlet to share their fears and their concerns.

He did apparently post this born to kill t-shirt on his Facebook page.

They were just two weeks away from finishing the school year up here in Santa Fe. As you know the end of the school year, everyone is excited, talking about their summer vacations. Of course, this was a high school. So, you also had graduation and commencement right around the corner. But, everything, all of it changed this morning during first period when authorities say just before 8:00 o'clock local time this morning. 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, a student at Santa Fe high walked into a morning art class and opened fire, killing 10 people, seriously injuring 10 others including the school resource officer, credited with helping stop the shooter. He was shot and rushed into surgery, now critical but stable. Authorities do have the teen in custody as well as two other persons of interest who are also being questioned to see if they were connected. But the teen, expected to be arraigned at any time not far from us over at the court in Galveston County. Texas Governor Greg abbot says while a motive is not clear, police have found journals in the gunman's computer and cell phones where he spoke of carrying out this attack, but he had planned on ending his own life, too. Federal agents say this also appears to be highly coordinated, well-planned out because explosive devices were found inside the high school, planted there ahead of time. There was also some fear that explosive devices were hidden around the school property. So a large perimeter has been set up, established and it is still being reinforced at this hour. Law enforcement scouring the crime scene and also urging the public to remain village lent, asking any students or faculty members with cell phone video or pictures to turn them over to the Feds because it may help paint a better picture of what happened here this morning, Melissa."

So why is it acceptable to keep letting our kids get shot in a school? It's pretty simple. We need metal detectors at our schools and that will solve the problem. Our kids shouldn't go to school and feel that they're not safe and our teachers, too. You know, we have got to fix it. And that's what we need to do that we could do this week."

And it angers me that these parents now are going to feel like I do and, believe me, it's not fun. I haven't felt any better since February 14th. Its 90 days later.

      "speaker": "POLLACK",

You can't have them where a minor has accessibility to be able to go get your gun. So, I'm all for that I think the parents should be held responsible. You'll see some things change if you start holding people accountable. And they should look into that. Because I really think they should have had those guns locked up. But it goes beyond that, how does he walks into a school with a shotgun? You know, you can't walk into the courthouse so why is it acceptable that this kid took a shotgun and walked in to a school and shot these kids? It's enough. You know, I keep getting angrier as I think about this. And I look at the pictures while I'm waiting to get interviewed, I'm looking at pictures of my daughter and I'm saying now there is 10 more families that have to live like I do."

But let's make sure it doesn't happen again, you know. I'm going to go -- I think I'm going to go to Texas. That's what's going to be now and I want to go see some of these families and just give them a hug and let them know that, you know, I know how they feel because no one else knows how you feel until you lose a kid.

Studies shown it increases aggressive behavior. And that's not to say that kids who play violent video games or watch violent movies become mass shooters. But it certainly is a contributor where have you these video games where kids are essentially engaged in violence for pleasure and are shooting at human targets. And I think it sends the wrong message to children. Obviously, correlation doesn't equal causation. I'm not saying that these games cause kids to become mass shooters. But it certainly desensitizes and in some cases encourages violence in society."

The bill didn't get a single democratic vote. So they need to have 20 of the 37 vote yes, now their going to get one of them to vote yes. The speaker voted no at the end as a parliamentary maneuver to allow him to bring back up the bill. Only a negative vote can bring back up the bill. 15 however of the 30 republicans who voted no were members of the Freedom Caucus. They are trying to extract a promise to vote on the McCaul and Goodlatte immigration bill in the middle of June. They got that commitment but they still broke 15 of the roughly 25 to 30 members of the freedom caucus voted no. Four people from New Jersey voted no. It apparently affects New Jersey adversely. There were four moderates who object to the strict work requirements in the bill. If you want to have food stamps, have you got to work? There were three malcontents. These are people that a beef with the leadership. They think they ought to be supporting him in a contested primary or they wanted to help edge aside another member to run in his district and we got sorta three others I can't figure out.

We provide services to 41 percent of women, so the impact of that means that millions of women are not going to get access to birth control. They are not going to get access to take cancer screenings.

I don't know about you, but I don't go to my foot doctor to get my health care.

But I loved that because he said economy and then he thought, if I don't say guns and if I don't say this and if I don't say that, then they will say this, and then they will say I'm soft on this stuff. I would just say to politicians, don't run scared. Don't run scared. If you can't win being yourself, it's not worth winning."

      "utterance": "That was the governor of Texas there trying to provide some support after what has been a very difficult day in Texas. Earlier this morning about halfway past 7:00 a.m., a shooter walked into the school in Santa Fe and opened fire on a classroom full of art students. We saw tonight the suspect in that case, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who was arraigned on capital murder charges. You see him here. This is the first time we are seeing him after the shooting. He was arraigned in Galveston County Jail and he elected to get a court-appointed attorney. We saw him here standing quietly and nodding his head at points. You couldn't get sight of his face there as families reel in the wake of what happened today. Ten people so far dead in that school, 10 others injured. The community trying to figure out where to go from here. We also got a statement from the school a little while ago saying, we know that our students and staff are going to need counseling to help them grieve. They're also going to need an outlet to share their fears and their concerns. They go on to say that they're going to have counselors at school but school will not be in session on Monday and Tuesday. That's it for \"The Story.\" Have a great weekend. Tucker is up next.
