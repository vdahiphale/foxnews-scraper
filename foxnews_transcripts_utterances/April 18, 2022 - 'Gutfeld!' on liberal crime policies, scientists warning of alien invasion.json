      "sentences": "That's so good. So, let's take a look at what you can get away with this week. It's pretty amazing. One man arrested after mass shooting in a South Carolina Mall. They have them there, in which 14 people were wounded. He has been released. He's under house arrest and thus wear an ankle monitor after the judge said 25 grand bond. Now there's an investment opportunity I missed out on, ankle monitors. Who knew that they would replace prisons? Maybe Nike or Converse can make a version that comes with one already built in. Thankfully, he has been told not to contact victims of the attack who range in age from 15 to 75. I guess his apology will have to be done on a Zoom call. And speak in Zoom, the perp can go to work while under arrest, just like you, Kat. Guess he will be voted employee of the month in that office. The H.R. department must be dreading his yearly review. Meanwhile, a D.C., which stands for duck and cover. It appears dognapping is not a crime-worthy crime. A crime worthy, crime worthy of incarceration, losing my brain. The feds chose not to press charges against four men arrested in an apartment where Pablo, a missing dog was found. Pablo was taken from his owner's at gunpoint, along with firearms and drugs. The four men were released and won't be charged which again will only embolden criminals not to mention damaging Pablo self-esteem. Poor thing. I guess the dog couldn't fill out the paperwork without opposable thumbs. You have that problem, Charlie. Meanwhile, over at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, it's a woman's prison. Your future mailing address, Kat. There, a transgender prisoner knocked up not one but two female inmates. You go, girl. In here I was thinking -- here, I was thinking a trans woman in a women's prison was going to cause problems. No, apparently the inmates welcomed her with open arms. I hear -- I hear they're going to have the gender reveal party in the laundry room. The gift registry is the prison commissary. I already ordered the tins of mackerel. That's what they sell. I checked on the commissary. They sell -- they sell tins of mackerel. And Miss Debbie snack cakes. Demitrius Minor, who's in the New Jersey women's prison confessed to impregnating two inmates, one of whom is serving a life sentence and will give birth in early autumn. Officials say the baby could be released early with good behavior, It was a joke. Just in case anybody missed it. By the way, the father who was also the mother, but not the birthing person is currently behind bars for stabbing their foster parents to death. Got to hate to see what crimes Demetrius majors committing because his name is minor. So, a murderer and a lifer are expecting that their kid's future was any bleaker. He'd be a Democrat in the House come this November. This baby has the genes of two criminals, he or she will be the first baby that when born to shave the delivery doctor who slaps it on the ass. And yes, the media uses the proper woke pronoun, there, to describe the murderer who knocked up the ladies, because not doing so would be the real crime I think. Now, we used to worry about prisoners sneaking in a file and a birthday cake. Not a penis. But I admire this scam. Think about how terrified these woke suckers are. They're consumed over pronouns without questioning whether, you know, placing a biological male murderer in a woman's prison is a good plan. But the idiocy is all connected through wokeness. Apparently the facility changed its transgender policy last year. So now, it allows transgendered women who haven't yet undergone sex reassignment to come in. Meaning that an inmate with a penis can shower among inmates with vaginas. And no, that's not alofa. And you wonder why women are getting knocked up in prison. The officials say it's a job hazard. So what can you do? Well, first maybe canceled the drink specials on ladies night and stop housing biological males with females. That's a start. Get them out of the women's prisons and into the college swimming pools where they belong. So, that's crime today. Well, let's just hope more criminals don't figure out this loophole.",

But a corpse was found at the subway stop Sunday morning. That's the stuff I used to take the Fox every day. And he wasn't the worst smelling person in the car. Down the block for me, two men got shot in a dispute in front of a pizza joint. Don't ever make fun of anyone ordering a slice with pineapple on it. Maybe it's me, but I keep feeling like adults have gone AWOL. Ever since we've criminalized law and order, all that's left are two groups. The oppressed and their victims. It's the allegedly oppressed who victimized but then use their status as oppressed as a shield. The lunatics have changed the language and change the realities of life without letting the rest of us know. So, we're living in a lab experiment right now, where the left tests out there horrifying theories on us. Before we operated on incentives and disincentives, but now progressives have disconnected punishment from crime. And we're left with a civilization at the mercy of the criminally insane. Anyway, happy Monday. Is it too soon to start drinking?",

I truly apologize. Maybe you should have thought about it. But fair enough. She's an idiot. But she's a contrite idiot. But the other guy, Roden double down posted pictures, the Hunter on Facebook suggesting \"It seems at the very least he is in darker makeup.\" If not blackface or I am completely mistaken.

But here's the thing, many of Elon's critics belong to media companies currently owned by billionaires. Facebook and Instagram are owned by Mark Zuckerberg billionaire, Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post in 2016, he's a space alien. The Atlantic, a magazine and an ocean, is majority, is majority-owned by Lauren, Steve Jobs's widow. And Time Magazine is owned by billionaire, Marc Benioff, and Bloomberg obviously is owned by Howard Hughes. Los Angeles Times owned by billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong -- I did not know that. Elon points out that the Twitter board collectively owns almost zero shares, yet they get paid a salary for being on the board. No wonder they're scared of him. He could take their influence and their paychecks away. So, he's got the media and the billionaire benefactors in a tizzy. That has to be a good thing.

How dare he privatize space, in conjunction with NASA, which was sort of a dying agency, like he provided a spark that benefited literally in the future hundreds of millions of people. And yet, we're supposed to look down on him for that, because he has a vision.

They have them there, in which 14 people were wounded. He has been released. He's under house arrest and thus wear an ankle monitor after the judge said 25 grand bond. Now there's an investment opportunity I missed out on, ankle monitors. Who knew that they would replace prisons? Maybe Nike or Converse can make a version that comes with one already built in. Thankfully, he has been told not to contact victims of the attack who range in age from 15 to 75. I guess his apology will have to be done on a Zoom call. And speak in Zoom, the perp can go to work while under arrest, just like you, Kat. Guess he will be voted employee of the month in that office. The H.R. department must be dreading his yearly review. Meanwhile, a D.C., which stands for duck and cover. It appears dognapping is not a crime-worthy crime. A crime worthy, crime worthy of incarceration, losing my brain. The feds chose not to press charges against four men arrested in an apartment where Pablo, a missing dog was found. Pablo was taken from his owner's at gunpoint, along with firearms and drugs. The four men were released and won't be charged which again will only embolden criminals not to mention damaging Pablo self-esteem. Poor thing. I guess the dog couldn't fill out the paperwork without opposable thumbs. You have that problem, Charlie. Meanwhile, over at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, it's a woman's prison. Your future mailing address, Kat. There, a transgender prisoner knocked up not one but two female inmates. You go, girl. In here I was thinking -- here, I was thinking a trans woman in a women's prison was going to cause problems. No, apparently the inmates welcomed her with open arms. I hear -- I hear they're going to have the gender reveal party in the laundry room. The gift registry is the prison commissary. I already ordered the tins of mackerel. That's what they sell. I checked on the commissary. They sell -- they sell tins of mackerel. And Miss Debbie snack cakes. Demitrius Minor, who's in the New Jersey women's prison confessed to impregnating two inmates, one of whom is serving a life sentence and will give birth in early autumn. Officials say the baby could be released early with good behavior, It was a joke. Just in case anybody missed it. By the way, the father who was also the mother, but not the birthing person is currently behind bars for stabbing their foster parents to death. Got to hate to see what crimes Demetrius majors committing because his name is minor. So, a murderer and a lifer are expecting that their kid's future was any bleaker. He'd be a Democrat in the House come this November. This baby has the genes of two criminals, he or she will be the first baby that when born to shave the delivery doctor who slaps it on the ass. And yes, the media uses the proper woke pronoun, there, to describe the murderer who knocked up the ladies, because not doing so would be the real crime I think. Now, we used to worry about prisoners sneaking in a file and a birthday cake. Not a penis. But I admire this scam. Think about how terrified these woke suckers are. They're consumed over pronouns without questioning whether, you know, placing a biological male murderer in a woman's prison is a good plan. But the idiocy is all connected through wokeness. Apparently the facility changed its transgender policy last year. So now, it allows transgendered women who haven't yet undergone sex reassignment to come in. Meaning that an inmate with a penis can shower among inmates with vaginas. And no, that's not alofa. And you wonder why women are getting knocked up in prison. The officials say it's a job hazard. So what can you do? Well, first maybe canceled the drink specials on ladies night and stop housing biological males with females. That's a start. Get them out of the women's prisons and into the college swimming pools where they belong. So, that's crime today. Well, let's just hope more criminals don't figure out this loophole."

Down the block for me, two men got shot in a dispute in front of a pizza joint. Don't ever make fun of anyone ordering a slice with pineapple on it. Maybe it's me, but I keep feeling like adults have gone AWOL. Ever since we've criminalized law and order, all that's left are two groups. The oppressed and their victims. It's the allegedly oppressed who victimized but then use their status as oppressed as a shield. The lunatics have changed the language and change the realities of life without letting the rest of us know. So, we're living in a lab experiment right now, where the left tests out there horrifying theories on us. Before we operated on incentives and disincentives, but now progressives have disconnected punishment from crime. And we're left with a civilization at the mercy of the criminally insane.

That's exactly what having wealth plus vision is. And I feel like what sets Elon Musk apart is that he has that vision. How dare he privatize space, in conjunction with NASA, which was sort of a dying agency, like he provided a spark that benefited literally in the future hundreds of millions of people. And yet, we're supposed to look down on him for that, because he has a vision.

He released this statement yesterday. This is so good. \"Happy Easter to all including the radical left maniacs who were doing everything possible to destroy our country. May they not succeed, but let them nevertheless, be happy, healthy, wealthy and well.\" So funny. Trump's Save America PAC also wished a \"Happy Easter to failed gubernatorial candidate and racist Attorney General Letitia James.\" \"May she remain healthy despite the fact that she will continue to drive business out of New York while at the same time keeping crime, death, and destruction in New York.\" That's Easter. That is way better than anything from Hallmark. And only Trump can make you feel dirty while taking the high road. Hopefully, these messages will become a new Eastern tradition like wearing bonnets and food poisoning. And why not appears more and more things Trump was alarmed about came true like Germany's gas pipeline deal with Russia. Remember this from 2018? DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where you're supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia."
