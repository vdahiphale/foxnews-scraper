Also, if Robert Mueller is really concerned with Russia collusion -- well, I'll happily be glad to point him in the right direction we've got all the evidence he needs. In fact, there are many real examples of Hillary Clinton, oh, Adam shift-less Schiff and other top Democrats happily colluding with Russia before, during and after the 2016 election.

It was supposed to be a deep dive into how Russia was attempting to meddle and cause chaos in our presidential election. Instead for months, special counsel Robert Mueller, he's been searching, searching for something, anything, to malign the president and all his allies. Well, now, the special counsel's judgment, political prejudice is in the spotlight today. This weekend, the president tweeted, quote, is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty, contentious business relationship. I turned him down to head the FBI one day before his appointment as special counsel and Jim Comey is his close friend. And he continued also, why is Mueller only appointing angry Democrats? Some of whom actually work for crooked Hillary like, well, Jeanne Rhee and others including himself have worked for Obama? Why is it Mueller looking at all the criminal activity the real Russian collusion on the Democratic side, Podesta, dossier? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president's absolutely right. On this program, we've been right and we have long called out Mueller, his merry band of Trump-hating and corrupt Democratic donors for what our extreme conflicts of interest.

Now, the two long term time bureaucrats were once referred to as brothers and arms. Now, given all of this anti-Trump bias, should anyone in this country really be surprised? Sadly, we have a two-tiered system of justice. Mueller is more than happy to obsess about a pointless meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. -- Paul Manafort goes on trial tomorrow. When is Hillary going on trial? And a Russian lawyer and resulted in absolutely nothing, it's a 2005 tax case had nothing to do with Russia. Nothing. But no investigation until, let's see, Congressman Adam Schiff. Now, we actually have the tape.

And are according to a report from the House Intel Committee, quote, a person whose name was redacted led regular briefings that contain Steele's information for senior Clinton campaign staff and that included campaign manager Robby Mook, campaign chairman Johnny Podesta. And second, the dirty dossier was actually shopped around to various high- ranking government officials and, of course, your corrupt media all in an effort to malign the Trump campaign before Election Day to lie to you. And that included senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr whose wife was working with Christopher Steele at Fusion GPS.

But then went public with the information. And, of course, there's also the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. It was Brennan who I was talking about before.

Four separate warrants, the bulk of information coming from the phony Russian dossier that Hillary paid for. Where's the investigation into this collusion?

Now, given the rampant bias from team Mueller and this two-tiered system of justice at play here, is it any surprise that President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani who will join us in a few minutes is urging his client not to participate in any interview with Mueller?

I turned him down to head the FBI one day before his appointment as special counsel and Jim Comey is his close friend. And he continued also, why is Mueller only appointing angry Democrats? Some of whom actually work for crooked Hillary like, well, Jeanne Rhee and others including himself have worked for Obama? Why is it Mueller looking at all the criminal activity the real Russian collusion on the Democratic side, Podesta, dossier? The president's absolutely right. On this program, we've been right and we have long called out Mueller, his merry band of Trump-hating and corrupt Democratic donors for what our extreme conflicts of interest. In fact, Mueller's team is made up in of investigators and lawyers who have almost exclusively donated to Obama, Hillary, Democrats. They couldn't find one Republican, not one, even an independent. And we're talking about tens of thousands of dollars to candidates like Kirsten Gillibrand, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton herself and we have called out Comey's cozy relationship with Robert Mueller. Now, the two long term time bureaucrats were once referred to as brothers and arms. Now, given all of this anti-Trump bias, should anyone in this country really be surprised? Sadly, we have a two-tiered system of justice. Mueller is more than happy to obsess about a pointless meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. -- Paul Manafort goes on trial tomorrow. When is Hillary going on trial? And a Russian lawyer and resulted in absolutely nothing, it's a 2005 tax case had nothing to do with Russia. Nothing. But no investigation until, let's see, Congressman Adam Schiff. Now, we actually have the tape. And remember, he was duped into having a conversation with the Russian pranksters who promised him embarrassing political dirt, naked pictures and everything, of Donald Trump collusion. Listen for yourself."

Robert Mueller, listen up, we found collusion, Call shiftless Schiff immediately. All right. Remember, it was Clinton in the DNC, they funneled money through a law firm, Perkins Coie, to a consulting firm Fusion GPS, to fund a foreign spy Christopher Steele. Why? Because he had Russian contacts that made up Russian lies, the now infamous dirty dossier that by the way was never verified, corroborated and has been debunked. Clinton campaign used these bought and paid for Russian lies in two ways. First, it was used to shape the Clinton campaign's message. And are according to a report from the House Intel Committee, quote, a person whose name was redacted led regular briefings that contain Steele's information for senior Clinton campaign staff and that included campaign manager Robby Mook, campaign chairman Johnny Podesta. And second, the dirty dossier was actually shopped around to various high- ranking government officials and, of course, your corrupt media all in an effort to malign the Trump campaign before Election Day to lie to you. And that included senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr whose wife was working with Christopher Steele at Fusion GPS. She was helping to make up all these lies. And then the CIA director turned MSNBC hack John Brennan also reportedly leaked the contents of the dossier to then Senator Harry Reid, also Brennan, by the way, was involved in this. But then went public with the information. And, of course, there's also the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. It was Brennan who I was talking about before. Clapper allegedly leaked the dossier to CNN, fake news, which now as his employer. And let's not forget the major role the phony dossier played with the FISA warrant application against Trump and a campaign associate of Trump's, Carter Page, during and after the campaign. Four separate warrants, the bulk of information coming from the phony Russian dossier that Hillary paid for. Where's the investigation into this collusion? Mr. Mueller, where are you? The Clinton campaign paid a former spy and used Russian lies to lie to the American people, steal an election, get a warrant to spy on Americans using an unverified, uncorroborated Hillary Clinton bought and paid for political document nobody told the FISA court judges ever in the original application, subsequent applications and disseminated what was false, untrue propaganda, disinformation to rig an election, a presidential election? Now, given the rampant bias from team Mueller and this two-tiered system of justice at play here, is it any surprise that President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani who will join us in a few minutes is urging his client not to participate in any interview with Mueller? If he did, he would be crazy. That's a bad idea. You can't trust these people. They're corrupt.

Still, many on the left, in your media are rolling out recent actions of one-time Trump attorney Michael Cohen as some kind of huge smoking gun against President Trump. Even Michael Cohen himself if they would do their jobs, they're lazy and overpaid, has denied the accusations of collusion. He did it in testimony on Capitol Hill in 2017. He said, quote: Given my proximity to the president of the United States as a candidate, let me also say that I never saw anything, not a hint of anything that demonstrated his involvement in Russian interference or election or any form of Russia collusion. We say it again. It's time for this witch hunt to end. We are now more than 14 months of this politically motivated fishing expedition all designed to malign the president that you the American people voted for. If the deep state, your corrupt media and all these elites had their way -- well, he never would have been president. That's why they rigged the investigation into Hillary to save her. Now, Donald Trump is the leader of the free world. His decisions impact the lives of literally billions of people every day and this collusion lie, distraction is hurting the country and frankly abroad, it's hurting us as well. It needs to stop. And meanwhile, breaking tonight, former deep state Trump hater, fired FBI Director Jimmy Comey, well, he may be headed back to Capitol Hill. Goodbye, Jim. And House Republicans are reportedly pushing to interview Comey over his decision-making during the 2016 election. Remember, he was one of the officials to sign off on the Pfizer warrant against the Trump campaign associate, despite admitting the dossier he said was salacious and unverified. But then he had already signed off on it. We also have breaking news on the immigration front tonight. Over the weekend, the president tweeted this, I'd be willing to shut down the government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for border security, which includes the wall. Must get rid of lottery, catch and release, and finally go to a system of immigration that is merit-based. We need great people coming into our country.

Everybody's going to be smeared. Buckle up. And guess what? The future of your country is at stake. If the Democrats win in November, this is their agenda. Take a close look right there. They want to rescind, they want their crumbs back. They want to rescind the tax cuts. They won't say it, they tell everyone to be quiet, but they want to impeach the president. Just don't tell the people. And, of course, they love their Obamacare, keep your doctor, keep your plan. I'd bet a lot of you are paying so much less, right? And they want to block Judge Kavanaugh. And, of course, they want to end all legitimate important investigations into the deep state and, yes, they want open borders. We know they want open border. They want to eliminate ICE.

All these things I find disconcerting. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, \"THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP\": Well, more than disconcerting. I find them unconstitutional. When members of the Justice Department seek a warrant and deliberately withhold the two most crucial pieces of information, namely that the dossier was paid for by people trying to defeat Donald Trump for president and withholding the fact that the credibility of the witness who was providing the information may turn on the fact that he claims he has evidence that Donald Trump engaged in these kind of salacious things with a bed and urine, if they had told that to the FISA court, the FISA court would totally discounted the credibility of this witness.

This print mediums are dying, right? CNN is losing to the Bob Ross reruns on PBS. Like people are watching beach house sales on HD TV from seven years ago rather than watching CNN. So you wonder why they sit around in a room and they say, OK. Like you have to believe you almost want to believe for the sins of rationality that they do believe it, even though it's crazy. Because they be insane otherwise."

When we come back, the great one Rush -- well, I say Mark is the great one and the great Rush Limbaugh on President Trump's threat to shut down the government over border security. That is next, what does he say, straight ahead."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Rush Limbaugh had a great take today on President Trump threatening to shut down the government. What Republicans and the base think about at? Let's take a look at."

      "speaker": "RUSH LIMBAUGH, TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Trump is showing he is not afraid of a government shutdown, which believed me, the base of this party loves. The base of the Republican Party -- we know now, by the way, when you have any poll that shows that Trump has 85 to 92 percent of the Republican Party, the Republican base is Trump's now. It's not a bunch of populist nationalists. It's a mainstream of the Republican Party that supports Trump. And they hate this cowering before the Democrats in the media over government shut downs. They hate giving up every policy idea in the face of the blackmail the government shutdowns. So they love Trump saying, he'd be willing to do it over this because the issue of immigration is what got him elected."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I'm with Rush. Shut it down. Shut it down. The people are with the president. All right. That's all the time we have left this evening. Remember, this show was always going to be fair and balanced. We are not and never will be the destroy-Trump media. We got a couple of big things coming up this week, I won't tell you now but I will tell you later in the week. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
