What really happened inside President Trump's explosive meeting with congressional leadership today. Pelosi and Schumer have their side of this story. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will give his in moments. Also, tonight, Judicial Watch is investigating about whether prominent conservatives including yours truly were unlawfully monitored at the request of ousted U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Tom Fitton is here with the shocking details. Plus, Raymond Arroyo breaks down the gaffetastic moments from last night's debate. And Tonya Reiman reveals why Democrats body language was the real story. But first, Trump wins another Democrat debate.

The AOC plus three party essentially believes that the American way of life in many ways has become evil and unsustainable. The candidates think Trump's a menace and he's got to go. But other than that, their policy prescriptions are kind of a mishmash. Biden thinks that if he wins, things will just magically go back to Obama. That whole era when Democrats were partying at the White House with Stevie Wonder and Tom Hanks. As for Warren and Sanders, they want to adopt a European style socialist approach which last time I checked isn't working anywhere in the world now.

Also, tonight, Judicial Watch is investigating about whether prominent conservatives including yours truly were unlawfully monitored at the request of ousted U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.

And Tonya Reiman reveals why Democrats body language was the real story. But first, Trump wins another Democrat debate. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Nearly three years ago, Donald Trump came to office and he promised peace and prosperity for America. And this he has delivered. Now even with a heavy anvil of the Mueller investigation tied around his neck, the President has worked tirelessly to drain the swamp with massive deregulation, phenomenal judges and a tax cut for working families. Markets are up, wages are up, unemployment is way down across all key demographic groups. And on foreign policy he has likewise been remarkably consistent on his pledge to put America first. He said, he was going to do this and he's doing it, he's winding down foreign entanglements, long-term military interventions that I seem to recall Democrats used to be against."

Well, by the end of the evening, it was obvious that the Democrats will say and do at this point almost anything including contort their own views on key issues just to oppose Trump. Now, I don't recall any of them voicing any great concern for what might happen to the Kurds back in 2012 when Obama drew his red line and didn't enforce it the Kurds were still implicated there, remember. Well, maybe it was because they started seeing polls on invading Syria and what were they like back then. Well consider what Gallup found, 68 percent to 24 percent of Americans oppose military action \"to attempt to end the conflict\" even if all economic and diplomatic efforts fail to end the civil war in Syria. So, have Americans today really become newly pro-interventionist. I don't think so. But the Democrats maybe they have all because that keeps them in opposition to Trump. The AOC plus three party essentially believes that the American way of life in many ways has become evil and unsustainable. The candidates think Trump's a menace and he's got to go. But other than that, their policy prescriptions are kind of a mishmash. Biden thinks that if he wins, things will just magically go back to Obama. That whole era when Democrats were partying at the White House with Stevie Wonder and Tom Hanks. As for Warren and Sanders, they want to adopt a European style socialist approach which last time I checked isn't working anywhere in the world now. Klobuchar, Buttigieg, well they're trying to hold themselves out I guess as more moderate, more reasonable Democrats. But neither of them can get out of single digits in the polls. Beto, he's basically a less interesting, a less intelligent AOC. Castro, he's a radical open borders nightmare. Booker thinks Democrats should just be nicer to each other, that's realistic. Well, they're all either running to be Vice President or they're running because they don't have anything better to do. I don't know. But CNN did try its best to help them all by staying away from certain topics altogether last night.

Talking about that small innocuous country called China mentioned a few times that was all in passing. So, we're supposed to take this crowd seriously.

No coherent trade policy except we'll work with the Europeans more, OK, like Obama didn't already try that and fail. They have no coherent health care policy and someone to abolish health insurance as you saw altogether wildly unpopular. Others want a hybrid of sorts but it's still a jumble. They have no plan to raise your standard of living that I can see.

They're defining themselves in a lot of other people out there are doing the same thing. But let's focus on the Democrats. They're defining themselves only through their opposition to Trump. Now they used to be skeptical of spy agencies and government surveillance, but they now embrace the deep state's powers. They used to be for better trade deals to help blue collar workers, but they won't support the USMCA. They used to be forgetting out of endless wars as I said, but now they want back in. There is no consistency whatsoever except on there's many - for abortion. It seems that I guess. Obama actually was a smart person. I didn't agree with him a lot, but really smart, incredibly talented politician. Elizabeth Warren, what am I missing? She cannot hold a candle to Obama. None of the Democrats that I can see on that stage can. The Democrats hate Trump but have a whole lot of nothing to replace him. And I think smart people in the party know it. Look at the new Moody's study out today. Their calculations show a 2020 map that looks like this. And when you step back and you looked at that field last night, on that Democrat debate stage, you can see why so many Democrats think impeachment even if it takes secret hearings is their only answer. And that's The Angle. All right, here to react Mercedes Schlapp, Senior Adviser to the Trump 2020 campaign along with Doug Schoen, Fox News Contributor and former Adviser for President Clinton.

MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER: Well, especially when Biden was supposed to be the strong competitor against the President. And what we're finding is, is he's getting weaker and weaker and especially when you're looking at the fact that he barely has cash on hand while you have these other candidates who are more extreme like a Warren, like a Sanders really taking off, getting small donor donations and also being able to push a much more radical agenda which is when you listen to them it's take away your private health insurance, raise your taxes, take away your guns.

She doesn't read it, she turns it over flat to show in the President's face, she's not going to read his letter. Then she starts to smile. The President calls her out, Nancy. Why are you laughing? This is a serious item. The General, the Joint Chief tells how he recommended to the President that he removed some of our men because they were in danger. He didn't want them to be harmed. We've got the Vice President over in Turkey trying to get a ceasefire and everything they care about is impeachment."

But I think basic American principles call for due process for fairness, not just to the minority, to the Republicans, but also for the president. This is the way we've done all the modern impeachment -- Watergate, Bill Clinton.  You had a vote in the House whether to start the proceedings, and then you had the minority had a right to subpoena and call witnesses, you have the White House is allowed to send representatives, and they're allowed to give alternative counts. Most importantly, you can't rush something like this. If you really want to do justice, if you really want to find out what happened, you have to take it slowly, give everyone a chance to interview witnesses."

As I've been saying and as they laid out at the top of the show, they are willing to abandon their entire belief system on foreign policy, on trade, on blue- collar workers, on the surveillance state. They upend everything for the noble goal that they believe is normal and imperative to remove Trump. So everyone thinks these are principled positions. Get out of town. It's ruthless, but don't call it principled. But Nancy Pelosi, John, said, it's our rules. We get to make up the rules, and all you people, Cipollone and you, saying there's no rules, there's no constitutional implications. This is just your dream fantasyland of some type of fairness rubric being foisted upon the impeachment process."

Why should he meet with people who called him all these names and are trying to unseat him from office based on so far it looks like flimsy evidence? I'm actually surprised President Trump does them the respect of having a meeting with them at all and gives them an opportunity. He actually gives them a forum to attack them. He doesn't have to do that. These are people who are trying to remove them from office and undo his election in 2016.

      "utterance": "More than a year ago, when basketball superstar LeBron James was trashing President Trump, I kind of warned him in a flip way about the perils of amateur punditry. LeBron took great umbrage to my suggestion.  It was a joke. But this week when he was asked to comment on the Chinese government's furious reaction to an NBA general manager's tweet supporting Hong Kong and the freedom movement there, LeBron kind of threw that sharp elbow."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So in other words, LeBron thought, kind of, that the Rockets' GM should Morey have shut up and managed. An uproar ensued, even among his most ardent supporters and fans. So yesterday, LeBron he tried to defend his pro-China stance."

      "speaker": "LEBRON JAMES, LOS ANGELES LAKERS FORWARD",
      "utterance": "It's a tough situation that we're all in right now. There's issues all over the world, and I think the best thing we can do is, if you feel passionate about it, talk about it.  If you're not, you don't have a lot of knowledge about it or you don't quite understand it, I don't think you should talk about it, because that just puts you in a tough position."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Especially LeBron, who if he speaks out against the Chinese regime would risk losing millions of dollars, more than any other player in the league, certainly. He has a massive deal with Nike and a big movie release in China waiting in the wings. All the money has made Mr. Social Justice rethink the wisdom of wading into politics, at least some politics.  And he is sounding a little bit more like me."

Also tonight, you heard what the 2020 Democratic candidates said last night during the debate, but there's a lot to learn from what they didn't say.  Joining me now, body language expert extraordinaire Tonya Reiman. All right, Tonya, let's start with the front runners. Let's do Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. So at the end of the night, it seemed tensions were getting kind of hot. This is a good old Joe addressing Liz."

    {
      "speaker": "TONYA REIMAN, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT",
      "utterance": "So the topping is authority, it's enforcing, it's I feel strong about this, but it's also anger. And when you're looking, see how his facial expression reads anger, and what did they do? They both pull apart and just release eye contact. And one of the things that Joe Biden makes a point of doing is pivoting his body towards the prison he is speaking to, and in this case, after he realized she was disrespecting him without even giving him eye contact, he pivots his body away as well."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "When you have your hand closed like this, it's more emphasis. So if you open up your hands, now you're really angry. This is more emphatic."

      "utterance": "Why was she up here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "So a lot of people don't understand her gestures, but her gestures actually follow her words. So when she's talking about, if you are up here financially, then her hand goes up here. And when she talks about what you need to do, she moves her hands in and out because that's her way of demonstrating the framing of her thought process. So her hand movements aren't really as wild as some might think they are. They're actually thought out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, I actually think some of the candidates, the hands don't go with the words, so I will take anything I can get at this point. All right, Tonya, how about this from Amy Klobuchar going after Warren."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, D-MINN., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "I'm tired of hearing whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that is going to do that."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "A little shaky in the voice and more pointing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Right. So when she gets, when she first starts off, Amy, she normally has a little bit shake to her voice, and then as she speaks a little bit more, gets a little bit comfortable, the shake tends to go away.  Then when she gets passionate or frustrated or angry, you hear the shake again, and here you even hear a little bit of a breathiness in her voice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tonya, you also pointed out Beto O'Rourke, speaking of someone who can't gesticulate in the right way, looking down after he got a shellacking from Mayor Pete. What does this tell us? Watch. It's just b- roll. We're just showing the b-roll of it. There it is. Look at it now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Here's the interesting thing. When we are watching, you have to realize, nonverbals, it's all about perception, right. So it's not that he was submissive in this clip. It's that people will perceive that looking down as a child now being scolded, because what Mayor Pete was saying was quite aggressive. So then he looks down and he kind of pouts his mouth, and then he starts shaking his head. See that slight head negation. So he came across as submissive even if that wasn't what he was intending to do, it's how we perceive it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I think the winner still, Tonya, is Joe's tomahawk chop at Elizabeth Warren. Do you think he did that -- maybe it was subconscious, but it looked like the Atlanta Braves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "He was angry."
