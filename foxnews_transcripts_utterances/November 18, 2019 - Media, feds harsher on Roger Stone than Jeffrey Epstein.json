      "utterance": "Well, good evening, and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson tonight.\" Things move fast in the AOC generation. History is 2017. So, for a little perspective, we're going to take you back -- Massachusetts unveiled her version of a Green New Deal, but this is for crime. It's a big plan. There's a lot -- we could spend all hour talking about it. But some of its provisions include these: ban life sentences -- all life sentences. Ban the prosecution of minors as adults. Okay. Legalize prostitution. Decriminalize the theft of -- quote -- necessary goods, remove police from public school, and far more. It even includes a provision for reparations based on skin color, for good measure. That was not clear what that has to do with justice, because, of course, it's the opposite of justice. Ian Samuel is a former Supreme Court clerk, and he joins us tonight. So, Ian, thanks so much for coming on. This is a big proposal. Some of it, probably, is non-crazy. A lot of it is crazy. I mean, it's sort of hard to generalize about it. But let's just take a couple issues in there --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ian Samuel",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "-- specifically, because I think they're interesting. One is decriminalizing prostitution. So, how can we be against human trafficking -- which is really another word for abetting prostitution -- and yet decriminalize prostitution? Is the idea that women are prostitutes because they want to be, because they think it's, like, a great deal for women? What is the idea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ian Samuel",
      "utterance": "Well, you don't have to necessarily believe that. Some people do think that, and I think there's reasonable disagreement about the extent to which anybody is really free when they're selling their [unintelligible] capitalism but that's kind of a side issue. But what you can ask is the best way to do something about human trafficking, to criminalize the people who are being trafficked and what they're doing? Or do you want to go after it at a different level? And to me it actually makes a great deal of sense to say if you're the person being trafficked we don't want to make your life worse we'd like to help you not threaten you with jail, we want to go after the people like, you know, Epstein, and you know, Trump and the Clintons and everybody else that's actually doing the trafficking."

      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "I guess here's the bottom-line principle, which is always true. When you criminalize something, you get less of it. Now, some things shouldn't be criminalized just on principle, but the truth is like cirrhosis deaths went way down under prohibition. No one wants to say that but it's real. So, if you legalize prostitution, when you legalize people camping on the sidewalk, you get a lot more of it, and that affects the lives of everyone else. So, what about their rights? I guess is my question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ian Samuel",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not sure you get a lot more or I mean of course you're going to have every policy is going to have some effect but the question you have to ask is putting somebody in a prison, a dungeon, that's a big, big idea, right? That's a big intervention and you have to ask is this, you know, say you've got somebody who's sleeping on the street or they're urinating in public because they don't have anywhere else to go to the bathroom. Now, I agree if you threaten to put those people in jail you may get a little less of it. But you have to ask, is that really the way you want to solve like public urination and not --"

      "utterance": "On the sidewalk?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ian Samuel",
      "utterance": "Which I agree with one thing you said, which is we can't have a society where we just treat as normal hey, a lot of people just have to go to the bathroom on the sidewalk because they don't have any other place to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "Right. Ian Samuel I just don't think the right answer is well, we're going to put you in jail, and you can go to the bathroom there. Like, that's a solution. It's just not a very good one. Nor is it particularly kind, Christian, or anything else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "And, actually, I'm not arguing for that. What I'm arguing is that when you \"decriminalize\" theft as they have in California what you're basically saying is the chaos that the tech oligarchy has given us is like totally normal and okay and if you complain about it you're against civil rights when in fact if you complain about it you're just a normal person who wants to live in an orderly clean society. Ian Samuel Well, are you going to criminalize the theft of bread? You don't like Les Miserables? I mean, what are you talking about? I mean, and by the way, the tech guys are the ones that hate the new San Francisco D.A. the most, which is a reason to love him if there ever was one."

On Friday Obama warned a room full of liberal donors that most voters out there actually don't want a radical revolution in America. Watch this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Barack Obama",
      "utterance": "We are bold in our vision. We also have to be rooted in reality. They like seeing things improve but the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "Now, you may have forgotten but Barack Obama won two elections in a row, pretty comfortably both times. Now he's too far right to get the democratic nomination. That's not speculation. It's literally true. The party's cadre of red guards would not have him. Case in point. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted this on Saturday, \"If being too far left # (illiterate) means believing health care is a human right future generations should live on a healthy planet, all student debt should be cancelled, minimum wage should be $15, lives depend on gun reform, and families don't belong in cages, count me in!\" arm flexing emoji. Richard Goodstein is a lawyer and former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton. He joins us tonight. So, are you for the exclamation point and the arm flexing emoji? Does that describe your feelings on the subject?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Richard Goodstein",
      "utterance": "I think in this case Ilhan Omar is really not in the mainstream of the Democratic Party. It's true. The Democrats do want health care which this administration is going to court to try to basically make sure tens of millions who got it thanks to the Affordable Care Act won't have it. Democrats do want to do something about gun violence, which this administration absolutely would rather not talk about, et cetera, but the way she's framed this issue is kind of crazy. It ignores the fact that she's in the majority because 40 Democrats beat Republicans in red districts as moderates, former military people, former intelligence people."

I think frankly Bernie Sanders brought Hillary Clinton down with him because he bad-mouthed her to the end and his supporters didn't vote. But -- but I tend to think, and the polls indicate what democratic voters in swing states want is somebody who's more moderate and somebody who's going to work with Republicans --"

It could be true. That's all ahead."

Even though his behavior was an open secret, he got away with it because he was affluent, and he had many powerful friends like Bill Clinton. Even after his suicide, we're still uncovering what went on. We still only know a fraction of it. But here's part of what we know. Prince Andrew, a member, of course, of the British royal family, was very close to Epstein during the period where he was abusing underage girls. Now, over the weekend, the prince gave a thoroughly bizarre interview, something you really have to see to believe, to the BBC, in which, among other things, he summarized Epstein's decades of abuse, and we're quoting now \"as unbecoming.\""

      "utterance": "There a lot of learning, a lot of teaching going on at Jeffrey Epstein's house, took on the island. Well, even though photographs show the prince with his arms around the waist of an Epstein accuser, prince says it wasn't him. It was probably faked."

      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the reasons that Prince Andrew has avoided answering the most basic questions for so long, of course, is because of the behavior of the news media, very much including ABC News in this country. They suppressed reporting into the Epstein scandal, apparently under pressure from the royal family. Now, just yesterday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to ABC News demanding answers in this story. Elizabeth Wagmeister has been following this from beginning. She's a senior variety correspondent at Variety, and she joins us tonight. So, Elizabeth, thanks for coming on. What is this letter from the House minority leader say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Elizabeth Wagmeister",
      "utterance": "He is demanding answers from ABC. So, he said, \"Why did you not air this interview?\" Which Amy Robach, she, of course, was caught on a hot mike. We spoke about that a few weeks ago, Tucker, where she said that she had an accuser of Jeffrey Epstein. She says she had all the goods that was ready for air, of course, at the time. ABC said it was not ready for air. So, in this letter, he's asking, why was this hidden? And will you send this interview to Congress so that we can see it? He's asking for all of the answers because there's many, many questions. And he even goes as far to say that over the years since this interview was conducted, that if the interview did air, it could have possibly prevented more underage women from being sexually trafficked."
    },

      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",

      "speaker": "Elizabeth Wagmeister",
      "utterance": "They have not. So, I reached out to ABC, Tucker. They are declining comment. But what I will tell you, because, of course, at the time when Amy Robach's video leaked, ABC said it was not ready for air. And they also pointed out we have not shied away from covering the Jeffrey Epstein saga. Well, I have to tell you this morning, of course, I tuned into Good Morning America. They did cover the Prince Andrew interview at length. They spent about 10 minutes on it. So, they weren't shying away from covering that now, which I think was a very clear, obvious step to say, look, we are covering it."
    },

      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Elizabeth Wagmeister",
      "utterance": "They have not addressed that on the air. Also, this morning, you know, Amy Robach, she was not the one to present the story. I guess that could have been a little awkward, you know. But, Tucker, I want to get back to Prince Andrew's interview. You were just going through some of the most bizarre moments. What should they? It was one after the other. It's perplexing how this even happened. The interview actually occurred in Buckingham Palace, which signals that the queen did approve this interview. It seems like he went through absolutely no coaching. He had no empathy. He didn't even mention any of the victims. One of the most bizarre parts, though, is when he said that he has a medical condition where he cannot sweat because the victim had mentioned in many of her accusations, she said that at one point she was dancing at a nightclub with him in London and that he was sweaty. So, he's going as far to come up with these bizarre, bizarre excuses. Now, another thing that you brought up. He said that he doesn't even know this woman. And then, of course, there's that infamous photo with his arm around her. He says it's photo shopped. I mean, it's like he's hanging out with Lori Loughlin or something. It's bizarre what he's been saying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "[laughing] Can't sweat. He has a medical condition. So that's what we've heard from the BBC. Again, treat yourself. It's on our Facebook page for our viewers who want to see the rest. Elizabeth, thanks so much for that."

      "utterance": "Well, there is an investigation into how exactly Jeffrey Epstein died while in custody in Manhattan prison. According to reports, federal charges are imminent against the guards were supposed to be guarding Jeffrey Epstein. Reportedly, the guards have already declined a plea deal offer. Ed Gavin is a former NYPD officer, now works as a private investigator and joins us tonight. Ed, thanks so much for coming on."

      "utterance": "So, these guards, I mean, even the mayor of New York, who I think is usually kind of out of it, Bill de Blasio, weighed in and seemed to kind of attack these guards. Tell us what charges they may be facing and what it means that they declined a plea deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ed Gavin",
      "utterance": "Well, if they're facing charges, it would be for failing to efficiently perform their duties as correction officers. They're required to make tours at frequent intervals. I believe in the special housing area every half hour. But it could be a fishing expedition on the part of the feds, too, because I think if they had enough evidence to make the arrest, they probably would have collared these officers already. And if their attorneys are telling them not to take the plea deal, there's got to be something more to it. Now, if the cameras weren't working, that's to their advantage. I mean, they can say, look, I made, we made our tours every half hour. The cameras aren't working. Unless they're going to interview inmates, and they're going to take the words of inmates. And if the inmates can say, \"Well, the officers were sleeping, or all the officers were making their required tours of inspection.\" It all depends on what the investigation shows."

      "speaker": "Tucker Carlson",
      "utterance": "You have a very high-profile prisoner whose life has apparently been threatened. Before the purported suicide, he was quoted as saying he feared for his life. How strange is it in your view that there were no cameras trained on his cell or in the hallway outside?"
    },
    {

      "utterance": "Well, it's patently outrageous. I mean, you have a special housing area, and he's arguably probably the most high-profile pretrial detainee in federal BOP history. Now, I mean, the feds messed this up from the onset. I mean, initially this individual, Mr. Epstein, was placed in a cell with Nicholas Tartaglione who is a former Briar Cliff Manor police officer who was charged in a quadruple murder. He was in protective custody as a police officer. He was taken out of protective custody and he immediately received a wantonly gratuitous beating to the point where they had to put a metal plate in his orbital. So, why would you put Jeffrey Epstein in a cell with this guy? You know, I mean, Jeffrey Epstein for all intents and purpose is a sex offender. He's a second-time offender and you're going to put him in a cell with this guy? That didn't make any sense. And then to take him off of suicide watch. That doesn't make any sense at all. What he should've done -- what should've happened is he should've been taken to a municipal hospital like Belleview where he could've been evaluated by a psychiatrist and that didn't happen. So, what do they do? They put him in a cell by himself, okay? And they put him on a floor with a correctional officer who is not even a certified correction officer and then you have Michael Baden, a world-renowned pathologist, he comes along. He looks at Jeffrey Epstein. He does his own independent autopsy and he's done -- he's been doing this for 50 years. He's done over 20,000 autopsies, and Michael Baden determines that the injuries that Jeffrey Epstein sustained are not consistent with suicide by hanging but rather suicide by strangulation. So, the only thing that I can think that might've happened is maybe the officers won't doing their jobs. Maybe they were sleeping. Maybe unknown, you know, individuals, inmates, officers, civilians, I don't know, went into Jeffrey Epstein's cell, strangled him and then put a ligature around his neck to make it seem like he was hung, like there was a hanging. I mean, what else could possibly have gone wrong there?"

      "utterance": "Roger Stone was convicted in federal court last week on seven felony charges stemming from the since closed Russia collusion investigation. Stone's main crime was lying to Congress about who he had or had not spoken to about Russia. By the time Stone's trial began in Washington the larger scandal that ensnared him had long been debunked. Nobody was talking about WikiLeaks anymore. Nobody cared. And yet prosecutors continued zealously as if it were still 2017. For lying about something that is now officially irrelevant, they argued that Roger Stone should spend up to 50 years in prison, effectively the rest of his natural life. Now, at the very moment prosecutors were making that case that Stone's misstatements ought to be a death penalty offense, Congressman Adam Schiff was busy lying to the rest of us about new things, some of which actually mattered. Schiff didn't seem worried about his lying. He knew he would never be prosecuted for it. In Washington dishonestly is strictly a one-way offense. Yet despite the obvious irony of all of this Roger Stone was convicted anyway. And official Washington cheered. \"Rot in hell,\" they screamed on Twitter, obvious to karma, which by the way is real. What's interesting about the response to Stone's case, both from federal prosecutors and from the conventional opinion makers on television is how much harsher and more outraged it was that anything that greeted convicted child molester Jeffrey Epstein. Do you think George Stephanopoulos would even consider having dinner at Roger Stone's house? Well, of course not. That would be immoral. FBI officials apparently agree with that. You remember what happened when Roger Stone was arrested earlier this year? Dozens of federal agents with automatic weapons, armored vehicles, and a helicopter descended on his home in a middle-class part of Fort Lauderdale and rousted the 66-year-old and his wife from bed at rifle point. And just to make sure the event inflicted maximum humiliation, the feds tipped off CNN, which was there to capture the whole thing live, which they did. That's how our government treated a man facing perjury charges. Now, Jeffrey Epstein, by contrast, was accused of molesting at least 34 separate underage girls. How was he arrested? Actually, that's a trick question. He wasn't arrested. According to the New York Times account, prosecutors called Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer and politely asked him to turn himself in, which Epstein politely did. Nobody tipped off CNN. In fact, just the opposite happened. Authorities tried to keep the whole thing secret in order to preserve Jeffrey Epstein's dignity. One prosecutor wrote to Jeffrey Epstein's attorney, Jay Lefkowitz, assuring him that in order to \"avoid the press\" she could \"file the charge in district court in Miami, which will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.\" Now, that's pretty thoughtful treatment for a child molester. Ultimately Epstein got a plea deal in which all federal charges against him were dropped, all of them. The arrangement was kept secret from Epstein's victims so they wouldn't be able to complain about it or contest that agreement in court. Epstein received just 18 months but instead of being sent to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida, he served his term in a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade. That was a massive improvement over ordinary lockup. But even that wasn't lenient enough for Jeffrey Epstein. After just three and a half months in custody Epstein was freed on work release. That means he was able to leave the grounds for 12 hours a day six days a week. Now, sex offenders are not by rule allowed to get work release. They're ineligible for it. But authorities gave it to Epstein anyway. Apparently, they liked him. The authorities don't like Roger Stone. He did something worse than molesting children. He mocked the people in charge and then helped get Donald Trump elected president. For that Roger Stone is likely to die in prison. Just so you know the rules in this country. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a small city in the Midwest, is having a ton of success with affluent donors on Wall Street. African American voters don't like him, though, at least according to the numbers. He's trying to win them over. How's that going so far? The hilarious results after the break."

It's more like a series of expletives, but it's a problem, is the bottom line. Obviously a problem. So, to fix this problem. Buttigieg has released a something called the Douglass Plan, as in Frederick Douglass, for achieving racial harmony of sorts. Well, the plan was illustrated with a photograph of a black woman and her child. The problem is the picture was of people in Kenya, not the United States. And then last week, Buttigieg released a list of 400 black South Carolinians he claims have endorsed him and his Douglass plan. The problem? A lot of the people on the list appear to be surprised that they're there, and in the most hilarious detail of the year so far, almost half of them are actually white.

You can't actually detect where 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black. You can't find a voter. He's got less support than Marianne Williamson. I didn't even know she was still in the race until they took this poll. So what's fascinating is, though. So you look, what's the difference between 25 percent in Iowa and 0 percent in South Carolina? And this New York Times columnist the other day wrote this long column saying that it's totally racist of white liberals to suggest that the lack of support for Mayor Pete in South Carolina is because of black homophobia. Now, I'd like, you know, I'm not I'm not a Democrat voter. So I don't have a dog in this fight. But it does suggest that actually aligning all the identity politics points is quite tricky. They'd love someone who's -- they're not interested in Elizabeth Warren because every other country has had a female prime minister. A female president."

Dzhokhar claims his violent and domineering older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the one who pushed him into taking part in the attack. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a shootout with police a few days after the Boston bombing. We already knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his friend were suspects in a triple murder two years before the marathon bombing but newly unsealed documents show that a month after the Boston bombings Tsarnaev's friend Ibragim Todashev who was also killed by law enforcement, gave specific details about the triple homicide saying he and Tsarnaev bound, beat, and slit the throats of three young men in Waltham, Massachusetts. Todashev went on to say he and Tsarnaev spent more than an hour trying to clean up the scene but experts point out there were clear links between Tsarnaev and the murders that police overlooked, and instead they blamed them on gang activity, even though Tamerlan Tsarnaev was already a bright light on the FBI's radar. In fact, in 2011 Russia warned the FBI that Tsarnaev appeared to be radicalizing and former FBI director Robert Mueller also acknowledged that prior to the Boston bombing Tsarnaev came to the attention of the FBI on at least two occasions, but no action was taken so the new information about the triple murder begs the question again could the Boston bombings have been prevented.
