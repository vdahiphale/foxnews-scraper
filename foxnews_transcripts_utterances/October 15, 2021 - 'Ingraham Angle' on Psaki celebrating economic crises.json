Police arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of murder and recovered a knife at the scene. Authorities believe the attacker acted alone. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE.

Last year when teachers' unions were refusing to come into work, Lightfoot, she backed down, she let the teachers walk all over her and further destroy the education system in Chicago, of course. But now when a mandate could actually threaten the safety and security of her citizens and then put thousands of officers out of a job, she is just pushing with all of her might. Don't forget this, Chicago. Now while many Democrat-run cities are seeing double digit increases in murders, homicides are only up about 1.5 percent in Chicago. Well, that's just because the windy city was already so violent that even this year's crime surge is just a blip on the radar. And according to \"The Chicago Sun- Times,\" Chicago has seen more than 500 murders each year for the past four years. This year has seen more than 630 people killed and more than 2,000 shot. And beyond the obvious pain and suffering, these horrifying stats reveal a city in decline. You've got the schools in decay, finances upside down, a populous literally fleeing for other states. But my next guest has a plan to save it. Joining us now is Matt Rosenberg, who lived in Chicago for 30 years. He just recently wrote a book titled \"What Next, Chicago? Notes of a Pissed Off Native Son.\" Matt, I don't like the phrase \"pissed off\" but I understand why you're use it here. How can Chicago be saved when it seems like they're cycling the same time of ineffective, radical, political leaders in election cycle after election cycle? MATT ROSENBERG, \"WHAT NEXT, CHICAGO?\" AUTHOR:  I think the first thing we can do is reschedule our municipal elections. They're held in odd numbered years in the early months of the year. We only have 33 percent voter turnout compared to 70 percent for presidential elections. That has to be changed through state law. We also need to pay more attention to judicial elections in order to reform bail reform. The revolving door policy for violent criminals that we're all too familiar with can be turned around if we put judges in office who understood that serious crimes require serious punishment. Then you turn to public education. Mayor Lightfoot agreed to a cap on charter school growth. That's all wrong.",

The media have actually helped dig the hole that Biden's now standing in. Same for his party leaders on Capitol Hill and throw in the Federal Reserve while you're at it.

Meanwhile, Biden is just kind of shuffled from one lame controlled event to another, always surrounded by his protective press cocoon. This bunch Biden's got running our country isn't just asleep at the wheel. It's not even in the car. Yesterday, we discovered that Mayor Pete is on paternity leave. OK, on big deal. I mean, people take maternity and paternity leave. OK, big deal. It's not like he has one of those important cabinet positions. I mean, he's only the Secretary of Transportation when we have historic delays at major ports in the United States. Remember, his big solution though for addressing the jam-ups, apprenticeships. Now, the public considers these people such inconsequential figures at this point. I think anyone really even noticed that Buttigieg has been on baby leave since mid August. But it sure tells you a lot about their sense of urgency about the problems directly affecting the American people, the working people who are really hurting.

And I want you to keep your eye on Virginia's governor's race. This could be the bellwether you've been waiting for. A new Fox News poll has Democrat Terry McAuliffe with just a slight lead over Republican Glenn Youngkin. But that's not McAuliffe's only problem. According to The New York Times, he's straining to motivate the liberal voters in increasingly blue state. Hey, Virginia, it's time to save yourselves. If you let another four years go by under a democratic governor, you're going to see the terrible trend lines for schools, energy prices and crime continue. Look at out far also that the left pushed Newsom to go after he beat that recall. Imagine where Terry is going to take the state, if he's given the green light. Radicals rule the Democrat Party. Don't forget, it's not Bill Clinton's anymore. Democrats do know it is looking grim out there in the Old Dominion. That makes me smile. Just today, a Loudoun County School Board Member resigned and the superintendent who allegedly helped cover up those sexual assaults there issued an after-the-fact apology. Well, that's nice. Very special. But it's only because this show and others did the job the pro-Biden media refused to do. Here's hoping this obvious example of Keister covering during a tightly contested election backfires as well. Joining me now, Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary; Charlie Hurt, Washington Times opinion editor; and Jason Chaffetz, former Utah Congressman, all our Fox News contributors. Ari, let's start with you. All the Biden disasters we've seen from the border to Afghanistan and beyond that. Now, it could be inflation that ends up bringing him down and the Democrats down. Back in the spring, they were saying, 'Oh, this is just transitory'. Not so - it doesn't look like it now."

You know, the problem with inflation, most people don't remember what it was like, because last time we had it, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were president. It eats at consumers by the tens of millions every day. That's the problem with inflation. Every time somebody fills your tank with gas, buys coffee, orange juice, pays rent, this winter with the home heating bills and natural gas. This is a daily piece of pain. And that's why inflation is so rough on tens of millions of people. It is one of the worst political problems anybody can have. It's why Jimmy Carter went into oblivion. And this is going to dog Joe Biden."

And they don't want to do that, because that's going to tank the market. So they're in a catch 22. And, Charlie, today Biden was in my old home state of Connecticut.

And by the way, let's also remember, that's highly unlikely, especially when I think we all can sort of safely bet that Democrats will not be in control, certainly not as much of control of Washington in two years, or a year from now as they are right now. So, that's wishful thinking on his part. And let's not forget, of course, a big reason that why we are seeing this inflation is because of this ridiculous amount of spending out of Washington that all of which cheapens the value of your buying power of the money that people have in their pockets. And I think people definitely understand that. And that's why Democrats and Joe Biden in that speech today was talking about this. Talking about how, oh well, we want to lower the price of childcare. Well, everybody wants to lower the price of childcare. Of course, we would all love that. The problem is, can you do it? What are your plans for doing it? And when they go to the gas pump, and they go to the grocery store, and they see that buying hamburger for their family is $7 a pound, or a package of bacon is $7 a pound. The idea that they're going to somehow do something to lower the price of--"

You know, I heard Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate very articulately say this week, that the reason things are gone to the point they are in Virginia is why Republicans were just regularly conservatives living their life, the Democrats stacked school boards everywhere with liberals and woke progressives. And now when we had COVID, parents were home and saw what their children were going through when we heard about school boards now, that an alleged rape took place and the school board suppressed the public information about it. So this is a righteous anger. We're seeing now conservative grassroots activism that is unlike Republicans. There's protest in the streets to show up at school boards. I've never seen such a passionate grassroots base. It reminds me of the Tea Party of 2010. It's genuine, it's raw, and it certainly is happening in Virginia."

And to listen to somebody like Terry McAuliffe say, parents should have no say and what - I mean, he said that openly in a debate, that parents should not be telling schools what it is they should be teaching their children.

This big spending agenda of Biden, the Democrats, has hit yet another snag. It's called the American people. Well, it turns out after nine months of Joe Biden, Americans are once again clamoring for their government to do less. The Washington Post notes that, \"Since 1992, Gallup has been asking whether government should do more to solve the country's problems. When late last year, 54 percent said they wanted more from the government. A month ago, only 43 percent did.\" Joining me now, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, I mean, look, it was the middle of COVID and all that, but it's still a stunning data point in the middle of this attempted spendorama that Biden's trying to pull out of his hat."

Because we were alarmed that the trend lines were going up, with people wanting more and more so-called free things, wanting to experiment with socialism. But I think now we've seen eight, nine months of big government socialism coming from Biden, and people are starting to understand that there are consequences. One of the consequences is prices are rising. We've had the highest increase now on the cost of living for social security. But the question is, will it keep up with prices? What if prices go up 10 percent next year? What happens to those on social security and those of lower wage income? So, yes, I think the results are coming in. Big government, socialism doesn't work. And people are unhappy with it. But this is important for people to know. But they also need to know the history of socialism that every time it's been tried in world history, it always ends up with state- sponsored authoritarianism and violence. So it's not a pleasant system to live in. But it's also economically a terrible system, if you want to try to get ahead for you and your family."

But now a judge is demanding an investigation. \"U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth of Washington acted after finding that jail officials failed to turn over information needed to approve surgery, recommended four months ago for a January 6 Capitol riot defendant's broken wrist.\" Senator, fairly appalling. Your response?"

    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Look, my initial impression of January 6 is people who were fighting with the police, shouldn't have. And people who entered, shouldn't have. But I keep hearing all of these cases. I met a woman this weekend, who's a journalist, who has podcasts, has been on television, she's on a no fly list and was yanked off of a plane, never been charged. But this is the kind of stuff happening. I met a young man, who works in Washington in his early 20s. He's been fired, uprooted, and now has lost his job. The pictures of him as he's wandering through walking past some policemen who never tell him to leave. Now, I'm not saying he did was right to walk in when he shouldn't have, but he's walking in, he's not even yelling, talking to anybody. He's not - he is just curious and walking around, and he's sort of swept up by this crowd. So for justice not to differentiate between people who sort of wandered in and people who were fighting with the police, there really is a big difference. And I am worried about what we're doing to these people. And I can tell you for one that the mob that attacked my wife and I, that bloodied a policeman and caused a laceration above his eye, nothing happened to him. No investigation of how they got to Washington, who paid for their hotel rooms, who's paying for all the stuff they're doing. Nothing."

And meanwhile, the Biden administration - we know they're not using accountability. Instead, they end up rewarding bad actors, senator, because we just learned the administration is restored former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe's pension. The settlement deal reached this week removes McCabe's FBI record any references to having been fired restores his retirement money. Senator, we just have - yes, we just had this marine Lieutenant Colonel Scheller, looks like he's going to suffer. But I guess, McCabe, no."

But you have the Department of Justice with Merrick Garland now saying, that if you're a mom, and you're a little bit irate about what they're teaching your kids at school, or the fact that they're mandating them to be vaccinated, if you are irate and upset and raise your voice, you might be - you just might be a domestic terrorist. Former President George Bush chiming in and comparing moms at these rallies to and at these school board meetings to domestic terrorists. It is awful. But you need to be aware that your government can listen to every phone call, can discover everything about you, yank you off a plane, prevent you from flying, and that is not the America that I want to live in.

But no one on sort of the preserve statue's side is trying to take Jefferson out of the context that he was a slave owner, or that slavery is bad. What the left is trying to do is rewrite history and tear down statues from prominent places, sort of, erasing his legacy on American history. By the way, Laura, the republic that he helped found it is working out pretty well for people, the bill of rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom from quartering troops in your house. All of these things have worked out pretty well for New Yorkers, and that's why he was given a spot in the city council chamber."

I don't give him any props for that, because that's not how you look at history. You look at history in the full lens. So he's opening the door for the removal of other statues with perhaps the balance isn't exactly as obvious as it is in Jefferson's case. So, maybe next year, the balance will tip against Jefferson, or another historical figure. But de Blasio is just - he knows this is a disaster. He probably wants it rip down. That's my view."

      "speaker": "BORELLI",
      "utterance": "No, no, you're 100 percent right. He is someone that really is behind all this. He appointed all the people to this Public Design Commission. So there is no tearing down Jefferson's statue without Bill de Blasio's go ahead. But the City Council, which is where this statue was located, in 2018, honored a guy named Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a Haitian founding father, who massacred 5,000 men, women and children that were French colonials. So, just because characters are complex, isn't necessarily a problem for the City Council and city government. It just seems that the woke left is only focused on a certain class of people, the people that probably did more than anyone else to make the country what it is, the founding fathers. And now, we're left at this juncture, where history is being literally torn from a building, which has stood for almost 200 years."

That they suffer from internalized racial inferiority, that they're filled with self loathing, and rage, and hatred, that they're incapable of seizing opportunity. It's really an all around bad deal for everyone. The only people it's good for are the executives. They get to get a pat on the back, they get to be lauded in the media for being pioneers of social justice. Well, they're denigrating their hourly rate - hourly wage employees as white supremacists and hapless human beings. It's a scandal and they have to stop."

It's basically a list of steps that they need to take to accept their guilt and shame and embrace collective action, where White can do right now. Now, Chris, I'd like them to try that over at Walmart on the people who actually patronize Walmart who happen to be white. Maybe they should -- before they spend their hard-earned money at Walmart, they should go through this training as well. How do you think that would go over?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUFO",
      "utterance": "I don't think it would go over very well. The average customer from Walmart, for Walmart, rather, is a working-class white American. And the training program makes it quite clear, Walmart believes that those people are white supremacists, they're racist, they're oppressive, and they have to accept their complicity in a racist country before they can actually pass through the stage of learning that whites cannot do right until they become, quote-unquote, anti-racist, adopt leftwing ideology. And only then, Walmart says in their training program, can white can do right. It's inherently bad. You have to overcome and abolish your own whiteness just to be a real human being. This is what is happening in Bentonville, Arkansas, at Walmart's headquarters. It has to be exposed."

Girls devoured the \"Harry Potter\" books and movies. How about this set? Does this discourage girls from playing with Legos? The truth is, Lego is just trying to expand its audience share. They did a survey and they found 76 percent of parents encouraged their sons to play with Legos while only 24 percent encourage their daughters to do so. Now the company says it's their job to encourage boys and girls to play with sets that are traditionally viewed as not for them. Are America girl dolls going to drop their gender bias? How about Disney princesses? There are gender specific toys that boys and girls are instinctively attracted to."

We had a special meeting last night of membership, and it was unanimous across the board -- hold the line, don't bend. It's not John Catanzara -- it's not John Catanzara pushing this. John Catanzara is the mouthpiece for the FOP members who want something done on their behalf."

She filed an injunctive complaint against Catanzara, writing \"As Chicago's mayor, I cannot and will not stand idly by while the rhetoric of conspiracy theorists threaten the health and safety of Chicago's residents and first responders. Catanzara has time and again deliberately misled our police officers by lying about the requirements of the policy and falsely claiming that there will be no repercussions if officers are insubordinate and refuse to follow and city and department directive or order.\" Shortly after the injunction was announced, Catanzara responded."

We also are filing -- and already have this drafted, our own TRO to compel the city to go to interest arbitration. They have done everything but negotiate in good faith, regardless of what the mayor says."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Good for Catanzara, fighting back. It's here where we should remind you where Lori Lightfoot's loyalties lie. Last year when teachers' unions were refusing to come into work, Lightfoot, she backed down, she let the teachers walk all over her and further destroy the education system in Chicago, of course. But now when a mandate could actually threaten the safety and security of her citizens and then put thousands of officers out of a job, she is just pushing with all of her might. Don't forget this, Chicago. Now while many Democrat-run cities are seeing double digit increases in murders, homicides are only up about 1.5 percent in Chicago. Well, that's just because the windy city was already so violent that even this year's crime surge is just a blip on the radar. And according to \"The Chicago Sun- Times,\" Chicago has seen more than 500 murders each year for the past four years. This year has seen more than 630 people killed and more than 2,000 shot. And beyond the obvious pain and suffering, these horrifying stats reveal a city in decline. You've got the schools in decay, finances upside down, a populous literally fleeing for other states. But my next guest has a plan to save it. Joining us now is Matt Rosenberg, who lived in Chicago for 30 years. He just recently wrote a book titled \"What Next, Chicago? Notes of a Pissed Off Native Son.\" Matt, I don't like the phrase \"pissed off\" but I understand why you're use it here. How can Chicago be saved when it seems like they're cycling the same time of ineffective, radical, political leaders in election cycle after election cycle? MATT ROSENBERG, \"WHAT NEXT, CHICAGO?\" AUTHOR:  I think the first thing we can do is reschedule our municipal elections. They're held in odd numbered years in the early months of the year. We only have 33 percent voter turnout compared to 70 percent for presidential elections. That has to be changed through state law. We also need to pay more attention to judicial elections in order to reform bail reform. The revolving door policy for violent criminals that we're all too familiar with can be turned around if we put judges in office who understood that serious crimes require serious punishment. Then you turn to public education. Mayor Lightfoot agreed to a cap on charter school growth. That's all wrong."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Last January, Lori Lightfoot said that she plans on having a reunion weekend for black Chicagoans who fled the city. And she said \"We've lost a lot of population over the last ten plus year. People leaving Chicago, particularly black Chicago, going to other places in the country. We have got to change that. We open back up, we're going to be heavily marketing to all areas of the country that know that Chicago, the diaspora has gone too and saying come back home. Give us another look.\" Well, Matt, she's announcing a P.R. campaign to bring people home. What is so wrong about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENBERG",
      "utterance": "Sadly, Laura, this is the strategy in Chicago City Hall, to try and soundbite your way out of egregious misgovernance. I think there's no chance at all that a P.R. campaign is going to turn things around. What we need are safe streets, more foot patrols by the police. We need a chief judge of Cook County to replace Tim Evans, the guy who instituted the bail reform in 2017. We need a far better Cook County state's attorney than Kim Foxx, who has never seen a dismissed prosecution that she didn't like. We need somebody running the city, our owner Eric Adams, if you will, who will take on the teachers' union. It's going to take a lot to turn the tide."
