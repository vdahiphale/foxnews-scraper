      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to my show. That's right, my show, Timpf, exclamation point. You might be asking, Where's Greg Gutfeld? You'd be asking the wrong person. That's a question for my lawyer. Gloria Allred. And that is all I will say about that, other than to remind you that it is very hard to be charged with murder if they never find a body. Anyway, it's great to be back. I hope you all had a great Christmas. Or if you're like me, a great COVID. Yes, I had COVID, which was a great way to finish the year. That started with me also having COVID. So let's do the math here. I know Greg's out there saying Kat can't do math, because he's definitely watching, has definitely not been dead for a week already. Must there's been an awful coincidence. So this year, I had two COVIDs. I also had two COVID shots. Two plus two equals four. As in, forget about all of this (BLEEP) following all of the rules and regulations failed me more than the dare program. I am over it. And I bet you are too. I mean, I'm not the only one who had COVID over Christmas. Lots of people did. Unvaccinated people, COVID. Vaccinated people, COVID. Boosted people also COVID. This Christmas COVID was more popular than robbing a Bloomingdale's with 30 of your closest friends. It hasn't gone anywhere. Just yesterday, the United States set a new record of COVID cases. That's despite our leaders telling us repeatedly that if we just did the right things COVID would be behind us. We just got the shots. We just closed our businesses and schools. If we just stayed inside of our homes, instead of indulging in luxuries like basic human interaction and gainful employment, we would defeat this virus. They should feel lucky they work for the government because if they didn't, they get fired. They were so wrong. And so like Greg Gutfeld, making his nine million drug use joke about his talented and brilliant cohost. It's time to admit that what they're doing isn't working and they really need to lay off. Joe Biden was almost there. Almost. On Monday, he admitted this.",

Jen Psaki has since tried to walk Biden's comments back saying the full context shows that he really meant federal and state governments need to work together. But it's also wrong to suggest that state rules are the answer. In New York City, we have some of the strictest and yet we celebrated Christmas Eve by setting a new COVID case record. Other strict states like Massachusetts and New Jersey did the same. So what does that tell you? You should be done with their rules and find out what works for you. Who else you got to listen to?

Worse. These quarantine rules would also include people like me who don't need a booster shot, because their booster shot was getting COVID and having to spend Christmas doing this.",

And I've also probably had at least 47 COVID exposures on my way to work today. So if I were to actually follow these new quarantine rules, you guys would never see me again. Much like you may never see Gutfeld again. But that does not mean he's dead. Of course, immunity isn't perfect either. If it were, I wouldn't have had two COVIDs. But saying it shouldn't be taken into account at all is stupid. And yes, vaccination can be a smart choice. Vaccinated people are still faring better than those who are unvaccinated when it comes to hospitalization and death. And if you're worried about those things, that could be the right choice for you. But the choice is the point. It should be your choice and your choice alone. And I'm not just saying that because I'm a mostly lawless heathen. He thinks almost everything should be your choice. Now with the Omicron variant, the science shows that vaccinated, even boosted vaccination can't stop you from contracting and spreading it, which was their entire justification for these mandates in the first place. We're entering into our third year of living like this, and I am not doing it. I've been married for seven months now. Costing Vegas millions. And I still haven't been able to have a honeymoon because of all the fears about planning a trip with all the rules changing all the time.

And I'm done listening to anyone who can't recognize that. The truth is what do we do about COVID? Should mean you and the people you live with? Should mean you and your doctor or you in the voices inside your head? It should not mean you and the rules your government imposes on you, must you want to lose your job or the ability to move around what is supposed to be a free country. Schoolhouse Rock never mentioned your rights can be trampled if one politician declares an emergency. And there is a 40-year- old reference in honor of Greg Gutfeld, who is probably still alive. So, like Chris Cuomos' future COVID is not going anywhere. Leaders and experts would be smart to focus on treatments instead of restrictions that do less good than searching my apartment for any evidence connected to Greg's disappearance.",

It's stricter rules, it's more laws, it's a bigger government encroachment into your life. And the media gives them a pass. They say this year or this month that -- oh, he reassured governor's as coronavirus surges. When President Trump did literally the exact same thing when he left it to the states to make their own public health decisions that same New York Times said he was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic.

I'm about to tell you what she shared. So, it's your chance to change the channel. If you don't want to hear any more about a young man swinging around town spraying secretions everywhere. And I don't mean Pete Davidson. All right, a few more sec -- OK. It's enough. You're old enough. Also, if you're old enough to be up this late, you are too old for Spider Man anyway. OK. According to The New York Post, which is owned by our parent company, Lane Bryant, Kim shared some screenshots of the film from her private theater on her Instagram story. The picture is revealed that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are in the movie. And I don't know why that matters, because I'm an adult. But some dudes who work for this show told me that it does matter. That conversation was also the closest any of them have ever been to a girl. So, there you go. So, Kim, she later deleted the photos, but it was too late. People were furious, tweeted one person, \"I thought the Spider Man ending would get ruined from a lot of places on social media for me, but never in @KimKardashian Insta Stories. Nothing says privilege, like getting a movie in your own private theater and spoiling it for those of us who are trying to stay home and safe. Sounds like someone's just pissed they don't have a private theater. But since it's all spoiled at this point, let's just watch the end of the movie now.",

That's a question for my lawyer. Gloria Allred. And that is all I will say about that, other than to remind you that it is very hard to be charged with murder if they never find a body. Anyway, it's great to be back. I hope you all had a great Christmas. Or if you're like me, a great COVID. Yes, I had COVID, which was a great way to finish the year. That started with me also having COVID. So let's do the math here. I know Greg's out there saying Kat can't do math, because he's definitely watching, has definitely not been dead for a week already. Must there's been an awful coincidence. So this year, I had two COVIDs. I also had two COVID shots. Two plus two equals four. As in, forget about all of this (BLEEP) following all of the rules and regulations failed me more than the dare program. I am over it. And I bet you are too. I mean, I'm not the only one who had COVID over Christmas. Lots of people did. Unvaccinated people, COVID. Vaccinated people, COVID. Boosted people also COVID. This Christmas COVID was more popular than robbing a Bloomingdale's with 30 of your closest friends. It hasn't gone anywhere. Just yesterday, the United States set a new record of COVID cases. That's despite our leaders telling us repeatedly that if we just did the right things COVID would be behind us. We just got the shots. We just closed our businesses and schools. If we just stayed inside of our homes, instead of indulging in luxuries like basic human interaction and gainful employment, we would defeat this virus. They should feel lucky they work for the government because if they didn't, they get fired. They were so wrong. And so like Greg Gutfeld, making his nine million drug use joke about his talented and brilliant cohost. It's time to admit that what they're doing isn't working and they really need to lay off.

But it's also wrong to suggest that state rules are the answer. In New York City, we have some of the strictest and yet we celebrated Christmas Eve by setting a new COVID case record. Other strict states like Massachusetts and New Jersey did the same. So what does that tell you? You should be done with their rules and find out what works for you. Who else you got to listen to?

It made other things stricter. It announced that it'd be changing the recommendation from anyone who has been vaccinated does not need to quarantine due to exposure to only people who have had a booster shot should be exempt from quarantining. Worse. These quarantine rules would also include people like me who don't need a booster shot, because their booster shot was getting COVID and having to spend Christmas doing this."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Unlike Greg when he sits in this chair I don't need a booster right now. Right now, I am far more protected than anyone who has gotten one. And I've also probably had at least 47 COVID exposures on my way to work today. So if I were to actually follow these new quarantine rules, you guys would never see me again. Much like you may never see Gutfeld again. But that does not mean he's dead. Of course, immunity isn't perfect either. If it were, I wouldn't have had two COVIDs. But saying it shouldn't be taken into account at all is stupid. And yes, vaccination can be a smart choice. Vaccinated people are still faring better than those who are unvaccinated when it comes to hospitalization and death. And if you're worried about those things, that could be the right choice for you. But the choice is the point. It should be your choice and your choice alone. And I'm not just saying that because I'm a mostly lawless heathen. He thinks almost everything should be your choice. Now with the Omicron variant, the science shows that vaccinated, even boosted vaccination can't stop you from contracting and spreading it, which was their entire justification for these mandates in the first place. We're entering into our third year of living like this, and I am not doing it. I've been married for seven months now. Costing Vegas millions. And I still haven't been able to have a honeymoon because of all the fears about planning a trip with all the rules changing all the time. I mean, what would the CD -- what would the CDC suggest that I do for my honeymoon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Honestly, I'd be afraid to ask what they would suggest. Because they either don't get it or they just don't care. Stuff like that is important. Living your life is important. And I'm done listening to anyone who can't recognize that. The truth is what do we do about COVID? Should mean you and the people you live with? Should mean you and your doctor or you in the voices inside your head? It should not mean you and the rules your government imposes on you, must you want to lose your job or the ability to move around what is supposed to be a free country. Schoolhouse Rock never mentioned your rights can be trampled if one politician declares an emergency. And there is a 40-year- old reference in honor of Greg Gutfeld, who is probably still alive. So, like Chris Cuomos' future COVID is not going anywhere. Leaders and experts would be smart to focus on treatments instead of restrictions that do less good than searching my apartment for any evidence connected to Greg's disappearance."

I've seen -- I mean, dozens of cases in the last week, and it has been exceedingly mild. Yes, if you're unvaccinated, it can hit your hard. If you're elderly, anything can hit you hard. That's absolutely the case. But we've done an amazing job. And we should begin to stand up tall, be a little courageous, and begin to live our lives the way we want to and not be preoccupied with this thing. And as you said, make decisions with your -- for yourself, with your doctor, let the healthcare system work again. That was always supposed to be the way it was.

It's how the media keeps giving this guy a pass. Right? He claims that the answer to everything to your point is more government. It's stricter rules, it's more laws, it's a bigger government encroachment into your life. And the media gives them a pass. They say this year or this month that -- oh, he reassured governor's as coronavirus surges. When President Trump did literally the exact same thing when he left it to the states to make their own public health decisions that same New York Times said he was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic. And that's what sucks as an ordinary American who doesn't really care who's in charge. As long as they're reasonable. They make sense and they don't infringe upon my liberties.

Not to mention bathed in Purell and wrapped in anti-microbial plastic which is also what experts recommend for meeting with Jeffrey Toobin. Oprah's policy was so strict that Gayle wasn't even allowed in because like Joe Biden on Air Force One, she missed one of the steps. The guest of honors own grandmother and Oprah's best friend.

Kim Kardashian or as she's known in my house, Kim Kardashian, is getting dragged online for posting spoilers for the new Spider Man movie, \"No Way Home.\" Now, spoiler alert. I'm about to tell you what she shared. So, it's your chance to change the channel. If you don't want to hear any more about a young man swinging around town spraying secretions everywhere. And I don't mean Pete Davidson. All right, a few more sec -- OK. It's enough. You're old enough. Also, if you're old enough to be up this late, you are too old for Spider Man anyway. OK. According to The New York Post, which is owned by our parent company, Lane Bryant, Kim shared some screenshots of the film from her private theater on her Instagram story. The picture is revealed that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are in the movie. And I don't know why that matters, because I'm an adult. But some dudes who work for this show told me that it does matter. That conversation was also the closest any of them have ever been to a girl. So, there you go. So, Kim, she later deleted the photos, but it was too late. People were furious, tweeted one person, \"I thought the Spider Man ending would get ruined from a lot of places on social media for me, but never in @KimKardashian Insta Stories. Nothing says privilege, like getting a movie in your own private theater and spoiling it for those of us who are trying to stay home and safe. Sounds like someone's just pissed they don't have a private theater. But since it's all spoiled at this point, let's just watch the end of the movie now."
