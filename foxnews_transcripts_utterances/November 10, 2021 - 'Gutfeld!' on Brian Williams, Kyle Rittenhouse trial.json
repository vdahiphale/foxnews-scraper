A quick recap it began with the police shooting of a violent knife wielding felon in Kenosha, Wisconsin back in August 2020. Following three days of riots and property destruction, or what CNN would call peaceful protests. Rittenhouse traveled to Kenosha armed with the rifle publicly stating his mission was to protect businesses and victims. In the ensuing melee, he shot and killed two people and wounded a third. The State of Wisconsin alleges he's a murderer, his defenders and anybody with an I.Q. over 15 describe it as self defense. And if you listen to the clueless prosecution, they're pretty much proving it was self defense too. I haven't seen someone this inept in court since Michael Avenatti. As legal -- as legal expert James Gagliano in the New York Post points out with video footage from the scene and witness accounts murder remains an impossible charge to prove. Now I've not watched much of the actual trial. I don't have time whill with having to hit shows and my night job as a bouncer at Joe Joe's leather and latex tea house. Where I met the judge. So let's -- but let's see how the media portrays Rittenhouse.",

      "sentences": "Whoops. So the guy wounded by Rittenhouse admits he was pointing his gun at Rittenhouse when he was shot. That's no tiny detail. If someone walks towards me with a gun drawn, it's either a threat or I've wandered into Dana Perino's yard. Look at the prosecutors when the story didn't go as planned. It's the same reaction my doctor has when I removed my pants. This trial blew up in their faces like an Antifa-made pipe bomb. Maybe they should have worn masks. But forget the laughable prosecution. What's concerning is how the media portrays the actual facts. The witness Gage Groskreutz lied about having a gun that admits he pointed a loaded gun in Rittenhouse. Gage which is a bad name to have in a firearms case. It's like being named Glock or Caliber or Alec Baldwin. He turned out to be a terrible witness for the prosecution. But that's on how the media is covering it. To them, it's not self defense at all. It's got to be murder open and shut because as usual, they're as crooked as an Auntie Anne's pretzel with scoliosis. So if Rittenhouse is found not guilty, how will the activist class react who were spoon fed the false media narrative? Let's put it this way. Home Depot is going to have a run on plywood from small business owners. It's almost as if the media wants to prime the rioters to think Rittenhouse got away with murder, and why? Well it keeps them from ever admitting they're wrong. They run from facts like Hunter Biden runs from a baby mama. But it guarantees more violence which they see as restorative justice and ratings too. Brian Williams pick the wrong time to retire. Fact is it was the media's embrace of the riots while condemning the police that led to more unbridled violence. And when there's no law enforcement who fills that gap? I'll give you a hint. It's not social workers or mental health experts. It's people like Kyle Rittenhouse. It was the media's emboldening of criminality they deemed necessary to punish our evil racist society and cowardly politicians responded with policies that sponsored this unsafe world. So why wouldn't some citizens step up to protect others? Who else if not you? Rittenhouse and others like him that too, when you leave people with no options this is what you're going to get. So maybe Rittenhouse acted in self defense but how did the media act? Well they're not on trial but if they were it would take a jury five minutes to bring in a verdict of guilty.",

I guess they'd realize the strategy of pretending it didn't exist, didn't work in Virginia, the 55-page document which is a lot of pages on something that isn't real, argues that doctors can't eliminate health inequities. By focusing only on individual's, their behavior or their biology. You know, that crazy stuff we used to call health care. Instead, if you're obese, pre-disposed to heart disease and have gout. The first thing a doctor should do is stereotype you by race. That's great news for the under, under-served communities. There's no time to patch your gunshot wounds. We've got a narrative to counter. Of course, like all effective CRT propaganda, no guide book would be complete without a section on word choice. And by choice they mean censorship. For example, instead of doctors saying vulnerable groups, they're now groups that have been economically and socially marginalized. That's a lot, especially if you're in pain. Instead of the homeless, there are people who are experiencing homelessness, how passive is that? And no more ex-con or felons, they're now formerly incarcerated or returning citizen or formerly worked with Hillary 2016. So, Loftus, we are at a stage where something like the AMA, which is supposedly made up of doctors, I don't know what kind of doctors but it's like the right pronoun is more important than finding the right cancer treatment, because it takes energy from one area and puts it to something else.

A quick recap it began with the police shooting of a violent knife wielding felon in Kenosha, Wisconsin back in August 2020. Following three days of riots and property destruction, or what CNN would call peaceful protests. Rittenhouse traveled to Kenosha armed with the rifle publicly stating his mission was to protect businesses and victims. In the ensuing melee, he shot and killed two people and wounded a third. The State of Wisconsin alleges he's a murderer, his defenders and anybody with an I.Q. over 15 describe it as self defense. And if you listen to the clueless prosecution, they're pretty much proving it was self defense too. I haven't seen someone this inept in court since Michael Avenatti. As legal -- as legal expert James Gagliano in the New York Post points out with video footage from the scene and witness accounts murder remains an impossible charge to prove. Now I've not watched much of the actual trial. I don't have time whill with having to hit shows and my night job as a bouncer at Joe Joe's leather and latex tea house. Where I met the judge. So let's -- but let's see how the media portrays Rittenhouse."

      "utterance": "Whoops. So the guy wounded by Rittenhouse admits he was pointing his gun at Rittenhouse when he was shot. That's no tiny detail. If someone walks towards me with a gun drawn, it's either a threat or I've wandered into Dana Perino's yard. Look at the prosecutors when the story didn't go as planned. It's the same reaction my doctor has when I removed my pants. This trial blew up in their faces like an Antifa-made pipe bomb. Maybe they should have worn masks. But forget the laughable prosecution. What's concerning is how the media portrays the actual facts. The witness Gage Groskreutz lied about having a gun that admits he pointed a loaded gun in Rittenhouse. Gage which is a bad name to have in a firearms case. It's like being named Glock or Caliber or Alec Baldwin. He turned out to be a terrible witness for the prosecution. But that's on how the media is covering it. To them, it's not self defense at all. It's got to be murder open and shut because as usual, they're as crooked as an Auntie Anne's pretzel with scoliosis. So if Rittenhouse is found not guilty, how will the activist class react who were spoon fed the false media narrative? Let's put it this way. Home Depot is going to have a run on plywood from small business owners. It's almost as if the media wants to prime the rioters to think Rittenhouse got away with murder, and why? Well it keeps them from ever admitting they're wrong. They run from facts like Hunter Biden runs from a baby mama. But it guarantees more violence which they see as restorative justice and ratings too. Brian Williams pick the wrong time to retire. Fact is it was the media's embrace of the riots while condemning the police that led to more unbridled violence. And when there's no law enforcement who fills that gap? I'll give you a hint. It's not social workers or mental health experts. It's people like Kyle Rittenhouse. It was the media's emboldening of criminality they deemed necessary to punish our evil racist society and cowardly politicians responded with policies that sponsored this unsafe world. So why wouldn't some citizens step up to protect others? Who else if not you? Rittenhouse and others like him that too, when you leave people with no options this is what you're going to get. So maybe Rittenhouse acted in self defense but how did the media act? Well they're not on trial but if they were it would take a jury five minutes to bring in a verdict of guilty."

The American Medical Association released the guide to counter narrating, counter narrating the attacks on critical race theory. I guess they'd realize the strategy of pretending it didn't exist, didn't work in Virginia, the 55-page document which is a lot of pages on something that isn't real, argues that doctors can't eliminate health inequities. By focusing only on individual's, their behavior or their biology. You know, that crazy stuff we used to call health care. Instead, if you're obese, pre-disposed to heart disease and have gout. The first thing a doctor should do is stereotype you by race. That's great news for the under, under-served communities. There's no time to patch your gunshot wounds. We've got a narrative to counter. Of course, like all effective CRT propaganda, no guide book would be complete without a section on word choice. And by choice they mean censorship. For example, instead of doctors saying vulnerable groups, they're now groups that have been economically and socially marginalized. That's a lot, especially if you're in pain. Instead of the homeless, there are people who are experiencing homelessness, how passive is that? And no more ex-con or felons, they're now formerly incarcerated or returning citizen or formerly worked with Hillary 2016. So, Loftus, we are at a stage where something like the AMA, which is supposedly made up of doctors, I don't know what kind of doctors but it's like the right pronoun is more important than finding the right cancer treatment, because it takes energy from one area and puts it to something else.

But 81 percent, I wonder how many of those men were just saying that in an attempt to have sex with someone? One doctor explained it this way: The more sex you have, the more you want. The less sex you have, the less you want. That's the same way I feel about fluffernutter. But it's like my therapist once told me: sex isn't what happens between the sheets, it's what happens between the ears. Turns out she loved to bang in a cornfield.
