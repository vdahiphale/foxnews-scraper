      "sentences": "All right. President Trump wrapping up a massive rally in New Hampshire, a state he wants to flip in 2020. We have pilots coming up throughout this hour. First tonight, thanks to the bravery and skill -- yes, you can keep the music, that's fine -- of the Philadelphia Police Department, last night's violence hours long standoff ended with no fatalities. All six officers who were shot, thank God, have been released from the hospital and just after midnight, the perpetrator finally surrendered and how did some of the residents of North Philly, how did they think they're police department? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. We'll put the music down. Now look at your screen. They taunted them. They shoved them, again, only a few. They pelted them with objects. KYW said only 2 percent of the hundred percent there, 90 percent did not involve themselves. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These brave men and women in uniform ready to take a bullet. Six Philly police officers took bullets yesterday to make this neighborhood a safer place. That's the thanks cops get in the middle of an ongoing crisis like this? A day care center across the street? These officers saving countless lives, putting themselves in harm's way, and there are people that are taunting them, pelting them with objects, treating them this way is beyond repulsive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Frankly, just like the ongoing felony assault against police officers in New York City with water and other objects now. And today, here we are, less than 24 hours after the standoff, police were forced to respond to yet another shooting in the exact same neighborhood. Five people were shot today. And these brave Philly police officers back again at work in some of the most dangerous conditions in America. They deserve better. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, I suspect did when I was on my radio show yesterday that something wasn't right. The fact that it was about 9:40 last night, in the middle of this program, our coverage on this program, we found out all that time, police officers with people they had apprehended were on the second floor the entire time and thankfully, they got out safely because of the good work, the diligence of the commissioner and everybody else in all law enforcement there. But at the very same time that this standoff is going on, Democrats, the media mob, they were exploiting what was an ongoing crisis for political gain, instead of actually covering what is serious breaking news on the ground that lives at stake here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For example, fake news CNN, before -- less than an hour into their breaking news coverage, dedicating an entire segment, pushing strict gun control, and less than an hour into the shooting, police officers still ducking for cover and returning fire, there was 2020 hopeful Kamala Harris in front of the camera saying this. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "OK. Senator Harris, it was less than an hour, remember. This was that about 5:26 in the afternoon she is saying that. And we had police officers and people apprehended in the building. Oh, they were there, let's say, at 9:40 at night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She didn't know any of the facts on the ground.

Beyond sick, ugly, twisted, shameful, and as a former prosecutor, frankly, you would think she would know better. And several other 2020 Democratic hopefuls also, yes, shamelessly weighing in during the ongoing standoff. They didn't even wait for it to end now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kirsten Gillibrand, who doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of ever being a president, blaming the NRA, while bullets are still flying. Cory Booker, on Roswell Rachel Maddow's conspiracy TV hour, calling for federal background checks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It still wasn't resolved. Pretty disgusting. Sadly, not shocking, not surprising. All too predictable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we can't forget, last week, it was Warren -- Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, they were literally advancing those old lies, 5-year-old lies and conspiracy theories that have been debunked about Michael Brown, hands off, don't shoot, and Officer Darren Wilson. Lies debunked by one eyewitness after another that saw the incident. Even Obama's Justice Department didn't agree with the analysis of Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Their Justice Department pointed out all the eyewitness testimony on the ground. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And even now, after, you know, another shooting, Democrats, the media mob, they're almost too giddy at a chance once again to politicize a strategy. Very predictable, very sad. But think about this, every weekend, there are dozens of shootings in some of America's biggest cities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's look at the city of Chicago. Two weekends, last two weekends alone, nearly 100 people were shot, nearly 100 people. These violent cities have been run for decades by liberal Democrats. These cities all have one thing in common. Very strict gun laws. So, guess what? We don't hear a peep from Democrats. The ones that are getting all upset, raising money off the events in El Paso and the events in Dayton, you don't hear a peep out of them about Chicago. It doesn't fit their political agenda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ultimately, the left's hysteria over gun control has very little to do with the people that are being shot. In Pennsylvania, for example, violent felons, they are not allowed to purchase guns. It's illegal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last night shooter was a convicted violent felon with at least a dozen arrests, including the illegal possession of firearms and aggravated assault and yet, he was in possession of multiple guns. No new law was going to stop him. He had belonged in jail. And meanwhile, the shooters in El Paso, Dayton, they are no felonies on their records, there is no background check that would likely have ever stopped them from purchasing any weapon. So, this is all feel good-ism in the name of the stricter and stricter gun control, for innocent people, law-abiding Americans that have the right to defend their homes and families. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Murder is illegal in every state of this country, shooting people is illegal, except in self-defense. Criminals don't seem to care. They don't follow the law or the very nature of what they do like the rest of us. And in a country with open borders, guns will always be available. Maybe they should help control the borders. But if Democrats and weak, feckless Republicans now get their way, those of us who follow the law, are responsible gun owners, we would be left totally unarmed and defenseless. Once you give away your rights, you're never going to get them back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On this program, for example, we had, well, a 2020 hopeful comrade de Blasio, the mayor of New York City. He wouldn't answer any question I asked again and again and again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He had his armed security guards with him. I asked whether people in the city of New York have the right to have a gun in their house if God forbid something happens. He kept saying, they have a right to be safe. I said I didn't ask you that. Do they have a right to a gun? They have a right to be safe. Do they have a right to a gun? They have a right to be safe. That means no. He was saying no in his own way. So for them, your rights are not important, as long as they are protected. Hollywood stars, they can afford armed security guards. We'll have a lot more coming up on all of this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, we do have other breaking news to report in the disturbing case of Jeffrey Epstein. His autopsy report revealed Epstein suffered multiple broken bones in his neck. What is that all mean? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now with the full report, from our West Coast newsroom, he's following the story, our own Trace Gallagher -- Trace.",

First, 330 pages of DOJ documents showing that, in fact, Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, was providing Bruce Ohr with a constant stream of anti-Trump material throughout 2016 and even into 2017. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, keep in mind, Nellie Ohr was paid -- was getting paid for ultimately by the Clintons. She worked with Fusion GPS. Remember, Clinton followed the money to the law firm Perkins Coie. Coie hired Fusion GPS, they hired Christopher Steele. But ultimately, it was the Clinton and the DNC paying, all to dig up dirt on all things Donald Trump. By the way, eventually, the FBI even debunked it in their own spreadsheet - - 90-some-odd percent of it. Now, meanwhile, Bruce Ohr was the associate deputy attorney general for the Department of Justice in the Obama administrator, and even more shocking in some cases, Nellie Ohr didn't even need her husband to proliferate her seedy information.

She's feeding lie after lie. They basically looked at every unsavory character in every unsavory sector in all of Russia.

He's bringing in stuff from his wife even though he is a conflict of interest with his wife being employed by Fusion GPS. A real significant portrait of the Justice Department sort of in disarray and allowing all these human sources to be blown away. I'm going to give you an example that come outside the Russia case, but it goes right to heart of this. Today, I learned from the Inspector General Michael Horowitz that the DEA was paying TSA workers, the people that screen is at the airports, to be snitches at airports. They were getting informant pay, just like Christopher Steele, to spy on us while they were checking us for security. The I.G. concluded that violated all the policies. There is a problem at the Justice Department. They were relying on government officials with fiduciary responsibility to do things right at the Justice Department, and turn them into their own informant. It was very unreliable.

And a national poll has and the two are a statistical tie. She's surging in places like New Hampshire and Iowa. Why? Because while she's embracing the ultra-radical extremism of her party, open borders, trillion into new entitlements, abolishing private health care, reparations and yes, the crazy insane New Green Deal.

No Israel backing. Yes, the boycott of Israel even writing for Louis Farrakhan. The anti-Semite himself in his magazine. Hatred of the state of Israel could not be any more clear.

      "utterance": "All right. President Trump wrapping up a massive rally in New Hampshire, a state he wants to flip in 2020. We have pilots coming up throughout this hour. First tonight, thanks to the bravery and skill -- yes, you can keep the music, that's fine -- of the Philadelphia Police Department, last night's violence hours long standoff ended with no fatalities. All six officers who were shot, thank God, have been released from the hospital and just after midnight, the perpetrator finally surrendered and how did some of the residents of North Philly, how did they think they're police department? All right. We'll put the music down. Now look at your screen. They taunted them. They shoved them, again, only a few. They pelted them with objects. KYW said only 2 percent of the hundred percent there, 90 percent did not involve themselves. These brave men and women in uniform ready to take a bullet. Six Philly police officers took bullets yesterday to make this neighborhood a safer place. That's the thanks cops get in the middle of an ongoing crisis like this? A day care center across the street? These officers saving countless lives, putting themselves in harm's way, and there are people that are taunting them, pelting them with objects, treating them this way is beyond repulsive. Frankly, just like the ongoing felony assault against police officers in New York City with water and other objects now. And today, here we are, less than 24 hours after the standoff, police were forced to respond to yet another shooting in the exact same neighborhood. Five people were shot today. And these brave Philly police officers back again at work in some of the most dangerous conditions in America. They deserve better. You know, I suspect did when I was on my radio show yesterday that something wasn't right. The fact that it was about 9:40 last night, in the middle of this program, our coverage on this program, we found out all that time, police officers with people they had apprehended were on the second floor the entire time and thankfully, they got out safely because of the good work, the diligence of the commissioner and everybody else in all law enforcement there. But at the very same time that this standoff is going on, Democrats, the media mob, they were exploiting what was an ongoing crisis for political gain, instead of actually covering what is serious breaking news on the ground that lives at stake here. For example, fake news CNN, before -- less than an hour into their breaking news coverage, dedicating an entire segment, pushing strict gun control, and less than an hour into the shooting, police officers still ducking for cover and returning fire, there was 2020 hopeful Kamala Harris in front of the camera saying this. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Well, it's just -- when will it stop, right? I mean, part of my focus on what we need to do around smart gun safety laws is recognize that we have to have more enforcement around gun dealers. Wolf, 90 percent of the guns that are associated with crime are sold by just 5 percent of the gun dealers in the United States. And so, among the many plans that I have, both in the form of executive action and also in the form of legislation, one of them is to put more resources into the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "OK. Senator Harris, it was less than an hour, remember. This was that about 5:26 in the afternoon she is saying that. And we had police officers and people apprehended in the building. Oh, they were there, let's say, at 9:40 at night. She didn't know any of the facts on the ground. She didn't know that -- who the shooter was. She didn't know anything at all about the ongoing standoff. She didn't know people were at risk in that same building where there was a live shooter in there. All these people risking their lives, serving and protecting the people of Philadelphia, Kamala Harris is in the comfort of the fake news CNN studio hawking a political agenda about something she knows nothing about. Beyond sick, ugly, twisted, shameful, and as a former prosecutor, frankly, you would think she would know better. And several other 2020 Democratic hopefuls also, yes, shamelessly weighing in during the ongoing standoff. They didn't even wait for it to end now. Kirsten Gillibrand, who doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of ever being a president, blaming the NRA, while bullets are still flying. Cory Booker, on Roswell Rachel Maddow's conspiracy TV hour, calling for federal background checks. It still wasn't resolved. Pretty disgusting. Sadly, not shocking, not surprising. All too predictable. And we can't forget, last week, it was Warren -- Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, they were literally advancing those old lies, 5-year-old lies and conspiracy theories that have been debunked about Michael Brown, hands off, don't shoot, and Officer Darren Wilson. Lies debunked by one eyewitness after another that saw the incident. Even Obama's Justice Department didn't agree with the analysis of Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Their Justice Department pointed out all the eyewitness testimony on the ground. And even now, after, you know, another shooting, Democrats, the media mob, they're almost too giddy at a chance once again to politicize a strategy. Very predictable, very sad. But think about this, every weekend, there are dozens of shootings in some of America's biggest cities. Let's look at the city of Chicago. Two weekends, last two weekends alone, nearly 100 people were shot, nearly 100 people. These violent cities have been run for decades by liberal Democrats. These cities all have one thing in common. Very strict gun laws. So, guess what? We don't hear a peep from Democrats. The ones that are getting all upset, raising money off the events in El Paso and the events in Dayton, you don't hear a peep out of them about Chicago. It doesn't fit their political agenda. Ultimately, the left's hysteria over gun control has very little to do with the people that are being shot. In Pennsylvania, for example, violent felons, they are not allowed to purchase guns. It's illegal. Last night shooter was a convicted violent felon with at least a dozen arrests, including the illegal possession of firearms and aggravated assault and yet, he was in possession of multiple guns. No new law was going to stop him. He had belonged in jail. And meanwhile, the shooters in El Paso, Dayton, they are no felonies on their records, there is no background check that would likely have ever stopped them from purchasing any weapon. So, this is all feel good-ism in the name of the stricter and stricter gun control, for innocent people, law-abiding Americans that have the right to defend their homes and families. Murder is illegal in every state of this country, shooting people is illegal, except in self-defense. Criminals don't seem to care. They don't follow the law or the very nature of what they do like the rest of us. And in a country with open borders, guns will always be available. Maybe they should help control the borders. But if Democrats and weak, feckless Republicans now get their way, those of us who follow the law, are responsible gun owners, we would be left totally unarmed and defenseless. Once you give away your rights, you're never going to get them back. On this program, for example, we had, well, a 2020 hopeful comrade de Blasio, the mayor of New York City. He wouldn't answer any question I asked again and again and again. He had his armed security guards with him. I asked whether people in the city of New York have the right to have a gun in their house if God forbid something happens. He kept saying, they have a right to be safe. I said I didn't ask you that. Do they have a right to a gun? They have a right to be safe. Do they have a right to a gun? They have a right to be safe. That means no. He was saying no in his own way. So for them, your rights are not important, as long as they are protected. Hollywood stars, they can afford armed security guards. We'll have a lot more coming up on all of this. But first, we do have other breaking news to report in the disturbing case of Jeffrey Epstein. His autopsy report revealed Epstein suffered multiple broken bones in his neck. What is that all mean? Joining us now with the full report, from our West Coast newsroom, he's following the story, our own Trace Gallagher -- Trace."

These types of breaks can certainly happen to those who hang themselves but are much more common in victims of strangulation. That's not to say Epstein was strangled, but it does boost the level of intrigue, especially about the circumstances. Our corporate cousin, \"The New York Post,\" says Epstein hung himself with the bed sheet tied to the top bunk in his cell but there is no information about how he did it. Meaning, did he jump? Roll? Or fall off the bunk? Standard prison bunks are five and a half feet high and forensic pathologist, Dr. Cyril Wecht, is skeptical about the generation of force. Listen to him."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yes, how did he generate the force? Epstein's autopsy was completed on Sunday but the cause of death is still pending and we should note that the guards ignored Epstein for hours, so it's very possible he could have been a hanging there for a while -- Sean."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Trace Gallagher, thank you. And tonight, we also have two big brand-new discoveries from our friends at Judicial Watch. First, 330 pages of DOJ documents showing that, in fact, Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, was providing Bruce Ohr with a constant stream of anti-Trump material throughout 2016 and even into 2017. Now, keep in mind, Nellie Ohr was paid -- was getting paid for ultimately by the Clintons. She worked with Fusion GPS. Remember, Clinton followed the money to the law firm Perkins Coie. Coie hired Fusion GPS, they hired Christopher Steele. But ultimately, it was the Clinton and the DNC paying, all to dig up dirt on all things Donald Trump. By the way, eventually, the FBI even debunked it in their own spreadsheet - - 90-some-odd percent of it. Now, meanwhile, Bruce Ohr was the associate deputy attorney general for the Department of Justice in the Obama administrator, and even more shocking in some cases, Nellie Ohr didn't even need her husband to proliferate her seedy information. Other newly discovered documents show that Nellie Ohr was communicating with another top DOJ official while she was working with Fusion GPS. Here on this breaking and developing story from Judicial Watch, its president Tom Fitton. Tom, I'm reading this and it's pretty amazing. She's feeding lie after lie. They basically looked at every unsavory character in every unsavory sector in all of Russia. You know, the biggest ones, the biggest mob people, the biggest whatever people. And they just found a way to tie Trump when there was zero connection and the FBI eventually even figured out in their spreadsheet, none of this is true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "And Bruce Ohr is dutifully printing out the material and sharing it or actually stripping Fusion GPS headers from the material and giving it to his colleagues at the FBI. And Nellie Ohr is in constant communication not only with Bruce but with his underlings at the Justice Department on a whole host of matters, sending news reports in the original Russian to her friends at the Justice Department, of course trying to smear Donald Trump along the way. You know, it turns out Nellie Ohr may have been the most significant hire by the Clinton campaign at Fusion GPS because of her connections to Bruce Ohr. You have her ability to talk to the Justice Department independent of her husband and obviously use her husband to not only launder the information and to get connections to Steele and Simpson to the Justice Department during the campaign but after he was elected. It's -- when you look at these documents, this outlines how the coup happened after the election. They used Nellie Ohr to get the job Fusion GPS material repeatedly to the FBI who then used it for the FISA warrants to target Trump."

      "utterance": "We expect full reports. We are going to get to more of that in a second. We also have major breaking news from an investigative reporter, the executive vice president at \"The Hill\", our friend, John Solomon. According to his report, just out, well, the 2020 FBI report obtained by Solomon -- well, the bureau had, quote, medium confidence that the dossier author Christopher Steele was a useful source and that is intelligence could only be minimally verified, which is huge since his intelligence was a very basis for the FISA warrants and three renewals, the bulk of information to spy on Carter Page, and through Carter Page, the Trump campaign transition and then the Trump presidency. And, by the way, only the tip of the iceberg. Now with more, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. OK, when we add that to the FBI spreadsheet which came up with over 90 percent of information and the dossiers was total B.S., that means the warnings Bruce Ohr gave one in 2016 in August, before the first FISA application."

They withhold -- withheld from the FISA judges the big fact that Hillary paid for it but they all knew it, which means that lying by omission. So I would say, premeditated fraud against the FISA court on four separate occasions to spy on a president. Well, first this campaign and then the transition under the presidency and even use to undo a president or attempted to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, listen, there is a clearer and clearer picture being formed from the new evidence that's coming out, Sean, that the Justice Department had a problem managing, vetting, and relying on human sources. Those are people we typically call informants. And there are many dynamics. We know all about Steele now. He's been exposed for what he is, a really bad informant. He did not provide reliable information and that took us down a three-year journey called the Russian collusion narrative. But here are some other important things. You are seeing increasing evidence by government officials and government jobs were acting in a second capacity as informants, as sources, as workarounds. Bruce Ohr is bringing in stuff from Christopher Steele, even after Christopher Steele is fired. He's bringing in stuff from his wife even though he is a conflict of interest with his wife being employed by Fusion GPS. A real significant portrait of the Justice Department sort of in disarray and allowing all these human sources to be blown away. I'm going to give you an example that come outside the Russia case, but it goes right to heart of this. Today, I learned from the Inspector General Michael Horowitz that the DEA was paying TSA workers, the people that screen is at the airports, to be snitches at airports. They were getting informant pay, just like Christopher Steele, to spy on us while they were checking us for security. The I.G. concluded that violated all the policies. There is a problem at the Justice Department. They were relying on government officials with fiduciary responsibility to do things right at the Justice Department, and turn them into their own informant. It was very unreliable. It gave us the facade -- the joke that became the Russian investigation."

And you and I might have a slight disagreement on what we would expect, and I want to air this out so our audience understands. We will expect the I.G. report on Comey alone. We thought we might get that today. That's on the classified materials that he shouldn't have in his home. A month after he is fired, the FBI went and they got them back. They also interrogated him. They found him to be lacking candor, another way of saying he lied to. But there are bigger issues for Comey. We agree on that coming separately. We agree then a full inspector general report on premeditated FISA fraud and abuse, that is going to be a big deal impacting everybody to sign it, correct?"

That will be one of the seminal reports that really examine what the FBI did right and wrong in the Russian investigation, and I'm hearing there is a lot more wrong than right in it.

Also, tonight, we are tracking several other breaking news stories, including a shocking development about Hillary Clinton's illicit server. Listen to this, according to reports out today, Clinton's secret server filled with, yes, top secret, classified, national secrets. Oh, yes, it might have been hacked by China, but high-ranking FBI officials didn't care one bit. At the same time, Comey's FBI was spying on the Trump campaign all over the world and recently one of Comey's alleged informants living abroad, Stefan Halper, just admitted that he was a government agent. In fact, he asked the judge to dismiss defamation lawsuit against him saying, quote, government agents have immunity from litigation. OK. The onion gets more smaller as we peel the layers. Here with reaction, author of the brand-new book, \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History\", out soon, FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, FOX News investigative reporter, Sara Carter. Let me start with the question I was just asking John Solomon about, OK, I think we all agree that we are going to get an I.G. report on Comey. A top secret information that they received from his house a month after he was fired. The second one is going to be the I.G. on FISA abuse, premeditated fraud on the court. He thinks there will be a third report and a separate on leaking alone. That would be McCabe, Comey, perhaps and others. I believe the work that they are doing abroad, and he's right, the attorney general has signaled very clearly, and my sources have confirmed to me that there are -- there's been a lot of activity across the pond in terms of interviews, including Christopher Steele 16 hours, and that we might have had high-ranking intelligence officials circumventing American law, spying on an American presidential campaign, transition and presidency, and the counterintelligence investigation might go into the office of Barack Obama.

They want to know what happened at the very beginning of the FBI's probe into President Trump and you brought up another very important point. Let's think about this. Stefan Halper, I spoke with Svetlana Lokhova. Now, she is the British Russian-born national who was basically tarnished in a number of news reports coming out of London that put her right in the middle of the whole Russia scandal and she is accusing Stefan Halper of being the point man in that. And what's so fascinating is that he comes out in his attorney to say, look, if he was looking for the U.S. government, they don't exactly say that he was spy, but they say, if he was, he would be granted immunity. And then they go on to say in the lawsuit, basically, to Svetlana, look, he was paid over half a million dollars by the U.S. government -- and remember, that was the story about the Office of Net Assessment at the Department of Defense. So, the Department of Defense was basically paying Stefan Halper in contracting while he was apparently working for the FBI, spying on everybody over there, from George Papadopoulos to Carter Page, and God only knows what else. And now, Svetlana Lokhova is accusing him of being the person who planted all of these false stories."

What they were doing was targeting Trump. And after he won the presidential election, after he became President Trump, they were moving into their insurance policy and that insurance policy was to remove the President of the United States.

Now just like we told you, we have other news tonight on the 2020 front, where we have Sleepy Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe Biden, his nonstop blunders, it now has the Democratic Party all across the country in an all-out panic and it's getting so bad that the new plan that has emerged - let's just hide him from the public. He will do fewer events, don't let him talk because not only is Joe making gaffe after gaffe and flip flop after flip flop and apologizing all over the place, everything he's ever said and done is also clearly running out of steam if he ever had a fastball, he doesn't even have a medium fastball. This point this is months before the first primary. President Trump weighed in on this earlier tonight. Let's take a look"

But I don't know, I think Sleepy Joe may be able to limp across the finish line. But today they announce that they're going to cut way back on his appearances because he is such a disaster. They're going to have fewer appearances, you've heard that, right. This is soon. They're going to cut way back on his appearances. Can you believe it? If I ever did that, it would be over. The fake news would get us, but we don't let him get us and it is fake."

Either he can cut it, or he can't.\" And he also said previously this is probably the best Biden has got. So, you see what's going on. Sleepy Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe has no fastball. Doesn't have a medium ball. Doesn't have a curve ball. He can't run on the Obama-Biden failed agenda with 30 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty and foreign policy, the bribes, mullahs in Iran with $150 billion in cash. He knows the new extreme Democratic agenda has no chance of beating Trump in 2020 and will drive the country into poverty probably instantaneously. So, the new radical Democrats, they're not moving on from Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe and in comes Elizabeth Warren and now in a newly released Fox News poll Warren, well she has now surged into second place within striking distance of the former Vice President. And a national poll has and the two are a statistical tie. She's surging in places like New Hampshire and Iowa. Why? Because while she's embracing the ultra-radical extremism of her party, open borders, trillion into new entitlements, abolishing private health care, reparations and yes, the crazy insane New Green Deal. And that means by the way includes lawmakers. Let's see. Like yes, The Squad. And today by the way Omar to leave, they were banned thankfully from entering Israel by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over a planned visit over their history of anti-Semitic controversies and their support of boycotting Israel. Remember Omar's tweet. Israel has hypnotized the world using the phrase all about the Benjamin's when discussing Israeli lobbying groups and so much more to leave pushing for a one state solution. No Israel backing. Yes, the boycott of Israel even writing for Louis Farrakhan. The anti-Semite himself in his magazine. Hatred of the state of Israel could not be any more clear. The President was right to support Bibi Netanyahu and his decision, the decision was right by the Prime Minister. Their bigotry deserves to be exposed.

In terms of the deepening of the mystery. The reason is there are so many rich and powerful people, Sean, who have their secrets in Epstein's hands. I mean, he could have opened his mouth, he had records on everybody. He told The New York Times reporter he had spent time with that he had dirt on everybody from the royals to presidents. You know, this is a guy that was totally connected, Mohammad bin Salman, others, you know, the ruler of Saudi Arabia. This Epstein fellow used his money. He used his connection. And he used the lure of these underage or, you know, barely of age young women to create an aura around himself that was impenetrable and exotic.

Bill Barr's Justice Department is going to conduct a thorough investigation and then we'll figure out what happen. But keep in mind, Sean, when you talk to - I know, you know, corrections officers, you have in your family. But when you talk to corrections officers, this guy had every motivation to end this life. He'd been accused of horrendous crimes. I mean, unspeakable crimes. It wasn't looking good for him. He was living on a yacht. A billionaire's lifestyle. Now he's eaten the low fin in MCC.

While the situation was still unfolding, and shots being fired last night and that harrowing standoff and the attacks on law enforcement don't stop there. Disturbing new video shows the recent attack on a Washington ICE facility, highlighting what appears to be a pattern of violence now that we have highlighted against our brave men and women, again in uniform. And the San Antonio incident and the Arizona incident and the Washington state incident. I wonder if any of this has anything to do recently with these detention centers, with soccer fields, rec facilities, TVs, phones. Let's see beds, blankets, pillows and baby formula and diapers and medical facilities and medicine and food and water called concentration camps. Wow. Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, along with Former Acting ICE Director, Fox News Contributor, Tom Homan is with us. Bernie, I see what they did to those cops last night.
