We're catching up, so we're not going to stop our development now when you're already are developed, to which I would say we are not going to apologize for having invented the steam engine.

      "utterance": "The hysteria from the left on this is a good reminder that their hysteria is not just because of Donald Trump, because Donald Trump is president, but it's based on policy. Some of the comments that you've heard Fareed Zakaria saying the United States had resigned as the leader of the free world, Tom Steyer saying this was a traitorous act of war on the American people suggests just how invested in the left is. But there is a deep irony, I would say, in this hysteria. It is, as you have described, a nonbinding, unenforceable, voluntary, non-ratified agreement. So how is it on the one hand that you have the left crying about this meaning doom for the planet and on the other hand this not having any enforcement mechanisms."

      "speaker": "MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO",
      "utterance": "They would have voted it down. But, as Steve just said, the goals were voluntary and they were chosen by each country individually. So if it was toothless and it wasn't binding, what's the harm of staying in? In other words, I think that, yes, there was hysteria on the left about getting out, but what President Trump, the picture he painted just doesn't comport with reality. He could have ratcheted down Obama's goals if he wanted to. He already was getting rid of all of the mechanisms that was supposed to get us to the Obama goals. But this was something that every single country in the world except for Syria, which, as John Kerry said, is in a civil war, and Nicaragua, which is going to join even though they want it slightly tougher, has agreed to. And the interesting thing is even today, even when White House officials briefed, they could not say whether President Trump believed that human activity causes climate change or not. That is a consensus, a big, overwhelming consensus around the world."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",

It would have cost more than 6 million jobs. And so not taking part in an agreement that causes a great economic damage for no environmental benefits is not a bad thing. It's actually a mark of leadership to say why would we do this to ourselves?"

And I think the people of our country will be thrilled."

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Look, I don't know how sincere or realistic that is, but that's the right idea. I'm all in favor of an international treaty on climate and on controlling emission of CO2, but Paris wasn't that. That was one where it essentially said the U.S. is going to export its coal industry to India and China, who don't have to do a damn thing for 20 years. And the argument of the developing countries was, well, you have a 100 year head start in the industrial revolution. We're catching up, so we're not going to stop our development now when you're already are developed, to which I would say we are not going to apologize for having invented the steam engine. We are where we are. If we are going to have controls on admissions, it's going to be equitable. You're not going to have a 20 year hiatus where the Chinese don't have to reduce anything and the Indians are going to double their emissions from coal. So I think withdrawing -- I didn't like the language around it that the president hurled. It will be useful in a presidential campaign, the next presidential campaign. But withdrawing from a treaty which was toothless except that it would have been used in our courts to enforce restrictions on us was a good idea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right, Mara, let's talk about where climate change as an issue stands. If you look at Fox News polls just out, climate change, concern, the time trend, this is number one, extremely or very concerned. In 2017 it's 60-40 to not very to not at all. And it is breaking now on FOX poll four as far as issues that face that people are concerned about, government spending, Russian meddling, the economy -- climate change is at 29 percent. Looking at what happened today, the reaction from environmentalists, Democrats, it seems like they are always losing to the argument about jobs and they are always losing to it even though the issue seems to be more concerning for American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "That's because jobs is usually the number one issue. Now, there is huge consensus around climate change and it's been growing, as you just showed. It's been growing. It's becoming one of those big consensus issues. That doesn't mean it's the number one thing that motivate someone to vote. Donald Trump has aligned himself with his base today very, very strongly. As he said I am representing Pittsburgh, not Paris, even though the mayor of Pittsburgh pointed out that they went for Hillary. But we know what he meant. He is aligning himself with his rustbelt base. He's fulfilling a campaign promise. But the general issue of climate change, which he did not address. He talked only about jobs and the economy today. That is the number one issue, but he didn't say what he wants and exits to about this other than what we've already done. You heard Scott Pruitt say we are already making such great strides. So this is an issue. Can the Democrats somehow make the argument, as Ed Markey tried to make in that clip, that doing something about climate change will actually produce jobs because of all of this green technology? They haven't been able to do that yet."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It's also worth noting that this deal itself, according to analysis, wouldn't do anything to help out with the climate change problem. And it's one thing to say we intend to help out with climate change and entirely another to actually do something. And particularly when you are asking middle Americans to support this with their jobs and with their loss of income and with the extra costs applied to them, it makes no sense to know have no democratic accountability --"

It's about the common sense when he says India is getting hundreds of billions of dollars and doubling their coal plants and China doesn't have to do anything until 2030, as Charles mentioned, and yet they're a developing as of the last agreement."

So they could have said if we continue on along on our current projections in terms of emissions, we will count that as success. But that's crazy to think of that. That would be like me saying I'm going to consider it a success in two years if I am just as fat as I am now. This diet is great. But I'm still gaining weight. It doesn't make any sense."

      "utterance": "Thanks for the buck up. There is other polling, too, that I think builds on what you asked Mara about that shows that climate change in terms of intensity of an issue is very small. The number of people who regard it as the most important issue are mired in the low single digits. It's just not the kind of issue that Democrats I think are likely to be able to move. And we've heard Democrats again and again and again say that they're going to marshal their forces to fight for climate change. It hasn't worked before. I am skeptical that it will work again politically."

You could shut down every coal mine in America, the effect on the climate, on temperature, would be negligible. You couldn't even measure it. And second, if this is such a popular issue, such a consensus issue, when the Democrats had the White House when Obama concluded this, why didn't he go to the Senate? We have a constitution. There's a reason why we have provisions because you want to treaties to have substance and permanence. So you go to the Senate, you get a consensus in the country expressed by a two-thirds majority rather than some executive agreement like I would say the Iran deal which they knew would not have consensus. The Kyoto agreement was voted down by like 99 to one in the late 1990s because people didn't want it. And I think if Democrats are so attached to this and think that this is so apocalyptic if it is withdrawn from, why didn't they go to the Senate and have it inscribed as a treaty? Because it would never have gotten the vote."
