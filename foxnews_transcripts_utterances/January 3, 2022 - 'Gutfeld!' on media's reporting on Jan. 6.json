You know, I usually prefer a different beds each night like Wilt Chamberlain. But I was sick. While I tested negative on COVID, I tested positive on everything else. I'm pretty sure I had the flu, the cold, Zika, Ebola. But what do you expect when you borrow one of Michael Loftus' jackets? Who mugged a rodeo clown? It looks your shirt had a triple bypass. I'm not kidding. That thing harbors more bacteria than a port authority toilet. Thanks for that single laugh. But thank God -- thank God I made it through and I wouldn't miss it for the world. Because what a year we have planned. I'm an optimist and I see great things again, and not just when I look in the mirror. The best sign, watching the legacy media realize that they're screwed. And you know things are bad in 2022 when they're still reliving 2021. Here they are gearing up for their version of conflict Christmas, otherwise known as January 6th 2.0. Yes, it's as if the only thing that can save their crippled cabled network is the ghost of president's past, Santa Trump. You see, there's a bit of an informal network of reporters who've been through it that day and are still coping with that leaning on each other, talking to each other.",

But oh, our nation's brave journalists are still processing it like it was a price surge and responsibly raised chicken. Yes, they're taking a riot where the only unnatural death was from a cop shooting an unarmed woman and making it out to be worse than 9/11. And it hurts that they're still coping while everyone saw it for what it was an ugly event that came and went. But CNN can't let go. They need to convey to others how serious it was for them, because they're the real victims. And why? Because reporting what actually happened didn't scare enough people. And much like Loftus' body spray the ginned up hysteria has long worn off and all that's left is the stench. So, what's left for CNN? Besides a -- to catch a Predator reboot? They got the stars. They have to create a distraction. Look at this guy wearing a viking hat. He's part of the unarmed insurrection that no one has been charged with insurrection for. He's so scary.

      "sentences": "They're all suffering from PTSD. A disorder usually experienced by military veterans and actual violent crime victims. You know, the people whose complaints the press normally ignores. If these journalists are victims, then so as Jussie Smollett. They're hoaxing a hate crime against themselves. And yet here they are demanding compassion. Something that was strangely missing when dozens of Americans were dying in the riots that they, the media at CNN ignored back when everything was mostly peaceful. They hid those violent details like the Secret Service hides Joe Biden's car keys. So the media now appropriates the pain of real victims. Just like when they blame the terror attack in Waukesha on a SUV. They certainly didn't feel this way when violence rampage through nearly two dozen major cities led by Libs, perhaps because they were far removed from the disrupt -- destruction that that they papered over. See, that's why it's the soldiers who get PTSD, not the people who sent them to war, but you can't blame them for trying. The polling has shown the country moved on from CNN's latest fetish, at least a one that's legal. Yes, the public sees the Republicans moving in the right direction, while it's the Dems who keep sinking like an iPhone dropped in a toilet. Now, I don't know if the Republicans have any answers. Since when to any politicians these days, like the Maroon Five catalogue, I pretty much hate them all. But anything is better than what the Dems are serving. It's 2022 but it's dressed up now as 2021. I might have that backwards. Inflation, COVID, crime, it's a bottomless pit with spikes at the bottom, Emily. And that explains CNN all it -- going all in on January 6th, and you can see right through it like a Miley Cyrus tube top. It's also obvious, maybe January 6th will be the diversion we need to save us from our own casual dismissal of the suffering incurred under Democrat rule in 2021. Name if we focus on January 6th, America won't look at every single day. Other than that where CNN dismissed your pain as deserved were victims of persecution deserved it and where law enforcement was worse than the thugs they tried to protect you from. Meanwhile, they covered for the screwed up anchors, their political relatives and their deviant producers. In 2021, CNN did more covering up of the news than actual covering of the news. So, I get it, for CNN January 6th, it really is their Christmas.",

The guy who was beaten to death in front of his two children while hanging Christmas lights. The list goes on of the families across America that have been absolutely ripped apart by homicide, by skyrocketing crime statistics, and by urban centers that have absolutely imploded. You would think these guys would exercise some empathy and say yes, yes, I have a modicum of understanding of how that felt. So, let me report on it. Let me lift up and amplify your voices.

Researchers showed that the cells also learn and improve their performance in the game faster than A.I., meaning they taught a clump of brain to beat a computer at Pong. While the study of brain cell clusters and dishes is nothing new, researchers say, Pong playing mini brains are the first to be shown performing goal-oriented tasks, which can overwhelm some of the tinier human brains. So, this is considered a major step towards the creation of synthetic brains. And I have to say, it has -- it can't come soon enough, like scientists making a coronavirus more infectious to human mice hybrids. Why ask what could go wrong, I say? Emily, people don't understand. OK. So, if those brain cells are working on their own, they are living in a universe that they believe is only their universe, right? Their universe is Pong. So, in that world, they are literally living in a simulation. Which means aren't we living in a Pong world? Somebody else is doing exactly the same thing to us that we are doing to those brain cells.

Yes, they're taking a riot where the only unnatural death was from a cop shooting an unarmed woman and making it out to be worse than 9/11. And it hurts that they're still coping while everyone saw it for what it was an ugly event that came and went. But CNN can't let go. They need to convey to others how serious it was for them, because they're the real victims. And why? Because reporting what actually happened didn't scare enough people. And much like Loftus' body spray the ginned up hysteria has long worn off and all that's left is the stench. So, what's left for CNN? Besides a -- to catch a Predator reboot? They got the stars.

You know, the people whose complaints the press normally ignores. If these journalists are victims, then so as Jussie Smollett. They're hoaxing a hate crime against themselves. And yet here they are demanding compassion. Something that was strangely missing when dozens of Americans were dying in the riots that they, the media at CNN ignored back when everything was mostly peaceful. They hid those violent details like the Secret Service hides Joe Biden's car keys. So the media now appropriates the pain of real victims. Just like when they blame the terror attack in Waukesha on a SUV. They certainly didn't feel this way when violence rampage through nearly two dozen major cities led by Libs, perhaps because they were far removed from the disrupt -- destruction that that they papered over. See, that's why it's the soldiers who get PTSD, not the people who sent them to war, but you can't blame them for trying. The polling has shown the country moved on from CNN's latest fetish, at least a one that's legal. Yes, the public sees the Republicans moving in the right direction, while it's the Dems who keep sinking like an iPhone dropped in a toilet. Now, I don't know if the Republicans have any answers. Since when to any politicians these days, like the Maroon Five catalogue, I pretty much hate them all. But anything is better than what the Dems are serving. It's 2022 but it's dressed up now as 2021. I might have that backwards. Inflation, COVID, crime, it's a bottomless pit with spikes at the bottom, Emily. And that explains CNN all it -- going all in on January 6th, and you can see right through it like a Miley Cyrus tube top. It's also obvious, maybe January 6th will be the diversion we need to save us from our own casual dismissal of the suffering incurred under Democrat rule in 2021. Name if we focus on January 6th, America won't look at every single day. Other than that where CNN dismissed your pain as deserved were victims of persecution deserved it and where law enforcement was worse than the thugs they tried to protect you from. Meanwhile, they covered for the screwed up anchors, their political relatives and their deviant producers. In 2021, CNN did more covering up of the news than actual covering of the news. So, I get it, for CNN January 6th, it really is their Christmas."

Scientists have taught living human brain cells in a dish how to play the video game, Pong, and many taught dead ones how to write for Jimmy Fallon -- using electric pulses to stimulate the clumps of cells in a virtual game world which sounds better than human brains we experiment on. Researchers showed that the cells also learn and improve their performance in the game faster than A.I., meaning they taught a clump of brain to beat a computer at Pong. While the study of brain cell clusters and dishes is nothing new, researchers say, Pong playing mini brains are the first to be shown performing goal-oriented tasks, which can overwhelm some of the tinier human brains. So, this is considered a major step towards the creation of synthetic brains. And I have to say, it has -- it can't come soon enough, like scientists making a coronavirus more infectious to human mice hybrids. Why ask what could go wrong, I say? Emily, people don't understand. OK. So, if those brain cells are working on their own, they are living in a universe that they believe is only their universe, right? Their universe is Pong. So, in that world, they are literally living in a simulation. Which means aren't we living in a Pong world? Somebody else is doing exactly the same thing to us that we are doing to those brain cells. They just proved the simulation works by manipulating brain cells to perform an action, which is what is being done to us right now, Emily?"

Twitter permanently banned Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green over what it called COVID misinformation. Last week, that platform banned Virologist Dr. Robert Malone just days before he appeared on Rogan's podcast allegedly over his vaccine hesitancy. Meanwhile, debunked claims from Fauci, the CDC and administration are still posted with thousands of retweets. I'm going to stop there because I'm bored by this topic.
