Of course, news always breaks throughout the day when it's in Trumpland and a Comey memo may have let a big cat out of the bag. Did he use a meeting with Trump as a set-up to tarnish him with that dirty dossier? And also, it's official. The Democrats have hit rock bottom by filing a lawsuit claiming that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia and WikiLeaks to sway election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } My angle later on in the show; you don't want to miss that.

That's a motley crew. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And another huge diplomatic win for Trump. Rocket Man might be becoming pocket man, pledging to pocket all of his missiles, hey, and the guys haven't even met yet. Maybe it was Pompeo; maybe he does have the magic touch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, Jim Comey might want to pull the plug on that book tour now that the former investigator himself is under investigation. Fox News has confirmed that the Justice Department's Inspector General is investigating Comey's handling of his memos describing his meetings with President Trump; a source saying that the DOJ's watchdog is looking into whether the former FBI Director leaked any classified information. Let's get into the details with Attorney Tom Dupree who served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration plus Republican Ron Desantis who joins us from Florida tonight and Steven Mulroy, a former federal prosecutor. Gentlemen, it's great to see all of you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Steven, let's start with you here. Jim Comey as former FBI Director, perhaps thought that, look, I'm the FBI Director. I can declare what's classified and declare what's not classified and so if I shoot these memos over to pal of mine at Columbia Law School, no big deal. He will give them to the press and it will cause a big stir and maybe my reputation will be bolstered, maybe even start a special counsel. But, doesn't this mean that you know, Comey could be in hot water now with this new investigation?",

But, frankly I think the DNC should have included Garmin and Google Maps because Hillary Clinton couldn't find Wisconsin on the map to campaign. To come and make up excuses why the Democrats lost I think is pathetic. They had a bad message; they had a bad candidate. Donald Trump understood he had to go out and win the electorate with a set of ideas they bought into. That's why we won. I agree with your point. I hope the Democrats keep talking about Russia.

In fact, when the cameras go away, when the passion dies down, my challenge to all the young people is to maintain their desire to end the violence.

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" A fantastic Friday full of great stories for you. Of course, news always breaks throughout the day when it's in Trumpland and a Comey memo may have let a big cat out of the bag. Did he use a meeting with Trump as a set-up to tarnish him with that dirty dossier? And also, it's official. The Democrats have hit rock bottom by filing a lawsuit claiming that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia and WikiLeaks to sway election. My angle later on in the show; you don't want to miss that. And, get this, Democrats first tried to expand their voter base with illegal immigrants, then with children, and now with felons. That's a motley crew. And another huge diplomatic win for Trump. Rocket Man might be becoming pocket man, pledging to pocket all of his missiles, hey, and the guys haven't even met yet. Maybe it was Pompeo; maybe he does have the magic touch. But, first, Jim Comey might want to pull the plug on that book tour now that the former investigator himself is under investigation. Fox News has confirmed that the Justice Department's Inspector General is investigating Comey's handling of his memos describing his meetings with President Trump; a source saying that the DOJ's watchdog is looking into whether the former FBI Director leaked any classified information. Let's get into the details with Attorney Tom Dupree who served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration plus Republican Ron Desantis who joins us from Florida tonight and Steven Mulroy, a former federal prosecutor. Gentlemen, it's great to see all of you. Steven, let's start with you here. Jim Comey as former FBI Director, perhaps thought that, look, I'm the FBI Director. I can declare what's classified and declare what's not classified and so if I shoot these memos over to pal of mine at Columbia Law School, no big deal. He will give them to the press and it will cause a big stir and maybe my reputation will be bolstered, maybe even start a special counsel. But, doesn't this mean that you know, Comey could be in hot water now with this new investigation?"

      "speaker": "STEVEN MULROY, ATTORNEY AND PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure that's really the case, Laura. It's important to remember exactly what we know here. We won't know for sure until the Inspector General has concluded his investigation about what all the facts are for sure, but the Wall Street Journal has reported that there are only two memos that Comey gave to his friend that had any classified information. In one of them, he went through and redacted out the classified information and the other one wasn't classified at the time. It was only classified later on. So it seems like his course of conduct here was fairly anodyne; fairly inoffensive. You can't very well blame him if a document wasn't classified until a later point in time. That kind of retroactive liability, I think he could argue is unfair."

I asked Christopher Wray under oath is it appropriate for FBI agents to leak their work product to the press and he said absolutely not. I do think he is facing exposure because some of that stuff very well may have been classified. But, at the end of the day, this is a guy who took those documents, he wanted to generate a special counsel, and it's interesting you look at those memos, he actually writes down in the memos, I told the President I don't leak. The fact that he is writing that in the memo that he doesn't leak tells me probably was a habitual leaker."

This is from January 6th, right after his first meeting at Trump Tower with the president. He said and he wrote, \"I said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.\" That's very dramatic. I said something about it being difficult he relied that we replied we need to create a narrative that we were investigating him because of course we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. He kept, as Ron said -- Congressman Desantis said, he went out of his way a number of times to say to the President, he said, he claims in this memo to the file, that I'm not a leaker. You can trust Andrew McCabe, he is a stand-up guy and I don't leak and McCabe is in your corner. Memos to the file are written by people to do what, Steve? To do what?"

He knew it might become important later on to know exactly what was said and wasn't said. He want to contemporaneously document it so there would be no doubt."

He says, \"I said media like CNN had them, the memos, and were looking for a news hook. I said it was important that we not give them the excuse to write that the FBI has the material or that's redacted, and that we were keeping it very close hold.\" He said he couldn't believe they hadn't gone with it, and I said it was inflammatory stuff and they would get killed for reporting straight up from source reports and then, bingo, just a few days later, Congressman Desantis, CNN runs with it and then it gets published elsewhere. This is why people were saying, again, the way this is written, this memo to the file, I said CNN would be crazy to put -- I don't know. If you are writing a novel here, yeah, there is the CNN headline Intel Chief Presented Trump with Claims; Russian Efforts to Compromise Them. Where did they get that from? Where do they get that headline from?"

He never did with Loretta Lynch, even though he now says Loretta Lynch was conflicted. It was only from day one with Donald Trump. That meeting to me is very fishy. Jim Clapper, I and most of my Republican colleagues believe is the one that actually leaked the existence of the meeting to CNN. But, why would Comey have."

Now, here's the deal, Comey acknowledges that it's not news worthy at the time they need a hook. What does he do? He gives them the hook. So either him and Clapper knew this together or maybe he was acting at Clapper's suggestion, but he provided the hook for that to go out and when is he briefing Donald Trump on it I only talks about the one salacious allegation. He didn't discuss other aspects of the dossier. Don't you think that's something the President-Elect should have been entitled to know about and, yet, Comey hid that from him. This thing smells very badly and I think he is going to have to answer more questions about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Right and he has to come back to Capitol Hill, does he not, Steve? I think the point that Congressman Desantis is making is that when you go out of your way to bring up the dossier and you bring only basically one of the most inflammatory elements of the dossier up, that's rocket fuel. There is a lot of other stuff in the dossier. You bring up that one point and we know now in hindsight that he was using that professor at Columbia to then get information out to the press. So he had it in his mind couple months later to disseminate stuff to the press. He wanted it to get out there. He wanted a special counsel appointed. Why wouldn't it be logical now to think huh, maybe he and Clapper chatted about this that you know, we got to get this out. I mean, Trump is rattled about this."

He hated Donald Trump. Today he said on an interview or yesterday oh, no, I don't hate him. I didn't even dislike him. Oh, please he walked into that Trump Tower meeting, everything about Trump he despises; the way he dress, the why he speaks. He probably doesn't think he is as educated as he is. He has utter distain for Trump. He's a push Republican; I know you're a Bush Republican, but not like a lot of Bush Republicans I know. He's condescending, supercilious and priggish and he can't stand Trump because Trump's a different guy. Frankly the kind of guy people vote for."

I mean one of the many tragedies I think here, Laura, historically, the reasonable why the FBI has been held in such esteem by the American public is they have widely been viewed as a nonpartisan independent law enforcement agency. What Jim Comey is doing now undercuts that because what it is its portraying a former FBI Director as a partisan actor, as someone who has a political ax to grind. He is going to be the talk shows, he's taking personal jabs at the President, and it may be satisfying to him and people who don't like the President, but for purposes of the American people's perception of the FBI, I think it disserves the institution frankly."

They were classified as soon as he wrote them. I had an experience when I started as AG on taking notes at a meeting on a top secret procedure, and when I got up to leave the meeting, my then chief of staff leaned over and wrote in big block letters at the top, TS/SCI, meaning Top Secret/Secure Compartmentalized Information. In other words, those weren't my notes those were the government's notes and the information in them, if it was classified, was classified as soon as he put it down on paper."

The trouble is I'm not in much of a position to answer it because although there were many people that I met with less frequently than I met with him, I really have very little in the way of insight into what he is like as a person. I didn't get to see that. You'll notice that he always wears button down white shirts. Well, he is very buttoned down and buttoned up.

However, when there were questions some policy questions where I questioned him about things the FBI was doing, he pushed back and he was somebody who was very devoted to defending the interests of the bureau. There was a saying at the FBI, never embarrass the bureau, and bureaucratic saying and they call it the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a good reason. It's a bureaucracy and he defended it."

His handling in particular, everybody has their own favorite issue, mine is with his handling of the Clinton email investigation was an outrageous performance. President Obama was sending messages and receiving messages on Hillary Clinton's private email server. Jim Comey knew that and when President Obama went on television and said there is no issue here, she doesn't really intend to cause harm. What he was saying in essence is you better let her off if you wind up accusing her, you accuse me and Comey followed that lead.

And that the FBI for some strange reason neglected to subpoena what's on those servers, the DNC is so desperate to keep hidden? Also, how about this scene on the witness stand?

I know no one likes to admit that the problem we are in now is that it is such a Hillary Clinton blames Russia thing that no one is talking about Russians or Chinese or North Koreans or whoever it may be screwing around with our election.

The very DNC that hired and funded a dossier with information that came from Russian informants. They are of the ones that colluded with the Russians. Beyond that I don't know why they don't name Barack Obama who didn't do anything in the election of '16 to stop the Russian involvement in the election or James Comey who came out and did press releases on his investigation. But, frankly I think the DNC should have included Garmin and Google Maps because Hillary Clinton couldn't find Wisconsin on the map to campaign. To come and make up excuses why the Democrats lost I think is pathetic. They had a bad message; they had a bad candidate. Donald Trump understood he had to go out and win the electorate with a set of ideas they bought into. That's why we won. I agree with your point. I hope the Democrats keep talking about Russia. I hope they keep Nancy Pelosi in the leadership position because we're focusing on ideas that grow the economy, that make people's lives better and their families, and Democrats can't get beyond why they lost the last elections and Russia, Russia, Russia."

So, deep blue states, Hawaii and Massachusetts, deep red states, North Dakota and Utah. This is about re-enfranchising people, reintegrating people into civic life.

But right now if you are a parolee, there could be curfew requirements. There could be drug treatment program requirements, things that have to do with public safety.

It has to do with identifying with folks who have been disenfranchised. Governor Cuomo helped pass same sex marriage in New York City. He's worked to protect the rights of women. But I want to make one point before we go, which is George Will, a conservative commentator who you know quite well spoke recently in favor of ensuring that people who have been let out of prison in Florida, there is going to be ballot initiative there, get the right to vote.

This one was timed to coinside with the 19th anniversary, it's hard to believe, the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado. Joining us now to discuss how to really make schools safer is Darrell Scott. Darrell is the father of Rachel Scott who was the first victim of the Columbine High School shooters in Littleton, Colorado. Darrell, it's so great to talk to you. We have so many friends in common, and I'm so bowled over by everything have you done in these last 19 years. I'm sure to you it seems like yesterday. And you run this foundation called Rachel's Challenge. Tell us how you think it's the best way to proceed to actually stop these school shootings."

      "speaker": "DARRELL SCOTT, FOUNDER, RACHEL'S CHALLENGE",
      "utterance": "Well, thank you, Laura. It's great to be here with you. I really want to applaud young people as far as wanting to make a difference and for marching for what they believe in. I want to just gently challenge them to focus on more than just gun control, because Eric and Dylan, the shooters at Columbine 19 years ago said in the camera you are going to change the gun laws, you're going to add more gun laws, and it's not going to stop people like us from doing what we do. And I'm as passionate about change as these young people are. In fact, when the cameras go away, when the passion dies down, my challenge to all the young people is to maintain their desire to end the violence. And our family has chosen to do that over the last 19 years. We created a program for schools. We reach about 1 million to 2 million students each year, over 25 million over the last 19 years. And we have seen seven school shootings prevented and we've seen an average of about three suicides prevented every week. There's far more suicides than there are school victims of school shootings."

      "utterance": "And we have done that through a message of kindness, compassion, and helping connect people to one another because when there's violence or when there is reaction to these kind of situations, we can do one of three things. We can hate and we can retaliate. Dr. King told us that hate will not remove hate. Only love can do that. So we can hate and retaliate. We can debate and demonstrate. Or we can relate and communicate. And relating and communicating is what our message has been. And we see the fruit of that."

      "utterance": "She understood the power that a simple act of kindness can have. I have this theory that if one person can go out of their way to show compassion, that it will start a chain reaction of the same. You know at a time when most kids in high school are just trying to fit in, she just wanted to be herself and encouraged others to do the same."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "That's right. And, you know, there is a lot of attention being poured -- a lot of money is being poured into the gun issue. And I'm not here to debate that. There is money from both sides being poured into that as a solution. But we need to look beyond the instrument and look at how we can prevent these things from happening, starting with the hearts of our kids. And I want to challenge people to pour as much money into programs like Sandy Hook Promise, like Kick Start for Kids, like Why Try, like Rachel's Challenge. We have a friend, Fosters Freeze, who has put up $2.5 million from now through the end of July. And every one of you who donate $5, $10, it's going to be doubled to Rachel's challenge."

You've turned tragedy into triumph. We pray for you and for all the victims of gun violence and tragedy across this country. Thank you for what you are doing. We need a spiritual reawakening in this country, and you are helping, along with Fosters Freeze and so many others. And you have a donation coming from me, my friend. We'll be right back."
