It is 4:00 a.m., Vietnam time, in Hanoi. The president will get ready for what will be a busy day of continued negotiations with his North Korean counterpart, on the same day his presidency and his actions are being called into question a very fiery, politicized debate back and forth about what he knew and when he knew it, and to whom he was writing out checks, and why he was writing them out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A fiery back and forth that has a lot of Republicans saying, you couldn't put off this hearing until after the president got back on these talks, and, well, Democrat saying, there's no time like the present. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Welcome, everybody.

What is President Moon going to do? And I'm concerned that the longer this drags out, the more opportunity he has to maybe cut a bad deal with North Korea. Now, I think this denuclearization definition is the first order of business. In my mind, that's what we have got to do. And then I think the second thing we have got to do is, we have got to -- we have got to set a time certain when there will be future high-level negotiations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That includes obviously Mike Pompeo, as well as maybe John Bolton, to determine the specifics of how the North is going to denuclearize.

And Michael Cohen testified today that he had suspicions about collusion, coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he had no direct evidence. And the closest he came to direct evidence was testifying about a phone call in the summer of 2016 involving then candidate Trump, political operative Roger Stone, and Mr. Cohen, and it was about WikiLeaks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just for some context, before we get to the sound, at that time, the U.S. intelligence community had not drawn a straight line between the hacked e- mails and Russian hackers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's that testimony.

One of them has to do with a hush money payments made by the president, Cohen testified, in 2017. These were part of what he said were installments, money to Stormy Daniels over an affair she alleged that the president denied.

This is going to start getting interesting, then, because Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is going to be among the questioners and others. It could get feisty. In fact, I think it's safe to say it will. We're waiting to get a little order. Not all the members are there, I understand. But you're going to hear a lot more from people who have been champing at the bit to get a chance to do some of the questioning here. This is one of the advantages of the party in power having the power to dictate pretty much the course of events in the hearing itself. That old line that elections have consequences, this is a direct consequence of a midterm election that put Democrats in charge of the House and the majority of the House and all key committees, including the House Oversight Committee. One of the things that we are learning right now is this bad blood that existed between the president and Michael Cohen actually went back and forth, with some feisty back-and-forths, for the better part of a decade. Also known as the president's fixer, Michael Cohen was well-versed in some of the deals and the check payoffs and others, that he said the president was intimately aware and had lied to the American people. The Trump administration has been very cautious to respond in any way at all to this, developments half-a-world away in Vietnam, as he prepares to sit down and negotiate some sort of agreement with the North Koreans on their nuclear capabilities. But this, no doubt, as you heard from Lieutenant General Boykin, telling me that it did muddy the waters with the president and maybe compromised him over there, trying to work on America's behalf for an agreement that would do just, denuclearize North Korea. This very messy political affair back in this country is all anyone is talking about. And to the general chagrin, the problem is that that makes scoring a deal with the North Koreans much more difficult. Michael Cohen is testifying here. We can assume that he has been cleared by Bob Mueller to go ahead and say what he is saying. The fact of the matter is, he's going to be facing prison in just a couple of months and probably for upwards of three years. So nothing he says here will change that. Former Justice Department prosecutor and Ifrah law partner Jim Trusty joins us now, as we await the resumption of this hearing. What do you think so far?",

I'm not sure I buy that. I don't think they would let him take the witness stand. But that's really intriguing, whether there's still life to a campaign finance reform or whatever else -- campaign finance law or whatever else they are looking at, kind of investigations.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has indicted or received guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies that we know of, the latest being long-term Trump adviser Roger Stone.

I drive past it every day going between the Bronx and Queens. In fact, The Washington Post reported on the Trump Links Bronx course in an article entitled \"Taxpayers Built this New York Golf Course and Trump Reaps the Rewards.\" That article is where many New Yorkers and people in the country learned that taxpayers spent $127 million to build Trump Links in a \"generous deal allowing President Trump to keep almost every dollar that flows in on a golf course built with public funds.\" And this doesn't seem to be the only time the president has benefited at the expense of the public. Mr. Cohen, I want to ask you about your assertion that the president may improperly devalued his assets to avoid paying taxes. According to an August 24th -- August 21st 2016 report by The Washington Post: \"While the president claimed in financial disclosure forms that Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, was worth more than 50 million, he had reported otherwise to local tax authorities that the course was worth 'no more than 5 million'.\" Mr. Cohen, do you know whether this specific report is accurate?",

Before this committee alone, we looked at the issue of making Election Day a federal holiday, reducing drug pricing and pursued subpoenas to reunite families, and just recently, before we return to here, tried to pass a universal background check gun bill. So we are doing the business of the American people, including today. It has been said that the best sunlight -- sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants. Electric light is the most efficient policeman. Well, let there be light, because the point of the oversight is for us to pursue the trust, to pursue the truth and justice for the American people, to understand if lies, deceit and corruption are threatening American Democracy and indeed our safety. Mr. Chairman, charities should not be abused as personal piggy banks. It is both against the law and extremely unfair to charities that play by the rules. A line of questioning that we have not yet addressed and been glaringly absent in tackling is that of the abuses of the Trump Foundation. Now the president's charitable foundation agreed to dissolve, in response to an ongoing investigation and lawsuit by the New York attorney general. The New York attorney general found what it called -- quote -- \"clear and repeated violations of state and federal law,\" including -- quote -- \"repeated and willful self dealing by the Trump administration.\" My apologies, \"by the foundation.\" If I understand your opening statement correctly, in mid-2013, you arranged for a straw purchaser to bid $60,000 for a portrait Mr. Trump, painted by the artist William Quigley, at a charity auction.

They're about to resume the Michael Cohen hearings, the president's so-called fixer, who has now presented the president a bit of a fix. And on the right of your screen, his old boss, the president of the United States, meeting with the North Korean leader. It is 4:00 a.m., Vietnam time, in Hanoi. The president will get ready for what will be a busy day of continued negotiations with his North Korean counterpart, on the same day his presidency and his actions are being called into question a very fiery, politicized debate back and forth about what he knew and when he knew it, and to whom he was writing out checks, and why he was writing them out. A fiery back and forth that has a lot of Republicans saying, you couldn't put off this hearing until after the president got back on these talks, and, well, Democrat saying, there's no time like the present. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" As we wait for that hearing the resume, let's first get the raid on what is going on with these talks now in Vietnam. Retired Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin. General, good to have you. The timing of all this is a little weird. I'm wondering if it hurts, in your view, the president and his ongoing negotiations if, back home, the world knows that this is about his former personal lawyer spilling the beans on a lot of stuff that might or might not be true."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOYKIN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, look, I think it's just exactly what it appears to be. Again, it's an effort to humiliate the president at a time when he needs to be totally focused on developing a relationship with Kim and coming to some agreement on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I think that this is scandalous, quite frankly, and I think it's exactly what it looks like to everybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. So, General, let's step back and talk about things which are very familiar, and that is these talks and what we want to see out of them. We obviously have very different opinions on what is denuclearization. To me, it seems rather simple. Just stop the nuke stuff, period. But it isn't that simple. I understand that. But is there a timeline that you think we should be pushing with Kim Jong- un, or what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOYKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, me personally, I think we should be very careful with the timeline. What I think is also looming on the horizon that we haven't paid a lot of attention to is, what is South Korea going to do? What is President Moon going to do? And I'm concerned that the longer this drags out, the more opportunity he has to maybe cut a bad deal with North Korea. Now, I think this denuclearization definition is the first order of business. In my mind, that's what we have got to do. And then I think the second thing we have got to do is, we have got to -- we have got to set a time certain when there will be future high-level negotiations. That includes obviously Mike Pompeo, as well as maybe John Bolton, to determine the specifics of how the North is going to denuclearize. Reaching the point where we have a common decision on the definition between the two of us is a major hurdle. I hope we get there. But I'm not sure that we will during these -- these talks."

And Michael Cohen testified today that he had suspicions about collusion, coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he had no direct evidence. And the closest he came to direct evidence was testifying about a phone call in the summer of 2016 involving then candidate Trump, political operative Roger Stone, and Mr. Cohen, and it was about WikiLeaks. Just for some context, before we get to the sound, at that time, the U.S. intelligence community had not drawn a straight line between the hacked e- mails and Russian hackers. Here's that testimony. MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY/FIXER FOR DONALD TRUMP: Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of e-mails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect, \"Wouldn't that be great?\""

      "utterance": "The other two issues that were discussed today have to do with the Southern District of New York. And I think these pieces of testimony may be the most efficient, because they speak to the possibility of ongoing legal exposure for President Trump. One of them has to do with a hush money payments made by the president, Cohen testified, in 2017. These were part of what he said were installments, money to Stormy Daniels over an affair she alleged that the president denied. What we saw today consistently from lawmakers was a clear political divide between those who felt there was new information here and others who felt that Cohen had a credibility problem."

And just to say there's more coming, there is in fact tomorrow, because there will be a closed session in front of the House Intelligence Committee, where they're dealing specifically with the issues surrounding Russia. But I think the bottom line for folks at home is that it looks like the most legal exposure, if it exists, is in the Southern District of New York for Donald Trump on issues that are unrelated to Russia collusion -- Neil."

However, as to what Michael Cohen said, the government can't -- doesn't always get to pick its witnesses. Often, the people who testify on behalf of the government or as morally bad as the people the government's prosecuting. All right, so Michael Cohen lied, and he admitted to it, and now says, I'm now telling the truth. If he's that kind of a monster, Mr. President, why do you keep him around for 10 years?"

Answer, \"No.\" If what Michael Cohen says is true that the president knew about the meeting with the Russians in Trump Tower in June of 2016, then he lied under oath, because he told Bob Mueller he didn't know about it."

      "utterance": "Correct. In one case, though, there is there is corroborating evidence. And that is the payments to -- by Donald Trump signed while he was president to Michael Cohen showing a debt from the president to Michael Cohen. The president swore in his financial statements filed with the Department of the Treasury he didn't have any debts with Michael Cohen. And two months after he swore to the accuracy of that, he starts writing checks of $35,000 a month to Michael Cohen. That extends the conspiracy to defraud the FEC, the Federal Election Commission, of accurate campaign information into the president's presidency. So, if Cohen is being truthful, and if the government can corroborate what he said today, there's at least four potential felonies of which he has accused the president of the United States."

They started out -- if this is their best witness, they have got credibility issues. Speaking of which, Michael Cohen, I asked him specific -- specifically if he remembered the date of that phone call that he claims that Roger Stone had with Trump where they learned about the WikiLeaks. He said it was the end of July. Well, guess what? On June 12 -- and I submitted this to the record -- on June 12, Julian Assange had released that information to the media already.

I asked him, was he a good lawyer when he made the payments to Ms. Clifford, because in his testimony this morning, what he said was, he didn't even consider whether it was right or wrong or the proper thing to do. He didn't care. He just did it. I said, how could you be advising your client of the legality of this when you didn't care what the legality was? And he -- and so he tried to say he was a good..."

This is now, according to his personal lawyer, what he was doing as the president of the United States. Did you or your colleagues, Republican colleagues in particular, take on the substance or the veracity of those remarks? Because I -- I didn't watch the whole thing, to be honest, Congressman.

Liz, if I can ask you the question I have asked others here, why today? Why did they have to do this today? I'm not minimizing the importance of hearing from Michael Cohen, but hearing from Michael Cohen on the exact same day the president is trying to negotiate a denuclearization agreement with the North Koreans. Was it a drop-dead date, they had to do it today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIZ HARRINGTON, THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they had to do it today because they're more interested in reasons why President Trump won in 2016 than actual news and newsworthy stories of his diplomacy with North Korea, because the more consequential story is certainly the negotiations with Kim Jong-un. But Democrats are still focused on 2016 and how President Trump won. So that's what they choose to elevate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The one thing I -- you might be right. I don't know. But I do know that when -- a couple of weeks ago, when they had ironed out the details, down to the minute and the hour the day, about what was going to happen with the president of Vietnam negotiating with the North Koreans, they knew this. The Democratic majority on the committee knew this. And I'm not dismissing the importance of eventually having a hearing, open or otherwise. But then knowing that in advance, you would think that someone would have volunteered, all right, doing it this very day might not be that crucial. I mean, this guy is going to be going off to prison in a couple of months, right? So there is that. So why today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "utterance": "They didn't have to do it today. They certainly didn't have to do it today. And I think they want to do it today to take away the news coverage and make it harder for President Trump to stay focused on his job as president, because they always choose the -- choose what's going to hurt President Trump the most."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Did any of this hurt him. Do you think in anything that you have heard -- and a lot of your colleagues have been in the hearing. I know a lot has been focused on the Southern District of New York, of course, and what they're getting in their case to pursue the president and his business dealings dating back many years that have nothing to do with collusion. But did anything come up here that, if you're the president, you're saying, oh, boy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "utterance": "I don't think there's anything new. I mean, the news that we have from Cohen is what we already know, that the media falsely reported that Trump directed him to lie to Congress. That -- Cohen said that wasn't true. Cohen said the main points in the dossier, which started this whole nonsense, also wasn't true. He never went to Prague. So the big stories of why we're even here in the first place of trying to grapple with the results of the 2016 election, nothing new came out of it, and actually refuted all the Democrats' reasons for these investigations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "One of the other things I just want to get, how do you think -- obviously, this started with Republicans on the committee saying, we got to put this off. There's no reason to do this, right, today. Obviously, Democrats, now in the majority, made sure that didn't happen. I'm just wondering what happens then tomorrow in a closed-door meeting. Is this a follow-up on this or new -- new material?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "utterance": "I don't think there's actually much new material there. I think Cohen -- everything we have known is the same stuff. And now he's just saying what Democrats want to hear, that Trump is a racist and a misogynist and everything else he can throw at him. Everything else -- I mean, that's nothing new. And there's nothing new on the Russia stuff. He has no information. And the payments with the campaign finance violations, it's proven that Michael Cohen is not a great lawyer, because he pled guilty to a violation that isn't even a campaign finance violation, if the payment would have happened irrespective of the campaign, which we know President Trump would have paid off Stormy Daniels anyway if he wasn't running for president. So, again, no real new information to go on."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you know why Bob Mueller -- not -- maybe I'm ignorant here. He couldn't have controlled getting Cohen up there regardless, but why Bob Mueller would let this go on, would let Cohen go ahead and speak before Congress, especially in a public venue?"

      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",

I don't know -- know what it gains him, except he's trying to ingratiate himself, I guess, to the media and to Democrats and to save his reputation. But nobody really believes him anymore. I mean, you have plenty of reasons on all sides to not like this guy. And I don't know why Mueller would like him testifying either, when he might be perjuring himself again, right? We have already seen him say that he said -- told the committee today he didn't ever want a job in the White House. And you had a lot of people have come out and say Cohen was specifically asking for a job in the White House. So he might be lying again today. So I'm really not sure why he was -- he thought it was a good idea. I guess it was because the Democrats would have subpoenaed him."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So what I'm wondering, if all of this is true, what Michael Cohen has raised, and he was working with him for the better part of a decade, why did he put up with it for so long?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "utterance": "That's, I think, to me the biggest question or the biggest problem that Trump supporters will have with the president, is, why did he employ this guy for so long? He's supposed to have the best judgment of hiring the best people, but this guy is clearly not the most credible, honest, good guy. To his own -- he called himself not a nice guy today in the hearing, but that might be the biggest question that Trump supporters will still have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Then what happens? I mean, does this weigh into the public perception here of this, whether people are hearing for the first time things that they didn't hear? I mean, a lot of people in the know and have been following, this is not exactly FOX News Alerts here, but others who might become aware of it, it's a first for them. Then what?"
    },

      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "utterance": "Is their mind going to be changed that they think Trump is a Russian stooge? No. The rest of the country, a lot of them probably don't know who Michael Cohen is. They're not paying attention. They have long since tuned out. And then people on the right tuning in to FOX News right now, they probably have their ideas too that it does not matter."

      "utterance": "It looks like this hearing is resuming right now. This is going to start getting interesting, then, because Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is going to be among the questioners and others. It could get feisty. In fact, I think it's safe to say it will. We're waiting to get a little order. Not all the members are there, I understand. But you're going to hear a lot more from people who have been champing at the bit to get a chance to do some of the questioning here. This is one of the advantages of the party in power having the power to dictate pretty much the course of events in the hearing itself. That old line that elections have consequences, this is a direct consequence of a midterm election that put Democrats in charge of the House and the majority of the House and all key committees, including the House Oversight Committee. One of the things that we are learning right now is this bad blood that existed between the president and Michael Cohen actually went back and forth, with some feisty back-and-forths, for the better part of a decade. Also known as the president's fixer, Michael Cohen was well-versed in some of the deals and the check payoffs and others, that he said the president was intimately aware and had lied to the American people. The Trump administration has been very cautious to respond in any way at all to this, developments half-a-world away in Vietnam, as he prepares to sit down and negotiate some sort of agreement with the North Koreans on their nuclear capabilities. But this, no doubt, as you heard from Lieutenant General Boykin, telling me that it did muddy the waters with the president and maybe compromised him over there, trying to work on America's behalf for an agreement that would do just, denuclearize North Korea. This very messy political affair back in this country is all anyone is talking about. And to the general chagrin, the problem is that that makes scoring a deal with the North Koreans much more difficult. Michael Cohen is testifying here. We can assume that he has been cleared by Bob Mueller to go ahead and say what he is saying. The fact of the matter is, he's going to be facing prison in just a couple of months and probably for upwards of three years. So nothing he says here will change that. Former Justice Department prosecutor and Ifrah law partner Jim Trusty joins us now, as we await the resumption of this hearing. What do you think so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a lot of people are going to see what they want to see or hear what they want to hear. But I think there's two real interesting issues, one of which Andy McCarthy brought up a couple of hours ago, which is, Cohen started referring to himself as cooperating, present tense, with the Southern District of New York. I'm not sure I buy that. I don't think they would let him take the witness stand. But that's really intriguing, whether there's still life to a campaign finance reform or whatever else -- campaign finance law or whatever else they are looking at, kind of investigations. So that's one that I think really needs some follow-up. And I would be really interested to see if the Southern District confirms it or denies it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That's been your concern, too. We're so focused on Mueller and the probe, that we haven't looked at what's happening in the Southern District. I know Chris Christie on his book tour has been saying much the same thing, that that is where the president should be worried. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "I think that's a pretty good guess. I mean, we're all in the dark a little bit. I think a report could still come out that would be very hurtful to the president from the Mueller probe, even if it falls short of being a blueprint for impeachment. But the Southern District of New York, when you look at the pleadings, the sentencing memo that involves Cohen up there, it looked like a pretty active investigation that was aimed at least in part at the president. So that may be the one to worry about. But, again, I can't imagine that they would say go on and go to your mea culpa tour and go to testify in front of Congress all day if they really wanted to use him as a live body someday as a witness."

During the 2016 campaign you said you personally wouldn't -- quote -- \"allow him to release those returns until the audits are over\" -- unquote. For the record, nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax returns even while under audit by the IRS. Mr. Cohen, do you know whether President Trump's tax returns were really under audit by the IRS in 2016?"

      "speaker": "GOMEZ",

My constituents need to know whether the president has financial ties that are causing him to protect his own bottom line rather than the best interest of this country. Can he be blackmailed because of his financial and business ventures, including by foreign governments, and I know that the opposition is the first thing they're going to ask or say is that he released his financial disclosure forms. But I believe there are other things we can learn from his taxes. Do you -- do you have any idea what we can learn in his tax returns if we actually received -- we got our hands on them?"

One of the things I also find ironic is the way they're kind of attacking you is to undermine your credibility is one of the ways is by saying that you committed bank fraud and tax evasion. And the reason why it's a big deal is that it really goes down to the person's character when it comes to taxes but yet the republican minority has never asked to see his taxes, right? Something that for 40 years Democrats and Republicans alike have released their tax returns to prove to the American people that they didn't have financial interests that would be leverageable by a foreign government, but this minority refuses to ask for his tax returns. I also want to kind of go on. I am noticing a pattern -- I am noticing a pattern about the president and those in his inner circle. Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has indicted or received guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies that we know of, the latest being long-term Trump adviser Roger Stone. That group includes six former Trump advisers. It appears that the present has a fondness for entrusting those who will, one, lie for him, two, break the law for him, three, cheat the system for him. Essentially, he wants to surround himself with people who are just like him. Would you agree with that statement?"

And in that you mentioned a treasure trove -- a treasure trove of documents in David Pecker's office relating the information assembled from all of these \"catch and kill\" operations against people who potentially had damaging information on the president.

Mr. Cohen, I want to ask you about your assertion that the president may improperly devalued his assets to avoid paying taxes. According to an August 24th -- August 21st 2016 report by The Washington Post: \"While the president claimed in financial disclosure forms that Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, was worth more than 50 million, he had reported otherwise to local tax authorities that the course was worth 'no more than 5 million'.\" Mr. Cohen, do you know whether this specific report is accurate?"

And I know there are some that would have you believe the more you say something the more true it is. But in fact, this committee, thanks to your leadership and our Democratic majority, has been doing the work of the American people. Before this committee alone, we looked at the issue of making Election Day a federal holiday, reducing drug pricing and pursued subpoenas to reunite families, and just recently, before we return to here, tried to pass a universal background check gun bill. So we are doing the business of the American people, including today. It has been said that the best sunlight -- sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants. Electric light is the most efficient policeman. Well, let there be light, because the point of the oversight is for us to pursue the trust, to pursue the truth and justice for the American people, to understand if lies, deceit and corruption are threatening American Democracy and indeed our safety. Mr. Chairman, charities should not be abused as personal piggy banks. It is both against the law and extremely unfair to charities that play by the rules. A line of questioning that we have not yet addressed and been glaringly absent in tackling is that of the abuses of the Trump Foundation. Now the president's charitable foundation agreed to dissolve, in response to an ongoing investigation and lawsuit by the New York attorney general. The New York attorney general found what it called -- quote -- \"clear and repeated violations of state and federal law,\" including -- quote -- \"repeated and willful self dealing by the Trump administration.\" My apologies, \"by the foundation.\" If I understand your opening statement correctly, in mid-2013, you arranged for a straw purchaser to bid $60,000 for a portrait Mr. Trump, painted by the artist William Quigley, at a charity auction.

      "utterance": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, all of you, for centering this committee on our sole purpose, is exposing the truth. And some of my colleagues can't handle the truth, and this is unfortunate because it's the center of what is protecting our country right now. The people at home are frustrated, Mr. Cohen, and they want criminal schemes to stop, especially those from the Oval Office. Mr. Cohen, I am upset and know that my residents feel the same way, that man you worked for, for the past 10 years, is using the most powerful position in the world to hurt our country solely for personal gain. We are upset that some of our colleagues here are so disconnected of what it means to have this president of the United States sending checks to cover bribe payments, not hush payments, bribe payments, you made on his behalf -- one in 2017 of March and another, August 2017, after he was sworn in as president. They are upset that, while my colleagues are trying to discredit your testimony by some of your own unlawful acts and lies, that they are disconnected with the fact that you were the personal lawyer for this president of the United States, that this president chose you as his legal counsel. My stance has always been the same, Mr. Chairman, based on the facts, not on future reports that we're all waiting on. My residents back home don't need a collusion cause with a foreign government to know this president, Individual 1, has disregarded the law of the land, the United States Constitution, and that he has misused has pardon powers. In the sentencing memo, Mr. Cohen, filed by the federal prosecutors in December of last year, they stated -- quote -- \"In particular, and as Cohen himself has not admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual 1.\" Mr. Cohen, as you know, Donald J. Trump brand comes first, not the American people. Based on what you know now, based on what we know now, has that Individual 1 used his money, businesses and platform to enrich -- to enrich himself, his brand, and in the process, directed you, Mr. Cohen, to commit multiple felonies and you covered it up? Correct?"

It's racist to suggest that I asked her to come in here for that reason. Mr. President -- the president's own person, she's a family member, and she loves this family. She came in because she felt like the president of the United States was getting falsely accused. And, Mr. Chairman, you are -- you and I have a personal relationship that's not based on color.
