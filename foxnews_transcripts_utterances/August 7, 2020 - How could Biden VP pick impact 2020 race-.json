Prosecutors said violent criminals were not eligible for release, but the judge set him free. Even though he faced charges of violently raping, choking and abducting Karla Dominguez outside of her Alexandria, Virginia, apartment, last July. Bouaichi was not supposed to leave his home in Maryland, but last week, he allegedly drove to Dominquez apartment and shot her to death. Two days ago, cops spotted him but he fled and crashed his car. Before cops could take him into custody, he shot himself and is now in grave condition.

And so, that is a very clear message. They have been very consistent on saying they aren't intent to destroy America. They need to be termed \"domestic enemies\" at this point for wielding their power in an unconstitutional way, and forcing in partisan, political prosecutions like this that are absolutely partisan. There were 26 attorneys general who are Republicans who signed a statement in the NRA case, calling it a partisan hit job that's aimed at empowering the mob and endangering the law-abiding citizens who love and support the Second Amendment.

And so, they look at the situation, they're concerned about their kids So this is a situation, the data shows that our kids are less likely to die of COVID than the seasonal flu. They look at how badly homeschooling meant for most of us and it really socked. And also, they look at what is happening with the economy. And they understand intuitively, that our economy and the Great Depression will hurt families, will hurt childhood, and it will make us less free and more vulnerable to national security threats from China and so forth. A weak economy means a weak America and that is bad for our kids and our families. And parents have made this calculation long before Chuck Schumer did. They figured it out.

There are 350 million people in this country, and this is the guy they came up with? This is the guy -- he's run for president umpteen times before. He's been rejected every time. The only way he got into the White House at that moment Barack Obama in 2008 needed a guy that was like Joe Biden to be his sort of wing man. And that's the only reason he has any White House experience in the first place. But this is downright -- it's painful to watch. And I think Matt is exactly right. At one level, it's -- it is kind of comical, but on the other level, it is like elder abuse. And you have these Democrats who are willing to put a guy out there like this, put him through this humiliating experience.

Now, late last night, the Biden campaign try to clean up the remarks, but here's the thing -- there is nothing Democrats can do to clean up Biden's decades of failure in the Washington swamp and his endless disasters on the 2020 campaign trail. And it's why in 88 days, 88 days, we face the biggest choice election of our lifetime, because it's not just Joe Biden and his bizarre blunders on the ballot in November, it is everything the new, extreme Democratic Party stands for. Joining me now for a reactions, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell, along with Salem radio host Larry Elder. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us here tonight. Leo, they brought out the big guns to defend Joe Biden. They brought out Congressman Clyburn. They brought out the mayor of Atlanta. They all tried to get out and put the spin on this thing. It just didn't fly, did it?"

Jim Clyburn came out. And you know what is insulting about that? Jim Clyburn comes out carrying Joe Biden's water and expect all black Americans, Larry, myself Condoleezza Rice, to believe his version of what Joe Biden said. Jim Clyburn insults our intelligence because again, he can't speak for me, he can't speak for Larry, he can't speak for black Americans. And what those other networks are doing like MSNBC, and CNN, they're doing a disservice to black Americans because the prerequisite to go on those shows, you have to be an apologist to the Democratic plantation mentality. And as Andrea Mitchell wants to interview black Americans who have different opinions, invite me, invite Larry, invite us, and we'll ill tell her exactly how we feel that we want to move from this Democratic mindset of extremism and we want to vote for President Trump. One last point, Jim Clyburn has no credibility. He attacks our great president by trying to make a derogatory comment about being Mussolini and he attacks our American soldiers by calling Gestapo tactics. Jim Clyburn is a dinosaur and he needs to retire yesterday."

Ayanna Pressley last year said we don't need any more brown faces who don't want to be brown voices. We don't need any more black places who don't want to be black voices. How is that different than Joe Biden telling Charlemagne Tha God, if you don't know if you want me or Biden, you ain't really black. These are how these guys roll. Diane Watson, a congresswoman, once said of a black political Republican opponent, you're married to a white woman, you have no ethnic pride. Marc Lamont Hill when Donald Trump got elected and invited people like Jim Brown and Steve Harvey to the White House, and he referred to them as, quote, mediocre Negroes. And Don Lemon when Kanye West flatter Donald Trump in the Oval Office said that he was, quote, a minstrel show. All that is doing, is saying to black people, there's only one way to be black and if you're not a Democrat, you are not black. You are an Uncle Tom, you're a con, you're a sellout. That's exactly what Joe Biden has said. That's what he's been taught. That's what his campaign has told him. And when a white person says it, it's insane indignation. It's hysterical."

Democrats think they own us. They do not. They do not own us and they have done nothing. I don't need Nancy Pelosi and Karen Bass kneeling on the floor, wearing African garb.

It's about the treatment of people like Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams, many of whom people in black America don't even know about because \"Ebony\" magazine every year has what is called 100 most influential black Americans. And Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams and even Clarence Thomas aren't even in there. So, imagine what would happen to the black community had people like Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams listen to 30, 40 years ago talking about choice, which would have improved things in the black community immeasurably. But they're not invited, they're dismissed as Uncle Toms because the Democrats taught black people like that her enemies. That is how successful the Democrats have been in convincing black people that they wear the white hat, Republicans wear the black hat. It's astonishing."

Yikes! But regardless of who Joe Biden picks, one thing is for sure, the Biden campaign is committed to running the most far left and out of touch campaign we've ever seen, embracing everything from open borders, to higher taxes, and economy-killing climate policies. Now, this radical extreme socialist agenda will be on full display at the virtual convention later this month, with speakers reportedly come including Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama. But what is still not clear is whether or not Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez will be granted a high-profile speaking slot despite her role in bringing these radical positions into Biden's platform. Joining me now for reaction, Trump 2020 director of press communications, Erin Perrine, along with FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce. Thank you both for joining us here tonight. Tammy, I want to start with you. What's on the line for the country and for Joe Biden in the selection of his vice presidential pick?"

But what it shows you is what the Democratic Party views of the future and who their future talent is going to be. So, for Democrats and regular Americans who are as appalled at what's going on as we are, and who are watching their party dissolve right underneath them, they have an interest in what the signaling is here. And if the Clintons and the Obama's are okay with this, that's the other issue. You know, you can look at Portland as an indication whether or not the Democrats felt that first perhaps, they were in charge and in control over what was happening in the streets. And then suddenly, they lost control. I think that is where they're at right now. The only person in control of an agenda in this country, thank God, is Donald Trump and he is moving it forward. It is general chaos -- you're going to -- you know, this is a benefit for the Democrats. They were going to have a huge floor fight. They weren't going to be able to stop Ocasio- Cortez. My advice to her, by the way, if she is not invited with all the work she has done, even though I follow vociferously everything she does, she should have a separate event and she should challenge them with that, because Americans who support her should have a right to see her. If she is shut out, she should make a point of making sure she's -- the American people understand she isn't happy about that."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, she has been a major impact player for the Democrats, but, Erin, what Tammy mentioned is right. These elections and the candidates are put forward about the future. But when they were successful as Democrats, think of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, new, vibrant ideas with a lot of energy. And this time, the Democrats are with somebody who's elected in 1972 when I was barely kicking a soccer ball. What does that say about where the Democrats are and the importance of this VP pick for Joe Biden? ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: Well, it shows that the Democrats don't really have any true ideas. They just needed a vessel for the radical, social agenda, and they got that vessel in Joe Biden. When it comes to his VP pick, we've seen him delay and delay and delay. Remember, if they had the convention at the normal time, it would have happen a month ago who they were going to select. And why is it so delayed? Well, because Joe Biden has got bad choices across-the-board between crazy or even crazier when it comes to who he's going to try to pick. You look at, you know, comrade Karen Bass who praises socialist dictators. You look at Kamala Harris who if you saw her on the debate stage, I don't really think likes Joe Biden that much. You look at Susan Rice, who has an abysmal record in the Obama/Biden administration, actually ordering the cybersecurity community to stand down when they knew that there was a potential for foreign election interference. It really doesn't matter who Joe Biden picks because it's a bad choice pool all around for him, not only is this who we thinks will be the future of the Democrat Party, he says he is the transition candidate, but look who he is talking about. He's even floating -- I don't know, pretend Governor Stacey Abrams, or even, you know, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, queen of do as I say, not as I do with her tyrannical hold in Michigan. It truly doesn't matter. Joe Biden is an empty vessel filled by the radicals."

Remember, hypothetically -- and let's say Joe Biden wins some help which, again I'm 110 percent sure it will not happen. What they are thinking about is what vice presidential choice, which one of those three women as an example will keep their secrets? Because that was the scariest thing with Donald Trump and his team were going to come into possession of everything that they had been doing. Kamala Harris is a transactional person. She will do and say and become whatever is required to get what it is she wants. And it doesn't matter what she originally thought of Joe Biden. Maybe she now is going to think something differently. I don't think Bass or Susan -- well, Susan Rice perhaps can be trusted to keep secrets because she's got a lot to lose as well. But I think Bass is going to be a problem for them. So the issue is, who is going to do what they are told without becoming a problem? That is going to be who that person is going to be seen as being, and that's also not a good sign for the future of the party either of."

Because there is the Bernie/Biden socialist manifesto of policy, including amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants, free health care for those illegal immigrants. But who's paying for that health care? Oh, that's right, the hard working taxpayers of the United States. Those with jobs who are paying into the tax system here in this country. Listen, Democrats have made it clear, they want socialism. They want government to have more of your money and more of your choice. They don't want opportunity. They want to ban fracking which would eliminate jobs. I mean, look at their contrasts on the Green New Deal. You're talking about 10 million jobs gone. And what does Joe Biden think? Oh, they can become a coder. He can't read off a teleprompter without an issue, and he thinks that miners are going to become coders overnight, The Democrats are delusional socialists, and wrong for America."

Back in April, lawyers for 33-year-old Ibrahim Bouaichi argued that he should be released over coronavirus fears. Prosecutors said violent criminals were not eligible for release, but the judge set him free. Even though he faced charges of violently raping, choking and abducting Karla Dominguez outside of her Alexandria, Virginia, apartment, last July. Bouaichi was not supposed to leave his home in Maryland, but last week, he allegedly drove to Dominquez apartment and shot her to death. Two days ago, cops spotted him but he fled and crashed his car. Before cops could take him into custody, he shot himself and is now in grave condition. Experts argue that violent offenders should never be included in the compassionate release of prisoners but again and again, they are, and again and again, they violently reoffend.

And Jenna and I can tell you and all the lawsuits we actually both filed in our careers, 1,633-page lawsuit going after the NRA when New York is in a time of crisis is really unheard of. They want to dissolve the NRA is really even more unheard of.

And this isn't just exclusive to the Second Amendment. We've seen this in religious liberty cases going on right now. We have seen this in speech cases, association cases, assembly cases. And so, this is something where Democrats all across the nation in leadership have put moderate and independent voters on notice that a vote for Joe Biden or a vote for a Democrat all the way down the ticket is a vote for tyranny. And so, that is a very clear message. They have been very consistent on saying they aren't intent to destroy America. They need to be termed \"domestic enemies\" at this point for wielding their power in an unconstitutional way, and forcing in partisan, political prosecutions like this that are absolutely partisan. There were 26 attorneys general who are Republicans who signed a statement in the NRA case, calling it a partisan hit job that's aimed at empowering the mob and endangering the law-abiding citizens who love and support the Second Amendment. And so, President Trump has been very clear that he is the only candidate, he is the only president that is standing on the side of the Constitution and is willing to make sure that our rights, our liberties, our freedoms and everything that makes this country great, that he is on the side of preserving and protecting that for all."

Teachers unions, of course, have been standing in the way of the success of students and teachers for a very long time. And we know that they help control the Democratic Party.

      "utterance": "Absolutely. I think one of the legacies to the pandemic, let a parents who maybe were ambivalent about school choice or suddenly waking up to the idea educational freedom and parental choice is really important, and this really brought it to life. I'll say this, parents are smart. Parents love their kids more than the government, you know? And so, they look at the situation, they're concerned about their kids So this is a situation, the data shows that our kids are less likely to die of COVID than the seasonal flu. They look at how badly homeschooling meant for most of us and it really socked. And also, they look at what is happening with the economy. And they understand intuitively, that our economy and the Great Depression will hurt families, will hurt childhood, and it will make us less free and more vulnerable to national security threats from China and so forth. A weak economy means a weak America and that is bad for our kids and our families. And parents have made this calculation long before Chuck Schumer did. They figured it out. Donald Trump was on to it, now lo and behold, they change their mind because the polls show that."

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely, and Rachel made such a good point there that it is actually true, if there is one blessing that has come out of this craziness that we're experiencing right now is that parents are realizing the importance of school choice and realizing that maybe the government doesn't have their best interest at heart, their kids best interest at heart. And that is not something that the Democrats saw coming but I think it's going to be a problem for them in the election, especially because the Biden/Bernie task force wants to ban for-profit charter schools and limit school choice. That is a part of their agenda. So, I'm hoping parents are using this to wake up and realize that the time is now to take control of their child's education for the best of their child."

We have to make a fundamental change. And I think as you said my think one of the legacies of COVID will actually be school choice comes to the forefront. At least I hope so. Thank you so much for joining us. I really do appreciate it."
