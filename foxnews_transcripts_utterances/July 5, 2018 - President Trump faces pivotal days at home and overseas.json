It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert, another cabinet shakeup for the Trump administration, EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt has resigned. President Trump tweeting the announcement aboard Air Force One on his way to a campaign rally in Great Falls, Montana, which is coming up in about an hour from now. Of course, we'll have that for you live. John Roberts joins us from the White House with the latest.

      "sentences": "Your head has got to be on swivel 24/7 here at the White House. This is not a surprise. It's really been a long time coming. What has been a surprise to many, many people is how Scott Pruitt held on to his job as long as he did given the controversy that was swirling around him, 14 different ethics investigations. But in his farewell tweet, Scott Pruitt after his resignation, you can see why he held on because the President really appreciated what he was doing. President Trump tweeting, I accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The senate confirm deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will take over on Monday, assume duty as the acting administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Scott Pruitt issued his resignation in a form of a letter to the president. The Administrator Pruitt shared that letter with me. I think the particular excerpt from that letter, the passage from that letter that is important here is Pruitt saying I'm stepping down as administrator of EPA effective as of July 6. It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in this role, first, because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also because of the transformative work that is occurring. However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented, has taken a sizeable toll on all of us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was well publicized all of the controversy and scandals that Pruitt has been facing, but there was another one that was facing him which may have been the most important at all. Congressman Ted Lou, as well as Don Baier had sent a letter to the inspector general at the EPA claiming that certain appointments in Scott Pruitt's calendar had been scrubbed from the official record because the meetings were with people that would have, quote, looked bad, in the federal record, and not keeping proper federal records can be considered to be a crime. So that was facing him, as well. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fierce critic of Administrator Pruitt, said Scott Pruitt was the worst administrator in the history of the agency. Congressman Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, simply said it's about time in terms of Scott Pruitt's departure. Again, Dana, he held on where so many other people in an administrative capacity would not have been able to, simply because the president thought he was doing a good job. The president during the campaign railed against what he called onerous and duplicative federal regulation that were really handcuffing, he believe, industry from being able to create the sort of economy that President Trump thought was possible, and Pruitt was right there on the front lines of it cutting those regulations, certainly, earned him a lot of enemies in government, at the EPA. In a breakfast that I had with Pruitt a couple of weeks ago, he thought that he was being targeted by people who wanted to see him gone, and today, he is gone. Dana. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert, another cabinet shakeup for the Trump administration, EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt has resigned. President Trump tweeting the announcement aboard Air Force One on his way to a campaign rally in Great Falls, Montana, which is coming up in about an hour from now. Of course, we'll have that for you live. John Roberts joins us from the White House with the latest. John, you can't ever take a break, you have to be on your toes at all times at the White House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Your head has got to be on swivel 24/7 here at the White House. This is not a surprise. It's really been a long time coming. What has been a surprise to many, many people is how Scott Pruitt held on to his job as long as he did given the controversy that was swirling around him, 14 different ethics investigations. But in his farewell tweet, Scott Pruitt after his resignation, you can see why he held on because the President really appreciated what he was doing. President Trump tweeting, I accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The senate confirm deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will take over on Monday, assume duty as the acting administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright. Scott Pruitt issued his resignation in a form of a letter to the president. The Administrator Pruitt shared that letter with me. I think the particular excerpt from that letter, the passage from that letter that is important here is Pruitt saying I'm stepping down as administrator of EPA effective as of July 6. It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in this role, first, because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also because of the transformative work that is occurring. However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented, has taken a sizeable toll on all of us. It was well publicized all of the controversy and scandals that Pruitt has been facing, but there was another one that was facing him which may have been the most important at all. Congressman Ted Lou, as well as Don Baier had sent a letter to the inspector general at the EPA claiming that certain appointments in Scott Pruitt's calendar had been scrubbed from the official record because the meetings were with people that would have, quote, looked bad, in the federal record, and not keeping proper federal records can be considered to be a crime. So that was facing him, as well. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fierce critic of Administrator Pruitt, said Scott Pruitt was the worst administrator in the history of the agency. Congressman Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, simply said it's about time in terms of Scott Pruitt's departure. Again, Dana, he held on where so many other people in an administrative capacity would not have been able to, simply because the president thought he was doing a good job. The president during the campaign railed against what he called onerous and duplicative federal regulation that were really handcuffing, he believe, industry from being able to create the sort of economy that President Trump thought was possible, and Pruitt was right there on the front lines of it cutting those regulations, certainly, earned him a lot of enemies in government, at the EPA. In a breakfast that I had with Pruitt a couple of weeks ago, he thought that he was being targeted by people who wanted to see him gone, and today, he is gone. Dana."

We're also learning the President Trump has narrowed down his short list to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. A source telling Fox News, the president and his vetting team are focusing on three possible candidates who are among six he's interviewed.

Kimberly, let me go to you first because the president I think is figuring out -- OK, I've interviewed these six people. He -- maybe, he has narrowed it down to three, as a source had told Fox News.

Obviously, you know, incredible candidates, all of them could and should be confirmed. But I think the concern is just really down to the numbers. They're all qualified. Who, in fact, will be able to, you know, get the confirmation and who might oppose it, you know, in terms of the concern about -- there's, you know, the two females that might not support, perhaps, like the female justices, or perhaps one of the other ones could be complicated because of Roe v. Wade. So, it may come just down to the vote, and who might be able of those six qualified people to be able to go forward."

And Kavanaugh has got a great pedigree. He clerked for Kennedy. An influential guy who reaches across the aisle, not in a way, you know, as a swing justice, but someone who uses the force of his personality to persuade other justices. He's a Yale guy, a Bush appointee, 53 years old. He has really strong judicial record on guns, on religious liberty, and on free markets. And he has a long record to look through. He's a constitutionalist and people like that. Right now, he has the inside track, considered the front runner. The Wall Street Journal editorial page endorsed him as top conservatives did, as well. The one concern about him is he did vote kind of the way Justice Roberts did rule on the Obamacare case. He called it a tax which a lot of conservatives didn't like. But he looks like a shoe-in. But a strong late surge by Amy Barrett, social conservatives, really like her, as well as, you know, constitutional conservatives. She's only 46. And she's got a lengthy."

He's really into Tyrus's arms. These are dogs that are much-needed. And the producer of \"The Daily Briefing,\" Jen Williams, she's here, over there taking pictures. This is a five-month-old puppy that she is raising. She will take care of him for 18 months and make sure he hits all of his benchmarks, all the training. And then after that he goes to more specific training, where he will learn how to open doors, turn on and off lights, and learn how to take care of someone. Jen has had him since he was eight weeks old. And if you go to FOXNews.com/TheDailySpike, you'll learn more about Canine Companions for Independence. That's CCI.org. And then you can apply for a dog or, even better, you can apply to figure out a way to help this organization. A lot of people need dogs. And we love Spike. And this is his first time on \"The Five.\" But I think he just wants Tyrus. OK, Jesse, you go next."

Making TV history, \"Pose\" features the largest cast of transgendered actors in a series regular roles, as well as the largest recurring LGBTQ actors ever in a scripted series. Trust me, you will love this show. You will laugh, you will cry, you will fall in love with it. Check it out. Big shout out to 21st Century FOX and FX Productions for taking a risk on this.
