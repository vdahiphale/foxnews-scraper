Not only was he cleared in all six of them, he was given access to America's nuclear codes. So, we knew all we were going to know about an event that supposedly took place 37 years ago, and that's why the FBI said it had zero interest in getting involved again. And yet, Democrats demanded a new investigation anyway, as you just saw. And then protesters screamed at poor Jeff Flake in an elevator in the Senate until he agreed with the Democrats. So, we got the investigation. It was supposed to take a week. Everyone agreed on that but it wrapped up in six days. Why? Because there was nothing to find.

Going forward, look for the Left to delegitimize any decisions written by Brett Kavanaugh from the court or even any decisions in which he is the majority.

Lawmakers in that state, the largest state in the Union have already made it a crime for citizens in California to insist -- assist in the enforcement of any federal immigration law. California is in effect in open revolt against the laws of the United States. Suppose the Supreme Court were to try to crack down on that, it's not impossible to imagine California simply refusing to comply because Brett Kavanaugh sits on the court. Its edicts are illegitimate. That could happen.

I believe with the Republican women it's gone up, I think, like 14 points. It's been a remarkable surge amongst people who thought everything was going to be OK, but this has been a reminder about what the Left really is about and what the Democrats have become. And frankly, look, when it comes to women who've been sexually assaulted, women either have had an experience or know someone who has, we all understand that. And this kind of patronizing, like from Eve Ensler, telling women about what they should do, we know what our lives have been. We know what we require. And we require a justice system that is fair. And we require due process. We do want to be taken seriously but the only way we will be taken seriously is if the system can be trusted.

President Obama just endorsed her, which is kind of amazing. President Obama is endorsing somebody who views his presidency as a disappointment, an embarrassment, something that needs to be replaced by something far more extreme. Ocasio-Cortez wants Obamacare replaced by Universal Healthcare, Medicare- for-all. She wants to abolish ICE rather than just handcuff it as Obama did. Obama sucked up hard to Wall Street and they repaid him with lots of cash. Ocasio-Cortez wants full-blown socialism. Obama's endorsement shows just how much the party has changed since he left office. Ocasio-Cortez didn't pause to savor the irony though. She said in a recent speech, she looks forward to being inaugurated in 2018. Members of Congress, of course, are not inaugurated. They're sworn in but she may have her eyes on something bigger. We'll see. So we did a segment tonight on the ACLU and spoke with their political director. I'm embarrassed to say I lost my temper in the middle of it. Why did I do that? Because I spent a year thinking about the ACLU and their role in defending free speech, a liberal organization that defended the least popular members of our society for almost a 100 years. They no longer do. They're part of the mob trying to take your free speech away. You're now the most unpopular segment of our society, and the ACLU thinks you should shut up. That's a huge change. And it's a metaphor for how the Left has changed and now represents the things it once hated. I've explained it in much greater detail in the book and you can read it. By the way, you may have noticed, we unearthed some videos as a -- of a man who same -- claims to be a Washington Post reporter. He actually works at a website sort of owned by the Post. Erik Wemple or Wemple (ph) -- there's some debate over his name -- if you're interested in seeing more, they're on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Facebook page. We'll hope you'll check them out.

Of course, we'll be watching that speech and we'll go right to it if news happens and it may. A lot has changed in the past three weeks as you may have noticed. We've watched slack-jawed as professional lawmakers attacked the rule of law. We've heard self-described anti-racism activists embrace full-throated racism on television. We've seen people who call themselves advocates for women destroy the life of an actual woman for political gain. The country is all but inverted during the debate over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. It is bewildering. In case you're having trouble keeping track of it all, a reminder that it was only a week ago that Democrats argued that a second Senate hearing into Brett Kavanaugh's High School record, the one we saw, was not enough to find the truth. We needed a supplementary FBI investigation and we needed it immediately."

Everyone involved had already given sworn statements under the penalty of perjury about what they knew about this story. The two people at the very center of it had already testified before the Congress on television. Brett Kavanaugh's life had been the subject of six previous FBI probes. Not only was he cleared in all six of them, he was given access to America's nuclear codes. So, we knew all we were going to know about an event that supposedly took place 37 years ago, and that's why the FBI said it had zero interest in getting involved again. And yet, Democrats demanded a new investigation anyway, as you just saw. And then protesters screamed at poor Jeff Flake in an elevator in the Senate until he agreed with the Democrats. So, we got the investigation. It was supposed to take a week. Everyone agreed on that but it wrapped up in six days. Why? Because there was nothing to find. And almost four decades after the fact there were very few people left to interview. Not surprisingly, in the end, the FBI did not corroborate Christine Ford's story. You know what that means don't you? The FBI must be involved in a cover-up. Yes, a diabolical secret plot orchestrated with their very close allies in the Trump Administration. That's what they're telling us. The very people who just days ago were telling us that the FBI is an ethically unimpeachable organization, the ultimate tiebreaker. Now, the FBI is part of the Deep State."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Why don't we just dunk him in water and see if he floats? It was good enough in medieval France. You know the truth. Only one thing will truly be good enough, an investigation of some kind or maybe a water dunking of some kind that lasts at least through January 3rd 2019, that's when the new Congress will be sworn in. Of course, that's the real goal. It always has been. Fortunately, it looks like this ploy is failing. Win or lose, Kavanaugh's nomination will be voted on, it looks like, within a few days. It seems likely he'll be confirmed but who knows, and we won't know until the moment the last vote is cast. Still it's worth thinking about what the world looks like once this is all over, after Kavanaugh's confirmation vote. This is a new country now. What will it look like? Well the Left has accused President Trump of overturning norms and destroying institutions. But as always, that is pure projection. Whatever they're accusing you of is exactly what they're doing. And it's true in this case too. The Left just mounted a full assault on our justice system. They thought nothing of tossing out the presumption of innocence. You saw actual U.S. senators say things like the accused has an obligation to prove himself innocent. They said that out loud and then they tried to use the FBI as a weapon against their political opponents, and not for the first time. The Obama Administration did the same. Think this will stop? Think again. Thought leaders, to the extent that's not an oxymoron on the Left, already laying the groundwork to pack the courts, something that hasn't been tried since the 1930s. Adding more Democrats to change the balance, the least democratic, small D democratic option available. It's only fair, they'll tell you, to offset the theft of Merrick Garland's seat on the Supreme Court and, of course, the appointment of a teenage sex offender. Going forward, look for the Left to delegitimize any decisions written by Brett Kavanaugh from the court or even any decisions in which he is the majority. Some states may just decide to ignore the Supreme Court. Sound fair fetched -- far-fetched to you? Maybe. Maybe not. Look what's happening in California right now. Lawmakers in that state, the largest state in the Union have already made it a crime for citizens in California to insist -- assist in the enforcement of any federal immigration law. California is in effect in open revolt against the laws of the United States. Suppose the Supreme Court were to try to crack down on that, it's not impossible to imagine California simply refusing to comply because Brett Kavanaugh sits on the court. Its edicts are illegitimate. That could happen. And that, by the way, is what crisis actually looks like, so get ready for that. Before we get to our first guest, we do have a Fox News Alert for you. Brett Kavanaugh wrote an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal, literally, a few seconds ago. Here's a selection from it and we're quoting now. \"I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I've said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband, and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and, most of all, my daughters. Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career, hard-working, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good.\" There's a lot more to that op-ed. We just tweeted out a link to the full piece just appearing in the Wall Street Journal, so there's that. Meanwhile Brett -- Joe diGenova is, of course, a former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Danny Coulson is a former Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI and they both join us tonight. First to you Joe, do you think it's likely as Democrats are now suggesting that the FBI is in secret collusion with their very close allies in the Trump Administration to subvert the will of the Democratic Party? Based on what we have been watching for the past two years, do you think that's a likely scenario?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, well I -- I think what the Democrats are engaged in is something that we call the big lie. And what they've done is they have associated themselves with anarchy and they are now in full revolt against the Constitution of the United States, the Union, and the rule of law. What you are hearing are the cries of an injured child not unlike those of Ms. Ford when she testified before the committee as an injured adolescent. The Democratic Party is in full retreat from good government, the rule of law, and sanity. These people are crazed, seeking power, and there they are calling into question the integrity of the FBI who didn't want anything to do with this and were asked to do it by Senator Coons and Senator Flake. Good lord, they are appalling."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So Danny Coulson, if you're one of the many FBI agents and employees who doesn't want the agency to become politicized or used as a weapon by a political party or other, what do you make of all this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANNY COULSON, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FBI",
      "utterance": "Well I think that they don't like the result. That's very, very simple. I said when the investigation began that you'll get your investigation but you not -- may not like what they find out. And what they found out is not only was there not corroboration of Dr. Ford's story. The important thing is her story was rejected by her own witnesses. And I think that's very difficult for the Democratic Party to handle. The FBI doesn't really care how these things come out. That's why there was so much aversion to James Comey's record as the Director. They don't -- they want to be known as -- as independent. We want to be fact-finders. And they do, today. And I will tell you they did not parch (ph) this investigation. They did a thorough investigation. And just because you didn't (ph) like it doesn't mean it's not valid. And I think that's what we're dealing with here is if you don't like the results then, you know, attack the -- attack the investigative agency, and I don't think it's going to play out very well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

This is an example of what happens when a party decides to uproot itself from the rule of law, from decency and honesty and integrity. They have destroyed themselves. They are hurting innocent people, a man, his family. The confirmation process is in shambles as a result of the conduct of Senator Feinstein and Senator Booker and Senator Harris and the little man from Delaware, Senator Coons, who's blathering. Fake lawyering has become an embarrassment to the Senate. But that's where we are. So what do they do? They attack the FBI. The FBI is a great institution notwithstanding James Comey's leadership."

They're fired up in opposition to Kavanaugh. But even more important could be the reaction of many Republicans who are every bit as mad, in some cases, they're madder, and they're uniting behind the nominee. It's a complicated question.

Compared to early September, the number of Republicans who say they feel extremely interested in the elections is up by two points in Arizona, nine points in Indiana, eight points in Missouri and North Dakota, and up 11 points in Tennessee. Meanwhile a new round of Fox News battleground poll shows the fight for the Senate trending Republican with the Kavanaugh showdown on Capitol Hill stoking interest in the mid-terms from Republicans all across the board. All five states surveyed showed an uptick in GOP interest. Incumbent Senate Democrats votes on Kavanaugh could tip tight races, especially in Missouri and North Dakota, and voting against his nomination will hurt more than help the Democratic candidates in those states.

The media have been relentless in backing Ford and her claims with rapid response to outrage if anyone dared to challenge Ford's facts or insist on careful due process. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh has been vilified successfully as a rich, drunken, lying gang-rapist. One media outlet suggested he's actually a pedophile. All that is true. All that would seem to work.

Our producer Alex Pfeiffer and a camera crew went down to D.C. They braved all that to bring those pictures to you. That was a mob pressuring senators to unquestioningly believe the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Meanwhile, the author of The Vagina Monologues, which you haven't seen, probably shouldn't, lashing out at women of a certain skin color who support Brett Kavanaugh for some reason. In an open letter published by Time magazine, Eve Ensler suggests that White women who backed Kavanaugh are deliberately supporting violent abusive behavior. \"I don't think you want to apologize to your daughters 40 years from now. Stop the ascension of a man who is angry, aggressive, and vengeful, and could very well be a sexual assaulter. Time is short. Call your senators. Stop laughing and stop -- start fighting.\" Tammy Bruce is a radio show host, President of the Independent Women's Voice. She's been watching all of this very carefully. She joins us tonight.

They have no mind of their own. And maybe they're the walking dead, I don't know, but they certainly don't have personal agency. That was her message. And I contend with all of this. And I know you've been covering the issue about why has a race been interjected into this. I contend this that, in fact, now the Democrats have decided that they've got to figure out a way to divide even the households to make women think that the men in their lives are the enemy. And so, if whether it is your husband or your son or your brother or your dad that in fact men, White men in particular, because the White women's vote was the issue, are -- are people you cannot trust.

So, it explains both of those approaches, and I think that what we're also seeing, of course, with the polls now that the enthusiasm, of course, is soaring amongst the GOP. I believe with the Republican women it's gone up, I think, like 14 points. It's been a remarkable surge amongst people who thought everything was going to be OK, but this has been a reminder about what the Left really is about and what the Democrats have become. And frankly, look, when it comes to women who've been sexually assaulted, women either have had an experience or know someone who has, we all understand that. And this kind of patronizing, like from Eve Ensler, telling women about what they should do, we know what our lives have been. We know what we require. And we require a justice system that is fair. And we require due process. We do want to be taken seriously but the only way we will be taken seriously is if the system can be trusted. And how dare they lecture every other woman whether you be a liberal or not? And let me tell you also, it's -- it's you -- with the polls with the Liberals, Liberal women, just like during the presidential race, there is such anger and rage on the Left. It is not safe to be honest about what you think of this situation."

President Obama just endorsed her, which is kind of amazing. President Obama is endorsing somebody who views his presidency as a disappointment, an embarrassment, something that needs to be replaced by something far more extreme. Ocasio-Cortez wants Obamacare replaced by Universal Healthcare, Medicare- for-all. She wants to abolish ICE rather than just handcuff it as Obama did. Obama sucked up hard to Wall Street and they repaid him with lots of cash. Ocasio-Cortez wants full-blown socialism. Obama's endorsement shows just how much the party has changed since he left office. Ocasio-Cortez didn't pause to savor the irony though. She said in a recent speech, she looks forward to being inaugurated in 2018. Members of Congress, of course, are not inaugurated. They're sworn in but she may have her eyes on something bigger. We'll see. So we did a segment tonight on the ACLU and spoke with their political director. I'm embarrassed to say I lost my temper in the middle of it. Why did I do that? Because I spent a year thinking about the ACLU and their role in defending free speech, a liberal organization that defended the least popular members of our society for almost a 100 years. They no longer do. They're part of the mob trying to take your free speech away. You're now the most unpopular segment of our society, and the ACLU thinks you should shut up. That's a huge change. And it's a metaphor for how the Left has changed and now represents the things it once hated. I've explained it in much greater detail in the book and you can read it. By the way, you may have noticed, we unearthed some videos as a -- of a man who same -- claims to be a Washington Post reporter. He actually works at a website sort of owned by the Post. Erik Wemple or Wemple (ph) -- there's some debate over his name -- if you're interested in seeing more, they're on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Facebook page. We'll hope you'll check them out.
