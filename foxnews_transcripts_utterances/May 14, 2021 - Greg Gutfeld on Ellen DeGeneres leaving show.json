      "sentences": "Just another whopper from Mayor McCheese. I’m still grossed out by that. OK. It’s been a few months and Joe Biden has made more mistakes than I did in med school. It’s why I’m not a doctor. Why all of those people are dead. Gets a laugh. All those dead people. All right. Now we could point out all of Joe’s failures, but I have a wedding to go to in September. But what’s weird is how the media buries these stories like cat poo in a sandbox. Where does it all go? Don Lemon’s hamper, Rachel Maddow’s Jim locker, that computer shop where Hunter Biden took his laptop. There’s a lot of bad stuff going on. But like Kamala Harris, the Jimmy Hoffa of vice presidents, it’s nowhere to be found. Biden screws up in the media slips the story between the mattress and the box spring. Like those photos I have of Bill Hemmer. But imagine if any of this happened under President Trump. Highest rate of inflation in 13 years, like Dana Perino hawking her new book, that would be everywhere. Unemployment is now rising faster than it has in a decade and during a job surplus. Has that ever happened before? That’s like losing weight after eating 10 pounds of cookie dough. Relax, Stelter. It’s not possible. As always, it’s all about the incentives. Incentives are the most basic science on Earth. If you’re married, you know what I mean. If you want your wife to stay interested in the bedroom, you do what I do. You put the dishwasher in there. Sadly, the only incentives the Dems understand is if you give someone money, they’ll vote for you. But I was kind of hoping that was changing. Biden has now decided to resume partly building the wall. Yes, that big evil Satan wall. Remember when they stopped building it in January? Every live did a victory dance, including Elizabeth Warren. And I know because it rained over my house for three days. So what happened next, a massive influx of migrants. Thousands of kids showed up unaccompanied and on a school night no less. Incentives took center stage, like a Bunyan on Pelosi’s foot, it got big and ugly fast. But maybe I thought something came to Joe’s senses, probably polling numbers or smelling salts. Or maybe the images of children being abandoned in the mountains like James Franco’s Tinder dates who wouldn’t put out. I was hoping Biden woke up to the fact that not everything Trump did was evil, and that the advice he’s getting from the woke is idiotic. In fact, a lot of Trumps teams were pretty good. If you’re not a communist socialist or something called Debra Messing. Record low unemployment, especially among minorities, energy independence, North Korea no longer and apocalyptic headache, a plethora of peace deals. True Trump could hurt your feelings. Don’t we all know it? I’m still smarting over being snubbed for that Presidential Medal of Freedom. But all of Joe’s current problems are based on rejecting Trumpism which isn’t a way to run a country. It’s like hooking up with a total loser after you got dumped just to get back at the person who dumped you, but it only harms you. However, it’s great if you’re the loser that people keep hooking up with. That was the only way I got lucky in college. I wonder what our angry white male thinks.",

Trump would never call a looter a protester because that’s an incentive to loot. He never paid people not to work because that’s an incentive not to work. He’d never applaud identity politics, because that’s an incentive to divide. True, he’d make fun of your weight or your hair. But that’s the price you pay for common sense. Plus, you’ve got Frank Luntz to join a gym. I go back to this analogy. When you hire a lawyer, do you want everyone in the court to like him or do you want everyone to go Holy crap, not that guy? Trump was supposed to be America’s lawyer. And he was (BLEEP) but he was (BLEEP) and if there’s one thing we Americans love, it’s (BLEEP).",

But like Kamala Harris, the Jimmy Hoffa of vice presidents, it’s nowhere to be found. Biden screws up in the media slips the story between the mattress and the box spring. Like those photos I have of Bill Hemmer. But imagine if any of this happened under President Trump. Highest rate of inflation in 13 years, like Dana Perino hawking her new book, that would be everywhere. Unemployment is now rising faster than it has in a decade and during a job surplus. Has that ever happened before? That’s like losing weight after eating 10 pounds of cookie dough. Relax, Stelter. It’s not possible. As always, it’s all about the incentives. Incentives are the most basic science on Earth. If you’re married, you know what I mean. If you want your wife to stay interested in the bedroom, you do what I do. You put the dishwasher in there. Sadly, the only incentives the Dems understand is if you give someone money, they’ll vote for you. But I was kind of hoping that was changing. Biden has now decided to resume partly building the wall. Yes, that big evil Satan wall. Remember when they stopped building it in January? Every live did a victory dance, including Elizabeth Warren. And I know because it rained over my house for three days. So what happened next, a massive influx of migrants. Thousands of kids showed up unaccompanied and on a school night no less. Incentives took center stage, like a Bunyan on Pelosi’s foot, it got big and ugly fast. But maybe I thought something came to Joe’s senses, probably polling numbers or smelling salts. Or maybe the images of children being abandoned in the mountains like James Franco’s Tinder dates who wouldn’t put out. I was hoping Biden woke up to the fact that not everything Trump did was evil, and that the advice he’s getting from the woke is idiotic. In fact, a lot of Trumps teams were pretty good. If you’re not a communist socialist or something called Debra Messing. Record low unemployment, especially among minorities, energy independence, North Korea no longer and apocalyptic headache, a plethora of peace deals. True Trump could hurt your feelings. Don’t we all know it? I’m still smarting over being snubbed for that Presidential Medal of Freedom. But all of Joe’s current problems are based on rejecting Trumpism which isn’t a way to run a country. It’s like hooking up with a total loser after you got dumped just to get back at the person who dumped you, but it only harms you. However, it’s great if you’re the loser that people keep hooking up with. That was the only way I got lucky in college. I wonder what our angry white male thinks."

Trump would never call a looter a protester because that’s an incentive to loot. He never paid people not to work because that’s an incentive not to work. He’d never applaud identity politics, because that’s an incentive to divide. True, he’d make fun of your weight or your hair. But that’s the price you pay for common sense. Plus, you’ve got Frank Luntz to join a gym. I go back to this analogy. When you hire a lawyer, do you want everyone in the court to like him or do you want everyone to go Holy crap, not that guy? Trump was supposed to be America’s lawyer. And he was (BLEEP) but he was (BLEEP) and if there’s one thing we Americans love, it’s (BLEEP)."

Or they talk about using the arrow glove which is the plastic hand wrap, much like the ones we all wear when handling Kat’s hair extensions. Disgusting what’s on that. Buffets are hard to keep clean. The food sits for hours. There’s cross contamination and the sneeze guard are always disgusting. A bearable Sim City of snot. Still, I’ll miss the buffet. Where else can a man eat expired sushi and glazed pizza like it’s his last meal, only to wash it down with a Coke Zero. So, let’s pause for a moment to remember this culinary greatness. In lieu of flowers, just go to Arby’s."

And they’re like, literally every item, they would say, would you like this? You couldn’t touch anything because of COVID. We like this, we’d like that. And I felt shamed. Like I didn’t take as much as I want them. Like I’m like, Oh, that’s more than enough for shooter. I’m like, No, it’s not. Hey, I want more, but I can’t say like someone’s gonna be judging you. Yes, maybe it’s like good for my health. But it was sad. I wanted not to be judged."

Dana, do you remember those buffet stories that were happening a couple years ago in New York where somebody was going into the bodegas and doing bad things? Come on. Yes. That happened. Oh, we talked about this. We did not. Remember this. It happened. It happened in Midtown. There was a phantom pooper."

It’s like the same soup and they have the, the big silver things as turkey chili, chicken noodle. And then and then the specials are the same. And then you have the chicken wings. You got the lasagna? baked potato. There’s one place that makes all this Where is it? It’s not it’s not in the bodega is a big place somewhere in Brooklyn. That’s the size of like the world’s largest cemetery and they’re just scooping it out of the ground. It’s -- people!"

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. You know, what’s interesting about it, this, get to this analogy. You look forward to a buffet, like going and then you get there and within 10 minutes, you’re regretting what you’ve done to yourself. It’s like those Brazilian mean, meat restaurants where they keep coming over. So it’s, I think it’s just like sexual promiscuity. The idea itself, the endless supply of sexual novelty seems enterprising or fun guy, but then after 10 minutes, you’re like, I’m tired. I’m hungry. Let’s go to the buffet."
