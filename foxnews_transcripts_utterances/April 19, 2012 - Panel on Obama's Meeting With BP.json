As you said, people have been talking about them deferring the dividend for the second quarter. They're going to defer it for the whole year, which is quite something, which means actually depriving the pensioners in England of the three dividends that they would ordinarily have. So that is a significant concession. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Second, they had been reeling. BP had been holding fast on the issue of compensation for oil workers idled by the president's decision to have a six-month moratorium, which is in no way a direct result or inevitable result of the spill.  The administration had a choice on that and many people in the Gulf oppose it, but nonetheless the principle was conceded. The small amount, $100 million is not going to support a lot of workers for a long time and we'll extend unemployment to the workers as well. But that was a concession. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the chairman of BP was doing really well by issuing an apology until he stumbled over the small people, which perhaps will give him a pass because he is Swedish.

I hear comments sometimes that the large oil companies are greedy companies or don't care. But that is not the case at BP. We care about the small people. BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: Perhaps lost in translation there, the chairman of BP trying to address the perceptions about greed and indifference on this issue, but said the oil giant will hold off on the stockholder dividends for the entire year. This after this meeting at the White House that lasted a lot longer than people thought it was going to -- 45 minutes with the president and some four hours for BP executives at the White House all told. They agreed to set up this company-financed escrow fund of $20 billion over four years and $100 million for unemployed rig workers because of the drilling moratorium set up by this administration. Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, Erin Billings, deputy editor of Roll Call, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles?"

As you said, people have been talking about them deferring the dividend for the second quarter. They're going to defer it for the whole year, which is quite something, which means actually depriving the pensioners in England of the three dividends that they would ordinarily have. So that is a significant concession. Second, they had been reeling. BP had been holding fast on the issue of compensation for oil workers idled by the president's decision to have a six-month moratorium, which is in no way a direct result or inevitable result of the spill.  The administration had a choice on that and many people in the Gulf oppose it, but nonetheless the principle was conceded. The small amount, $100 million is not going to support a lot of workers for a long time and we'll extend unemployment to the workers as well. But that was a concession. And the chairman of BP was doing really well by issuing an apology until he stumbled over the small people, which perhaps will give him a pass because he is Swedish. I'm not sure."

Agreeing to suspend dividends was very significant. I think had they gone forward with them it would have been politically a disaster, from a public relations standpoint it would have been a disaster. I think it's interesting today when the president went off-script and he started to talk about the shrimpers and the people that would be affected by or are already being affected by this disaster. We saw the human element we didn't see it last night. He tried to inspire at the end, but I don't think he connected. Today I thought he did when he went off script. So all in all, it was a very good day for the president. And I think BP did what it had to do, and I think, you know, frankly they will be credited for it."

A lot of what was discussed today at the White House had been figured out in advance. One thing that was the snag was the $100 million fund, voluntary fund, payment to a foundation that will be used to compensate deepwater oil rig workers. It's very specific language. And BP made clear they don't want to accept responsibility or liability for the workers and their compensation because of what they're agreeing to pay. So they say look, this is voluntary. We're doing it because we're a good corporate citizen, not because we're at fault for what the administration decided on the moratorium. And those issues had not been ironed out in advance of the meeting, and I think the president basically sprang this on BP and they had to figure out how do we respond to this? There were initial side meetings and this is what they agreed to. But I think we're likely to hear in the next couple of days lots of back-and-forthing about that specific issue."

So it isn't only a boot on the neck of the British pensioner, as one of the British politicians it, it's also going to be damaging here. However, BP is acting in what it sees as its own interest. It sees itself, it's a rich company with reserves of over 18 billion barrels. At the current prices it's over $1 trillion. So it's got money if it can get to it in the future. It has to get through the cash flow crisis now. So its calculation is it has to win back public approval or it can't continue. It will pay a price, hopefully, it thinks, a finite one which it can shoulder."

Of course, they criticize the president when they don't get enough direction, but that's probably for another panel. There was some confusion. We saw Democratic leaders embracing what the president said. Nancy Pelosi obviously has made climate change her legacy project and she is excited about this. But the House bill isn't going anywhere. It is not going to pass the Senate. There is not appetite for cap-and-trade. Republicans certainly don't like it and a lot of Democrats don't like it. The question is where do we go from here. And in my mind comprehensive climate change is off the table in 2010. It's possible we'll do something smaller. Senate Democrats will huddle tomorrow to see what approach they will pursue, and they'll probably target something with bipartisan support, maybe nuclear or clean energy items.

How big they make it or significant the changes, it won't be Waxman-Markey, but it could be big and they think it could be damaging after the November elections. That's problematic. It's one thing that I think has the Republican leadership wanting to make sure that every Republican is on board in blocking this and not allowing for any kind of a compromise, even on the small ball issues."
