      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\" tonight. If you are over the mass hysteria, if you're over politicizing and weaponizing the coronavirus, you are not alone. That's why tonight, we are focused on two major stories. First, we're going to call out anyone and everyone who's using this virus as a political weapon against the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's sick, it's sad, but predictable. I'm sure in the end, the mob and the media -- well, they will be advancing their new conspiracy theory and their newest hoax. Probably, they will come up with, hypothetically, I'm just guessing, wouldn't shock me, President Trump, Putin, mad scientists of Russia and Ukraine are manufacturing the coronavirus on purpose so they can hurt innocent children and kill grandma and grandpa, before they throw them over a cliff, before they feed them dog food. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look, it is time, in all seriousness, for simple, fundamental truths to protect our fellow Americans. That means Democrats. That means Republicans, liberals, conservatives and libertarians and everybody in between. Viruses do not have a political identity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, tonight, we will separate cold hard truth from what is the mob's latest, manufactured, irresponsible, over-the-top rhetoric. Our medical A- team and Dr. Oz tonight will explain. Plus, coming up, we will show you how Democrats and the media now want you to ignore real concerns about quid pro quo Joe and his apparent and his increasing inability to complete thoughts and deliver a cogent speech. It is now serious campaign issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, it was serious to Democrats when Ronald Reagan was running for re-election. We have the evidence. But we start with the media mob's ongoing effort to now use a virus, an infectious disease, as a political weapon all to bludgeon President Trump yet again. I've said many times, if he cured cancer, they would likely want to impeach him for curing cancer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the coronavirus is a serious disease. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, should you and your family be concerned? Of course. You should be concerned about the flu. You should be concerned about a cold. You should be concerned about any health risk. Should you be informed? Absolutely. Do we all need to take necessary precautionary steps? Yes, all of us. But the coverage we are seeing from the media and the mob is beyond despicable and political. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For example, Sunday, you got Chucky Todd boasting the coronavirus, that could actually help President Trump like the Iran hostage situation hurt Jimmy Carter. \"The Washington Post\" editorial calling it, President Trump's Chernobyl. And over there at state-run, conspiracy TV, MSDNC, poor liberal Morning Joe saying Trump's stupidity will cause Americans to die. And meanwhile, Joyless Reid -- well, actually, telling her viewers that the children of Trump supporters were more likely to spread the coronavirus to other kids. Just made that up, I guess. That's what they do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The lies, the conspiracy theories, the psychotic anti-Trump rage -- well, it's been nonstop. Sadly, this is all we've gotten for three-plus years. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": What is government really for? The government is there to protect you from terrorism, for a health thing -- just exactly this thing. This is exactly the function of government and our government is screwing up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Chaos ensues. Recently, a group of shoppers caught on tape -- what were they doing? They will brawling. What were they brawling over? The last pack of toilet paper. Now, we've also witnessed a recent market selloff, although today's drop likely had a lot more to do with an oil supply battle between the Russians and Saudis than anything corona-related but markets are skittish.

So there is something about being young that is protective. We want people to be reassured by that. We want people to know that we are really focusing in on those groups that are at highest risk for complications. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Now, just to recap, according to the surgeon general of the United States, people over 60, they are most at risk for corona-related complications or hospitalization. Now, the average age of mortality is 80. Young people, unlike H1N1, that tended to impact younger kids more than older people. But now, in this case, older people are much more likely to die from this -- or from regular flu actually than from coronavirus, believe it or not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, remember, despite early reports the likely mortality rate could be as low as 1 percent. Dr. Fauci was out there in the New England Journal in the first few hundred cases in China, he wrote, quote: There were no cases in children younger than the age of 15. Either children are less likely to become infected or their symptoms were so mild that their infection escaped detection. By the way, as an older person, I'd rather it be on me. Let's be honest. Kids have their whole lives ahead of them. And it's important to remember this administration took unprecedented steps on the coronavirus, seriously and a lot of criticism to boot. No president ever, except Donald Trump, ever acted faster, ever acted sooner, or have done more to stop the spread of an infectious disease. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Keep in mind, the virus was not officially detected and named until January 7th. WHO recognized it on December 30th of last year. That's pretty quick. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then on January 31st, the president declared a public health emergency and he is the one that ordered the travel ban and quarantine, which we hadn't done in decades and, by the way, he did it against the advice of many, by the way, that were offering him advise out of an abundance of caution. That's the travel ban to China. That's when that began. Three weeks later, quid pro quo Joe Biden and others called the president for doing in this ban was xenophobia, fake news CNN suggesting the president is stigmatizing people from other countries. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And for the better part of February, now, what were the Democrats doing? Oh, that's right. They hardly addressed the virus at all. They were too busy and too focused on impeaching the president over nothing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, they seem more interested in scoring what is nothing but cheap political points than actually working with the administration to protect our American family. We ought to protect every American life here. Today, the president asked for lawmakers to help with the payroll tax cut to ease corona-related economic concerns. That is really going to help and be impactful to small business, hourly wage earners around the country. Well, hopefully, Democrats will come to the table and do what's right for America. Will they alleviate the economic fallout of corona or will they do nothing to continue to use it as a political weapon, politicizing a disease? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, coronavirus is a serious matter. It's not the end of days. Sadly, pandemics, like this, happen more often than any of us would like. H1N1 worldwide killed over about half a million people according to estimates. The U.S. has the best doctors. By the way, H1N1 we lost nearly 14,000 Americans. We have the best doctors. The best researchers, the best scientists anywhere in the world and the Trump administration will continue to aggressively stop the spread of this infectious disease. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We also forget people that get flu every year. Some years, tens of thousands of people died from the flu. Every year, people die from the flu. Now, should we be smart, wise, learn things, how to be neat, clean, not -- yes. Of course. Let's protect our families. But let's do it in a thoughtful way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here with more what you need to know about coronavirus, he is the host of \"Dr. Oz's Show\", the real Dr. Oz, the real Oz. He's the wizard of Oz and he is not behind the curtain, I'm kidding. How are you, sir? Great to see you again. DR. MEHMET OZ, MD, \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\" HOST: I'm doing very well.

Now, with that said, tell me if I am wrong on any fact here -- is it true that this virus if you don't have underlying health issues and you don't have a compromised immune system, and you're not above 60, the odds of you dying are dramatically like negligible?

It's hard to tell sometimes because people die from related causes from the flu. And so, if you are equating to that and young age groups, certainly, it's comparable and if you haven't gotten the flu shot then you shouldn't be that worried about this either. But you pointed out something earlier I want to highlight. You are a student of human motivation, what is it that is scaring people? I think deep in our psyche, there is this fear about viruses and things we don't see because human species has been attacked by viruses and bacteria for all of known history. So people inclined to worry about it and then if you feed that concern -- that potential hysteria like data we had from the Chinese CDC with 3.5 mortality rate, which is still what the World Health Organization is reporting concerning the mortality figure, then, of course, you're going to get worried. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } To your point, once you're over the age 60 and a surgeon general is coming on my show tomorrow for a broader discussion.

And, of course, Reagan ultimately received another term as destroying Mondale in debate number two when he promised not to use my opponent's youth and inexperience against him in this campaign.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity\" tonight. If you are over the mass hysteria, if you're over politicizing and weaponizing the coronavirus, you are not alone. That's why tonight, we are focused on two major stories. First, we're going to call out anyone and everyone who's using this virus as a political weapon against the president. It's sick, it's sad, but predictable. I'm sure in the end, the mob and the media -- well, they will be advancing their new conspiracy theory and their newest hoax. Probably, they will come up with, hypothetically, I'm just guessing, wouldn't shock me, President Trump, Putin, mad scientists of Russia and Ukraine are manufacturing the coronavirus on purpose so they can hurt innocent children and kill grandma and grandpa, before they throw them over a cliff, before they feed them dog food. Look, it is time, in all seriousness, for simple, fundamental truths to protect our fellow Americans. That means Democrats. That means Republicans, liberals, conservatives and libertarians and everybody in between. Viruses do not have a political identity. So, tonight, we will separate cold hard truth from what is the mob's latest, manufactured, irresponsible, over-the-top rhetoric. Our medical A- team and Dr. Oz tonight will explain. Plus, coming up, we will show you how Democrats and the media now want you to ignore real concerns about quid pro quo Joe and his apparent and his increasing inability to complete thoughts and deliver a cogent speech. It is now serious campaign issue. By the way, it was serious to Democrats when Ronald Reagan was running for re-election. We have the evidence. But we start with the media mob's ongoing effort to now use a virus, an infectious disease, as a political weapon all to bludgeon President Trump yet again. I've said many times, if he cured cancer, they would likely want to impeach him for curing cancer. Now, the coronavirus is a serious disease. Now, should you and your family be concerned? Of course. You should be concerned about the flu. You should be concerned about a cold. You should be concerned about any health risk. Should you be informed? Absolutely. Do we all need to take necessary precautionary steps? Yes, all of us. But the coverage we are seeing from the media and the mob is beyond despicable and political. For example, Sunday, you got Chucky Todd boasting the coronavirus, that could actually help President Trump like the Iran hostage situation hurt Jimmy Carter. \"The Washington Post\" editorial calling it, President Trump's Chernobyl. And over there at state-run, conspiracy TV, MSDNC, poor liberal Morning Joe saying Trump's stupidity will cause Americans to die. And meanwhile, Joyless Reid -- well, actually, telling her viewers that the children of Trump supporters were more likely to spread the coronavirus to other kids. Just made that up, I guess. That's what they do. The lies, the conspiracy theories, the psychotic anti-Trump rage -- well, it's been nonstop. Sadly, this is all we've gotten for three-plus years. Take a look. JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": What is government really for? The government is there to protect you from terrorism, for a health thing -- just exactly this thing. This is exactly the function of government and our government is screwing up."

Last week's \"New York Times\" editorial spelled it out pretty clearly. They named the coronavirus, the Trump virus, and they wrote, if you're feeling awful, you know who to blame. It's getting close to that lab conspiracy theory I was kind of joking about. That's how sick it is. Now, this kind of coverage has serious ramifications why people panic. Chaos ensues. Recently, a group of shoppers caught on tape -- what were they doing? They will brawling. What were they brawling over? The last pack of toilet paper. Now, we've also witnessed a recent market selloff, although today's drop likely had a lot more to do with an oil supply battle between the Russians and Saudis than anything corona-related but markets are skittish. Let's cut through all the hysteria and all the B.S. Let's give you some simple truth and facts. Here is the surgeon general of the United States of America. You don't believe Dr. Hannity? Let's listen to him. I'm not a doctor."

      "utterance": "People over the age of 60, they are much more likely to develop complications from the coronavirus and to be hospitalized from the coronavirus. The average age of death is age 80. Now, what we also want communities to know is that if you are a child or young adult, you are much more -- you are more likely to die from the flu if you get it than you are to die from coronavirus. So there is something about being young that is protective. We want people to be reassured by that. We want people to know that we are really focusing in on those groups that are at highest risk for complications."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, just to recap, according to the surgeon general of the United States, people over 60, they are most at risk for corona-related complications or hospitalization. Now, the average age of mortality is 80. Young people, unlike H1N1, that tended to impact younger kids more than older people. But now, in this case, older people are much more likely to die from this -- or from regular flu actually than from coronavirus, believe it or not. And, remember, despite early reports the likely mortality rate could be as low as 1 percent. Dr. Fauci was out there in the New England Journal in the first few hundred cases in China, he wrote, quote: There were no cases in children younger than the age of 15. Either children are less likely to become infected or their symptoms were so mild that their infection escaped detection. By the way, as an older person, I'd rather it be on me. Let's be honest. Kids have their whole lives ahead of them. And it's important to remember this administration took unprecedented steps on the coronavirus, seriously and a lot of criticism to boot. No president ever, except Donald Trump, ever acted faster, ever acted sooner, or have done more to stop the spread of an infectious disease. Keep in mind, the virus was not officially detected and named until January 7th. WHO recognized it on December 30th of last year. That's pretty quick. And then on January 31st, the president declared a public health emergency and he is the one that ordered the travel ban and quarantine, which we hadn't done in decades and, by the way, he did it against the advice of many, by the way, that were offering him advise out of an abundance of caution. That's the travel ban to China. That's when that began. Three weeks later, quid pro quo Joe Biden and others called the president for doing in this ban was xenophobia, fake news CNN suggesting the president is stigmatizing people from other countries. And for the better part of February, now, what were the Democrats doing? Oh, that's right. They hardly addressed the virus at all. They were too busy and too focused on impeaching the president over nothing. Now, they seem more interested in scoring what is nothing but cheap political points than actually working with the administration to protect our American family. We ought to protect every American life here. Today, the president asked for lawmakers to help with the payroll tax cut to ease corona-related economic concerns. That is really going to help and be impactful to small business, hourly wage earners around the country. Well, hopefully, Democrats will come to the table and do what's right for America. Will they alleviate the economic fallout of corona or will they do nothing to continue to use it as a political weapon, politicizing a disease? Again, coronavirus is a serious matter. It's not the end of days. Sadly, pandemics, like this, happen more often than any of us would like. H1N1 worldwide killed over about half a million people according to estimates. The U.S. has the best doctors. By the way, H1N1 we lost nearly 14,000 Americans. We have the best doctors. The best researchers, the best scientists anywhere in the world and the Trump administration will continue to aggressively stop the spread of this infectious disease. We also forget people that get flu every year. Some years, tens of thousands of people died from the flu. Every year, people die from the flu. Now, should we be smart, wise, learn things, how to be neat, clean, not -- yes. Of course. Let's protect our families. But let's do it in a thoughtful way. Here with more what you need to know about coronavirus, he is the host of \"Dr. Oz's Show\", the real Dr. Oz, the real Oz. He's the wizard of Oz and he is not behind the curtain, I'm kidding. How are you, sir? Great to see you again. DR. MEHMET OZ, MD, \"THE DR. OZ SHOW\" HOST: I'm doing very well. Thanks for having me on."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Look, you know and I know that we lose people to the flu every year. Some years, we lose a lot of people. H1N1 impacted young kids. That was scary. We didn't declare a national emergency there for six weeks. The president acted in record time. Travel ban in three weeks. And then, of course, he had the quarantines. Now, with that said, tell me if I am wrong on any fact here -- is it true that this virus if you don't have underlying health issues and you don't have a compromised immune system, and you're not above 60, the odds of you dying are dramatically like negligible? Is that -- is that a true statement?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the risk of dying is unclear just because we haven't been able to study it in this country. What we do know is that in China, it was a problem. But we've also learned, I just got this data before walking at here to do your show, from the Korean CDC that the mortality numbers in young otherwise healthy people is very similar to what the traditional every year seasonal flu virus is. So we have lost already 20,000, 30,000 people. It's hard to tell sometimes because people die from related causes from the flu. And so, if you are equating to that and young age groups, certainly, it's comparable and if you haven't gotten the flu shot then you shouldn't be that worried about this either. But you pointed out something earlier I want to highlight. You are a student of human motivation, what is it that is scaring people? I think deep in our psyche, there is this fear about viruses and things we don't see because human species has been attacked by viruses and bacteria for all of known history. So people inclined to worry about it and then if you feed that concern -- that potential hysteria like data we had from the Chinese CDC with 3.5 mortality rate, which is still what the World Health Organization is reporting concerning the mortality figure, then, of course, you're going to get worried. To your point, once you're over the age 60 and a surgeon general is coming on my show tomorrow for a broader discussion. But once you get over the age of 60, the numbers do increase a bit. You still pretty well off if you don't have chronic illness like cardiovascular disease --"

I would rather not split hairs here. But I want to make sure Americans are safe. The vast overwhelming majority of people even if they were to contract this virus will end up being fine. We've got to be really concerned about the elderly. We've got to really be concerned apparently people with high blood pressure that are elderly and people with compromised immune systems. And then short of that, your advice would be, I'm sure, take all the precautions, use the Purell."

We're good at that. We need clear direction to what we can do for ourselves. We are not sitting around trying to figure out what's next. And the one sheet works through the things you pointed out. I put some ideas around potential foods you might want to eat, some ideas around hygiene, basic sort of cutting through a lot of the ideas. The best concepts that I've been told by experts who've come on the show and share them with me, to make it upper easy for folks to take charge of their health. In the meantime, I agree with you. We've got the best docs around. We're mobilizing folks. Seema Verma I spoke with today, the head of CMS, the government is moving aggressively to provide more of their testing kits, for more ventilators, more ICU beds. But if you get this virus and it's a virus that is so contagious, that there's good chance most people will either get the vaccine or get the virus. It's not going to kill you but you're going to get touched by it. We want to be smart about trying to reduce our chance of contaminating others. If we do it together, we'll be fine."

Now, tonight, which is 239 days until you have a chance once again to shock the world. You're the ultimate jury. It is important that we vet the Democratic Party's frontrunner. Now, we will know a lot more tomorrow night. Our coverage begins usual time 9:00 Eastern, six big primaries right here on this show. Big race tomorrow to watch in Michigan where it looks like quid pro quo has racked up a lead there. He's racking up endorsements as well, picking up steam in the polls. But there are serious glaring questions that, yes, Democrats and the media look at when Ronald Reagan was running for president that need to be addressed here. First and foremost, does quid pro quo Joe have the stamina, the strength and the focus and alertness to be president? It is now a legitimate concern. The president of the United States must be able to endure the single hardest most grueling job on earth 24 hours a day, four years. Presidents, yes, they play golf. They go fishing. They do what they do. But they rarely get a day off. Over the weekend, Biden could not even, well, make it through a seven- minute speech.

But because Biden is the Democratic Party frontrunner, they are trying to sweep all of this under the rug. Some are even claiming that you're not allowed to even question Biden's fitness for office the way they did Reagan, which brings to us a quick Hannity history lesson tonight. Biden is not the only presidential candidate to face questions about his mental acuity. 1984, well, many in the mob and the media then openly questioning Ronald Reagan's mental fitness for office. Judy Woodruff reporting that Reagan, quote, seemed less alert and less in control of the subject matter. \"Houston Chronicle\" writing that a press conference was a critical look at Ronald Reagan's mental acuity. \"Wall Street Journal\" wondering if the president was showing his age. And, of course, Reagan ultimately received another term as destroying Mondale in debate number two when he promised not to use my opponent's youth and inexperience against him in this campaign. As can you see, critical questions about a presidential candidate's ability to serve are not out of bounds. Now, sort of like know these truths to be self-evident all men and women are created -- by the thing, you know, the thing. The thing.

Just two weeks ago on \"FOX News Sunday\", he had a lengthy interview with Chris Wallace and at the end of the interview called him Chuck and then said that he doesn't understand how people do early mornings. So, there are serious questions about his ability to keep up on the campaign trail. I think President Trump is probably pretty happy about this looking like it's going to be his eventual opponent because President Trump has been campaigning for over a year now. He loves doing it. He has a lot of energy. And he is efficient when it comes to getting -- to running the White House at the same time as being able to go out and campaign for re- election."

He would be even worse as president of this country. He is supporting taxpayer funded abortion, free healthcare for illegals, the Green New Deal, which would be disastrous for the American economy and American jobs. He is not a moderate that they're claiming to be. His policy positions are liberal and he would be a terrible president for so many reasons just like Bernie Sanders would be terrible.

He wants to repeal the Trump tax cuts which for good for the vast majority of Americans, especially in the middle class in this country. He's put Beto O'Rourke in charge or Beto O'Rourke in charge of gun control policy, which that means gun confiscation, which is completely unconstitutional. And if everybody believes in the Democratic Party that somehow Joe Biden is going to swing the party back to the middle from the left, they're completely against what the reality of the situation is in that party. Joe Biden is going to get eaten alive by the left wing of the party. The AOCs, Ilhan Omars, Nancy Pelosi couldn't even handle keeping them together in the house which led them down this road of impeachment of president Trump. Not to mention Joe Biden who can't even stand up to these ideas and put forward his own platform when it comes to being out on the campaign trail in a real moderate way. His policies are very far left. And, yet, we're stuck with this talking point that he is somehow the normal one who everybody should be voting for."

I say good. Unless you can stop the weapons weaponization of tools of intelligence and use it against the American people, it has to stop. You can't allow this to happen. Come up with a better plan. Also, the 21 words that our friend John Solomon talks about changed the world with FISA court. Christopher Steele refuses to cooperate with the Durham probe. I say, extradite him.

GOP lawmakers, they are making it clear, unless major, major reforms are met to prevent future surveillance abuse of these spying tools will not be renewed, especially as the deep state remains defiant. There's Christopher Steele, there's a guy I want extradited. Forget Julian Assange he is part of a media group I don't think you are going to win that case, in my own opinion. It's called the Pentagon papers, freedom of the press. Anyway, it was that guy's dirty Russian dossier that was used as the bulk of the information in the FISA application that illegally spied on and took away the civil liberties and constitutional rights of Carter Page to spy on a candidate he hated, to spy on a transition team he hated and a president he hated. Now, he recently told an audience at oxford that he will not cooperate with the Durham probe. Fine, let's extradite him. Assange can stay. The good news is we are inching closer and closer to truth and justice because the as Solomon points out, scathing rebuke of FBI agents involved in the Page warrant by a federal judge just last week -- look at this -- 21 words uttered by FISA court that change the Russia collusion case forever, effectively barring those agents from appearing in front of a court. Here with reaction, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes, FOX News contributor, Sara Carter, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. All right. I want to get to the bottom of this. These 21 words are dead on accurate, Devin Nunes. This makes all the difference in the world. Finally, finally, the FISA court gets to be heard from.

But like you said in the monologue, the Congress really has to open up all of FISA. It has to be looked at. Tonight, just got out about an hour and a half meeting with Attorney General Barr. He's got some great ideas. We still are suspect that the Democrats who control the House are actually going to allow us to get the reforms we need because, look, at the end of the day, we need FISA to protect this country, but not if it comes at the sake of our liberties that we would have to give up. And that's really what we're -- what we're dealing with right now."

Let me interpret it and put it in Hannity speak, because we know they were warned numerous times -- premeditated on the FISA court to take away one American's constitutional rights and spy on a president. It sounds like the FISA court either watches this show or they read the inspector general report that vindicated all four of us."

Americans have lost faith in the FISA court because they have lost faith in the FBI and the Department of Justice to tell the truth, to present honest evidence. And instead, in this particular case, they presented 51 lies, deceptions, omissions, the concealing of evidence and, as you point out fraud. And the reforms I've seen so far suggested by the independent monitor and endorsed by the FISA court isn't nothing but pretend reforms. These are things that the Department of Justice and the FBI is supposed to do under the law. So, in my judgment, the only solution is to abolish FISA or adopt what Senator Rand Paul is advocating and that is no more FISA spying on Americans. In other words, put \"foreign\" back into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act."

And as far as FISA reform, I agree completely with Gregg Jarrett on this. The changes have to come through Title 1 and that's electronic surveillance of American citizens on U.S. soil. And we can't allow what happened to Carter Page to happen to anybody else because that's a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It's completely unacceptable. It's wrong. And unless they can make severe changes, like he said, maybe what Rand Paul says is true. Take it back to foreign, let's deal with that, and abolish the system the way we know it and maybe rebuild it differently. We shouldn't trust that they're going to do their job."

It drew a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts who called the comments dangerous. Liberal Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe said the comments were inexcusable, and liberal CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin called them a physical threat. Now, Missouri GOP Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a resolution signed by a dozen conservative lawmakers for Schumer to be censured, meaning consequences very much still on the table for Schumer -- Sean."
