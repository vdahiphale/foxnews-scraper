And what's so interesting about this is the police -- he called the cops. He needed help. Thirty years ago the cops would have brought him to a psychiatric emergency room. He probably would have gotten antipsychotics and he probably would have been hospitalized for a couple of weeks.

The cops left. He was left on his own. He was a man who shouldn't have been on his own. He should have the state looking after him, and he ended up killing people. In a way that's -- look, you want to respect the civil liberties of everybody, but there is a point in which if you don't take control of people who are clearly out of touch with reality, you are damaging them, exposing them, and of course tragically, exposing a lot of innocents around them.",
