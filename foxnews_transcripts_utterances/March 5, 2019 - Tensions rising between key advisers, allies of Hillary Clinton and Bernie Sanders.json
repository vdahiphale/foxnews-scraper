So it's not the first time that he has targeted Wall Street. He introduced a similar bill two years ago. Not too much pickup at the time. But now Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is a lead co-sponsor of this bill, along with a dozen others. DeFazio wants to discourage high- frequency trading. This is the group that he says he is targeting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, in other words, he wants to avoid another flash crash. DeFazio also saying the money from the tax could go to more worthy causes. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a financial transaction tax could help reduce the budget by adding $777 billion to the budget over a 10-year period. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If the exact form of the proposed law were to pass, individual investors would have to pay 0.01 percent, so very slight, per transaction, but they still have to pay to have the same if it goes through, in their online brokerage account. So that means TD Ameritrade, Schwab, what have you. Individuals wouldn't to be taxed, an important distinction, when putting money into 401(k) plans. But the companies that manage those, Charles, when they bought or sold securities for someone, they would be taxed. In theory, it would stay with the asset managers, but as we know many skeptics say corporations always find a way to pass down costs to consumers.

I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the lawmaker behind the Green New Deal, is now co-sponsoring a bill that would impose a tax on most stock transactions. The move could raise hundreds of billions in new tax revenue. FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, well, she's been doing some digging around. Deirdre, what did you find?"

      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "I certainly have been, Charles. Democratic Congressman from Oregon Peter DeFazio leading the charge against Wall Street, expected to introduce legislation this evening that would tax trades on stocks, bonds, derivatives. So it's not the first time that he has targeted Wall Street. He introduced a similar bill two years ago. Not too much pickup at the time. But now Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is a lead co-sponsor of this bill, along with a dozen others. DeFazio wants to discourage high- frequency trading. This is the group that he says he is targeting. So, in other words, he wants to avoid another flash crash. DeFazio also saying the money from the tax could go to more worthy causes. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates a financial transaction tax could help reduce the budget by adding $777 billion to the budget over a 10-year period. If the exact form of the proposed law were to pass, individual investors would have to pay 0.01 percent, so very slight, per transaction, but they still have to pay to have the same if it goes through, in their online brokerage account. So that means TD Ameritrade, Schwab, what have you. Individuals wouldn't to be taxed, an important distinction, when putting money into 401(k) plans. But the companies that manage those, Charles, when they bought or sold securities for someone, they would be taxed. In theory, it would stay with the asset managers, but as we know many skeptics say corporations always find a way to pass down costs to consumers. This is going to be one to follow this evening -- Charles, back to you."

So I predict that they're wrong. Additionally, this -- what the Democrats are trying to do is -- is change behavior. And whenever you're changing behavior, your -- all of your predictions about how much revenue you're going to have are going to change, because people are not going to be able to pay this. I mean, the margins that these traders are -- have and these high-frequency traders, they are slim margins. So it may seem like a small tax, but it's not. And the consumer is going to feel this. It is going to hit Main Street. It is going to hit farmers. It's going to hit every industry in the nation."

To be fair, wages, inequality and distribution is a gigantic issue, particularly in the four states that will probably decide the next presidency. That is Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Bernie Sanders almost rode to the nomination on that issue. Donald Trump wrote to the White House largely on that issue. In addition, debt and deficits are out of control. The last three administrations have extrapolated that problem. But the Democrats can make a mistake by lurching far left, even though this bill -- we're still getting details. I don't know that it's going to move that far through the Congress. This is what the U.K. -- the Labor Party did in the U.K. after Thatcher won, the Democratic Party did after Reagan won. They launched hard left. So if this is what the Democrats end up doing, and it's why Biden's potential entry into the race is so critical and so interesting."

The tax returns are actually now larger than what we thought they were going to be. So, sure, people are always going to want what somebody else has. The grass is always greener. But, in the end, they can go to bed at night, their bills are paid, their children are taking care of, they have food on the table, and that's what really matters."

These are a new breed of Democratic socialists, and maybe we should embrace them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOREY",
      "utterance": "Well, and I think Holly's uniting the Democratic Party, when it's not. AOC is more of a pace car than a center of the party. And that's again why Biden's going to get in. I think the nominee is eventually going to push for public-private partnerships, scale the markets, have a coalition bigger than the liberals, because what -- how can you get anything done? Look at the Amazon deal. Look at the Green New Deal. How could you get anything done without a public-private partnership, without a coalition bigger than the liberals and without depending on government alone to get something done? So I think the Democrats are going to have to find the center. And with Trump, the center is missing right now."

And Congress can investigate anything. And they famously investigated once for a couple of days the contents of Roger Clemens' urine, which was absurd. But it's what was on their minds at the time. So the president can do very little about this. Now, Jerry Nadler, who's the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, about what you asked me, issued requests for documents. You can take a request for a document, throw it out. But if you do, the next document will be a subpoena, which you can't throw out and what you must either comply with or take to court and have the judge invalidate, meaning hire your own team of lawyers to do it.

The chair of the House Ways and Means Committee has the power under a federal statute -- most people don't know this -- to get any citizens tax returns, you, me, people watching us now, or the president of the United States, without a reason.

I think the president has the clear authority to move the money from the DOD, Department of Defense, to defend our country, to defend our border. So, the real question we should be asking ourselves, is there a national emergency? Congress has backed the president into a corner that this is the only way he's going to get it done. I think they need to side with the president. Congress has failed the president over and over again. Once again, the president is on his own doing the best he can to secure this nation.

There's loopholes in the law. But rather than Congress addressing the loopholes, they want this uncontrolled border to continue because it's all about the president and failing. They don't want this president to succeed. So, they're putting their hatred of this president over their responsibility secure the border. I tell you, here's my opinion. If Congress is going to address this legislatively, then the operational components, CBP and ICE, need to do what they can operational to address this. So ICE should be out there right now, nationwide operation, look for all these family members that have had their due process in court in front of a judge, have been ordered removed.

When we filled a couple planes and sent them south, showing there's a consequence to deterrents to illegal activity, the crossings went down.

But some of the Democratic -- Republican congressmen I hear saying, well, we don't want to do this because the Democratic president could do the same to us a couple years down the line. They have already done it. President Trump did it -- I mean, President Obama did it with DACA. He said he couldn't do it. It's not constitutional. He did it anyway. He went around Congress, gave amnesty to 800,000 people. And where was the anger there from the Democratic Party? They have already done it. I think playing nice is over.

I got to tell you, this infighting -- over the weekend, when Bernie was announcing, I was watching live tweets from some former Clinton staffers. And they just took him to task.

I mean, you have candidates like Bernie that are so far into socialism, you have AOC championing that. Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's basically the Mitt Romney of the Democratic Party, that just instead of graciously fading away, is trying to push her politics instead of actually supporting someone and supporting her party. So I think the Democrats are just really fractured at this point. That's only going to help Trump in 2020. And over the next year-and-a half, we're going to see even more promises fulfilled.

They're going to move this as under what they call a suspension bill, meaning they waive some of the rules. But in exchange for that, you need a two-thirds supermajority. And if you have a lot of pro-Israel, pro-Jewish Democrats who want to be for this, and they don't like the language, and you can't get to 285, 290, which is the two- thirds threshold, that's a problem. I'm going to read you some of the tentative language of what we have here so far. It acknowledges the dangerous consequences of perpetuating anti- Semitic stereotypes. It rejects anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the United States.

I talked to one senior House Democratic aide earlier today who said, I wish that we could quit dealing with one another and start to deal with the bigger issues on the table.

      "utterance": "Over the weekend, Howard Dean took shots at him. Do you see the same sort of vitriolic response from the Republican side to potentially Mark Cuban?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I haven't. But Republicans are really united behind President Trump. And I think the Republicans that are turned off by President Trump and may vote for Mark Cuban are the ones that also may vote for a Democrat or a Howard Schultz. So, Republicans, really, the base has remained united against -- or for Trump, as a matter..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, he's got record approval ratings amongst Republican voters. No doubt about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "He does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Also, the cost. I mean, there's no doubt running as an independent requires spending a lot of money. And Mark Cuban has always come across to me as someone who counts the pennies and the nickels and dimes. And he makes practical, real pragmatic business decisions. He could actually have to spend a lot of his own money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Right. And I'm sure that's something he's thinking about. Remember, Mark Cuban has brought this up before. Cuban and Trump have this long on-and-off- again relationship, where they feud. Trump -- or Cuban has threatened to run for president before, and he hasn't done it. But, again, this is a whole different ball game. And we're seeing that everybody kind of feels like they can be president now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, everyone's kicking the tires. I want to ask you about breaking news we had this hour. Mike Bloomberg has decided not to run for president, of course, a billionaire. If he had run, he would have run as a Democrat. But a scathing op-ed he just released on his own Web site, what do you think? What does that mean now for the Democratic Party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, it means they will get lots of money towards certain issues. He floated climate, guns in that op-ed, when basically he said he didn't think -- or he didn't know if he could win a Democratic primary, though he thought he could win a general election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. PAYNE",
      "utterance": "And we're running out of time, so I do want to ask you, will that make Democratic candidates perhaps beholden to him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure yet. I mean, I think there's money pouring in. He jumped into that 2018 midterms and poured lots and lots of money, and candidates didn't necessarily -- weren't beholden to him then. So I think that the issues he's talking about, these candidates are already talking about."

      "speaker": "C. PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right. All right. Well, everyone wants that cash, though. Eliza, thank you very much.
