In moments we will explain in detail why Trumps legal machine is 1,000 percent correct which we've been doing now for some months. We'll also callout the media for yet another pathetic display of their misplaced anti-Trump outrage in a scare over a nonstory. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders will join us and respond in a minute. Also, the great one, Mark Levin will weigh in, and we have more updates about the deep state.

But they actually stuck with the Clintons through, well, November 8th of 2016. We'll explain that as well. We'll also end on a very incredibly positive note. We have a lot of good news. Today is day 500 of the Trump administration. For months, the left has been telling you, the American people, that Donald Trump is going to ruin this country. He is going to start a nuclear war.

And the exact opposite is true. From North Korea, to Iran, to Jerusalem -- yes, the capital of Israel -- the economy here, record breaking numbers all over the place.

Mayor Giuliani thinks that's a fact. Now, about while neither the left, nor the mainstream media seemed to care about why a confidential letter was leak from Robert Mueller's office to the press, many liberals are now feigning their predictable moral outrage over the memo's contents, especially this paragraph that details the legal team's view of obstruction and the president's power to pardon. Quote: The president's actions here by virtue of this position of chief law enforcement officer could neither constitutionally nor legally constitute obstruction because that would amount to him obstructing himself and he could, if he wished, terminate the inquiry or even exercise the power to pardon if he so desired. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This echoes exactly what attorney after attorney after attorney have been telling you right here on this program now for months. And as President Donald Trump and his legal team, they do have the power to literally order the Department of Justice to actually initiate an investigation, end an investigation, and, by the way, for whatever reason, that is within the president's constitutional authority. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Even the DOJ admits they can't charge a sitting president with obstruction. So, why are we talking about it? Also, the president's power to pardon, even himself, it is an absolute power.

Which brings us to a very important point.

REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We should have been provided all of this information that we've been asking for over and over and over again.

And we've got to be very careful, because the media has tried to make a bigger deal about this than what it is. What Trey Gowdy is specifically talking about is the small slice of the investigation that we're looking at as it relates to whether or not informants, an informant or informants were used. That's what he is referring to. That we've talked about. The president is not a target of this investigation.

So, as long as there's somebody else out there in the world, you never really alone, are you? I had sex with that woman not a single time.' For years, both Bill and Hillary Clinton, they've acted above the law. The complicit media gave them a pass. They ignored all of this in the 2016 election. And Bill Clinton's sick, perverted history of sexual misconduct, including all of these allegations, we've interviewed these women, even rape have gone unpunished. And the media didn't bring it up in 2016 because they wanted her elected. And, by the way, we all know Hillary was gifted leniency by James Comey after she committed felonies, violated the Espionage Act, deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washed her hard drive, and broke up her devices with a hammer, or had an aide do it. Do you think you or any other ordinary Americans would be given a pass by law enforcement if you did what Hillary Clinton did or did what Bill Clinton did? I doubt it. Now, what about the Hillary Clinton campaign hiring a foreign spy to cook up unverified, untrue, proven false in most cases, Russian intelligence to use as an op research against President Trump? Anyone in the Clinton campaign under investigation for that Russian collusion? No, the Mueller witch hunt is only investigating Trump associates. We have a two-tiered justice system. This is the danger in this country today, if we are going to remain a constitutional republic, one that benefits the Clintons at every turn, and they have laughed all the way to the bank. By the way, you should all be outraged. Despite all of this, we do have amazing news to share with you tonight. It is now the 500th day since Donald Trump was inaugurated and after months of predictions that a Trump presidency would lead this country in ruins -- well, it's now undeniable that the entire world is seeing massive, serious progress under the president's leadership. We have pending talks with the North Korean dictator, just days away. We are going to talk about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, that now weighs in the balance in the interim. Let's see? Kim Jong Un has halted all of his missile tests. No more missiles being fired over Japan in the interim. He literally is destroying one of his nuclear test sites have been disabled. Don't forget, three American hostages were also returned and he walked over to the DMZ into the arms of the South Korean president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All good news, not a dime paid, like in the case of Obama or Clinton in showing peace through strength works. And also breaking today, three longtime North Korean generals have been fired by Kim Jong Un, another good, potential sign of North Korea's commitment towards serious reform. And meanwhile, on day 500, the Trump presidency -- let's see, we've seen so many great developments right here at home. We don't even have the time to list them. Look at the side of your screen. Nearly 3 million plus jobs have been created, 300,000 in manufacturing alone, the unemployment rate, an almost unprecedented 3.8 percent, lowest in 50 years. Americans -- we have -- African-Americans, all time low unemployment rate, same with Hispanic Americans, same for women in the workplace, 14 state record lows as it relates to unemployment. Consumer confidence, 17-year high. This after passing a historic $3.7 trillion tax cut and cutting 22 regulations for every new one and acted. Even \"The New York Times,\" of all places, writing, we ran out of words to describe how good these job numbers are. And fake news CNN even had to report that the unemployment rate matches its lowest in half a century. Other accomplishments include the president keeping his promise. The U.S. embassy has moved to Jerusalem in Israel, getting America out of that horrific Iranian nuclear deal, and you can't forget about Trump's actions against Assad, ISIS, and Vladimir Putin. And you likely won't hear about this in the press. But the construction of that wall in the southern border of this country, yes, it started in San Diego. And remember, successful appointment of Neil Gorsuch, an originalist, to the Supreme Court, as promised. I could go on and on. It will take up the whole show. Look at Zogby. More Americans now believe they're much better off than when Donald Trump took office. But yet, the elites in this country, the Democrats, the media, Hollywood, and others all warning you that President Trump would be bad for America. You knew better, bad for the world. You knew better. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In fact, these people were actively and are actively rooting for the president and the country to fail so they could get power back. What they don't understand is that Americans are fed up with both parties, they are disgusted, so they purposely elected an iconoclast, a disruptor, and someone that they knew would get results and make decisions and move with the speed of Trump. And in his first 500 days, the president -- he has proved his first naysayers wrong. So, tonight, an important question to ask, who do you trust? The anti-Trump sycophants who have been wrong over and over and over again, actively now in the position of having to root for failure of the president, that means failure for the country? And by the way, a guy that has gotten results? Tonight, the answer to this question is clear. Everyone in America is reaping the awards, you, the American people made the right decision.

      "speaker": "MARK LEVIN, HOST, FOX NEWS",
      "sentences": "All right. Number one, this indictment issue, the president can't be indicted according to the United States Department of Justice. The two memos that they put together. This has been the position the Department of Justice for almost half a century. Mr. Mueller is an inferior employee in terms of the Department of Justice. He works for the Department of Justice. And he must comply with the policies of the Department of Justice. So he's been putting aside the constitutional issue, he can't defy the Department of Justice and bring in an indictment. I believe they already understand that because they watch your show. Constitutionally, we know he can't either because of the arguments laid out by Republican administration and Democrat administration. In other word, you can't cripple the president of the United States, he's the most powerful man in the federal government, and expect him to have his due process constitutional rights properly defended at the same time. No president has been indicted, and there is a reason for that. No president has ever been brought before a federal grand jury, and there is a reason for that. Perhaps Mr. Mueller is the one who was the tyrant, not the president of the United States. Now the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, President Trump didn't write that. Last time I checked them the framers wrote it, and it was ratified by all the states. The defect here is that every special counsel's appointment is unconstitutional, every special counselor's appointment is not unconstitutional. This special counsel's appointment is unconstitutional because the deputy attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein, hasn't educated himself about the Appointments Clause. He does not have the power to substitute his will for the president and the Senate. The president nominates principal officers to come to the United States Senate and the Senate must confirm. Assistant attorney general, assistant - - United States attorneys, assistant secretaries are not. The problem is Mr. Rosenstein conferred so much power onto this special counsel, no specific criminal statutes, no specific individuals, really, and his oversight is so tacit and so limited as he promised, he would keep his hands off of Mr. Mueller that he's created an unconstitutional special counsel. And I believe that the president challenges that one day, he will be successful. Now the pardon power. You know, this memo they keep referring to on Capitol Hill, Mr. Schumer, of all people, it's two and a half pages long. Page one? Page two? Page three. See my exes? Those of the relevant part of the memo that have nothing to do with what's going on today. See the circle? That's it. And there's one sentence in this whole thing. Under the fundamental rule that no one maybe a judge in his own case would seem that the question should be answered in that negative. That is whether the president can pardon himself. This is not a legal document. This is a joke. Do you see all the footnotes here? There aren't any. Do you see all the case law here? There isn't any. It's a novel question because no president has ever been indicted. So why are we even discussing this pardon power? Because the Washington -- excuse me -- the New York Times, one of their reporters in one of the highlighted sections of their phony article based on the leaked letter puts in there, is the president saying that he can pardon himself? Of course the president can pardon himself! Here is the language in the Constitution, article two, section two. The president has the power to grant reprieves in part for offenses against the United States except in cases of impeachment. Do you hear anything there, except in the case of the president? All of these protections are built into our Constitution to protect our Constitution, to protect the president from the mob, from the media, from the Democrats that are a mob today. They are here to protect them. It's not the president who is violating the Constitution, it's the media who want the Constitution violated. It's the Democrats who want the Constitution violated. It's Mueller and his merry brand of Democrat prosecutors who are tipping around a constitutional confrontation. As I said here, every time I've been in your show, Sean, the Constitution is the president's friend. And I'm speaking rather slowly so even Joe Scarborough can comprehend what I'm saying. Or even Chris Cuomo can copperhead what I'm saying. The president is in his position because of what is Mr. Rosenstein did, he created an unconstitutional monster who is threatening to bring the president in front of a federal grand jury, which is unconstitutional and has never been done, with this notion of obstruction of justice when he exercises his prerogatives as president because they want to indict him, which has never been done. The only way to remove the president of the United States is the old-fashioned way, through the Senate. And that's it. And so it's not the president who is the thug, it's Mr. Mueller who is the thug, it's not the president who is the incompetent, it's Mr. Rosenstein who is the incompetent. And they can mock the president and his attorneys all they want. But they show up in the Supreme Court, I'm betting that the president and his attorneys win.",

There are some reports that this could be a diplomatic misunderstanding and that they're not going to meet before the June 12 summit. Remember, there is a long friendship here. In 2007, Israeli warplanes bombed what they said was a nuclear facility in Syria that they believed was being built by North Korean scientist. More recently, there have been reports as well and allegations that North Korea shipped chemical weapon components to Syria. A more hopeful sign is what you mentioned out of North Korea, the purge of three senior military commanders. A younger loyalist to Kim who might be more willing to go towards denuclearization.

But welcome to \"Hannity.\" We have a major disgraceful leak apparently out of Robert Mueller's anti-Trump witch hunt and sending your mainstream corrupt anti-Trump media into a frenzy which is such a predictable state for them to be in. The leak consisted of a confidential months-old letter from President Trump's attorneys detailing their long-standing belief that the president of the United States cannot obstruct justice and can pardon himself. In moments we will explain in detail why Trumps legal machine is 1,000 percent correct which we've been doing now for some months. We'll also callout the media for yet another pathetic display of their misplaced anti-Trump outrage in a scare over a nonstory. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders will join us and respond in a minute. Also, the great one, Mark Levin will weigh in, and we have more updates about the deep state. And then former President Bill Clinton? Major meltdown. We got it all on tape. We'll play it for you and show you the tape. Many, by the way, on the left in this country, if you look at them, they are hoping, wishing, begging, pleading that the Clintons will finally go away. But they actually stuck with the Clintons through, well, November 8th of 2016. We'll explain that as well. We'll also end on a very incredibly positive note. We have a lot of good news. Today is day 500 of the Trump administration. For months, the left has been telling you, the American people, that Donald Trump is going to ruin this country. He is going to start a nuclear war. It's going to be a disaster. Well, numbers are numbers, facts are facts. And the exact opposite is true. From North Korea, to Iran, to Jerusalem -- yes, the capital of Israel -- the economy here, record breaking numbers all over the place. We'll highlight a lot of the president's greatest compliments in 500 days and explain why optimism in America is now at an all-time high. People are not listening to fake news. S, that's all coming up in tonight's very important breaking news, opening monologue."

If leaked by someone on Mueller's team, this is a huge, criminal breach of trust. Mayor Giuliani thinks that's a fact. Now, about while neither the left, nor the mainstream media seemed to care about why a confidential letter was leak from Robert Mueller's office to the press, many liberals are now feigning their predictable moral outrage over the memo's contents, especially this paragraph that details the legal team's view of obstruction and the president's power to pardon."

This echoes exactly what attorney after attorney after attorney have been telling you right here on this program now for months. And as President Donald Trump and his legal team, they do have the power to literally order the Department of Justice to actually initiate an investigation, end an investigation, and, by the way, for whatever reason, that is within the president's constitutional authority. Even the DOJ admits they can't charge a sitting president with obstruction. So, why are we talking about it? Also, the president's power to pardon, even himself, it is an absolute power. And over the weekend, look at that guy there, you see him, well, his hair is a little grayer now, but that's Clinton sycophant turned so- called journalist for ABC News, Georgie Stephanopoulos. You can see him whispering in Bill Clinton's ears. Well, yesterday, Stephanopoulos, he asked Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's attorney, former New York City mayor, what is a completely nonsensical, totally hypothetical, and, frankly, ridiculous question about this very concept. It is irrelevant to everything in the reality that is happening. Take a look."

And little Georgie Stephanopoulos acts all bewildered. This is not a new concept. We'll take you back. Let's go back down memory lane. 2016, then-candidate Hillary Clinton, remember in hot water over a gross, blatant misuse of classified information on the mom and pop bathroom closet server? Well, many were actually arguing, thinking that she was going to be elected president, that she -- if she was, could rightly pardon herself. Let's look at this headline from Dan Abrams \"Law and Crime\" website. 'If Hillary Clinton is indicted -- well, President Clinton could pardon herself and Congress might be helpless. 'This article from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" quote: 'The short answer to whether the Constitution permits self-pardoning is, yes, it probably does.' That seems to be the prevailing but by no means unanimous opinion among legal experts. Of course, that ridiculous question to Giuliani came from the same guy who made a name for himself as being Bill Clinton's political hit man during his run for the president.

Which brings us to a very important point. This phony, feigned, so-called outrage from the left and the media and other anti-Trump groupies is over something that has not happened and something that will not happen because President Trump has done nothing wrong and it was a hypothetical that Rudy Giuliani was actually laughing at. Still, the media's echo chamber blowing up over something rooted, illegal precedent, backed up by real constitutional scholars, and yet something that has not ever happened and probably won't. Take a look at the media once again making much ado about absolutely nothing, and watch this, you know, knowing this is the same media, as you watch this, totally missing in action on the biggest story in their lifetimes, which is the largest, biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in U.S. history.

The House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes gave an update on the DOJ stonewalling. Yet, it's a really strong words for his colleagues, and especially House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy who was dead wrong last week, unfortunately, and didn't have all the information that he needed before he made these comments. Take a look at what he said to our friend Maria Bartiromo. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We should have been provided all of this information that we've been asking for over and over and over again. We've issued a new subpoena. And so, now, we've been waiting. We've attended two briefings. They were very small briefings. Not a lot of information. But we were happy it was progress. We believe that there are some documents and information that we will review this week. What I would say is, if you don't have anything to hide, the deputy attorney general knows that Mr. Gowdy would love to exonerate the Department of Justice and the FBI. And we've got to be very careful, because the media has tried to make a bigger deal about this than what it is. What Trey Gowdy is specifically talking about is the small slice of the investigation that we're looking at as it relates to whether or not informants, an informant or informants were used. That's what he is referring to. That we've talked about. The president is not a target of this investigation. I believe that Mr. Gowdy knows very well and he's been instrumental in helping us get to the bottom of the FISA abuse that did occur."

Bill Clinton is back in the public spotlight, obviously, making money, pushing a brand-new book that is off to a horrible start. So, what a grandfather -- we can say -- we can call him the grandfather of today's Me Too movement. Clinton failed to realize is that it's no longer 1996. And all his buddies in the mainstream media can no longer afford to give him the free pass on his history of rampant, horrific sexual misconduct. During an interview with NBC News, the former president was finally pressed -- now, they could have done this before the election. But, of course, they wanted Hillary to win, but he was pressed on how he mishandled the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and almost unbelievably Clinton, who was impeached for lying under like under oath, said he did the right thing Remember, Paula Jones said he dropped his pants and got naked in front of her.

So, as long as there's somebody else out there in the world, you never really alone, are you? I had sex with that woman not a single time.' For years, both Bill and Hillary Clinton, they've acted above the law. The complicit media gave them a pass. They ignored all of this in the 2016 election. And Bill Clinton's sick, perverted history of sexual misconduct, including all of these allegations, we've interviewed these women, even rape have gone unpunished. And the media didn't bring it up in 2016 because they wanted her elected. And, by the way, we all know Hillary was gifted leniency by James Comey after she committed felonies, violated the Espionage Act, deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washed her hard drive, and broke up her devices with a hammer, or had an aide do it. Do you think you or any other ordinary Americans would be given a pass by law enforcement if you did what Hillary Clinton did or did what Bill Clinton did? I doubt it. Now, what about the Hillary Clinton campaign hiring a foreign spy to cook up unverified, untrue, proven false in most cases, Russian intelligence to use as an op research against President Trump? Anyone in the Clinton campaign under investigation for that Russian collusion? No, the Mueller witch hunt is only investigating Trump associates. We have a two-tiered justice system. This is the danger in this country today, if we are going to remain a constitutional republic, one that benefits the Clintons at every turn, and they have laughed all the way to the bank. By the way, you should all be outraged. Despite all of this, we do have amazing news to share with you tonight. It is now the 500th day since Donald Trump was inaugurated and after months of predictions that a Trump presidency would lead this country in ruins -- well, it's now undeniable that the entire world is seeing massive, serious progress under the president's leadership. We have pending talks with the North Korean dictator, just days away. We are going to talk about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, that now weighs in the balance in the interim. Let's see? Kim Jong Un has halted all of his missile tests. No more missiles being fired over Japan in the interim. He literally is destroying one of his nuclear test sites have been disabled. Don't forget, three American hostages were also returned and he walked over to the DMZ into the arms of the South Korean president. All good news, not a dime paid, like in the case of Obama or Clinton in showing peace through strength works. And also breaking today, three longtime North Korean generals have been fired by Kim Jong Un, another good, potential sign of North Korea's commitment towards serious reform. And meanwhile, on day 500, the Trump presidency -- let's see, we've seen so many great developments right here at home. We don't even have the time to list them. Look at the side of your screen. Nearly 3 million plus jobs have been created, 300,000 in manufacturing alone, the unemployment rate, an almost unprecedented 3.8 percent, lowest in 50 years. Americans -- we have -- African-Americans, all time low unemployment rate, same with Hispanic Americans, same for women in the workplace, 14 state record lows as it relates to unemployment. Consumer confidence, 17-year high. This after passing a historic $3.7 trillion tax cut and cutting 22 regulations for every new one and acted. Even \"The New York Times,\" of all places, writing, we ran out of words to describe how good these job numbers are. And fake news CNN even had to report that the unemployment rate matches its lowest in half a century. Other accomplishments include the president keeping his promise. The U.S. embassy has moved to Jerusalem in Israel, getting America out of that horrific Iranian nuclear deal, and you can't forget about Trump's actions against Assad, ISIS, and Vladimir Putin. And you likely won't hear about this in the press. But the construction of that wall in the southern border of this country, yes, it started in San Diego. And remember, successful appointment of Neil Gorsuch, an originalist, to the Supreme Court, as promised. I could go on and on. It will take up the whole show. Look at Zogby. More Americans now believe they're much better off than when Donald Trump took office. But yet, the elites in this country, the Democrats, the media, Hollywood, and others all warning you that President Trump would be bad for America. You knew better, bad for the world. You knew better. In fact, these people were actively and are actively rooting for the president and the country to fail so they could get power back. What they don't understand is that Americans are fed up with both parties, they are disgusted, so they purposely elected an iconoclast, a disruptor, and someone that they knew would get results and make decisions and move with the speed of Trump. And in his first 500 days, the president -- he has proved his first naysayers wrong. So, tonight, an important question to ask, who do you trust? The anti-Trump sycophants who have been wrong over and over and over again, actively now in the position of having to root for failure of the president, that means failure for the country? And by the way, a guy that has gotten results? Tonight, the answer to this question is clear. Everyone in America is reaping the awards, you, the American people made the right decision. Here now, Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, former deputy attorney general to the president, Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Gorka, the author of a new book out, it is out in July, get your copy now, \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump,' Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett.

We know that he crossed the DMZ, he released three American hostages, he's willing to talk about the denuclearization.

If there was another missile fired, we know that the president will then probably send or strike forces right back off the Korean peninsula, if need be.

This may not happen over the course of one meeting but several meetings. And this is the beginning of that dialogue. And the president is going to be a committed and firm to it.

That promise is fulfilled, moving the country towards energy independence. You can see the president is fighting on all issues regarding the border and the wall. I know it's 500 days in. Then he kept his word on Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, pulling out of the Iranian deal that nobody really expected that it started out as little rocket man, this would happen. And I watch you every day and I watched you today, all the focus is, you told us in 2017 that the president had nothing to do with the comments of Don Junior, and I'm thinking well, every report shows that what the president said, that the Magnitsky Act or the fact that that meeting was all about -- and all the e-mails proven to be about talking about adoption, that the fact is that at the end of the report, they told the truth. Isn't that the bigger picture that is missed tonight?"

We have the best economy since we've had since World War II. And they've refused to talk about that. The stock market is growing. People actually have jobs. People that need jobs and want jobs can get them. I mean, the fact that that wasn't something that was talked about, that wasn't brought up, that was totally ignored, the fact that ISIS is on the run and being defeated day after day and we are in a much better position than ever before when it comes to that battle, the fact that the president has completely remade the judiciary, the fact that we are becoming an energy independent and an energy dominant country under this resident's leadership, they ignore all the successes of this president and it's to their detriment.

He's the host of CRT TV Levin TV, the host of Life, Liberty, Levin, the number one show on Sunday night, 10 here on Fox News, the great one. All right. The idea that a president can be indicted, I want you to deal with that. I want you to deal with the idea of pardons. I want you to -- because this is your wheelhouse, Mark, and the idea that the president has done anything wrong, I see you got your papers and you are prepared, sir. Go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK LEVIN, HOST, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "All right. Number one, this indictment issue, the president can't be indicted according to the United States Department of Justice. The two memos that they put together. This has been the position the Department of Justice for almost half a century. Mr. Mueller is an inferior employee in terms of the Department of Justice. He works for the Department of Justice. And he must comply with the policies of the Department of Justice. So he's been putting aside the constitutional issue, he can't defy the Department of Justice and bring in an indictment. I believe they already understand that because they watch your show. Constitutionally, we know he can't either because of the arguments laid out by Republican administration and Democrat administration. In other word, you can't cripple the president of the United States, he's the most powerful man in the federal government, and expect him to have his due process constitutional rights properly defended at the same time. No president has been indicted, and there is a reason for that. No president has ever been brought before a federal grand jury, and there is a reason for that. Perhaps Mr. Mueller is the one who was the tyrant, not the president of the United States. Now the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, President Trump didn't write that. Last time I checked them the framers wrote it, and it was ratified by all the states. The defect here is that every special counsel's appointment is unconstitutional, every special counselor's appointment is not unconstitutional. This special counsel's appointment is unconstitutional because the deputy attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein, hasn't educated himself about the Appointments Clause. He does not have the power to substitute his will for the president and the Senate. The president nominates principal officers to come to the United States Senate and the Senate must confirm. Assistant attorney general, assistant - - United States attorneys, assistant secretaries are not. The problem is Mr. Rosenstein conferred so much power onto this special counsel, no specific criminal statutes, no specific individuals, really, and his oversight is so tacit and so limited as he promised, he would keep his hands off of Mr. Mueller that he's created an unconstitutional special counsel. And I believe that the president challenges that one day, he will be successful. Now the pardon power. You know, this memo they keep referring to on Capitol Hill, Mr. Schumer, of all people, it's two and a half pages long. Page one? Page two? Page three. See my exes? Those of the relevant part of the memo that have nothing to do with what's going on today. See the circle? That's it. And there's one sentence in this whole thing. Under the fundamental rule that no one maybe a judge in his own case would seem that the question should be answered in that negative. That is whether the president can pardon himself. This is not a legal document. This is a joke. Do you see all the footnotes here? There aren't any. Do you see all the case law here? There isn't any. It's a novel question because no president has ever been indicted. So why are we even discussing this pardon power? Because the Washington -- excuse me -- the New York Times, one of their reporters in one of the highlighted sections of their phony article based on the leaked letter puts in there, is the president saying that he can pardon himself? Of course the president can pardon himself! Here is the language in the Constitution, article two, section two. The president has the power to grant reprieves in part for offenses against the United States except in cases of impeachment. Do you hear anything there, except in the case of the president? All of these protections are built into our Constitution to protect our Constitution, to protect the president from the mob, from the media, from the Democrats that are a mob today. They are here to protect them. It's not the president who is violating the Constitution, it's the media who want the Constitution violated. It's the Democrats who want the Constitution violated. It's Mueller and his merry brand of Democrat prosecutors who are tipping around a constitutional confrontation. As I said here, every time I've been in your show, Sean, the Constitution is the president's friend. And I'm speaking rather slowly so even Joe Scarborough can comprehend what I'm saying. Or even Chris Cuomo can copperhead what I'm saying. The president is in his position because of what is Mr. Rosenstein did, he created an unconstitutional monster who is threatening to bring the president in front of a federal grand jury, which is unconstitutional and has never been done, with this notion of obstruction of justice when he exercises his prerogatives as president because they want to indict him, which has never been done. The only way to remove the president of the United States is the old-fashioned way, through the Senate. And that's it. And so it's not the president who is the thug, it's Mr. Mueller who is the thug, it's not the president who is the incompetent, it's Mr. Rosenstein who is the incompetent. And they can mock the president and his attorneys all they want. But they show up in the Supreme Court, I'm betting that the president and his attorneys win."

I would say and I've it before. Where the hell is the United States Congress? The Republicans control it. They need to hold hearings. They need to ask Mr. Rosenstein why he didn't recuse himself since he recommended that Comey be fired. They need to ask Mr. Mueller about those memos out of the Justice Department. They need to ask Mr. Mueller what authority he has to drag a president in front of a federal grand jury or subpoena him, what authority does he has to even contemplate indicting a president. And how is it that he hasn't violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution? Congress has a role for crying out loud. And there are article one they created first in the Constitution.

When a woman steps up when you used to have much power over and now she's got a powerful voice it might be time to sit down. Take several seats. We'll see what happens."

      "utterance": "Yes. That's another big part of it, Sean. You're right. In terms of the Syrian meeting, remember, remember, this follows meeting that Kim Jong Un has had with Chinese and Russian officials. And so the question is, is this sort of a had faked to the hardliners that yes, I might also meet with the Syrian president Bashar al Assad, with you and with the rogue nations right before he flips and actually does the right thing and seals a peace deal with President Trump, or is this a warning sign that it's hard to trust Kim when he's potentially meeting with Assad who only days ago raised the specter of attacking U.S. troops to try and reclaim territory in Syria. There are some reports that this could be a diplomatic misunderstanding and that they're not going to meet before the June 12 summit. Remember, there is a long friendship here. In 2007, Israeli warplanes bombed what they said was a nuclear facility in Syria that they believed was being built by North Korean scientist. More recently, there have been reports as well and allegations that North Korea shipped chemical weapon components to Syria. A more hopeful sign is what you mentioned out of North Korea, the purge of three senior military commanders. A younger loyalist to Kim who might be more willing to go towards denuclearization. A sign that the chances of a peace deal may be increasing, Sean."
