They start going through the phone and they find that he has a lot of things that would be very troubling. Thankfully, he wasn't successful, right, necause we have to be right a hundred percent of the time. They just have to be right once.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Another prominent liberal caught in a racist photo scandal, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau facing a firestorm over wearing a black face in a 2001 photo. It happened during an Arabian night's themed party at a school where he was a 29-year-old teacher. Trudeau apologizing last night, but then two more examples emerged, one from high school in the '90s where he's wearing a wig performing a Jamaican folk song at a talent show, the other, a video showing him in black face waving his hands around and sticking his tongue out. Trudeau force to apology again this afternoon. He hit all the liberal buzz words like intersectionality and unconscious bias, and he didn't rule out that there could be more photos."

My favorite part of this is the quote he gives when he says, I didn't consider it racist at the time but now we know better. That was in 2001. In -- this was not a photo that somebody took in 1960 of someone where you could say, you know, the times are different. People didn't realize the severity of what they were doing. They didn't realize how offensive it was. In 2001, every single one of us at this table was an adult in 2001, who knew well and good enough that you don't put black face on and behave this way as a grown adult teaching. Also, you're a teacher, what kind of example are you setting? So this guy, you know, with all his P.C. nonsense and always trying to seem so wonderful and, oh, I sugar coat all my words not to offend anyone. He's bracing us for more stuff that's coming.

I think that if you're 29 years old, you should know about the history of things like birth of a nation, and minstrel shows and, you know, depicting the other minorities and it could be orientalism as it's called, or depicting Irish people as drunks or -- you know, I could go on with all the language that we in America know too well. But the whole idea is that the other is lazy, dumb, you know, not a good worker, not to be trusted, and it's all a basis for racist behavior for excluding people. And, you know, the problem here is, I find it so interesting, as, you know, from a political analyst point of view, he's being attacked in Canada as not as advertised. That is the slogan being used by conservatives in Canada to attack Trudeau during a very close race. I think the election is October 21st. And he has not been able to move ahead of his conservative challenger. And now the question is what about the liberals in Canada? So you depict him as a hypocrite, but the liberals in Canada now start to agree with the conservatives in Canada that, well, maybe this guy shouldn't be the sword carrier for liberal ideology. He previously has made his cabinet, a cabinet that he says looks like Canada because it's diverse. It's one half women."

That's where his political foundation is up in the Quebec area. Remember, he was kind of Canada's President Obama. He was hope and change. And he was the political dynasty of the Trudeau's. The English media, however, is really going after him very hard. But, if you think of Ralph Northam of Virginia, the governor there, people have pretty short memories, if you could weather the storm. Remember, Northam was like, I'm not really sure if that's me. I don't really know. I'm not really sure. Trudeau has a different tactic.

He looked shaky in New Hampshire. He looked shaky in Iowa. And every time he gets on the debate stage he looks like a babbling mess. She does have positives. She's very strident. She's very forceful. She, obviously, has tapped into this kind of socialist, populist part of the country. She does have crowd size, but let's be honest about the crowd size, Jedediah. When she had the 15,000 or the 20,000 in Minnesota and in Seattle, you know who estimated that? Her campaign."

And just in terms of policy, conservative policy. You're running in the rust belt and you're saying you're for the green new deal. That's a nonstarter. If you're running on taking away people's health insurance and raising middle class taxes that's a nonstarter. I think she's a little -- I wouldn't say awkward, but she can't dance. She makes people uncomfortable, I think, in a general sense when you watch her talk on television.

And timing is everything. And I think had she decided to not endorse Hillary Clinton and take on Bernie Sanders and to go toe to toe with President Trump when he didn't have a record to run on, yet, then I think her outcome could have been different. Bernie Sanders has to make a decision. Is he going to go after her or not? They are basically waiting for President Trump to try to take her down for them.

He wanted to make some more money, so he was just hoping that the plane would send an error message and then come back to the gate and he would be able to make a little bit more dough. What ended up happening, though, is that the pilots recognize there's something wrong, they decided not to fly, they come back to the gate, and because he has a distinctive limp, when they looked at videotape his colleagues were able to identify him. Subsequently, prosecutors were like, oh, wait a second, let's just see if the story checks out. They start going through the phone and they find that he has a lot of things that would be very troubling. Thankfully, he wasn't successful, right, necause we have to be right a hundred percent of the time. They just have to be right once.

You know, you can't add surveillance to certain people because of their ethnicity or their nationality or their religion, but I think everybody in that industry that's working on planes needs to be scrutinized just a little bit more. And if you're going to Iraq and maybe you come back, maybe there has to be some scrutiny there. Not because of who he is or what religion he is, but just because that is a country in which a lot of terrorism comes from and has a history there.

You know, luckily, he was found out. It was stopped and nothing terrible happened. But I don't know what do you do? You can't start seizing people's phones and just searching inside their phones. You have to have reasonable suspicion that something is going on. People have privacy rights in the country. If you had overreach into that, you would have mass - people would be going crazy. They would say, my constitutional rights are being stepped on here. What's interesting is, why do all these details come out later though. There seems like so much information. When it came out that he failed to disclose to arresting authorities that he had traveled to Iraq in March. I mean this guy has this stuff on his phone. He sent $700 to someone in Iraq recently. All of these details after these things happened seem to emerge and you say, why was none of this flagged or why did no one look into this at all. And maybe you just can't. Maybe there is no way to do it without infringing on people's privacy rights and that's going to be the next big debate for people who work in industries that are sensitive to conditions like this and people's safety is so heavily at risk."

They have been spending in San Francisco and Los Angeles hundreds of millions of dollars for years now to try to combat this problem. And it's not doing anything. It's not making a difference. And liberals always think let's throw more money at the problem and I think the resistance is, well, this money is getting in the hands of people who are not properly allocating it. It's not being spent properly. It's not investing into the community in ways that seek to prevent these types of things from happening and just because you stick up a housing complex is not going to fix a homeless problem; you have to deal with substance abuse.

The young players said the last time he played catch with his granddad was when he was seven years old before a Thanksgiving dinner. By the way Mike hit a homerun Tuesday night at Fenway. That was that shot was the first time that Yastrzemski hit a homerun at Fenway in 36 years. What a story."

A Halloween costume, you see her daughter absolutely loves it. Mom had just received it in the mail. I'm guessing from Greg Gutfeld that's not in the script, but it could have happened. Before the bus arrived and wanted to surprise her daughter who loves unicorns. This - I love this because this is the age before your parents embarrass you."
