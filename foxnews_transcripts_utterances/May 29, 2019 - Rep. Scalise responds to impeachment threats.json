We dissect every aspect of what Bob Mueller did today when he came out and talked for the first time before the cameras. The Dems impeachment lurch, the outstanding investigations into the Obama deep state and Trump's 2020 first reaction is straight ahead. We're going to be joined by Sol Wisenberg, Robert Ray, Harmeet Dhillon, Dan Bongino, Brad Parscale, Steve Scalise, Chris Hahn, Raymond Arroyo is here with a palate cleanser in between. Plus, with all the Mueller news of course we had to bring you that. That means the culture wars, everything happening in between with Biden out there, the touchy-feely Joe Biden once again and what's happening next week when Trump goes to London, who will not be there to be part of the ceremonies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Raymond Arroyo is here with all that as I said and will be going to London on Monday. We'll be there on Monday and in Paris at the Normandy anniversary next week where I'm going to be interviewing exclusively President Trump. You're not going to want to miss any of that. That's next week. But first Mueller pulls a Comey. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Today, the man behind the curtain, Robert Mueller spoke for the first time. Now, if you expected him to have a booming powerful voice and a reassuring presentation, you were sorely disappointed. He seemed and sounded older than his 74 years, almost tired, exasperated and yet determined to throw elbows on his way out the door. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We dissect every aspect of what Bob Mueller did today when he came out and talked for the first time before the cameras. The Dems impeachment lurch, the outstanding investigations into the Obama deep state and Trump's 2020 first reaction is straight ahead. We're going to be joined by Sol Wisenberg, Robert Ray, Harmeet Dhillon, Dan Bongino, Brad Parscale, Steve Scalise, Chris Hahn, Raymond Arroyo is here with a palate cleanser in between. Plus, with all the Mueller news of course we had to bring you that. That means the culture wars, everything happening in between with Biden out there, the touchy-feely Joe Biden once again and what's happening next week when Trump goes to London, who will not be there to be part of the ceremonies. Raymond Arroyo is here with all that as I said and will be going to London on Monday. We'll be there on Monday and in Paris at the Normandy anniversary next week where I'm going to be interviewing exclusively President Trump. You're not going to want to miss any of that. That's next week. But first Mueller pulls a Comey. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Today, the man behind the curtain, Robert Mueller spoke for the first time. Now, if you expected him to have a booming powerful voice and a reassuring presentation, you were sorely disappointed. He seemed and sounded older than his 74 years, almost tired, exasperated and yet determined to throw elbows on his way out the door."

Mueller effectively invited Democrats to institute impeachment proceedings. Now as I said in my podcast today as I was watching Mueller in real time, this kind of reminded me of Jim Comey, you remember the FBI Director, his absurd non-indictment indictment of Hillary Clinton back in July of 2016."

His job as FBI Director was to investigate the case than merely present his findings to the Attorney General, his bosses at the Department of Justice. But instead what Comey ended up doing, well he managed to tick off everyone. Now setting aside the glaring fact that Hillary got off for conduct that others would have been jailed for, Comey did enormous damage to the integrity of the FBI and the rule of law."

      "utterance": "Well, there is nothing reasonable about a system of justice where at least half the country thinks the entire thing is rigged. The deep state said candidate Trump up after it became obvious that he was going to win the nomination because they were terrified of even the remote prospect of an outsider becoming President of the United States exonerating Mrs. Clinton was an essential step to stopping Trump. But it didn't work. And once Trump won the presidency, they had to fire up the Russian collusion investigation via the phony dossier, the FISA court and of course Agent Mueller helping along the way. And when that didn't work after a two- year long investigation, they found no evidence of collusion and failed to get the obstruction goods on Trump. But now Mueller comes along in his final bow and is attempting to resuscitate the corpse that was his report. But for you little people by the way, he's going to say nothing more."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's it. No questions. After completing their investigations neither Comey nor Mueller needed to appear before the cameras. He didn't have to do that today and Comey didn't have to do that back in July of 2016. So, why did they? Now, it wasn't because of Comey's feigned concern for transparency or because Mueller was closing up the special counsel's office, leaving for the last time. Thinking about it today, it was all partly due to the old set of pride. We all suffer from it. But here it's a concern that they both had for their place in history. Remember, both men are lifelong products of the Washington legal establishment that at its core reviles a man such as Trump. Think about it. To be defeated or even embarrassed by a man that they believe is as uncouth and undignified as Trump and his supporters. Well that's unthinkable. Comey turned himself and the law into a pretzel to give Hillary a pass. Then use the collusion crutch that led to the appointment of Mueller. And today, Mueller actually tried to turn a lack of evidence on obstruction into grounds for impeaching a sitting President. It is wild. Both of them are trying to get back into the good graces of the in-crowd. Both of them and their careers with a deafening thud.

They think he's uncouth. They think he's not smart. They think he didn't deserve the presidency. He didn't check all their boxes and they never wanted him to be President and the fact that he managed to get through two years of this investigation accomplished as much as he has, I think it sticks under their craw and I don't mean to cut you off Sol, but Harmeet I'm hot on this, because I don't like when prosecutors grandstand before the cameras whether It was Patrick Fitzgerald, with Conrad Black or whether it's this with President Trump.

I think that by coming out and saying dropping this, he's that jerk who has to have the last word. Right. So, it's not enough to come out and smear the President again like his report does.

But then he says, well, if we could have exonerated him, we would have, but we can't exonerate him. Well, there's no difference. He still really can't. He's putting the same position. If Mueller to be consistent, I think should have said, look, here is the evidence we found on obstruction. Here is the evidence, we're not making a conclusion about it, here it is, which by the way is what Leon Jaworski did when he sent his report to Congress. He said here's what happened on this day.

Chris, let's just say as a matter of politics. Do you think that's smart politics aside from whether do you think it's the right thing to do? HAHN: I think that the president thinking that him being impeached is a benefit to his reelection is a gross miscalculation. I think impeachment would be bad for this president. It was bad for Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party. It led to the election of George W. Bush. The Republicans did not lose to the House of Representatives or the Senate during that time. So there's a lot of talk that this is something that he wants. I tell you, Mr. President, you don't want it. And the way to avoid it is to start cooperating with Congress on their subpoenas, give them the documents they want, and let it play out that way, and it won't be an impeachment."

What you won't hear from those anchors is the fact that, of course, that doesn't stop the fact that there are three separate investigations still going on into the origins of this Russia hoax, how it all started. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is looking at a potential surveillance abuses by the FBI. Utah Federal Prosecutor John Huber is also investigating potential FISA abuses by the FBI and the DOJ. He's also reviewing the handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. And finally, of course, U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut was tapped to examine the origins of the Russia probe and specifically tasked with determining if former intel leaders abused their powers. Here now is Robert Ray, former Independent Counsel, and George Papadopoulos, a former Trump 2016 campaign adviser who himself, of course, got caught up in this Russia witch hunt. He's also the author of the new book, \"Deep State Target.\" Robert, which of these investigations is the most important at this moment post Mueller statement?"

We don't know, it's too early to say what we will see from that, but obviously that's the most potentially significant. I don't want to minimize the fact that we are also preparing to hear from the Inspector General, Michael Horowitz. That will provide I think a bit of a roadmap for the public to understand where we're going. But I think the bottom line is the Attorney General intends to get to the bottom of this, and I would take him at his word that he's serious."

      "utterance": "I saw a feeble man, meaning Bob Mueller, basically propagating conspiracy theories and trying to galvanize the Democrats to initiate some sort of obstruction hearings or impeachment hearings, which I think of course would boomerang and hurt the Democrats in 2020. So I don't think they are dumb enough to actually initiate those considering the president of course could not obstruct a witch hunt, and Bob Mueller himself should have stated that very clearly and eloquently, which he did not. But I think the president was on to something a couple days ago before he went to Japan when he stated that he is going to looking into foreign government interference in the 2016 election. And at the beginning of this segment you showed the three agencies, the CIA and the FBI, and possibly the NSA, were colluding, I believe, with foreign governments including the U.K. and Australia to basically set traps for the Trump campaign to make it look like we were conspiring or coordinating with the Russian government, which of course was absurd."

      "speaker": "PAPADOPOULOS",

And I was face-to-face with these spies, with these agents, these foreign agents, Alexander Downer, Stefan Halper, Joseph Mifsud, State Department officials, CIA officials, all of these individuals were running into me in capitals around the world, in London, Athens, and even in the U.S. So clearly, they were targeting the campaign. And I even went, in my opinion, it goes back even to other campaigns, too. I think Donald Trump's campaign wasn't the only one targeted. I was working for the Ben Carson campaign, and there were very strange forays into that campaign of State Department officials. So I think the president is right to declassify the materials. It's the only way to get to the bottom of it, and he did the right thing for the American people."

I don't really know what the point of nine minutes and 40 seconds worth of a, I'm returning my paper clips and I'm going to head back into retirement, really what the purpose of all that was. I assume the purpose was to show Congress, lest they be tempted into subpoenaing his testimony, that Director Mueller is serious that he has no intention of saying anything other than what he's already said in his report. And if that is the result of this, I think that's a good thing. I think, and I've thought all along, that it is in the country's interest to allow the report to speak for itself. If the Congress in its infinite wisdom wants to jump on the impeachment bandwagon, then go to it. But they don't need an assist from Bob Mueller to do so. I don't understand really what the point of that press conference was. He said nothing new and he made it clear that if you subpoena him he doesn't intend to say anything other than what's already --"

You saw others in their own leadership on the Democrat side saying this was what they were going to make their two year majority about. Frankly, this isn't what the American people elected them to do, so I think there is going to be a heavy price for Democrats who go down this path. But they've been planning this witch hunt. They spent two years and over $30 million of taxpayer money lying, saying that there was proof of obstruction, that there was proof of collusion. There was none of it. In fact, the only collusion that happened were there were people, officials at the Department of Justice, at the FBI, even in the Obama administration who were spying on the Trump campaign. And ultimately when you look at some of the things that happened, they had a partisan agenda within the FBI to take down this president before he was elected. People aren't going to stand for this. If they want to pursue this road, it's going to be, again, at the peril of their majority."

The very committee that has jurisdiction over the crisis at the border that is real today, more than 4,000 people a day crossing our border illegally, that's the committee that is chaired by Jerry Nadler that is focused on this witch hunt, on focusing down ratholes to try to impeach the president even when there is no proof and there was no collusion."
