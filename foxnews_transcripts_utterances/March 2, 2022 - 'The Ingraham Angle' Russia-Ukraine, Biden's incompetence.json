The first major city fell to Russian forces today as the civilian death toll climbs to more than 2000, according to officials there. Now, further east, the port city of Mariupol underwent a 15-hour bombardment after being surrounded by Russian troops. Now, according to the mayor, the city is near a humanitarian catastrophe. And already tonight in Kyiv, blasts are being heard all around the city. We're going to be updating you on the increasingly dire situation on the ground there. And we'll do that throughout the hour.

But everyone around me who lived there for this entire year was just ok with it. It was like a normal day. So it's not as dramatic as you try to describe it. Ukrainians are not panicking.

And while that speaks to the courage of the Ukrainian people. It also speaks to the fact that Vladimir Putin miscalculated. He thought that conventional missile strikes and cruise missile strikes on command and control centers combined with his armored forces would lead to a quick victory, and that hasn't happened. And that's good news for the Ukrainians. But the bad news is, we've seen what happens before when the Russians get bogged down. And Putin gets more desperate. What he did in Syria with saving Bashar Al Assad was to do what he's starting to do now, which is a siege mentality around cities where he literally has decided it's better to level entire neighborhoods, including civilians rather than risk any more Russian lives. And that's what you're seeing in Kyiv and Kharkiv right now. And it also speaks to the fact that he has already warned that he does not want NATO interfering in this. And so, we need to be careful about escalating this. But, Laura, it really underscores why this was such a bad strategy from the Biden administration. The if-then strategy - if Russia invades then we'll do something about it, then we'll help Ukraine. All of these supplies and all of the weaponry and all of the things that we sent in the Trump administration like javelins and stingers and sniper rifles and all the things that the Russians need, they should have been there long, long time ago instead of the strategy that now leaves them on the outside looking in.",

He's going to use those, use air to ground missiles to target Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities, and then he's going to carpet bomb. That's what he did in Georgia. That's what he did in Syria. That's what he's going to do here. And unfortunately, at this point, it's a matter of time if the Biden administration isn't going to do the things that were really necessary to help the Ukrainian people. We're just going to have a front row seat to the horrors of war. And it will be a front row seat, because unlike Syria the world press is watching this.

They're resilient, they're angry, and they're filled with passion, and they're filled with rage. And one man defending his home is better than 10 hired Russian soldiers.

I think that has it the wrong way around. The reality is that because there has been no response for Wuhan, that has incentivized American adversaries. Whether we're talking about Vladimir Putin, whether we're talking about the Chinese Communist Party. Remember what happened at Wuhan. This is the issue. The Chinese lied about where it started, how it started, they lied about the nature of transmission. At that point, it became an operation. And let's remember where this doctrine comes from. The idea of being able to deploy, deploy violence, hurt your adversary without them actually knowing what you're doing. This is a Soviet doctrine. So this reminds us how close at different points Moscow and Beijing have been in the past. But again, for I think that that's one of the things we need to start looking at. No one has held the Chinese Communist Party responsible for the millions of deaths in the world, instead what did they do?",

This lines up really well with the top concerns of the GOP voters. But not the Democrat voters, because their top five extreme worries include Trump supporters, white nationalism, climate change, and voter suppression. That's right, they are more worried about MAGA hat wearers than the potential for a job-crushing recession or rampant crime. So for them, police brutality is a far bigger worry than inflation. More of them see systemic racism as more of a serious threat than our crippling supply chain, our porous borders. This is a nightmare scenario for Democrats. They're caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place. On one side is their vicious, impatient grassroots itching for some type of socialist type revolution. On the other side, you have most Americans who just want to live in peace and freedom, maybe a fair shot at prosperity. That would be nice.

Now, when I was in Mariupol in 2015, I was jogging along the street. And I heard artillery bombing for the first time. I was like, What the f*** is going on? But everyone around me who lived there for this entire year was just ok with it. It was like a normal day. So it's not as dramatic as you try to describe it. Ukrainians are not panicking.

And while that speaks to the courage of the Ukrainian people. It also speaks to the fact that Vladimir Putin miscalculated. He thought that conventional missile strikes and cruise missile strikes on command and control centers combined with his armored forces would lead to a quick victory, and that hasn't happened. And that's good news for the Ukrainians. But the bad news is, we've seen what happens before when the Russians get bogged down. And Putin gets more desperate. What he did in Syria with saving Bashar Al Assad was to do what he's starting to do now, which is a siege mentality around cities where he literally has decided it's better to level entire neighborhoods, including civilians rather than risk any more Russian lives. And that's what you're seeing in Kyiv and Kharkiv right now. And it also speaks to the fact that he has already warned that he does not want NATO interfering in this. And so, we need to be careful about escalating this. But, Laura, it really underscores why this was such a bad strategy from the Biden administration. The if-then strategy - if Russia invades then we'll do something about it, then we'll help Ukraine. All of these supplies and all of the weaponry and all of the things that we sent in the Trump administration like javelins and stingers and sniper rifles and all the things that the Russians need, they should have been there long, long time ago instead of the strategy that now leaves them on the outside looking in."

Obviously, to Russia."

      "utterance": "If you take out the options that would have worked the double whammy of this - the sanction that was the double whammy, which is actually sanctioning Russia's oil supply and increasing U.S. oil production. None of the other sanctions are going to work in a timely manner to help Ukraine. It is going to get worse. Putin has not yet deployed. He's got 300 modern striker fighters, SU-30s, 34s, 35s. He's going to use those, use air to ground missiles to target Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities, and then he's going to carpet bomb. That's what he did in Georgia. That's what he did in Syria. That's what he's going to do here. And unfortunately, at this point, it's a matter of time if the Biden administration isn't going to do the things that were really necessary to help the Ukrainian people. We're just going to have a front row seat to the horrors of war. And it will be a front row seat, because unlike Syria the world press is watching this. So I think the American people unfortunately are going to see the horrors of war up close. And I think it'll really underscore the Biden failed strategy here."

And why - from the intelligence community standpoint, there's concern here, Laura. He - Joe Biden instructed our intelligence community to share our intelligence of Putin's invasion plans of Ukraine with China, naively thinking that China might help us stop Putin. And instead, they did exactly what everyone knew they would. They shared that information with Putin. And not only that, they told Putin, look, we know you're going to invade Ukraine, we just ask that you hold off until after the Olympics. That's been confirmed by our intelligence sources. And again, it just underscores that China is not a strategic competitor. They are the adversary that wants to get rid of us as the world's superpower."

This episode regarding the fact that China shared our intelligence with Russia on our intelligence about his invasion plans with Putin really underscores the point and shows the naive approach that we're taking with what is our greatest national security threat. It's really inexplicable. And it does not portend well for the next three years. We've been slapped around by China already. Their diplomats have come to U.S. soil. Early in this administration, they are engaged against Taiwan in a way that they never have in the air defense identification zone. And Biden does nothing about it.

I mean, you're used to being in war zones. And other people have lived through military campaigns. But for women and children, this is not usually part of their daily life.

And you get really close to somebody when you share a bus for 22 hours. And I'll tell you, the thing that I have learned the most is that every one of these stories are terrible, and gut wrenching, and heartbreaking. Every single one. And the pictures really don't do a justice. Having your life whittled down to a backpack and a carry on bag leaving your home for possibly forever, under the threat or action of Russian artillery, or bombers, or what have you, is absolutely terrible. As it relates to the resolve of the Ukrainian people, I didn't hear the segment. But I've seen it firsthand. The resolve of the Ukrainian people is inspiring to me, at least. They're resilient, they're angry, and they're filled with passion, and they're filled with rage. And one man defending his home is better than 10 hired Russian soldiers. So I think that the Ukrainians have already given the Russian army a run for their money. And I think that they will continue to do so."

I can't tell you how many - I was on the border today and watching the men, the men kiss their wives goodbye as they cross the border, and they go and fight. They go and fight.

You're - everyone's hearts break to see this suffering - at the level of human suffering that we're seeing it.

At that point, the intelligence community got itself in a lot of trouble. And this is one of the reasons or the key reason I've been saying for several years, what we saw was not just a beltway political scandal. It was a national security disaster waiting to happen. Now, whether it's the press, whether it's coming out of the Pentagon, whether it's coming out of intelligence community assessments at this point, I believe that the American public has no very good idea what's going on, because these same people have now established a reputation for lying, in particular, about Russia, and for using Ukraine as an instrument against their adversaries, both foreign and domestic."

The larger problem here is that to explain how we got to this point. It's not about being pro-Putin. It's not about being pro-Russian. It's not about feeling heartbroken for the Ukrainian public. What it is to - we need to understand what role the U.S. national security establishment has played getting us here. What role even Joe Biden as vice president under Barack Obama has played getting us here? These are very important details. So as that article you're talking about, we need to understand actually what Putin is doing. We need to understand who Vladimir Putin is, without the lies of the national security establishment and the prestige press.

A very important issue here that I think that most people have put aside is, they say that the - Oh, Biden administration's response to Ukraine is likely to incentivize Xi and the Chinese to make a run at Taiwan. I think that has it the wrong way around. The reality is that because there has been no response for Wuhan, that has incentivized American adversaries. Whether we're talking about Vladimir Putin, whether we're talking about the Chinese Communist Party. Remember what happened at Wuhan. This is the issue. The Chinese lied about where it started, how it started, they lied about the nature of transmission. At that point, it became an operation. And let's remember where this doctrine comes from. The idea of being able to deploy, deploy violence, hurt your adversary without them actually knowing what you're doing. This is a Soviet doctrine. So this reminds us how close at different points Moscow and Beijing have been in the past. But again, for I think that that's one of the things we need to start looking at.

They found that the top give issues that Americans has a whole are extremely concerned about are the obvious ones like inflation, the economic damages from COVID, supply chain problems, the deficit, and of course, illegal immigration. This lines up really well with the top concerns of the GOP voters. But not the Democrat voters, because their top five extreme worries include Trump supporters, white nationalism, climate change, and voter suppression. That's right, they are more worried about MAGA hat wearers than the potential for a job-crushing recession or rampant crime. So for them, police brutality is a far bigger worry than inflation. More of them see systemic racism as more of a serious threat than our crippling supply chain, our porous borders. This is a nightmare scenario for Democrats. They're caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place. On one side is their vicious, impatient grassroots itching for some type of socialist type revolution. On the other side, you have most Americans who just want to live in peace and freedom, maybe a fair shot at prosperity. That would be nice.

And Joe's spin doctor, Jen Psaki, said that he didn't have the time to get to everything? We would have sat there for three hours if he could have sustained for three hours, but sadly, Biden has never had time for these heroes. Remember when they returned home? Joe was checking his watch. And last night, he spent more time giving small business owners bad economic advice than honoring those 13 heroes."

But I saw that horrific story about that attacker in New York who smeared human feces on that woman and he just, the judge released him. I guess he's being looked at for a hate crime right now, but the judge said we can't hold you. Today, I thought that kind of is the whole -- that's just an image of today's Democrat Party, what they are doing to the American people. They are shoving it in our faces and then expecting a standing ovation at the end of it. Go on to do it again. We'll release you to do it again to us. And it is kind of an intemperate way of comparing the two, but it's an insult to the American people to do what he did last night, try to pretend you're an America first populist and a uniter when they have been trashing America for the last 14 months as racist and misogynist and every other \"ist\" you can think of. Give me a break."

He's the one who opened it. I've talked to the Border Patrol agents that just want to policy to be able to do their job. He said that Democrats support the police, but it is his party who defunded and demonized them for the past two years. He said he will be tough on Russia. But he is the one who has empowered Russia by increasing our reliance on their energy. The American people are on him, and they know that his career -- he is a career politician, and they are not falling for his lies any longer. And we need to stop funding Putin's war and become energy independent here in America."
