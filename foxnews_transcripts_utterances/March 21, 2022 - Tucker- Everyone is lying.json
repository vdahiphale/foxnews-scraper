      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT",
      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. One upside of the very sad war in Ukraine is the national conversation underway in this country about freedom and democracy. Those are words on everyone's lips, and so it set us off on a nationwide search for Americans who are living as if this were a free country, like it was, say 1989. And one of the first people we found we have to tell you is Kid Rock. We spent the weekend with him. We've got an interview with him in just a moment. But first tonight, what exactly is democracy? Well, pluralism is the hallmark of it. In a democracy, citizens can have any opinion they want to have. They can express any opinion they want in public whenever they care to express it, including through mass media. If citizens are dissatisfied with their political leadership, they can challenge their leaders for office. Now, all of these things are true in every free country, in any period -- always. These are not just features of democracy. These are prerequisites for democracy. So with that in mind, you should know about a political party in Ukraine called Opposition Platform for Life. With 43 seats in Parliament, it is the largest opposition party in that country. Over the weekend, the President of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned that party. Opposition Platform for Life is now prohibited from quote \"all activity within Ukraine.\" So with a single command, Zelenskyy made it impossible for anybody to run against him for President. He did this not just to Opposition Platform for Life, but to 10 other political parties that he believed are insufficiently loyal to him. They're all illegal now. Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law. We must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine. Opposition Platform for Life, for example, denounced the Russian invasion the moment it happened, just like everybody else. But Zelenskyy took the opportunity to turn Ukraine into effectively a one-party state, which it now is. So having banned all opposition, he then seized control of the country's media outlets. Zelenskyy signed a decree that combines all national television channels into a single platform that he controls. He described this as a quote, \"unified information policy,\" and it certainly is unified. So if all of these details seem shocking to you, if this is not the Zelenskyy you've heard about on the \"Today\" show, then you may not have been paying attention to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been solidifying complete control over Ukraine for a long time, since long before the Russian invasion and the war. Last year, he had his main political opponent arrested, and his assets seized by the state. At the same time, Zelenskyy shut down three of Ukraine's most popular television networks, channels that coincidentally, had criticized him. So how should we, as Americans assess this? Well, first and most obviously, by admitting this is authoritarianism, it is not democracy. And then second, by acknowledging that actually, it is pretty common around the world. Even in 2022, real democracy is a rare thing anywhere. Most countries are still governed by some variety of dictatorship, whatever they may call it, and that includes close American allies -- the Kingdoms of Jordan and Saudi Arabia come to mind, but there are others. We are not moralizing about this, by the way. Obviously, we'd prefer democracy everywhere in every country. But as Americans, it is probably a waste of time to get too involved in the internal affairs of other countries. They are hard to change. What we care about what all Americans should care about is what happens here in the United States. The United States is, despite the fact it is also a bumper sticker doesn't make it untrue, is a beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world. How do we maintain that inspiring position? Not simply by sending people missiles, but by remaining free ourselves. The United States cannot be a beacon of freedom, of light in the world, if we are not free. So that is the first thing we do if we want to inspire and change the world -- Ukraine included -- is make sure that we stay free. And with that concern in mind, you should be very worried by your leaders' response to what's happening in Ukraine, the growing dictatorship there, and that that's the word for it. What's another word for it? If you have ideas, send it to us. On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar, and \"Atlantic\" Magazine pundit, David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim quote, \"Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that under the pressure of war is becoming more tolerant and more liberal.\" Right. So when you outlaw all criticism of yourself, that's called tolerance. It's called democracy, but don't take the word of a single Canadian warmonger propagandist. David Frum is hardly alone in telling you that, all of Washington is telling you that. Watch.",

      "sentences": "These people. So the man who just declared himself king is actually the world's newest George Washington, okay. Now, you can be deeply concerned and deeply saddened, outraged, by what is happening to Ukrainians without saying things like that. Because it's absurd, it is a lie. That's the word from Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Republican. And again, on one level, you can understand why people are whipped into an emotional frenzy when they talk about Ukraine. Why wouldn't they be? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was shocking. It was wrong. The suffering of civilians there is entirely real. We're watching that on TV. It's horrifying. So it is entirely natural to root for the Ukrainians to expel the invaders, and obviously, we are rooting for them to expel the invaders, Russia. But just because what Russia has done in Ukraine was wrong, doesn't mean you have to lie about the Ukrainian government. In fact, if you really cared about the Ukrainian people, and all the people you just saw on TV, \"We care so much,\" you wouldn't want them to live under a dictator. So you would be highly upset about what Zelenskyy just did. But our leaders are not upset in the slightest. They are cheering it on, even when they know better. So some of them are just too dumb to know, but some of them do know, Michael McFaul, for example. He is Barack Obama's Ambassador to Russia, unlike shallow gas bags like Dick Durbin or Ben Sasse, McFaul actually understands Eastern Europe, he has lived there. He knows exactly who Zelenskyy is and exactly what he is doing. So here is his assessment of the Ukrainian government, not the people, the government, as of this afternoon, quote: \"If Zelenskyy remains in power, Ukrainian democracy is preserved.\" Like that guy teaches at Stanford, but that's not true. So again, Ukraine was invaded by its neighbors, and we oppose that, we should oppose that. But that doesn't mean Ukraine is a democracy. It's not. And we shouldn't tell Americans it is because that's a lie. We should tell the truth, but virtually no one is telling the truth. Everyone is lying. So why? Why is everyone like -- why not just say: Look, it's outrageous that Russia did this and we're going to -- we like Ukraine better? We're going to support Ukraine. Fine. Why go the extra step to tell us that Ukraine is a model democracy, when it's not at all? Why are they doing that? Maybe because Ukraine now is exactly the sort of democracy they'd like to see here in the United States. They hate to think that could be true, it's scary to think that's true. But ask yourself, play this word game. If they could find a, quote, \"national security\" pretext for it, a war, for example, do you think Adam Schiff and Kamala Harris or Mitch McConnell would pause for even a second before banning their political opponents for running from office in this country? Do you think they would hesitate before pulling this show off the air forever? No. Of course not. They'd do it in a flash. Then they'd call it democracy. So maybe you're starting to -- these people love Zelenskyy not because he represents the Ukrainian people. But because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint. Maybe that's what's going on. It seems kind of obvious when you think about it. Now, of course, we pray, they never have the power to do any of that in this country, the last free country in the world, we should not let them do that because freedom in America is not just important to us, our children, and grandchildren, it is important to the globe. Again, we are the last free country and we must remain free. But in the meantime, a war is being waged in America's name, with our money, so it is fair to ask how the side we are backing is doing? Clearly, there are an awful lot of heroic Ukrainian citizens. We see them all the time on television, we applaud them, we admire them. But how is the government doing? How is it behaving? Again, we have a right to know, even if state controlled media in Ukraine won't report it, even if our sort of state controlled media here downplays it, dismisses it. Here is a man called Gennadiy Druzenko. Druzenko was a medic in charge of a field hospital in Ukraine. He has appeared on CNN. In this clip, he casually announces that he has ordered the castration of captured Russian soldiers. Watch.",

      "sentences": "\"Cockroaches, not people.\" Now again, that doesn't mean the broader Ukrainian cause is unjust, it is just. They were invaded. They have a right to fight back and expel the Russians from their country. And for the fifth time, we're rooting for that. But we're paying for this, so we have a right to know exactly what's happening. We have an absolute right to know. In fact, we have a constitutional right to free media. We don't have that. That video, by the way disappeared. People on the internet managed to get a copy of it. You may hear it dismissed as Russian propaganda just like Hunter Biden's laptop was or the 2016 presidential election results in this country were, but it is not Russian propaganda. It's real. The man you just saw speaking has confirmed the video is authentic. He apologized for it. So murdering POWs is a war crime, so is castrating them. We're not shocked by this. This happens in a lot of countries, Ukraine is not unique. Atrocities happen during war, every war, always, no matter what the neocons may tell you. But this is a war that we are paying for. This is a war with moral implications. This is a war the White House is involved in at every level. So when the Ukrainian government does something, we have an interest in knowing exactly what it is and what it means. But more than anything, we have an overriding interest and a moral obligation to keep the United States free. So when you see them admire someone who is shutting down any opposition to him, you should pause. Maajid Nawaz is one of the bravest people on Twitter, relentlessly telling the truth no matter what the response is, doubtless will be bounced off of there at some point. But in the meantime, he's by the way, a broadcaster and a journalist. We're grateful to have him join us. Thank you so much for coming.",

I have criticized Putin, probably to a wider audience than many of my critics today have done so, and that's for Putin.

That's different to why we, on principle would support the Ukrainian people. But ultimately, we've got to ask this question that you've got a country led by a man who even before the war, AXIOS, \"The Guardian,\" The Atlantic Council, all of them were reporting that Zelenskyy, even though he ran on an anti-corruption ticket has through the Panama Papers and other such leaks have stashed his millions offshore like most corrupt oligarchs have. And so even before the war, his corruption was known, and then you fast forward to what he has done over this weekend with the banning of 11 opposition parties. And I know at this stage that he banned these opposition parties, including, as you mentioned, Tucker, the second largest in his Parliament, while the Nazi elements and I use the word Nazi, not neo Nazi, because these are actual Nazis that aren't neo in any sense. They are the continuation of Nazis as we know them, and study them in history. And Bandera, the man that they revere was actually a Nazi, and they made him into a national hero and icon. The Nazis in Ukraine have not been banned by Zelenskyy. And so, this is a very interesting point that you've got a man that we are hailing as a democratic icon who is fighting for freedom and democracy and our way of life, banning all opposition parties controlling through the state the media narrative, while refusing not only to ban Nazis, but having after not banning them, incorporated them into his state, as of as a battalion, formerly serves in the Ukrainian National Guard. Now, people say to that, in response, you know, but Maajid, there are racists in every country. No, the analogy here is imagine, Tucker, in America, the KKK had a formal battalion in the U.S. military. That's what we've got with swastikas and Nazi insignia inside the Ukrainian army and then people would say, well, what do you want to do? They invaded -- Putin invaded their country, of course, they have to fight. I find this line of argument absolutely absurd, because the best analogy is with Syria. Now, Putin did -- allying with Nazis in Ukraine to defeat Putin is as absurd as allying with ISIS in Syria to defeat Putin. You've got an extremist, an armed extreme terrorist militia known as ISIS. None of us ever had any more difficulty in understanding that Assad was a dictator, that Putin's support for Assad was wrong, but the people opposing him, the jihadists were also wrong. Why can't we have that moral complexity when it comes to Ukraine?",

It's a joke, but it's kind of true. In response to this Twitter on which no jokes are allowed, suspended \"Babylon Bee\" before hate speech. So per Twitter policy, when a man calls himself a woman, you have to pretend that person is telling the truth. The whole point of this is to get you to submit. They don't care whether Rachel Levine is a man or a woman. They care about humiliating you and making you accept what you know is not true. It's fascinating to watch it.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. One upside of the very sad war in Ukraine is the national conversation underway in this country about freedom and democracy. Those are words on everyone's lips, and so it set us off on a nationwide search for Americans who are living as if this were a free country, like it was, say 1989. And one of the first people we found we have to tell you is Kid Rock. We spent the weekend with him. We've got an interview with him in just a moment. But first tonight, what exactly is democracy? Well, pluralism is the hallmark of it. In a democracy, citizens can have any opinion they want to have. They can express any opinion they want in public whenever they care to express it, including through mass media. If citizens are dissatisfied with their political leadership, they can challenge their leaders for office. Now, all of these things are true in every free country, in any period -- always. These are not just features of democracy. These are prerequisites for democracy. So with that in mind, you should know about a political party in Ukraine called Opposition Platform for Life. With 43 seats in Parliament, it is the largest opposition party in that country. Over the weekend, the President of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy banned that party. Opposition Platform for Life is now prohibited from quote \"all activity within Ukraine.\" So with a single command, Zelenskyy made it impossible for anybody to run against him for President. He did this not just to Opposition Platform for Life, but to 10 other political parties that he believed are insufficiently loyal to him. They're all illegal now. Obviously, there's a war underway in Ukraine and on that basis, Zelenskyy has declared martial law. We must tell you, there is no evidence that the opposition parties he banned were aiding Russia in its war against Ukraine. Opposition Platform for Life, for example, denounced the Russian invasion the moment it happened, just like everybody else. But Zelenskyy took the opportunity to turn Ukraine into effectively a one-party state, which it now is. So having banned all opposition, he then seized control of the country's media outlets. Zelenskyy signed a decree that combines all national television channels into a single platform that he controls. He described this as a quote, \"unified information policy,\" and it certainly is unified. So if all of these details seem shocking to you, if this is not the Zelenskyy you've heard about on the \"Today\" show, then you may not have been paying attention to Ukraine. Zelenskyy has been solidifying complete control over Ukraine for a long time, since long before the Russian invasion and the war. Last year, he had his main political opponent arrested, and his assets seized by the state. At the same time, Zelenskyy shut down three of Ukraine's most popular television networks, channels that coincidentally, had criticized him. So how should we, as Americans assess this? Well, first and most obviously, by admitting this is authoritarianism, it is not democracy. And then second, by acknowledging that actually, it is pretty common around the world. Even in 2022, real democracy is a rare thing anywhere. Most countries are still governed by some variety of dictatorship, whatever they may call it, and that includes close American allies -- the Kingdoms of Jordan and Saudi Arabia come to mind, but there are others. We are not moralizing about this, by the way. Obviously, we'd prefer democracy everywhere in every country. But as Americans, it is probably a waste of time to get too involved in the internal affairs of other countries. They are hard to change. What we care about what all Americans should care about is what happens here in the United States. The United States is, despite the fact it is also a bumper sticker doesn't make it untrue, is a beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world. How do we maintain that inspiring position? Not simply by sending people missiles, but by remaining free ourselves. The United States cannot be a beacon of freedom, of light in the world, if we are not free. So that is the first thing we do if we want to inspire and change the world -- Ukraine included -- is make sure that we stay free. And with that concern in mind, you should be very worried by your leaders' response to what's happening in Ukraine, the growing dictatorship there, and that that's the word for it. What's another word for it? If you have ideas, send it to us. On the very same day that Zelenskyy shut down opposition media and all opposition political parties, professional liar, and \"Atlantic\" Magazine pundit, David Frum posted this on Twitter verbatim quote, \"Ukraine may be the first example in human history of a country that under the pressure of war is becoming more tolerant and more liberal.\" Right. So when you outlaw all criticism of yourself, that's called tolerance. It's called democracy, but don't take the word of a single Canadian warmonger propagandist. David Frum is hardly alone in telling you that, all of Washington is telling you that. Watch."

Now, you can be deeply concerned and deeply saddened, outraged, by what is happening to Ukrainians without saying things like that. Because it's absurd, it is a lie. That's the word from Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Republican. And again, on one level, you can understand why people are whipped into an emotional frenzy when they talk about Ukraine. Why wouldn't they be? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was shocking. It was wrong. The suffering of civilians there is entirely real. We're watching that on TV. It's horrifying. So it is entirely natural to root for the Ukrainians to expel the invaders, and obviously, we are rooting for them to expel the invaders, Russia. But just because what Russia has done in Ukraine was wrong, doesn't mean you have to lie about the Ukrainian government. In fact, if you really cared about the Ukrainian people, and all the people you just saw on TV, \"We care so much,\" you wouldn't want them to live under a dictator. So you would be highly upset about what Zelenskyy just did. But our leaders are not upset in the slightest. They are cheering it on, even when they know better. So some of them are just too dumb to know, but some of them do know, Michael McFaul, for example. He is Barack Obama's Ambassador to Russia, unlike shallow gas bags like Dick Durbin or Ben Sasse, McFaul actually understands Eastern Europe, he has lived there. He knows exactly who Zelenskyy is and exactly what he is doing."

So again, Ukraine was invaded by its neighbors, and we oppose that, we should oppose that. But that doesn't mean Ukraine is a democracy. It's not. And we shouldn't tell Americans it is because that's a lie. We should tell the truth, but virtually no one is telling the truth. Everyone is lying. So why?"

      "speaker": "Why is everyone like -- why not just say",
      "utterance": "Look, it's outrageous that Russia did this and we're going to -- we like Ukraine better? We're going to support Ukraine. Fine. Why go the extra step to tell us that Ukraine is a model democracy, when it's not at all? Why are they doing that? Maybe because Ukraine now is exactly the sort of democracy they'd like to see here in the United States. They hate to think that could be true, it's scary to think that's true. But ask yourself, play this word game. If they could find a, quote, \"national security\" pretext for it, a war, for example, do you think Adam Schiff and Kamala Harris or Mitch McConnell would pause for even a second before banning their political opponents for running from office in this country? Do you think they would hesitate before pulling this show off the air forever? No. Of course not. They'd do it in a flash. Then they'd call it democracy. So maybe you're starting to -- these people love Zelenskyy not because he represents the Ukrainian people. But because Zelenskyy is exactly the leader they would like to be with wildly expanded war powers to make everyone who complains shut up at gunpoint. Maybe that's what's going on. It seems kind of obvious when you think about it. Now, of course, we pray, they never have the power to do any of that in this country, the last free country in the world, we should not let them do that because freedom in America is not just important to us, our children, and grandchildren, it is important to the globe. Again, we are the last free country and we must remain free. But in the meantime, a war is being waged in America's name, with our money, so it is fair to ask how the side we are backing is doing? Clearly, there are an awful lot of heroic Ukrainian citizens. We see them all the time on television, we applaud them, we admire them. But how is the government doing? How is it behaving? Again, we have a right to know, even if state controlled media in Ukraine won't report it, even if our sort of state controlled media here downplays it, dismisses it. Here is a man called Gennadiy Druzenko. Druzenko was a medic in charge of a field hospital in Ukraine. He has appeared on CNN. In this clip, he casually announces that he has ordered the castration of captured Russian soldiers. Watch."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"Cockroaches, not people.\" Now again, that doesn't mean the broader Ukrainian cause is unjust, it is just. They were invaded. They have a right to fight back and expel the Russians from their country. And for the fifth time, we're rooting for that. But we're paying for this, so we have a right to know exactly what's happening. We have an absolute right to know. In fact, we have a constitutional right to free media. We don't have that. That video, by the way disappeared. People on the internet managed to get a copy of it. You may hear it dismissed as Russian propaganda just like Hunter Biden's laptop was or the 2016 presidential election results in this country were, but it is not Russian propaganda. It's real. The man you just saw speaking has confirmed the video is authentic. He apologized for it. So murdering POWs is a war crime, so is castrating them. We're not shocked by this. This happens in a lot of countries, Ukraine is not unique. Atrocities happen during war, every war, always, no matter what the neocons may tell you. But this is a war that we are paying for. This is a war with moral implications. This is a war the White House is involved in at every level. So when the Ukrainian government does something, we have an interest in knowing exactly what it is and what it means. But more than anything, we have an overriding interest and a moral obligation to keep the United States free. So when you see them admire someone who is shutting down any opposition to him, you should pause. Maajid Nawaz is one of the bravest people on Twitter, relentlessly telling the truth no matter what the response is, doubtless will be bounced off of there at some point.

I have criticized Putin, probably to a wider audience than many of my critics today have done so, and that's for Putin. But that is very different to what I think is happening in Ukraine, as you touched on, and where I stand on that. And I think, actually, we're being led down the garden path. We are being pressured through intense propaganda led by our governments not to question what is going on, and to see this in purely good versus evil, in Manichaean terms, and to accuse anybody that tries to look at the gray in between as being somehow a Putin apologist."

      "utterance": "Well, exactly and I think first of all, I don't think it is a war on principle when it comes to the reason our governments are involved. That's different to why we, on principle would support the Ukrainian people. But ultimately, we've got to ask this question that you've got a country led by a man who even before the war, AXIOS, \"The Guardian,\" The Atlantic Council, all of them were reporting that Zelenskyy, even though he ran on an anti-corruption ticket has through the Panama Papers and other such leaks have stashed his millions offshore like most corrupt oligarchs have. And so even before the war, his corruption was known, and then you fast forward to what he has done over this weekend with the banning of 11 opposition parties. And I know at this stage that he banned these opposition parties, including, as you mentioned, Tucker, the second largest in his Parliament, while the Nazi elements and I use the word Nazi, not neo Nazi, because these are actual Nazis that aren't neo in any sense. They are the continuation of Nazis as we know them, and study them in history. And Bandera, the man that they revere was actually a Nazi, and they made him into a national hero and icon. The Nazis in Ukraine have not been banned by Zelenskyy. And so, this is a very interesting point that you've got a man that we are hailing as a democratic icon who is fighting for freedom and democracy and our way of life, banning all opposition parties controlling through the state the media narrative, while refusing not only to ban Nazis, but having after not banning them, incorporated them into his state, as of as a battalion, formerly serves in the Ukrainian National Guard. Now, people say to that, in response, you know, but Maajid, there are racists in every country. No, the analogy here is imagine, Tucker, in America, the KKK had a formal battalion in the U.S. military. That's what we've got with swastikas and Nazi insignia inside the Ukrainian army and then people would say, well, what do you want to do? They invaded -- Putin invaded their country, of course, they have to fight. I find this line of argument absolutely absurd, because the best analogy is with Syria. Now, Putin did -- allying with Nazis in Ukraine to defeat Putin is as absurd as allying with ISIS in Syria to defeat Putin. You've got an extremist, an armed extreme terrorist militia known as ISIS. None of us ever had any more difficulty in understanding that Assad was a dictator, that Putin's support for Assad was wrong, but the people opposing him, the jihadists were also wrong. Why can't we have that moral complexity when it comes to Ukraine?"

So it was a fascinating experience spending a couple of days with Kid Rock on his property in Tennessee. All for a documentary we are making for the \"Tucker Carlson Original\" series coming out this summer. It's going to be good. So, as we look to Eastern Europe to bring freedom, Twitter just suspended \"Babylon Bee\" for a satirical headline about Joe Biden's Assistant Secretary for Health, Rachel Levine. Apparently, it's now hate speech to acknowledge that Rachel Levine is biologically a man, which is true. They've banned it. We will talk to the head of \"Babylon Bee\" next."

But you have to call me a woman or else you're a hater, not fine. In October, because almost everything happening at this point is almost beyond parody, on the basis of that claim \"I'm a woman,\" of course not a woman, Joe Biden made Rachel Levine an Admiral in something called the Public Health Service. Watch."

But when you get up on stage and say something that everyone knows is untrue and then demand that we believe it, you degrade the rest of us. It's outrageous, actually, and not everyone wants to play along. So this person is now an Admiral. To memorialize the moment, the \"Babylon Bee\" named Rachel Levine, their Man of the Year. It's a joke, but it's kind of true. In response to this Twitter on which no jokes are allowed, suspended \"Babylon Bee\" before hate speech. So per Twitter policy, when a man calls himself a woman, you have to pretend that person is telling the truth. The whole point of this is to get you to submit. They don't care whether Rachel Levine is a man or a woman. They care about humiliating you and making you accept what you know is not true. It's fascinating to watch it. As Jim Treacher put it today on his brilliant \"Substack,\" quote: We finally figured out how to trick feminists into defending men.\" It is just so smart. Anyway, to its credit, the \"Babylon Bee\" is not backing down. Seth Dillon is the hero CEO of the \"Babylon Bee\". And we're happy to have him join us tonight. Seth, they are demanding that -- I mean, this is part of your business, I should say. It's not like most people tweeting, this is like important that you can get your stuff out by Twitter, they're going to keep it down until you delete the tweet, are you? SETH DILLON, CEO, \"BABYLON BEE\": No, we're not. I mean, it's like asking us to say that two and two make five. And so we're sitting there looking at this email that tells us in order to reinstate our account and get access to be able to tweet again, we've got to delete this tweet. And the tweet is a joke, that's the first thing to get straight here. This is satire, it's just a joke. It's pretty harmless. And it's certainly not hurting anybody. And this is a public official, you know, it's not like we're like punching down at some downtrodden person. So you know, it's just a joke. And they're asking us to basically bend the knee and say, we admit that this is hateful conduct, please keep us on your platform and we're not going to do that. And so we don't know where this ends, you know, there's an appeal process that we can go through. But we're not going to delete the tweet."

It's not like we're some fringe group that has some outrageous idea that nobody accepts, you know, this is the case where somebody is telling us look, you know, the word was even used female like female is a reference to your biological sex.
