I think there is some agreement by giving the states more money, and that's because the states are just -- their coffers have run dry. They are not getting the tax revenue they need and they are facing catastrophic budget shortfalls. I think that's possible. And there's also a desire on each side to get some things they want. For example, the president wants a payroll tax cut, maybe capital gains relief, other measures that would be incentives for businesses to get going again and get the economy going again. And so as they say in Washington here, if there is a will, there's a way. There is some will to do this. It won't be what Nancy Pelosi put forward, that's a $3 trillion marker she put down, but she may get a little bit of that because there may be negotiations eventually. I think this really does, as Republicans have said, need to play out for a couple of weeks to see with the need is. I am not sure -- my sense is that Republicans are not entirely sure what they need yet, what the needs are. That is going to drive a lot of this. So when Senator Kennedy says less than 50 percent, I think it all depends.

And Joe Biden is someone who looks like he cannot handle the job. That's a very powerful message to send to voters right now when America is facing this pandemic and depression era unemployment, an economy that has just crashed to the ground. So that's a great strategy for the president to use on Biden. But again, as Jonathan was saying, we are nowhere near October yet. It's so uncertain. Once Biden gets out of the basement and is out of their campaigning, everything is going to change. It could look worse for him if he's not able to recover, or he could actually start looking better if he gets some of his mojo back and looks better on the campaign trail.",

Now, Rice is pushing back against allegations the national security team improperly handled concerns they had about President Trump's incoming NSA. In a statement to Fox News, a spokesperson for Ambassador Rice, says that she was directed to write that January 20th, 2017 e-mail. As has been previously documented by Rice's attorney, she wrote this memorandum in response to a request from White House Counsel. Rice's spokesperson insists the Obama team had legitimate counterintelligence concerns about Flynn's communications with Russia, including the number of interactions he had with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. In her e-mail, Rice writes, \"President Obama said he wants to be sure that as we engage with the incoming team, were mindful to ascertain if there's any reason that we cannot share information fully.\" But Rice's spokesperson insists those concerns didn't impact their efforts to share information with Flynn. \"Ambassador Rice briefed Michael Flynn for over 12 hours, and led the NSC in preparing and delivering to him over 100 separate briefing memos.\" Yesterday, acting Intel Chief Ric Grinell declassified Rice's top-secret e- mail.

Scientists are using a telescope in Chile to observe a huge disk of dense gas and dust surrounding a newly formed star about 520 light-years from Earth. Astronomers believe the object is a large gas planet about as far away from its star, as Neptune is from Mars. Up next, what Joe Biden says he will not do if elected president? First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. A powerful cyclone tears into eastern India and Bangladesh, destroying mud houses and embankments, whipping up a storm surge along the coast. Millions of people there have been moved out of its path. At least, seven people so far have been killed. Gunmen killed 14 people in two separate attacks in Afghanistan today. Officials also said the Taliban targeted pro-government checkpoints in the northeast, killing nine militiamen. The U.S. envoy to the region has begun another round of talks with the Taliban to press them to start negotiating with the newly reconciled Afghan political leadership. An Israeli court is ordering Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to appear for the opening of his criminal trial in Jerusalem Sunday. Netanyahu's attorneys have argued his presence is not essential for the arraignment. The prime minister faces charges of fraud breach of trust and accepting bribes. He denies any wrongdoing. A new research suggests, Antarctica is going green -- sort of. The British study says algae blooms assisted by warming temperatures there are becoming so prolific, they are even visible from space. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back."

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": He sure was, and he has a right to be. When you go back and you listen to what all of the dire predictions that we heard about Florida going back several months now. But throughout this entire thing, we have seen -- I feel like the media more than anybody, more than any politician, has come up with egg on their face considering the politicized nature with which they have covered this, the way they cover an awful lot of things.

SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, they could start in the coming weeks, and I think there have been preliminary talks. I think there is some agreement by giving the states more money, and that's because the states are just -- their coffers have run dry. They are not getting the tax revenue they need and they are facing catastrophic budget shortfalls. I think that's possible. And there's also a desire on each side to get some things they want. For example, the president wants a payroll tax cut, maybe capital gains relief, other measures that would be incentives for businesses to get going again and get the economy going again. And so as they say in Washington here, if there is a will, there's a way. There is some will to do this. It won't be what Nancy Pelosi put forward, that's a $3 trillion marker she put down, but she may get a little bit of that because there may be negotiations eventually. I think this really does, as Republicans have said, need to play out for a couple of weeks to see with the need is. I am not sure -- my sense is that Republicans are not entirely sure what they need yet, what the needs are. That is going to drive a lot of this. So when Senator Kennedy says less than 50 percent, I think it all depends. Maybe right now that is the case, but as we move forward and you see the needs developing and you watch the economy and see what may be needed there, it will really motivate Republicans to get to the table and try to work out a deal with Democrats."

Certainly, Susan Rice is somebody that the administration sent out repeatedly to push a line for the administration that turned out not to be true. We saw that with the Benghazi situation, and of course, we saw that in the aftermath of all of this.

And if you look at battleground states, again, this is the average of polls, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina, where you see Donald Trump with a lead. There are other polls, including a CNN poll that showed Donald Trump with a bigger lead in some of those battlegrounds. Again, these are the average of recent polls. We're back with the panel.

You have -- President Trump hasn't actually started to really go after Biden, his campaign hasn't really started to nuke him yet. The last couple of weeks they have just started. So I think now is actually a peculiarly awful time to try and draw larger conclusions about this race. I think we will know much more in September, October, particularly whether the economy has gotten back on a decent trajectory, and also whether there has been a second wave of the virus and what the severity of that second wave is."

And Joe Biden is someone who looks like he cannot handle the job. That's a very powerful message to send to voters right now when America is facing this pandemic and depression era unemployment, an economy that has just crashed to the ground. So that's a great strategy for the president to use on Biden. But again, as Jonathan was saying, we are nowhere near October yet. It's so uncertain. Once Biden gets out of the basement and is out of their campaigning, everything is going to change. It could look worse for him if he's not able to recover, or he could actually start looking better if he gets some of his mojo back and looks better on the campaign trail."
