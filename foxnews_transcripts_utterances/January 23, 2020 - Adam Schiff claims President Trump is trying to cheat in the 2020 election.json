And yes, we've established the hypocrisy is well at hand. People who had one position in 1999 have a different position now. And if the shoes were on the other feet, then we know what would happen. I do want to mention one thing. Adam Schiff and his cohorts there have continued to use this phrase that the president was trying to cheat in an election. The Republicans, when they had a chance on opening statements on Tuesday, repeated several times that the Democrats are trying to steal an election. So I'm just wondering, if you are at home, and cheating and stealing an election and it gets to be a little bit confusing. And I think the numbers show that. The ratings are not great for all of this. People are sort of paying attention, not much. People are pretty tribal on it. They've heard this for this for a long time.

And in fact, I think this is the heart of the matter that you heard presented by Adam Schiff yesterday that you can't just say that this is about something that happened in the past. The president persistently saying it was a perfect call. There is nothing wrong, he's told interviews, with seeking a foreign country to intervene in our election to his benefit. That's the way he's -- so what you heard from Adam Schiff yesterday was literally saying, you know, we have to be aware. This is an ongoing issue. But I think the big story, to my mind -- by the way, I think the ratings numbers have been surprisingly good for something that is taking place largely in the middle of the day. You know, people are paying attention. Maybe it's not a sensation. You know, it's not pro-wrestling. But you know what? For something as serious and as requiring of attention as this, I think it's pretty good. But I think the big news here over the last two days is Republicans said, hey, why do we need witnesses if Democrats say they've made a compelling case with their two articles of impeachment? And what we have seen from Schiff yesterday, which even Republicans like Lindsey Graham said was a very good job. And now, today, from Jerry Nadler and Sylvia Garcia, are just compelling narratives about why this president, in fact, on the basis of facts and evidence, deserves to be impeached.",

Adam Schiff and all of the other impeachment managers from the House on the Democrats have had the luxury this week to talk for hours on end without being contested by anyone, without being questioned like we see in regular Senate hearings. So they can really say whatever they want and call it facts when there is a rebuttal coming that we are waiting for from the White House. But on the Hunter Biden narrative, it's been made, the argument that President Trump is simply going after Hunter Biden or Joe Biden because they wanted to score political points or gain some kind of advantage in the election. The White House has repeatedly argued it was about corruption. And the argument has been that it's only President Trump. Well, the Obama White House also had very serious questions about Hunter Biden's position on the Burisma board, while Vice President Joe Biden has the Ukraine portfolio and was working on foreign policy. State Department officials who testified as Democrat witnesses -- we're hearing a lot about witnesses, that record has been entered into the Senate for everyone to see that they have repeatedly said that Burisma was a problem. It was notoriously corrupt and they were very serious questions about why Joe Biden's son was earning a lot of money at the same time that there was a conflict of interest in the White House while he was running foreign policy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Did you notice that they were already showing videos that they showed yesterday? So they are already into their summer reruns. And -- but it doesn't matter because all they are trying to do is fill space. This is basically so far a three day campaign ad against Trump. And it would be -- this would be a great time for the news to actually do the fact-checking, to say Adam Schiff is saying this because -- the reason why people say Adam Schiff sucks and Adam Schiff did a great job is because Adam Schiff is presenting opinions. And so people can disagree with the opinion say he's bad. And people who agree with his opinion say he is dazzling. So we know it is all opinion. The problem is we have all these fact- checkers and amazing journalists, and they are just overloaded with Adam Schiff that they can't fact-check what he is doing. So instead, what did they do? They discuss his performance. Not the content, but the performance. Oh, he really laid it out there. What do you mean? Tell me. Did you tell me -- can you tell me what he laid out and whether or not it was true or false? The most telling moment was that sound on tape that you played when Schiff said impeachment is necessary because we can't count on 2020 being a legitimate election. So think about that. He is saying that impeachment, as a process, is a process is superior to an election. Not just past ones in 2016, but future ones, OK? So it's not -- so what he is basically saying is that anybody can do this. And he is saying this to prevent a future event. This is a figment in his brain. It's not even real. He is saying the 2020 election cannot be trusted. The 2020 election has not even happened yet. So we have seen this before with the media and the Democrats. Their arguments are always about the future, because the reality is so different than what they experienced. The reality in the United States is great, the economy, the stock market, we have peace and prosperity. So they have to look ahead and predict the apocalypse in order to somehow keep Trump in their crosshairs. But it's not about -- they know it is going to be acquitted, right? They know he is not going to be impeached. So we know -- we all know it's not about impeachment. It's about wounding. This thing is actually effective because it's wounding him so that it will be a bother and it will be a burden for him come election. So they already know they are not going to impeach the guy.

In America, the way due process works is the burden of witnesses, it falls -- not the burden, but the side of fairness of witnesses falls on the defendant. The defendant is the one who gets to decide on witnesses. Not the prosecutors. And now, at this point, Democrats have a long history of throwing due process out the window, whether it's Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump on impeachment. They have a guilty -- prove now before -- to prove your innocence attitude. And they keep saying this is an unfair trial to the Democrats. It's not about the Democrats.

Well first off, he just revealed the entire anti- Trump platform with, quote, \"You know exactly what they are thinking.\" The last few years of panic have been brought on by the media believing they can mind read, which allows them to conclude the worst intentions in any act.

And yes, we've established the hypocrisy is well at hand. People who had one position in 1999 have a different position now. And if the shoes were on the other feet, then we know what would happen. I do want to mention one thing. Adam Schiff and his cohorts there have continued to use this phrase that the president was trying to cheat in an election. The Republicans, when they had a chance on opening statements on Tuesday, repeated several times that the Democrats are trying to steal an election. So I'm just wondering, if you are at home, and cheating and stealing an election and it gets to be a little bit confusing. And I think the numbers show that. The ratings are not great for all of this. People are sort of paying attention, not much. People are pretty tribal on it. They've heard this for this for a long time. And I talked to a House Democrat who said they think Adam Schiff did a great job, but they also know that this is going nowhere and they would like to get back to business."

And in fact, I think this is the heart of the matter that you heard presented by Adam Schiff yesterday that you can't just say that this is about something that happened in the past. The president persistently saying it was a perfect call. There is nothing wrong, he's told interviews, with seeking a foreign country to intervene in our election to his benefit. That's the way he's -- so what you heard from Adam Schiff yesterday was literally saying, you know, we have to be aware. This is an ongoing issue. But I think the big story, to my mind -- by the way, I think the ratings numbers have been surprisingly good for something that is taking place largely in the middle of the day. You know, people are paying attention. Maybe it's not a sensation. You know, it's not pro-wrestling. But you know what? For something as serious and as requiring of attention as this, I think it's pretty good. But I think the big news here over the last two days is Republicans said, hey, why do we need witnesses if Democrats say they've made a compelling case with their two articles of impeachment? And what we have seen from Schiff yesterday, which even Republicans like Lindsey Graham said was a very good job. And now, today, from Jerry Nadler and Sylvia Garcia, are just compelling narratives about why this president, in fact, on the basis of facts and evidence, deserves to be impeached."

Adam Schiff and all of the other impeachment managers from the House on the Democrats have had the luxury this week to talk for hours on end without being contested by anyone, without being questioned like we see in regular Senate hearings. So they can really say whatever they want and call it facts when there is a rebuttal coming that we are waiting for from the White House. But on the Hunter Biden narrative, it's been made, the argument that President Trump is simply going after Hunter Biden or Joe Biden because they wanted to score political points or gain some kind of advantage in the election. The White House has repeatedly argued it was about corruption. And the argument has been that it's only President Trump. Well, the Obama White House also had very serious questions about Hunter Biden's position on the Burisma board, while Vice President Joe Biden has the Ukraine portfolio and was working on foreign policy. State Department officials who testified as Democrat witnesses -- we're hearing a lot about witnesses, that record has been entered into the Senate for everyone to see that they have repeatedly said that Burisma was a problem. It was notoriously corrupt and they were very serious questions about why Joe Biden's son was earning a lot of money at the same time that there was a conflict of interest in the White House while he was running foreign policy."

      "utterance": "Yeah. You started this segment by saying you are looking live at the Senate floor. No, you are looking dead. Did you notice that they were already showing videos that they showed yesterday? So they are already into their summer reruns. And -- but it doesn't matter because all they are trying to do is fill space. This is basically so far a three day campaign ad against Trump. And it would be -- this would be a great time for the news to actually do the fact-checking, to say Adam Schiff is saying this because -- the reason why people say Adam Schiff sucks and Adam Schiff did a great job is because Adam Schiff is presenting opinions. And so people can disagree with the opinion say he's bad. And people who agree with his opinion say he is dazzling. So we know it is all opinion. The problem is we have all these fact- checkers and amazing journalists, and they are just overloaded with Adam Schiff that they can't fact-check what he is doing. So instead, what did they do? They discuss his performance. Not the content, but the performance. Oh, he really laid it out there. What do you mean? Tell me. Did you tell me -- can you tell me what he laid out and whether or not it was true or false? The most telling moment was that sound on tape that you played when Schiff said impeachment is necessary because we can't count on 2020 being a legitimate election. So think about that. He is saying that impeachment, as a process, is a process is superior to an election. Not just past ones in 2016, but future ones, OK? So it's not -- so what he is basically saying is that anybody can do this. And he is saying this to prevent a future event. This is a figment in his brain. It's not even real. He is saying the 2020 election cannot be trusted. The 2020 election has not even happened yet. So we have seen this before with the media and the Democrats. Their arguments are always about the future, because the reality is so different than what they experienced. The reality in the United States is great, the economy, the stock market, we have peace and prosperity. So they have to look ahead and predict the apocalypse in order to somehow keep Trump in their crosshairs. But it's not about -- they know it is going to be acquitted, right? They know he is not going to be impeached. So we know -- we all know it's not about impeachment. It's about wounding. This thing is actually effective because it's wounding him so that it will be a bother and it will be a burden for him come election. So they already know they are not going to impeach the guy. But they do know that this is something that will be stuck on him until the election."

And I can even just imagine that this is going to go both ways, right? That Republicans will do the same. I just think that the Democrats that they're already sending mixed signals about witnesses, because they're like we want these witnesses, not these witnesses. I predict that there will be no witnesses. I think the Republicans will say I think we've heard enough here. And you don't want to give us these witnesses. You are not interested in a fair trial, either. We are going to vote. We are going to be done here."

      "utterance": "They could. And we know where to find him. He's living in a $3.5 million home in the Hollywood Hills. So just knock on the door and you will find Hunter Biden where he is fighting paying child support to a woman who he got pregnant at a strip club where he also allegedly smoked crack at. I want to get into the mindset of a Democrat right now, because I've been listening to a lot of the testimony today. And I think I understand what they think Donald Trump did wrong. Just tell me if I have this right. OK, so Donald Trump comes in and asks the Ukrainians to investigate Hunter Biden, his corrupt company, and the role his father played in getting the prosecutor fired. Trump, you say, should've just handed over the millions of dollars without doing any due diligence, without ever establishing any trust with the Ukrainians. That is what you believe. Hand over the money. Don't ask any questions. So it could've been bad press for Joe Biden if this had happened with the investigation. And since he's running for president, this is foreign interference in the campaign. Do we have that right?"

So to your logic, Hunter Biden could've sat on boards of corrupt companies in corrupt countries all over the world and protected them from political prosecution and curried favor with the United States taxpayer for eight years while his father was VP. And then Donald Trump can come in and he can't ask a damn thing about this guy's son being involved in all these corrupt countries. That is your logic, OK? So is it the crime that he tied the aid to an investigation? Because the Democrats have put zero evidence and had zero witnesses testify that aid was linked to the investigation, or was it asking a foreigner to investigate an American, because if that's the crime then that is what Hillary did except she did more than ask. She paid for it."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "So two months before the July 25th phone call happened, a big story came out about Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma and whether he would be a problem to Joe Biden's campaign based on his long history of dealing in these situations where he didn't have a lot of experience, was getting paid a lot of money. On the phone call, to pick up where Jesse left off, the president asked about the firing of the prosecutor. He was asking about a government issue, a governmental issue which Joe Biden was dealing with while his son was on the board of Burisma. So that's the issue. But I want to get back to this issue of witnesses. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have no leg to stand on when it comes to this. In America, the way due process works is the burden of witnesses, it falls -- not the burden, but the side of fairness of witnesses falls on the defendant. The defendant is the one who gets to decide on witnesses. Not the prosecutors. And now, at this point, Democrats have a long history of throwing due process out the window, whether it's Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump on impeachment. They have a guilty -- prove now before -- to prove your innocence attitude. And they keep saying this is an unfair trial to the Democrats. It's not about the Democrats. It's about the person who is on trial. And in America, the fairness factor falls heavily on the side of the person being accused. And in this case, that is the president."

But the fact is -- and this is where my legal expertise comes in. Any time you're going to take the prosecutors advice or take his suggestion that makes them happy. And that is a bad sign. You want the prosecution to be upset with you. You want to put a fiery, aggressive defender. You want everybody to hate your lawyer, because that means your lawyer is doing a great job.

If half the stuff Schiff is saying is true, we are up bleep's creek. Hope the White House has exculpatory evidence.\" So after the tweet gained much praise, including from the Washington Post, barely inged (ph) Jennifer Rubin, Lockhart later added, quote, \"OK, maybe I made up the convo, but you know that is exactly what they are thinking.\" So why does this matter? Well first off, he just revealed the entire anti- Trump platform with, quote, \"You know exactly what they are thinking.\" The last few years of panic have been brought on by the media believing they can mind read, which allows them to conclude the worst intentions in any act. So they screamed for the 25th Amendment. They accused everyone of racism and openly demonize Trump supporters, because they know what is in everyone's heads. Yet, they are always wrong about reality. Maybe it is their ill-advised mind reading that leads to these predicted catastrophes that never, ever come, and that makes them even sadder and more nervous. Of course, Lockhart's lie got thousands of re-tweets and his mea culpa just a fraction, which is fine with him. The lie is what he believes. Will CNN admonish him for his fabrications? Not when they are busy with their own. So Dana, you remember Joe Lockhart. He was the press secretary under a Clinton, Bill Clinton during his infamous sex scandal. You were but a tot then.

Adam Schiff, at the beginning of the House Intel Committee Hearing, made up a whole phone conversation and has paid the price for it ever since.

And what did I say? People care more about this and they care about impeachment. The ratings are in. 2.3 million watch this game. And that outscored CNN big time."

As a team, they won first place on rapid response, active shooter, vertical assault, and a bunch of their teammates won -- one of them on first place and pistol shooting, third in SWAT. So what this group does, it's a community-based program like the Boys Scouts that gives young people who want to be law enforcement officers the ability to do so as teenagers."
