      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. A little over 15 months ago, a group of Chinese scientists working on the ground at the scene of the outbreak of a brand new virus came to the conclusion that the novel coronavirus, probably escaped from a government lab in Wuhan. These Chinese scientists said that in the clearest possible terms and then posted it on the internet. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } From our perspective, this struck us as an amazing and important story. And also, by the way plausible. We expected a flurry of media interest in it. Where did this virus come from? It seemed worth knowing as people were dying of it, but no one asked the question. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Instead, there was silence punctuated only by occasional smirking about anti-Asian racism and conspiracy theories, and that's where it stood for more than a year, until just a few weeks ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then suddenly, for reasons we still don't really understand, all the smirking morons in the American news media changed their view completely overnight. Of course, corona escaped from a Chinese virology lab. Duh. What? Do you think it came from a wet market? Come on? That was the new consensus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } An avalanche of evidence followed. \"The Wall Street Journal\" confirmed that the first corona victims seem to have been researchers working with bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. BuzzFeed that obtained thousands of e-mails showing that Tony Fauci knew from the beginning that COVID may have been manufactured in China in dangerous experiments he helped pay for. The lab leak theory, it turns out was never crazy. It was always likely true. So why did they lie to us about it for so long? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A shocking new piece, and of all places, the celebrity suck up magazine, \"Vanity Fair,\" answers that question in great detail, you should read it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In short, many research scientists are addicted to American tax dollars. If the American public understood just how recklessly they have behaved, endangering the entire world with their weird little experiments in poorly regulated labs in China that money might dry up. As a former N.S.C. official called Jamie Metzl put it succinctly, quote: \"If the pandemic started as part of a lab leak, it had the potential to do to virology what a three-mile island in Chernobyl did to nuclear science.\" Can't have that. Got to keep the money flowing, so they lied about it. And then they intimidated anyone who tried to tell the truth. That would include the Director of the C.D.C., Robert Redfield. Redfield received death threats from scientists after he suggested the virus may have come from a lab. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "That's not some guy on Twitter. That's the former Director of the C.D.C., so you think the world would stop and ask follow-up questions such as: why do you think that? Where's the evidence? But that's not what happened, quote: \"I was threatened and ostracized because I proposed another hypothesis.\" Redfield told \"Vanity Fair,\" \"I expected it from politicians. I didn't expect it from science,\" but maybe he should have. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Redfield had dared to buck the orthodoxy that have been imposed by the global scientific establishment. It began on February 19, 2020, just as the virus was getting to this country and scaring the hell out of all of us. At that moment, one of the leading science journals in the world, \"The Lancet\" published a letter that was signed by 27 scientists. That letter declared flatly and for all time that the coronavirus did not originate in a lab in Wuhan, and you'd have to be a bigot to believe otherwise. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, that letter we now know was organized by Peter Daszak. Daszak is a man with everything to gain by pretending that COVID came from a wet market. Daszak was involved in gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } E-mails show that Peter Daszak carefully selected other signatories to \"The Lancet\" letter, so that this obviously disqualifying conflict of interest would remain secret. At one point, Daszak wrote to another scientist called Ralph Baric, who was also working on gain-of-function research in China, telling him not to sign the letter. Here's why, quote: \"We'll put it out in a way that doesn't link it back to our collaboration, so we maximize any independent voice,\" end quote. So the whole thing was a fraud. And yet, it worked. It was in \"The Lancet.\" Everyone trusts \"The Lancet.\" In fact, Tony Fauci himself cited Daszak's letter as proof that the virus was not caused by research he was funding. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Self-described fact checkers, the one who control the flow of information in our country now, used \"The Lancet\" letter to censor anyone on social media, who mentioned the possibility of a lab leak. It can't be true, \"The Lancet\" says it's not true. Twenty seven eminent scientists say it's not true. Only a few scientists in the face of all of this dared to speak up. One of them was called Gilles Demaneuf. He formed a group of researchers called DRASTIC.

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "sentences": "So it turns out that Metzl wasn't exactly speculating on that. Unlike the scientific establishment, he and DRASTIC had evidence that they had bothered to gather. They found that the official scientific consensus had in fact been doctored at the source. In one instance, they discovered that Shi Zhengli, the bat lady in Wuhan had collected samples of a bat coronavirus that were virtually identical to COVID-19. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Where did she get these samples? Well, she found them in a cave in the Yunnan Province in China. Several miners had been killed there after inhaling the bat guano left by these bats. She recognized this virus was significant because it had moved directly to humans without going through an intermediate animal host first. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Chinese seems to be looking for the most dangerous virus they could find. And in that cave, they found it. After the coronavirus pandemic began, Shi Zhengli tried to hide that COVID- 19 was virtually identical to this virus that she had collected in the mine. In her records, she renamed the virus to hide its source. Peter Daszak then published a paper with Shi Zhengli categorizing all the various coronavirus strains they had encountered in recent years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The paper listed hundreds of them, and yet somehow, and you'll be surprised by this, they omitted the deadly viruses found in the Yunnan mine. Funny. Were those viruses significant? Well, the government of China appears to think they are. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Late last year, journalists from the BBC tried to visit that mine to get some answers, and when they got there, they were followed by plainclothes police officers. They found the road to the mine had been blocked by a broken down truck. So the Chinese government covered this up. But here's the worst part and the most shocking part, if you're an American. Some within the U.S. government helped them cover it up. They knew all along this was going on, but they buried the truth, too, because their interests were aligned with the interests of the Chinese government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Christopher Park, a Director in the State Department's Nonproliferation Bureau told the agency's investigators, quote, \" ... not to say anything that would point to the U.S. government's own role in gain-of-function research.\" Now, why would he say that? It turns out that Christopher Park was involved in a 2017 decision, a world changing decision it turned out, to lift the Federal moratorium on funding gain-of-function research. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } \"Vanity Fair\" obtained a memo from Thomas DiNanno, who was then the Acting Assistant Secretary of the State Department's Arms Control Bureau. In that memo, he wrote that staff from two State Department bureaus had warned leaders within his office, quote, \" ... not to pursue an investigation into the origin of COVID-19\" because it would, quote, \"open a can of worms.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These are Americans working to hide the truth of the origin of COVID-19 from a country that's been destroyed by COVID-19. You can't prevent outbreaks unless you know where they came from, and yet Federal bureaucrats prevented us from learning where this one came from. One of the officials you wanted to shut down the probe was Chris Ford, acting Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security. A former administration official with direct knowledge of the probe -- direct knowledge -- tells this show that Chris Ford was briefed about the lab leak investigation earlier than December 2020 when Ford claims he first heard about it. We are told that Ford wanted it shut down. He was overruled by the Secretary of State at the time, Mike Pompeo. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ford, by the way, was not a permanent bureaucrat. He was a political appointee. But he spoke for many in the bureaucracy, many of whom we are told wanted to bury the probe out of political animus. They didn't like the administration they served, and they didn't want to give it points. They accused anyone who asked questions about where the virus came from of being a conspiracy theorist, and in our conformist culture, that's enough to shut people up. In other words, they acted just like the people you see on TV, just like MSNBC anchors. They did not act like Federal officials who have been sworn to protect American lives. They weren't protecting American lives. They're protecting the consensus and that endangered American lives. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As for actual MSNBC anchors, well, they have regressed to a childlike state of incoherence.

There were a small number of these self-interested scientists who recognized, and you quoted me in your intro, that there was a binary outcome that if the story was that this pandemic starts from a natural outbreak, it's not just that that's a boon for virology, it also helps support things that many people really believe in, like defending, protecting wild spaces and all sorts of things. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But if the story was a lab incident origin then, it is a lot more challenging for a lot of scientists, even ones who were doing things that they believed in. On top of that, we had this very toxic political environment, and I was one of the people who was a big critic of President Trump.",

And yet, when you look at the Defense budget, very little of it is actually about Defense, things like protecting our industries and our food supply and our energy supply from actual hacks, right? Spending money to fortify those systems, that would be defense, there's very little of it, that is spent on that. You see this over and over. You know, when I did the Snowden reporting in 2013, which was about eight years ago, which is when that report came out, $75 billion was spent on the Intelligence budget, almost all was spent on spying on American citizens, hacking into the systems of other countries. Virtually none was spent on how to do Defense, defending our own country. And even during Russiagate when there was all that hysteria about the Russians hacking our election system. People like Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic Congresswoman would say, if you're really that worried about it, pass this bill to provide paper ballots to make sure there can't be hacking and there was no interest in that.",

Simon & Schuster was paying me to do it, but it still seemed cowardly not to address directly what they had just done to Josh Hawley. So I called the head of the company, the CEO, Jon Karp, and I told him that I thought canceling a book for partisan reasons was disgusting and wrong, and that it set a very bad precedent for American publishing. Then I told him I wanted to write about what he had done in my new book as a kind of snapshot of what was happening across the country. So I started to report on it. In the end, I interviewed Jon Karp and other Simon & Schuster executives at some length and on the record. I asked them under what circumstances are you willing to censor the political views of your authors? It turned out to be an amazing series of conversations. They were highly uncomfortable as you can imagine, but fascinating. Their answers, some of them honest, some of them lies revealed in the clearest possible way how Corporate America undermines free speech in the country itself. Last week, Simon & Schuster confirmed that they will publish my account of their censorship. CEO, Jon Karp has said he will come on the show to explain what he has done and attempt to justify it.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. A little over 15 months ago, a group of Chinese scientists working on the ground at the scene of the outbreak of a brand new virus came to the conclusion that the novel coronavirus, probably escaped from a government lab in Wuhan. These Chinese scientists said that in the clearest possible terms and then posted it on the internet. From our perspective, this struck us as an amazing and important story. And also, by the way plausible. We expected a flurry of media interest in it. Where did this virus come from? It seemed worth knowing as people were dying of it, but no one asked the question. Instead, there was silence punctuated only by occasional smirking about anti-Asian racism and conspiracy theories, and that's where it stood for more than a year, until just a few weeks ago. Then suddenly, for reasons we still don't really understand, all the smirking morons in the American news media changed their view completely overnight. Of course, corona escaped from a Chinese virology lab. Duh. What? Do you think it came from a wet market? Come on? That was the new consensus. An avalanche of evidence followed. \"The Wall Street Journal\" confirmed that the first corona victims seem to have been researchers working with bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. BuzzFeed that obtained thousands of e-mails showing that Tony Fauci knew from the beginning that COVID may have been manufactured in China in dangerous experiments he helped pay for. The lab leak theory, it turns out was never crazy. It was always likely true. So why did they lie to us about it for so long? A shocking new piece, and of all places, the celebrity suck up magazine, \"Vanity Fair,\" answers that question in great detail, you should read it. In short, many research scientists are addicted to American tax dollars. If the American public understood just how recklessly they have behaved, endangering the entire world with their weird little experiments in poorly regulated labs in China that money might dry up."

Got to keep the money flowing, so they lied about it. And then they intimidated anyone who tried to tell the truth. That would include the Director of the C.D.C., Robert Redfield. Redfield received death threats from scientists after he suggested the virus may have come from a lab."

I didn't expect it from science,\" but maybe he should have. Redfield had dared to buck the orthodoxy that have been imposed by the global scientific establishment. It began on February 19, 2020, just as the virus was getting to this country and scaring the hell out of all of us. At that moment, one of the leading science journals in the world, \"The Lancet\" published a letter that was signed by 27 scientists. That letter declared flatly and for all time that the coronavirus did not originate in a lab in Wuhan, and you'd have to be a bigot to believe otherwise. Now, that letter we now know was organized by Peter Daszak. Daszak is a man with everything to gain by pretending that COVID came from a wet market. Daszak was involved in gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. E-mails show that Peter Daszak carefully selected other signatories to \"The Lancet\" letter, so that this obviously disqualifying conflict of interest would remain secret. At one point, Daszak wrote to another scientist called Ralph Baric, who was also working on gain-of-function research in China, telling him not to sign the letter. Here's why, quote: \"We'll put it out in a way that doesn't link it back to our collaboration, so we maximize any independent voice,\" end quote. So the whole thing was a fraud. And yet, it worked. It was in \"The Lancet.\" Everyone trusts \"The Lancet.\" In fact, Tony Fauci himself cited Daszak's letter as proof that the virus was not caused by research he was funding."

No matter how badly they screw up, it's never their fault. Oh, we didn't imagine WMD in Iraq, et cetera. Pick your screw up. It's your fault, racist. But it wasn't just Tony Fauci and the Federal bureaucrats who cited that letter. Self-described fact checkers, the one who control the flow of information in our country now, used \"The Lancet\" letter to censor anyone on social media, who mentioned the possibility of a lab leak. It can't be true, \"The Lancet\" says it's not true. Twenty seven eminent scientists say it's not true. Only a few scientists in the face of all of this dared to speak up. One of them was called Gilles Demaneuf. He formed a group of researchers called DRASTIC. That's an acronym for Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team, something that all scientists should be. Jamie Metzl, the former N.S.C. official soon joined the group. Almost immediately as early as April of last year, it was becoming clear to Metzl that the lab leak theory was not a conspiracy theory, in fact, it was plausible."

      "utterance": "I think that if I had to just bet based on what I've read and logic, I would bet it's most likely this was an accidental leak from a lab."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So it turns out that Metzl wasn't exactly speculating on that. Unlike the scientific establishment, he and DRASTIC had evidence that they had bothered to gather. They found that the official scientific consensus had in fact been doctored at the source. In one instance, they discovered that Shi Zhengli, the bat lady in Wuhan had collected samples of a bat coronavirus that were virtually identical to COVID-19. Where did she get these samples? Well, she found them in a cave in the Yunnan Province in China. Several miners had been killed there after inhaling the bat guano left by these bats. She recognized this virus was significant because it had moved directly to humans without going through an intermediate animal host first. The Chinese seems to be looking for the most dangerous virus they could find. And in that cave, they found it. After the coronavirus pandemic began, Shi Zhengli tried to hide that COVID- 19 was virtually identical to this virus that she had collected in the mine. In her records, she renamed the virus to hide its source. Peter Daszak then published a paper with Shi Zhengli categorizing all the various coronavirus strains they had encountered in recent years. The paper listed hundreds of them, and yet somehow, and you'll be surprised by this, they omitted the deadly viruses found in the Yunnan mine. Funny. Were those viruses significant? Well, the government of China appears to think they are. Late last year, journalists from the BBC tried to visit that mine to get some answers, and when they got there, they were followed by plainclothes police officers. They found the road to the mine had been blocked by a broken down truck. So the Chinese government covered this up. But here's the worst part and the most shocking part, if you're an American. Some within the U.S. government helped them cover it up. They knew all along this was going on, but they buried the truth, too, because their interests were aligned with the interests of the Chinese government. Christopher Park, a Director in the State Department's Nonproliferation Bureau told the agency's investigators, quote, \" ... not to say anything that would point to the U.S. government's own role in gain-of-function research.\" Now, why would he say that? It turns out that Christopher Park was involved in a 2017 decision, a world changing decision it turned out, to lift the Federal moratorium on funding gain-of-function research. \"Vanity Fair\" obtained a memo from Thomas DiNanno, who was then the Acting Assistant Secretary of the State Department's Arms Control Bureau. In that memo, he wrote that staff from two State Department bureaus had warned leaders within his office, quote, \" ... not to pursue an investigation into the origin of COVID-19\" because it would, quote, \"open a can of worms.\" These are Americans working to hide the truth of the origin of COVID-19 from a country that's been destroyed by COVID-19. You can't prevent outbreaks unless you know where they came from, and yet Federal bureaucrats prevented us from learning where this one came from. One of the officials you wanted to shut down the probe was Chris Ford, acting Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security. A former administration official with direct knowledge of the probe -- direct knowledge -- tells this show that Chris Ford was briefed about the lab leak investigation earlier than December 2020 when Ford claims he first heard about it. We are told that Ford wanted it shut down. He was overruled by the Secretary of State at the time, Mike Pompeo. Ford, by the way, was not a permanent bureaucrat. He was a political appointee. But he spoke for many in the bureaucracy, many of whom we are told wanted to bury the probe out of political animus. They didn't like the administration they served, and they didn't want to give it points. They accused anyone who asked questions about where the virus came from of being a conspiracy theorist, and in our conformist culture, that's enough to shut people up. In other words, they acted just like the people you see on TV, just like MSNBC anchors. They did not act like Federal officials who have been sworn to protect American lives. They weren't protecting American lives. They're protecting the consensus and that endangered American lives. As for actual MSNBC anchors, well, they have regressed to a childlike state of incoherence. Watch this dopey little fan girl swoon over Tony Fauci like he is the bassist in a boyband."

And I was looking at all of the data that was suggesting to me that a lab incident origin was really possible. And I started asking those questions, and I think everybody should have been asking those questions. Some were, but there was a forced consensus that was pushed by -- certainly by the Chinese, but by a number, even a small number of scientists who had very significant conflicts of interest, undisclosed conflicts of interest. And unfortunately, we allowed, we, collectively, a lot of fake consensus to emerge and I think that stifled some very healthy question asking that needed to happen last year. And I'm glad after a lot of us have worked very, very hard for almost a year and a half now that suddenly, but appropriately, we're asking these tough questions."

Were you shocked by it? Or have you been in the bureaucracy long enough not to be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "METZL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not just officials. The way I see it is from day one, following the outbreak, China began its massive cover up, which involved destroying samples, hiding records, imprisoning Chinese citizen journalists, asking the most basic questions, they established a universal gag order on their scientists. So there wasn't a lot of information coming out as a result of that. And a lot of scientists here were a bit hands-off because they didn't have the data. There were a small number of these self-interested scientists who recognized, and you quoted me in your intro, that there was a binary outcome that if the story was that this pandemic starts from a natural outbreak, it's not just that that's a boon for virology, it also helps support things that many people really believe in, like defending, protecting wild spaces and all sorts of things. But if the story was a lab incident origin then, it is a lot more challenging for a lot of scientists, even ones who were doing things that they believed in.

And yet, Tony Fauci is not only free and unindicted, uninvestigated, but he is running around basking in the love on cable TV shows. What's the difference? Well, possibly, Tony Fauci knows how to use the media and if you watched MSNBC last night, you saw the surreal interview he did with Jeb Bush's former flak. Really, it's hard to believe that actually happened. Over at CNN, one anchor at least tried to make his interview with Tony Fauci look legitimate. He asked Fauci why some of his e-mails were heavily redacted, and Fauci just laughed in his face."

I mean, he knew from day one, that there were reputable scientists who believed that this was a man-made virus. He also knew that he had been funding gain-of-function, this Frankenstein research to juice up bat coronaviruses in the Wuhan lab, specifically to get around the Obama administration ban. Anthony Fauci was probably the world's greatest fan, greatest supporter of this dangerous gain-of-function research and there are hundreds of American scientists who thought it was too dangerous to persist with. They convinced the Obama administration to lift the ban. Then Tony Fauci took advantage of the new Trump administration in their early days in 2017 to go and tell them that there was nothing dangerous, they had done a review and to lift that moratorium. And he is, you know, if this is a lab leak, that's why he has a vested interest. The last thing he wants is for anybody in the media to come close to saying, if this is a lab leak, are you responsible for the research that resulted in that lab leak? He doesn't want that. The other person who is very conflicted is the man whose sub-agency, whose nonprofit in New York at the N.I.H. through Anthony Fauci was funding, that is Peter Daszak from EcoHealth Alliance, and like Anthony Fauci, he is very powerful in terms of shaping the narrative. You just talked about \"The Lancet\" article that he engineered, and also, he was the only American person on the World Health Organization investigation whitewash into what happened in the lab."

Now keep in mind, the bottom line finding of all government reports no matter what they are about is, we need more money from you. So there's no question this report will find that. Increase in DoD budget. \"The New York Times\" has been briefed. We don't have the report, but we are just getting a report from that newspaper in New York that they have spoken to someone who has seen the report and here is the bottom line as described by \"The New York Times.\" Lots of these sightings. No, they did not come from the American military. This is not some secret advanced government technology they haven't been telling us about. They don't know where they are from. They don't know if they're from another country or from another planet. They have no idea. We will apparently learn more on June 25th and that's when the unclassified report is set to arrive. And of course, we will give you all the details we can, and maybe more leaks. Nicole Solas is the mother of a kindergartner enrolled in school in South Kingston, Rhode Island. This summer, she filed several public record requests to learn about the indoctrination that the school was forcing on kindergarteners. Nicole Solas then wrote a post on the blog Legal Insurrection and the south Kingston School Committee threatened to sue her for doing this.

They reduce everyone down to the color of their skin and a human being's worth is more than that. And if this is any indication of what's going on in my school district, our town is in deep, deep trouble. This is exactly why I was submitting my public records request to get information about how exactly this is being taught in our schools.

And I want parents to know that if they are going to get answers from their school district, they need to submit public records request, it's called an APRA. It stands for the Access to Public Records Act. This is a way that you can legally compel your school to answer your questions so you can know what is being taught in your classrooms.

And suddenly those threats have multiplied, they appear to have anyway. When hackers shut down the gas supply to the Eastern Seaboard earlier this year, for example, the White House said it was a private matter.

It is run through the Department of Defense. Constantly, this word is invoked to justify these huge bureaucracies and these huge military budgets, we have to defend the country. And yet, when you look at the Defense budget, very little of it is actually about Defense, things like protecting our industries and our food supply and our energy supply from actual hacks, right? Spending money to fortify those systems, that would be defense, there's very little of it, that is spent on that. You see this over and over. You know, when I did the Snowden reporting in 2013, which was about eight years ago, which is when that report came out, $75 billion was spent on the Intelligence budget, almost all was spent on spying on American citizens, hacking into the systems of other countries. Virtually none was spent on how to do Defense, defending our own country. And even during Russiagate when there was all that hysteria about the Russians hacking our election system. People like Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic Congresswoman would say, if you're really that worried about it, pass this bill to provide paper ballots to make sure there can't be hacking and there was no interest in that."

There's a really simple solution. I have a like a two paragraph bill that just requires states to generate paper ballot backups so that nobody can ever hack our voting machines, because we'll have a paper backup to prove it. And I think she had like four sponsors in all of Congress while they were constantly babbling about Russian interference in our elections, and it just shows you that so often these things are pretext to build massive budgets that really have nothing to do with the interest of the American people."

Amazing. He also sees himself as a hero who is going to bring justice for the January 6th insurrection. He's got a plan for that. He is investigating his own colleagues. We learned yesterday that Eric Swalwell has hired private investigators to fine Congressman Mo Brooks of Alabama. Swalwell claims Brooks is avoiding a lawsuit he filed to hold Brooks accountable for the insurrection. But there's an easier way, Swalwell can just call his old girlfriend, Fang Fang. She is good at finding people in power. Hey, Eric Swalwell, call Fang Fang, the Chinese spy you had sex with. She'll get it done. Well, the Biden administration while the rest of us have been otherwise occupied have been awarding many millions in coronavirus stimulus money to people based on their skin color alone. This is illegal, it's immoral and then it goes unchallenged. Stephen Miller has finally challenged it. He's a former White House adviser.

Almost always those terms are wielded by progressives in a way that is a lie. That is dishonest. That is a smear. In this case, we have real life institutional discrimination, real life systemic racism, where restaurant owners and farmers are being denied aid solely because of their skin color. That is not only racist and bigoted, it is flagrantly unconstitutional. And I'm proud of the fact that we have won for our clients in the restaurant case, an injunction so they're able to apply.

That's why I'm doing this. That's why I am suing the Biden administration to say, in this country, you do not punish people because they look a certain way, because their ancestors come from a certain place. Because if the government has the power to destroy a business because of how someone looks, what's next? Put someone in jail because of how they look.

And then Hawley's publisher, Simon & Schuster suggested that he was somehow an accessory to violence and insurrection. In a press release, Simon & Schuster denounced Hawley and canceled his book contract and the book ironically, was about the danger of big media companies.

But for me personally, what happened to Josh Hawley was more than an academic question. At the time his book was canceled, I was also under contract to produce a book for Simon & Schuster, a collection of magazine journalism. Simon & Schuster was paying me to do it, but it still seemed cowardly not to address directly what they had just done to Josh Hawley. So I called the head of the company, the CEO, Jon Karp, and I told him that I thought canceling a book for partisan reasons was disgusting and wrong, and that it set a very bad precedent for American publishing. Then I told him I wanted to write about what he had done in my new book as a kind of snapshot of what was happening across the country. So I started to report on it. In the end, I interviewed Jon Karp and other Simon & Schuster executives at some length and on the record. I asked them under what circumstances are you willing to censor the political views of your authors? It turned out to be an amazing series of conversations. They were highly uncomfortable as you can imagine, but fascinating. Their answers, some of them honest, some of them lies revealed in the clearest possible way how Corporate America undermines free speech in the country itself. Last week, Simon & Schuster confirmed that they will publish my account of their censorship. CEO, Jon Karp has said he will come on the show to explain what he has done and attempt to justify it. We assume he will keep his word, we hope so. That book comes out the week of August 10th. You can pre order it now. By the way, Eric Swalwell had sex with a Chinese spy. We say that a lot. We are never that specific about what that meant. What was that like, Eric Swalwell? Not many members of Congress have done it.
