The president is resisting a lot of subpoenas, a lot of requests for documents across the board. He has decided to fight. That's what he likes to do.

BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": The thing is, this fight between Barr and the House Judiciary Committee is basically kind of dumb at the basis of it. We know that certain parts of the Mueller report were redacted for various reasons because of classified information, because of information about ongoing cases, and because of grand jury information. And that attorney general said to the committee, look, I will uncover everything except the grand jury information, and you can come over and read it. And Doug Collins, who is the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, did go over and read it, meaning he read almost everything, and certainly almost everything in volume two, and he said that it really didn't change anything. And Jerrold Nadler, the chairman, will not go read it, refuses to go read it, and instead wants to threaten Barr with contempt for not releasing the whole thing, which, by the way, the attorney general can't do on his own because it requires a court order to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, so it could be delayed and delayed as you get back up into an election. Matthew, the other from Capitol Hill today, you have the Senate Majority Leader saying listen, clearly the Mueller report and all the extraneous activities around it are not a winning issue for Democrats on the campaign trail. Then the Speaker the House, Nancy Pelosi, said this about impeachment."

    {
      "speaker": "REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER",
      "utterance": "Trump is goading us to impeach him. That's what he's doing. Every single day he is just like taunting, taunting, taunting, because he knows that it would be very divisive in the country. So we can't impeach him for political reasons, and we can't not impeach him for political reasons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "That is a new argument, Matthew. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I think that's what's called a Catch-22. Pelosi is walking this tightrope. She's like a gymnast. On the one hand, her base wants her to impeach Donald Trump. But on the other hand, the public does not. And so she has to give her basically appearance that the Democrats are doing everything they can close to impeachment, but not actually crossing the line. On the other hand, she knows that the second she does that, the public will turn against her. So I don't know if Pelosi is actually capable of walking that tight rope, and that's why you get clumsy phrases like the one today."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, everybody is waiting for that. Clearly Director Wray sees \"spying\" as a pejorative term, suggests that something inappropriate happened. What he is talking about is surveillance that was ordered by judge multiple times. Hopefully Michael Horowitz, the inspector general, is going to lay this all out for us, but \"spying\" is a term that President Trump uses to say that it was illegal. But what Wray talked about today was, look, this is a kind of thing that the FBI should be investigating when an agent of a foreign power makes a contact with a campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Byron, I guess the question is splitting hairs here rhetorically, and whether the FISA authorization was based something that the FISA judges didn't know was not real."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "You're right. It is all parsing. If you just look at the actual facts, the FBI did wiretap Carter Page. It was a court approved wiretap, but it was a wiretap. They use a confidential informant, the college professor named Stefan Halper, to seek information on Page and George Papadopoulos. And recently we found out that they used an undercover agent who went by the alias Azra Turk to try to tease information out of George Papadopoulos. That was undercover. Now, if you have undercover agents and you have wiretaps, a lot of people would say that is the stuff of spying. Clearly there is a rhetorical battle, but these actual facts are what they are."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "utterance": "Some mixed messages from Democrats on the issue of tariffs and China. This is the Dow, and the markets took another dive today, a big dive for a while, bouncing back a little bit at the end. World markets slowing on all this news as the Chinese delegation comes here to Washington. We are back with the panel. Mara, all that optimism kind of went away with the president's tweets and some of the messages. But they are still coming, the Chinese delegation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "They are still coming even though the president and his advisors say at midnight on Thursday, I guess one minute after, they are going to raise tariffs, put more tariffs on, because they think that the Chinese have tried to back away from some commitments that they were about to make. The president and his team thinks the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand whatever hit they get from the tariffs. They think that the Chinese economy is weaker. So it is a real standoff, and we're going to see who blinks first."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "I'm sure the president is very happy to hear that. Look, this is the one things, the one tariff issue in which the president has his strongest support. He made a lot of people in Washington very unhappy, both parties, when he was talking about tariffs with Canada or Mexico or Europe. But on China there is a large agreement on the abuses that have brought us to this point. And when you have Lindsey Graham, and when you have Charles Schumer telling the president to hang tough, I think the president is going to hang tough on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And we'll see whether that changes the dynamics in that room as they come to a conclusion. Matthew, I want to turn to Iran, and we have this carrier strike group heading to the Persian Gulf. We have B-52 bombers. We have the secretary of state going to Iraq, assuring them we have their back even if Iran acts against U.S. interests in Iraq. It seems like tensions are building."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "Tensions are building, I think illustrating two things, Bret. The first is that designating the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, and also ending the waivers on sales of petroleum from some of our allies from Iran had real bite. And so the Iranians now are trying to get us back to the negotiating table or to exact some price in terms of national security. The second thing this illustrates is just how hard it is for America to extricate ourselves from the Middle East. It's now the policy of two subsequent administrations, Democrats and Republican, to get us out, or try to at least. And you see by the Iranian moves how difficult that is because of the region's importance strategically. Not only our allies are there, its centrality geographically, and of course the existence of resources which we might not need because we are energy independent, but our allies definitely do."
