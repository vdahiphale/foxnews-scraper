      "sentences": "We're waiting to hear from the president too. This will be his first opportunity to respond to yesterday's twin debacles in Virginia and, of course, in New Jersey, where it remains tight as a tick in the governor's race there. We will have more than that in just a second. This, of course, announcement is meant to talk about the vaccine that is now available and given the go-ahead by the CDC, as it was by the FDA, to use on kids as young as 5 years old. That would be about 29 million eligible children across the country. The president is going to talk up the need to get vaccinated. But, of course, what's going to be closely scrutinized is whether he comments on yesterday's election developments. Speaking of them, and before I get into some other particulars here, we're getting some reconstituted numbers, if you will, out of the Garden State. There was apparently a sign, if we can show this guys, in Hudson County, a very strong Democratic area, where there was a double count going on. It is now since been addressed, bringing Governor Murphy's total down by a little bit less than 11,000 votes and affecting his opponent, Ciattarelli, by reducing his by close to 3,000. Upshot is, it essentially put them back in a position where they're almost at a tie again, but that double-counting in Hudson County has been addressed. We're told that there are anywhere from 150,000 to 175,000 other votes that have yet to be tabulated. There is no automatic recount in the Garden State. But given the closest of this, whoever comes up at the short end of the stick, will likely demand and petition for a recount and likely get that recount petition accepted. So, this is something that could drag on a while here until we have an official count on all of this. But in case you think any of this was going to change behavior on Capitol Hill or that big spending plan the Democrats are still cooking up, but we got a strong signal from Nancy Pelosi, don't count on it. Take a look.",

      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "sentences": "Get my mask here. Today is a great day for American parents, American families, and American children. We've taken a giant step forward to further accelerate our path out of this pandemic. After months of rigorous and independent scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration -- the FDA -- authorized and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the CDC -- recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11. For parents all over this country, this is a day of relief and celebration. After almost 18 months of anxious worrying every time that children -- your child had a sniffle or started to cough, well, you can now protect them from this horrible virus, because that would always worry that it was coming along. Twenty-eight million more young Americans are now eligible for the protection of a vaccine, and my administration is ready -- we're ready from day one, today -- organized, and have a plan for this vaccination's launch. As soon as next week, we will have enough vaccine in enough places, and parents will be able to schedule appointments to get their kids their first shot. And we've already secured enough vaccine supply for every single child in America ages 5 through 11. And weeks ago, we asked states and pharmacies to put together their detailed plan to start placing their orders for these specially formulated vaccines for young children. We started packing and shipping these orders last week, as soon as FDA authorized the vaccine. And we've already sent millions of doses -- excuse me -- millions of doses, and millions more to come by next week. These doses will be available at approximately -- excuse me -- I beg your pardon -- I swallowed wrong -- will be available in approximately 20,000 locations around the country. These include places that parents know and trust: their local pharmacies, their pediatricians, family doctors, and children's hospitals. Many of the vaccine sites will offer times on nights and weekends so parents can take their children to get vaccinated after work and after school. We've also been working with governors, mayors, and local school leaders to bring vaccines to schools. As of today, more than 6,000 school clinics have already been planned in school districts around the country. These efforts will also ensure equity that -- is the center of our children's vaccination program, as has been -- as it has been the -- the vaccination program for adults. We're making vaccines available at hundreds of community health centers, rural health clinics, and thousands of pharmacies and schools in our hardest-hit communities. And we're sending out mobile units to reach where the people are. The bottom line is: We've been planning and preparing for months to vaccinate our children. Our program will be ramping up this week and more doses shipped out each day so that we have fully -- we are fully up and running by next week. Now, I know that many parents have been anxiously waiting for this day, but I also know that some families might have questions. So, trusted messengers -- like your pediatricians, family doctors -- will be able to answer your questions, talk to parents about the importance of getting their kids vaccinated, and put your mind at ease. We'll also be raising awareness and encouraging parents to get their children vaccinated, from our level. Just when we've been doing -- that's what we've been doing since day one of my administration. And we're going to do everything we can to make these vaccines easily available and raise awareness of the importance of getting vaccinated. So, parents of children ages five and older, please get them vaccinated. Because here's the deal: Children make up one quarter of the cases in this country. And while rare, children can get very sick from COVID-19. And some can end up -- few -- but end up hospitalized. But they don't have to. This vaccine is safe and effective. So, get your children vaccinated to protect themselves, to protect others, and to stop the spread, and to help us beat this pandemic. Today, I also want to speak to America's seniors. While everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19, the evidence is overwhelming that older Americans are still, by far, the most vulnerable to getting the sickest. And boosters -- boosters add an important layer of protection. Booster shots are free and effective, and every senior should get one. It's important. Seniors are eligible to get your booster shot six months after you've been fully vaccinated. So, six months. If you got your second shot before May the 1st, you are eligible to get the booster right now. And I've made it clear: We have ample supply of boosters. And thanks to our planning and preparation, our booster program is off to a very strong start. Over 20 million Americans have now received a booster. In fact, in just six weeks, we've already gotten boosters to about half the eligible seniors who received the Pfizer vaccine. Nearly half of the eligible seniors in just six weeks. It took nearly 11 weeks to get half of all seniors their first shot for that -- when that program was launched back in December of 2020, just during the prior administration. So, as a -- this is a strong pace. To our seniors: If you're eligible, get your booster now. I will conclude with this: Vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 and boosters, provide additional protection for seniors and others are two major steps forward that are going to accelerate our path out of this pandemic. And this brings -- and this brings me to where we are and where we're going to go from here: Since early September, cases and hospitalizations are down now more than 50 percent. And over the past two weeks, cases and hospitalizations are falling in approximately 40 states. A year ago, we had no vaccines. Just this week, we hit an important milestone: 80 percent of adults have at least one shot. That's four out of every five adults. And for our seniors, over 95 percent have gotten at least one shot. Overall, 193 million Americans are fully vaccinated, up from just 2 million the day I was sworn in. Over 20 million have enhanced protections from boosters. And we're now down from 100 to about 60 million unvaccinated Americans 12 years and older. And I'm proud to say, Black and brown adults and Native Americans have gotten vaccinated at the same rate as white adults. And one more thing. Our vaccination program is not only helping to save lives and beat the pandemic, it's helping our economy recovery and helping us grow. In the three months before I came to office, the economy was stagnant and creating only 60,000 jobs a month. Since I've taken office, it's now averaging 600,000 new jobs every month. That's the average. And one more thing. Vaccinating our children will help us keep our schools open -- keep our kids in the classroom, learning and socializing with their classmates and teachers. I think every reporter in this room who has a child understands the difference of a child going to school and having to learn from home. It matters. It matters in terms of their not just physical health, their mental health. You know, during this pandemic, we've seen just how important being in school is for our families and for our country. A year ago, we were heading into a Thanksgiving where public health were -- experts were advising against traveling or gathering with family and friends. Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us -- my wife and I, our daughter and her -- and my son-in-law. Later this month, our tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines. We've made incredible progress over these past nine months, but we have to keep going. The pandemic is not yes -- behind us -- yet behind us, but we're getting there. So, please -- please do your part. If you know someone who is not vaccinated, encourage them to get vaccinated. And folks -- folks who haven't gotten vaccinated yet, please get vaccinated. It's easy. It's accessible. And it's free. Get vaccinated. You can do this. May God bless you all. And I will take a few questions.",

But the big news there in the end with our own Peter Doocy was this story that was out there for some time, and it had not been disputed for a number of days by the White House, that it was considering a plan to pay families for up $450,000 each if they're separated or had been separated at the border. The president seemed to make clear there was nothing to that. Why only now to clarify it in response to Peter's question is anyone's guess, but saying that there was nothing to that. In the meantime, discussing what some people have interpreted as obsession with Donald Trump and constantly mentioning him. He only says he mentions that in the context of events going on here, but was not aware of any particular number, I think, as Peter said, a couple of dozen times at one single event. But what is very clear from the president's reflection yesterday's double debacle for Democrats in a race still too close to call in the bluest of blue states in New Jersey is that he might be taking some of the responsibility for that, has no way of knowing whether the failure to get a spending package through or at least something that had a popular appeal, the bipartisan infrastructure-only package through, whether that could have made a difference. He doesn't hazard to guess. Let's go to what David Spunt at the White House of how it's handling this day-after impact of these races, because, best I can tell, David, they're full speed ahead at pushing this through.

And the White House hoped to have something done before President Biden went overseas to meet with people in Scotland, to meet with world leaders to talk the climate. As far as the fallout from the Virginia gubernatorial race last night, many conservatives criticized Terry McAuliffe, who wanted to get his old job back, for repeatedly mentioning the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. They said that he was doing it too much. As you heard in Peter's question right there. President Biden mentioned Donald Trump 24 times on the campaign trail. That's what we were able to count. Biden also said to another reporter, the president said the reason he did so was because he wanted to show the juxtaposition between McAuliffe's policies and Youngkin's policies, trying to tie Youngkin to Trump. Ultimately, that did not work. Glenn Youngkin will be the next governor of Virginia. It was also pointed out to the president -- and this is notable, Neil, for our viewers -- that President Biden, Joe Biden -- candidate Biden, I should say, at the time a year ago beat then-President Donald Trump by 10 points in Virginia. The reason Biden said that happened is because he said just a few minutes ago, well, I was running against Donald Trump. So, right there, it shows that is something the White House focused on, was Donald Trump. As far as this legislation is concerned, it was on Monday when Senator Joe Manchin held this news conference, rare news conference, when the president was overseas, saying he just cannot get on board with this spending package right now. That's what the White House is going to focus on. They hoped to have something not only before Scotland, but also before this election, hoping that that could propel Terry McAuliffe to victory, but, ultimately, it did not -- Neil.",

Imagine what things would have looked like in the months running up to this election if that is what Biden had done. He didn't. He also now today has failed to do it again.

We saw it jump couple hundred, then a couple hundred just a moment ago, too. So that may change yet again. But what are we waiting on? Why can we not make a call? We can't make a call because Ciattarelli has made this thing super tight in New Jersey. And nobody really considered that to be the case. What are we waiting on right now? This is Philadelphia down here in the southwest. It's New York up here in the northeast. This is Camden, New Jersey. Murphy's going to win the county, Neil. But we expect right now at least 15, 16 percent of the votes still outstanding. And two-thirds of that vote, we think, was cast today on election -- or was cast on Election Day. Yes. It's been a long night, as I'm sure you can tell. Up here in Essex is where you find Newark, just a short drive from us here in New York City, a heavily Democratic county, but we believe in Essex, like we have been saying for hours, 25 percent of the vote outstanding in Essex yet to be counted. Why is that? We can't say. We don't know. Is there an issue? Not confirmed. But, I mean, Neil, it goes back to the calculator question, Neil. We need to send a few their way here. Also, down in Union County, you find Summit, Westfield, New Jersey here, we think 12 percent of the vote is outstanding in Union County as well. To summarize those three places, they are blue counties, and in all likelihood, up to about 60 percent, maybe a little more than that vote, could go for Murphy over Ciattarelli, which would certainly be good news for the Democrat. We can't conclude that just yet. It's just based on some of their projections we're looking inside. This is up here in the north in Passaic County, New Jersey. Had a couple of votes come in. I think this is interesting, Neil, and I will tell you why. Had a few votes take in just a few moments ago here. Murphy, just look at the raw vote here. We did this a bit earlier today. I think it's -- I think it's fascinating, right? He's at 53,000. Ciattarelli is at 51, 500. Now I'm going to show you what came in four years ago, when Murphy won over Guadagno, OK? he was at 56,000. You see there, for the Republican, it was at 36,000. So come back to 2021 and just watch this number, do the math in your head. Well, he increases voter turnout in one county by 15,000 votes, in a blue county too, and made it very, very competitive. And I think you can -- clear that off -- you can do that, Neil, all over the state of New Jersey. Republicans came out to vote. And that was pretty evidence. You come down to the shore and you look at the percentages in Monmouth County, this is -- that's where you want to be. I mean, you can even argue Ocean County, Monmouth County, that he overperformed in these heavily Republican areas of the state. But we will see whether or not he can turn the trick, ultimately -- Neil, .",

And voters in New Jersey say that came out to specifically vote on two main issues, how they handled the COVID-19 pandemic, the governor, who's Governor Murphy, and also just figuring out a couple other things. But as those results show right now, half of the Garden State does want to replace Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. So let's get to it. These early results showing right now Governor Murphy ahead by 16,000 votes, those numbers just in, after the two candidates traded spots for first place throughout the day here. Now, Governor Murphy faced Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman and New Jersey native. Roughly 89 percent of the votes have now been counted, but the remaining votes are expected to heavily favor Democrats. In the last few weeks, Governor Murphy, who's been considered a shoo-in, in this race, has tried to rally support, bringing in Senator Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and even first lady Jill Biden. Murphy held the lead early in the night, but as those results continued to pour in from other counties, Ciattarelli taking the lead for a short time there. In New Jersey, registered Democrats do outnumber for registered Republicans by more than a million.

Well, New Jersey doesn't want to be California.",

So I think -- I hope this may - - this election maybe some sign to both sides to, let's talk a bit. Let's reason together. Let's recognize that we're not badly motivated and a lot of people in both parties are well-intentioned. And so let's talk to each other and see if we can come up with some compromises.

It's been buying a ton of Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, all that gooky stuff, if you will, to the tune of about $120 billion every month. It was the first sign by the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, the chairman, to say, we're going to start slicing that a little bit, $10 to $15 billion in the next couple of months, beginning next month, and slowly unwind those positions. That was not a surprise to the markets. They liked it. Didn't seem rattled by all these developments on Capitol Hill.

This will be his first opportunity to respond to yesterday's twin debacles in Virginia and, of course, in New Jersey, where it remains tight as a tick in the governor's race there. We will have more than that in just a second. This, of course, announcement is meant to talk about the vaccine that is now available and given the go-ahead by the CDC, as it was by the FDA, to use on kids as young as 5 years old. That would be about 29 million eligible children across the country. The president is going to talk up the need to get vaccinated. But, of course, what's going to be closely scrutinized is whether he comments on yesterday's election developments. Speaking of them, and before I get into some other particulars here, we're getting some reconstituted numbers, if you will, out of the Garden State. There was apparently a sign, if we can show this guys, in Hudson County, a very strong Democratic area, where there was a double count going on. It is now since been addressed, bringing Governor Murphy's total down by a little bit less than 11,000 votes and affecting his opponent, Ciattarelli, by reducing his by close to 3,000. Upshot is, it essentially put them back in a position where they're almost at a tie again, but that double-counting in Hudson County has been addressed. We're told that there are anywhere from 150,000 to 175,000 other votes that have yet to be tabulated. There is no automatic recount in the Garden State. But given the closest of this, whoever comes up at the short end of the stick, will likely demand and petition for a recount and likely get that recount petition accepted. So, this is something that could drag on a while here until we have an official count on all of this. But in case you think any of this was going to change behavior on Capitol Hill or that big spending plan the Democrats are still cooking up, but we got a strong signal from Nancy Pelosi, don't count on it. Take a look."

We're currently going through it right now to see what's in it. So it's looking more and more likely that there will be a vote in the House this week. It doesn't look like there's going to be that CBO score beforehand, as some of the moderates have asked for. Look, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi, as you saw in that clip there, didn't think that the election last night was going to have an impact on this social spending bill or the timeline of it. And she didn't at all today talk about the strategy for House Democrats either.

      "utterance": "Get my mask here. Today is a great day for American parents, American families, and American children. We've taken a giant step forward to further accelerate our path out of this pandemic. After months of rigorous and independent scientific review, the Food and Drug Administration -- the FDA -- authorized and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the CDC -- recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11. For parents all over this country, this is a day of relief and celebration. After almost 18 months of anxious worrying every time that children -- your child had a sniffle or started to cough, well, you can now protect them from this horrible virus, because that would always worry that it was coming along. Twenty-eight million more young Americans are now eligible for the protection of a vaccine, and my administration is ready -- we're ready from day one, today -- organized, and have a plan for this vaccination's launch. As soon as next week, we will have enough vaccine in enough places, and parents will be able to schedule appointments to get their kids their first shot. And we've already secured enough vaccine supply for every single child in America ages 5 through 11. And weeks ago, we asked states and pharmacies to put together their detailed plan to start placing their orders for these specially formulated vaccines for young children. We started packing and shipping these orders last week, as soon as FDA authorized the vaccine. And we've already sent millions of doses -- excuse me -- millions of doses, and millions more to come by next week. These doses will be available at approximately -- excuse me -- I beg your pardon -- I swallowed wrong -- will be available in approximately 20,000 locations around the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "These include places that parents know and trust",
      "utterance": "their local pharmacies, their pediatricians, family doctors, and children's hospitals. Many of the vaccine sites will offer times on nights and weekends so parents can take their children to get vaccinated after work and after school. We've also been working with governors, mayors, and local school leaders to bring vaccines to schools. As of today, more than 6,000 school clinics have already been planned in school districts around the country. These efforts will also ensure equity that -- is the center of our children's vaccination program, as has been -- as it has been the -- the vaccination program for adults. We're making vaccines available at hundreds of community health centers, rural health clinics, and thousands of pharmacies and schools in our hardest-hit communities. And we're sending out mobile units to reach where the people are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "The bottom line is",
      "utterance": "We've been planning and preparing for months to vaccinate our children. Our program will be ramping up this week and more doses shipped out each day so that we have fully -- we are fully up and running by next week. Now, I know that many parents have been anxiously waiting for this day, but I also know that some families might have questions. So, trusted messengers -- like your pediatricians, family doctors -- will be able to answer your questions, talk to parents about the importance of getting their kids vaccinated, and put your mind at ease. We'll also be raising awareness and encouraging parents to get their children vaccinated, from our level. Just when we've been doing -- that's what we've been doing since day one of my administration. And we're going to do everything we can to make these vaccines easily available and raise awareness of the importance of getting vaccinated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "So, parents of children ages five and older, please get them vaccinated. Because here's the deal",
      "utterance": "Children make up one quarter of the cases in this country. And while rare, children can get very sick from COVID-19. And some can end up -- few -- but end up hospitalized. But they don't have to. This vaccine is safe and effective. So, get your children vaccinated to protect themselves, to protect others, and to stop the spread, and to help us beat this pandemic. Today, I also want to speak to America's seniors. While everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19, the evidence is overwhelming that older Americans are still, by far, the most vulnerable to getting the sickest. And boosters -- boosters add an important layer of protection. Booster shots are free and effective, and every senior should get one. It's important. Seniors are eligible to get your booster shot six months after you've been fully vaccinated. So, six months. If you got your second shot before May the 1st, you are eligible to get the booster right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And I've made it clear",
      "utterance": "We have ample supply of boosters. And thanks to our planning and preparation, our booster program is off to a very strong start. Over 20 million Americans have now received a booster. In fact, in just six weeks, we've already gotten boosters to about half the eligible seniors who received the Pfizer vaccine. Nearly half of the eligible seniors in just six weeks. It took nearly 11 weeks to get half of all seniors their first shot for that -- when that program was launched back in December of 2020, just during the prior administration. So, as a -- this is a strong pace."

      "speaker": "I will conclude with this",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "And this brings -- and this brings me to where we are and where we're going to go from here",
      "utterance": "Since early September, cases and hospitalizations are down now more than 50 percent. And over the past two weeks, cases and hospitalizations are falling in approximately 40 states."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A year ago, we had no vaccines. Just this week, we hit an important milestone",
      "utterance": "80 percent of adults have at least one shot. That's four out of every five adults. And for our seniors, over 95 percent have gotten at least one shot. Overall, 193 million Americans are fully vaccinated, up from just 2 million the day I was sworn in. Over 20 million have enhanced protections from boosters. And we're now down from 100 to about 60 million unvaccinated Americans 12 years and older. And I'm proud to say, Black and brown adults and Native Americans have gotten vaccinated at the same rate as white adults. And one more thing. Our vaccination program is not only helping to save lives and beat the pandemic, it's helping our economy recovery and helping us grow. In the three months before I came to office, the economy was stagnant and creating only 60,000 jobs a month. Since I've taken office, it's now averaging 600,000 new jobs every month. That's the average. And one more thing. Vaccinating our children will help us keep our schools open -- keep our kids in the classroom, learning and socializing with their classmates and teachers. I think every reporter in this room who has a child understands the difference of a child going to school and having to learn from home. It matters. It matters in terms of their not just physical health, their mental health. You know, during this pandemic, we've seen just how important being in school is for our families and for our country. A year ago, we were heading into a Thanksgiving where public health were -- experts were advising against traveling or gathering with family and friends. Last Thanksgiving, for the first time, it was just four of us -- my wife and I, our daughter and her -- and my son-in-law. Later this month, our tables and our hearts are going to be filled, thanks to the vaccines. We've made incredible progress over these past nine months, but we have to keep going. The pandemic is not yes -- behind us -- yet behind us, but we're getting there. So, please -- please do your part. If you know someone who is not vaccinated, encourage them to get vaccinated. And folks -- folks who haven't gotten vaccinated yet, please get vaccinated. It's easy. It's accessible. And it's free. Get vaccinated. You can do this. May God bless you all. And I will take a few questions."

We brought out every Democrat about there was. More votes than ever has been cast for a Democratic incumbent -- I mean, not incumbent -- a Democrat running for governor. And no governor in Virginia has ever won when he is of the same -- where he or she is the same party as the sitting president. What I do know is -- I do know that people want us to get things done. They want us to get things done. And that's why I'm continuing to push very hard for the Democratic Party to move along and pass my infrastructure bill and my Build Back Better bill. I think if we -- look, think about what we -- what we're talking about here. People are upset and uncertain about a lot of things -- from COVID, to school, to jobs, to a whole range of things, and the cost of a gallon of gasoline.

I'm not talking about the COVID push right now to get vaccinated -- to get children vaccinated. About 29 million would be eligible as young as 5 now, with the CDC and FDA writing off on this, approving it for parents. It's up to them, the president says, but he hopes that they would do that. But the big news there in the end with our own Peter Doocy was this story that was out there for some time, and it had not been disputed for a number of days by the White House, that it was considering a plan to pay families for up $450,000 each if they're separated or had been separated at the border. The president seemed to make clear there was nothing to that. Why only now to clarify it in response to Peter's question is anyone's guess, but saying that there was nothing to that. In the meantime, discussing what some people have interpreted as obsession with Donald Trump and constantly mentioning him. He only says he mentions that in the context of events going on here, but was not aware of any particular number, I think, as Peter said, a couple of dozen times at one single event. But what is very clear from the president's reflection yesterday's double debacle for Democrats in a race still too close to call in the bluest of blue states in New Jersey is that he might be taking some of the responsibility for that, has no way of knowing whether the failure to get a spending package through or at least something that had a popular appeal, the bipartisan infrastructure-only package through, whether that could have made a difference. He doesn't hazard to guess. Let's go to what David Spunt at the White House of how it's handling this day-after impact of these races, because, best I can tell, David, they're full speed ahead at pushing this through. And that is even without a CBO score. So nothing's changed on their part."

      "utterance": "Nothing's changed on their part, Neil. That's exactly right. And the White House hoped to have something done before President Biden went overseas to meet with people in Scotland, to meet with world leaders to talk the climate. As far as the fallout from the Virginia gubernatorial race last night, many conservatives criticized Terry McAuliffe, who wanted to get his old job back, for repeatedly mentioning the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. They said that he was doing it too much. As you heard in Peter's question right there. President Biden mentioned Donald Trump 24 times on the campaign trail. That's what we were able to count. Biden also said to another reporter, the president said the reason he did so was because he wanted to show the juxtaposition between McAuliffe's policies and Youngkin's policies, trying to tie Youngkin to Trump. Ultimately, that did not work. Glenn Youngkin will be the next governor of Virginia. It was also pointed out to the president -- and this is notable, Neil, for our viewers -- that President Biden, Joe Biden -- candidate Biden, I should say, at the time a year ago beat then-President Donald Trump by 10 points in Virginia. The reason Biden said that happened is because he said just a few minutes ago, well, I was running against Donald Trump. So, right there, it shows that is something the White House focused on, was Donald Trump. As far as this legislation is concerned, it was on Monday when Senator Joe Manchin held this news conference, rare news conference, when the president was overseas, saying he just cannot get on board with this spending package right now. That's what the White House is going to focus on. They hoped to have something not only before Scotland, but also before this election, hoping that that could propel Terry McAuliffe to victory, but, ultimately, it did not -- Neil."

I mean, remember, he ran on COVID and on bringing the country together. And in the first couple of months, he had his big win. He got his recovery package through. Then he had a bunch of bipartisan senators sit down, go to work together, come up with a bill which passed 69 votes in the Senate for infrastructure. I mean, we have both been around a long time, Neil. How often does that happen? All you had to do was put it through the House, where there was majority support for it, take that victory. Imagine what things would have looked like in the months running up to this election if that is what Biden had done. He didn't. He also now today has failed to do it again.

That's Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, the president. You just heard him. Then you have Joe Manchin this morning saying, no, the message out of Virginia is, we need to slow down. We need to take our time with this. We need to do it the right way. We need to hold hearings and figure out what's going on. So, in a way, Neil, that's all that matters, because he's the guy that makes the call. And he has taken the message of Virginia to be one that they need to slow this down. So, Nancy Pelosi can jam this through the House. But Joe Manchin has made clear it's not getting jammed through the Senate. It's going to run on his timeline. The things he's laying out are clearly going to take a long time. And he's also made clear that whatever they're sending him is not what's going to be in the final bill. So that bill in the House, that's not the legislation. Joe's agenda has already changed."

Here's your difference right now as of 4:30 Eastern time, Neil, 16, 600 votes roughly between Murphy and Ciattarelli. This popped up a moment ago, just like in the past 30 minutes, I would say. We saw it jump couple hundred, then a couple hundred just a moment ago, too. So that may change yet again. But what are we waiting on? Why can we not make a call? We can't make a call because Ciattarelli has made this thing super tight in New Jersey. And nobody really considered that to be the case. What are we waiting on right now? This is Philadelphia down here in the southwest. It's New York up here in the northeast. This is Camden, New Jersey. Murphy's going to win the county, Neil. But we expect right now at least 15, 16 percent of the votes still outstanding. And two-thirds of that vote, we think, was cast today on election -- or was cast on Election Day. Yes. It's been a long night, as I'm sure you can tell. Up here in Essex is where you find Newark, just a short drive from us here in New York City, a heavily Democratic county, but we believe in Essex, like we have been saying for hours, 25 percent of the vote outstanding in Essex yet to be counted. Why is that? We can't say. We don't know. Is there an issue? Not confirmed. But, I mean, Neil, it goes back to the calculator question, Neil. We need to send a few their way here. Also, down in Union County, you find Summit, Westfield, New Jersey here, we think 12 percent of the vote is outstanding in Union County as well. To summarize those three places, they are blue counties, and in all likelihood, up to about 60 percent, maybe a little more than that vote, could go for Murphy over Ciattarelli, which would certainly be good news for the Democrat. We can't conclude that just yet. It's just based on some of their projections we're looking inside. This is up here in the north in Passaic County, New Jersey. Had a couple of votes come in. I think this is interesting, Neil, and I will tell you why. Had a few votes take in just a few moments ago here. Murphy, just look at the raw vote here. We did this a bit earlier today. I think it's -- I think it's fascinating, right? He's at 53,000. Ciattarelli is at 51, 500. Now I'm going to show you what came in four years ago, when Murphy won over Guadagno, OK? he was at 56,000. You see there, for the Republican, it was at 36,000. So come back to 2021 and just watch this number, do the math in your head. Well, he increases voter turnout in one county by 15,000 votes, in a blue county too, and made it very, very competitive. And I think you can -- clear that off -- you can do that, Neil, all over the state of New Jersey. Republicans came out to vote. And that was pretty evidence. You come down to the shore and you look at the percentages in Monmouth County, this is -- that's where you want to be. I mean, you can even argue Ocean County, Monmouth County, that he overperformed in these heavily Republican areas of the state. But we will see whether or not he can turn the trick, ultimately -- Neil, ."

A lot of the people we talk to out here who did vote in this race said they just did not expect it to be so close. And voters in New Jersey say that came out to specifically vote on two main issues, how they handled the COVID-19 pandemic, the governor, who's Governor Murphy, and also just figuring out a couple other things. But as those results show right now, half of the Garden State does want to replace Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. So let's get to it. These early results showing right now Governor Murphy ahead by 16,000 votes, those numbers just in, after the two candidates traded spots for first place throughout the day here. Now, Governor Murphy faced Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman and New Jersey native. Roughly 89 percent of the votes have now been counted, but the remaining votes are expected to heavily favor Democrats. In the last few weeks, Governor Murphy, who's been considered a shoo-in, in this race, has tried to rally support, bringing in Senator Bernie Sanders, former President Barack Obama and even first lady Jill Biden. Murphy held the lead early in the night, but as those results continued to pour in from other counties, Ciattarelli taking the lead for a short time there. In New Jersey, registered Democrats do outnumber for registered Republicans by more than a million. The main issues driving voters out to the poll, as I mentioned, high taxes and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic"

Democratic governors have a devil of the time generally getting reelected. It goes back to 1977. Brendan Byrne was the last Democrat reelected, I'm not saying without a problem. But that was then, very different right now. Tom Kean is among the very successful Republican governors who have been reelected. He really started it all when he barely beat, but he did beat, Jim Florio. It seems like just yesterday. Governor Kean kind enough to join us right now.

Governor Murphy is most liberal governor the state's ever elected. And he's done very liberal things. The state isn't quite ready for some of that.

What does it mean when you spend this much on so many things? And what does it mean for our future, our taxes and the future of our families? And I think to slow it down, do it right is probably the best thing to do. I mean, we can do it, fine, but do it fully following the procedures that you should follow.

New Jersey has since become, much like the nation, a very polarized state, and I'm just wondering whether you see any of that changing, and especially the way the Democrats are responding in Washington so far, not really doing the kinds of things you saw Bill Clinton do, for example, after getting humbled in his first midterm.

And there's particularly no point not talking to each other. In this country, you, our neighbors, political people in Congress, they have got to start talking to each other. Most people are well-motivated. And my experience was that, if you talk to the other party and reason with them, you can get an agreement. I did that again and again in New Jersey, and I did it with the 9/11 Commission. We were unanimous and one of the strongest recommendations of a major reform the government. And it worked. So I think -- I hope this may - - this election maybe some sign to both sides to, let's talk a bit. Let's reason together. Let's recognize that we're not badly motivated and a lot of people in both parties are well-intentioned. And so let's talk to each other and see if we can come up with some compromises.

There are other market-moving developments, including the Federal Reserve indicating today that it's finally going to begin this process of tapering. It's been buying a ton of Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, all that gooky stuff, if you will, to the tune of about $120 billion every month. It was the first sign by the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, the chairman, to say, we're going to start slicing that a little bit, $10 to $15 billion in the next couple of months, beginning next month, and slowly unwind those positions. That was not a surprise to the markets. They liked it. Didn't seem rattled by all these developments on Capitol Hill.

And I'm told that might happen. That scoring or the pricing of it is important to a lot of moderates.

Well, a couple of weeks ago, you had progressives who were saying the same thing. They were saying, don't rush this. We want to see a legislative text. We want to know what's in this bill. Obviously, their calls for a slow and steady approach were so that they could get more spending, more programs in the final package. But this really does show you how you have got a party that is fighting amongst itself. Republicans are not the boogeymen here. Instead, they're off to the sidelines. And it is Joe Biden who is going to his own party and pleading with them, just like he did last week, to give him something. He said very clearly that he thought his presidency, as well as their majorities in both the House and the Senate, could be on the line. And yet they still didn't deliver.

Other folks who were there were saying, no, I mean, we have been waiting for some time for the provisions that are going to be in this bill. And I heard from a president of a local SEIU union there, who said, I'm fine with taking a little bit more time. I think the thing that Washington, D.C., is realizing now, and the White House is especially aware of this, if they weren't before, it's that Republicans are motivated. They showed up in Virginia. They won there. And if Vice President Harris is correct, like she warned just a week ago that what could happen in Virginia could have reverberations in 2022 and then 2024 and beyond, Democrats are starting to realize this might be our last chance, because, next year, everyone is going to be off campaigning.

      "utterance": "Well, the last thing you said is absolutely right. I have said that I think Democrats have and continue to take it for granted. It's not just a question as to what votes Youngkin may have picked up. The real question is, look how many people did not vote, did not choose to vote because they felt no need to vote. One thing that a lot of people forget, the leader of the party was supposedly Ralph Northam. Also, when you hear that Terry McAuliffe says, I have got to come back and lead again, Terry McAuliffe ran for governor three times in Virginia, and never, ever got 50 percent of the vote. Think of that."

      "utterance": "So where does your leadership come from? What is that mantle that you wear? And who bestowed that upon you, to the extent that you are going to run against the three black people or two black people, particularly, the two black women and the one black man, and to say that these are the same people that you can't win without their -- people who supported them and put them in office? So, it's a combination of people not being energized and then those who are coming are in lesser numbers."

      "utterance": "Well, here in the past hour, the House of Representatives has released 2, 135 pages of bill text there before the House Rules Committee, which is the gateway to the House floor. This tees up potentially a vote on the social spending bill tomorrow, along with the infrastructure bill. However, the moderate Democrats the Blue Dog Democrats, are not happy about this. There are about five who say we want a full price tag from the Congressional Budget Office. In fact, I had one source say to me -- quote -- \"We resent it. This is only strengthening our resolve, the fact that the House is going to forge ahead and potentially vote on this bill with an unofficial score from the Congressional Budget Office.\" The House can vote without a score, but the Senate cannot, Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "And it does come down to the math. Right now, the Democrats have a three-vote margin. It'll be a little smaller today, because they will swear in a Republican who was elected. That's already been announced tomorrow, Mike Carey from Ohio."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Incredible. All right, Chad Pergram, thank you very, very much. Just leaving you with the New Jersey race still tight as a tick here. They're counting ballots. Of course, they had some double-counting going on in Union County, but it is far from resolved, that contest. We stay on it. We always are.
