But any (ph) case, save that tape for the next time some Liberal calls you a racist. Hilarious. Well East Coast opinion columnists may routinely denigrate them but Americans remain a caring, generous people, the most caring and most generous people in the world, by far. And, unfortunately, some people take advantage of that. A year ago, Mark D'Amico and Kate McClure raised over $400,000 on the GoFundMe site. They did it allegedly in the name of a man called Johnny Bobbitt. He's homeless. They said he had helped them out when they ran out of gas on the highway. Well later, Bobbitt accused the couple of keeping all that money for themselves. Now, in a new twist, authorities say the entire story was a hoax from day one and all three of them are facing charges. What can we learn from this?

But still, several big races remain unresolved at this hour. In the State of Florida, recount is ongoing. We'd have more on that in just a minute. It's pretty weird story. But perhaps, strangest of all is what is happening right now in Georgia. The race for Governor of Georgia was tight for months. You probably followed it. But it finished in the end pretty much exactly where the polls predicted it would finish. The Republican, Brian Kemp, defeated the Democrat Stacey Abrams by about 1.5 percentage points. In a big state, that is an awful lot of votes. For reasons she hasn't really explained those, Stacey Abrams has refused to accept those results. Her allies are now claiming the election was stolen."

But Democrats do not apply the same standard to themselves. When Democrats lose, there is always a reason, a reason that has nothing to do with alienating voters or getting fewer votes. It's Putin rigged the machines. The Macedonians hacked Facebook. Roger Stone sent unapproved tweets, or the perennial favorite, you're racist, all of you who didn't vote for us, you're racist, you're immoral bigots. And, of course, that's what we're hearing once again now. By the way, it's a lie. America is not a racist country. It's a kind and decent country. But the Left hopes that by calling you enough names they'll bully you into giving them more power. They always try that and sometimes it works. It might work this time.

And perhaps, you could go back even before the 1957 Civil Rights Act to the deep south, Orval Faubus, Lester Maddox, George Wallace and there's a reason for it. There are several reasons for it. But one is it works, and they were trying to delegitimize the election in advance.

Rick Scott ran up his lead through the first phase of the recount, which leaves Nelson in a position of being the political equivalent of Bruce Willis from Sixth Sense and that his career is over, he just does not know it yet, and he is playing that out. And you have more blunders in southeast Florida counties, the Democratic strongholds. You have Palm Beach County, there, the bad news is that their machines continued to - to sputter and fail and melt down. And Palm Beach County fell flat on its face and was unable to complete the recount, meaning, they just go back to their original results. If there's any good news there in Palm Beach County, it's that they're not Broward County to the south.

She finally did something right that they after all the hand wringing were able to meet the deadline to complete their recount. She said they did it with minutes to spare and as she celebrated, the bad news is she forgot they had to transmit it to the state, and then they fumbled around where the computer couldn't figure out how to do it in time, they were two minutes late.

Why is New York, which is crumbling, I'm there a lot, you may be there now, the city's falling apart. It smells. The subways break. It's disgusting. Why would the city be spending $3 billion to the richest man in the world? Why wouldn't that money go to, I don't know, fixing the subways, just throwing out there, cleaning up the streets or plowing the snow or helping the people who already live there? I'm just confused."
