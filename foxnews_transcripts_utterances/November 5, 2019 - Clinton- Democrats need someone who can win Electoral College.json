We now know these vehicles were miles apart heading in different directions. And in the first attack, one of the moms, Christina Langford Johnson, got out of her vehicle, waved her hands to show she wasn't a threat and was shot and killed anyway. A child running away also shot and killed.

She and her four children were killed, including her 8-month-old twins. A few miles away, search teams found a third vehicle with three bodies. Relatives identified them as Dawna Ray Langford and her 11 and 3-year-old children. Several other children, some badly wounded escaped that vehicle. And after hiding the smaller children in bushes, a 13-year-old boy walked 14 miles for help. The families were all breakaway Mormons, not associated with the Church of Latter-day Saints.

And Sondland remembers telling him U.S. aid to Ukraine likely wouldn't resume until the government issued an \"anti-corruption statement we had been discussing for many weeks.\" Asked about a meeting in the Oval Office with Secretary Perry and Kurt Volker, Sondland says the president directed him multiple times to talk to Rudy Giuliani. He says, he wasn't even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying talk to Rudy. Talk to Rudy. Sondland also says after Ambassador Bill Taylor texted him with that now- infamous text on September 9th saying, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with the political campaign, he called President Trump himself directly and asked him what do you want from Ukraine to which the president answered, I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. Now, Martha, the next big-ticket item for impeachment investigators here on Capitol Hill in particular with the Intelligence Committee is going to be the appearance or may or maybe not appearance of John Bolton on Thursday.

And in the first attack, one of the moms, Christina Langford Johnson, got out of her vehicle, waved her hands to show she wasn't a threat and was shot and killed anyway. A child running away also shot and killed. But Johnson's 6-month-old baby was found in a car seat, hidden on the floor of the vehicle alive. In another SUV, Rhonita Maria Miller had some car trouble it had fallen behind the other families when she was attacked near the border of Sonora. She and her four children were killed, including her 8-month-old twins. A few miles away, search teams found a third vehicle with three bodies. Relatives identified them as Dawna Ray Langford and her 11 and 3-year-old children. Several other children, some badly wounded escaped that vehicle. And after hiding the smaller children in bushes, a 13-year-old boy walked 14 miles for help. The families were all breakaway Mormons, not associated with the Church of Latter-day Saints. Most have dual citizenship and have lived in Mexico for decades. Authorities say their relative wealth once made them targets of the cartels for extortion and kidnapping. In 2009, one of the group's prominent members publicly denounced the drug traffickers and was shot and killed shortly thereafter. But experts say, it's rare for the cartels to target Americans -- it generates too much pressure. And today, President Trump tweeted, \"If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing and able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador, thanked President Trump for the offer but said Mexico would handle it. But Arkansas GOP Senator Tom Cotton, says Mexico can't handle it. Watch."

Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell, says that the newly revealed transcripts describe President Trump's quid pro quo pressure campaign against Ukraine. Also in New York, this evening, Brit Hume, and he says that he does not see that being the case given what we learned today. So, we'll talk to them both, next."

Acknowledging that he told a Ukrainian and official that U.S. aid would not resume until the country issued a corruption statement. Democrats call that revelation a clear-cut quid pro quo, but the White House is saying not so fast as more staffers are summoned. Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner poring through the stacks of documents today on all of this, she has a story for us tonight from Capitol Hill. Hi, Gillian."

      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. We're still going through them -- hundreds of pages, it'll be going on all night. But for now, we want to tell you that Ambassador Gordon Sondland revised that testimony you just mentioned with this three-page long addendum that he sent over to the Intelligence Committee yesterday. In that addendum, he said after he gave committee investigators his testimony, he then soon after remembered a meeting that he hadn't mentioned to them with a Ukrainian official. Now, that Ukrainian official was Andriy Yermak. And Sondland remembers telling him U.S. aid to Ukraine likely wouldn't resume until the government issued an \"anti-corruption statement we had been discussing for many weeks.\" Asked about a meeting in the Oval Office with Secretary Perry and Kurt Volker, Sondland says the president directed him multiple times to talk to Rudy Giuliani. He says, he wasn't even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying talk to Rudy. Talk to Rudy. Sondland also says after Ambassador Bill Taylor texted him with that now- infamous text on September 9th saying, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with the political campaign, he called President Trump himself directly and asked him what do you want from Ukraine to which the president answered, I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing. Now, Martha, the next big-ticket item for impeachment investigators here on Capitol Hill in particular with the Intelligence Committee is going to be the appearance or may or maybe not appearance of John Bolton on Thursday. He's been summoned. His lawyer hasn't so far said he's not going to appear so there is at least some reasonable chance to think he may show up. We'll keep you updated on that, of course. And then also today, Fox News confirmed Mick Mulvaney has been summoned for Friday but our sources here are telling us, you know, there's a lot of hope but not much chance he's actually going to show up."

And the arrows continue to point in the direction that the President was leading an extortion scheme. But I do think you see that there is a sharp straight line from the President to Sondland and the President to Rudy Giuliani. These two individuals are the ones asking the Ukrainians to carry out this investigation --"

      "speaker": "SWALWELL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "OK, so quid pro quo essentially. But the issue is that -- one of the issues is that the funding was released and they never did make this public statement about corruption. So that makes it a little bit more difficult to have a case of extortion if A, you're not sure that the people understood that they were being extorted and B, the issue that was the goal of that extortion never actually happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWALWELL",
      "utterance": "And I made this clear in the Volker interview, if you read the Volker transcript. And Volker acknowledges that the money was actually not released until after the whistleblower complaint had become public. So I think there's a very good argument that once impeachment is now on the table, the Volker complaint -- or the whistleblower complaint becomes public, the White House realizes they've got us, we better release it otherwise it looks really bad."

So the question is, how long does the Senate want to take. How long do the presidential candidates want to be here on the floor in the Senate instead of in Iowa or New Hampshire?

    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, looking ahead, I think it's pretty clear that he and his Republican colleagues in the Senate are now the key audience. I think it's pretty evident that the Democrats are going to go through and impeach this president. And the question then becomes, you know, what happens in the Senate? The President can afford to lose 19 Republican senators and still survive an office. I don't think there's anywhere near 19 Republican senators, if any who are prepared to vote against him so far. So that's where we are. And so when we judge these things like the Sondland transcript today and other information we're getting, I think you need to look at it in that light to -- because this is a peculiar process. It's sort of quasi-legal, quasi-political."

So that's I think where we are and I, you know, you heard McConnell. He's somewhat dismissive. They'll have to hold a trial. But at this point, I don't think that the Democrats in the House have moved the ball very far toward getting Republicans to go along and they need it."

President Trump -- I think the number is right there. 87 percent want him removed, back in 1974 71 percent. I mean, you know, I would imagine, a lot of that is a reflection of, of the times and certainly, of the strong feelings about President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, that -- and remember, that impeachment, that whole impeachment was very much a bipartisan affair. I mean, the vote -- the vote just started with 410-4. It was clear that Republicans were prepared to vote to convict if he were impeached. And Nixon saw the handwriting on the wall and resigned before that could all happen. It was a very different time. And I must say to you, Martha. I was there in Washington watching all that. And the atmosphere in the House was very different. It was a very sober proceeding. There was a sense of gravity about the whole thing. There we're not members of the House running out to the microphones after every day's events and announcing their conclusions, as you saw Eric Swalwell doing right here with you, even though he insisted he had an open mind. That wasn't how it was that that was then. That was -- and there was a sense that impeachment is a drastic step. There was a sense that, you know, it's going to be very divisive, and it has to be gone about with some care. Nancy Pelosi had it right in the beginning when she said, it's got to be bipartisan. Well, it's not. It's not a bit bipartisan at this stage."

And she said, well, now that this -- now that we have this transcript and this piece of information, it's very clear the phone -- the phone call that we need to move forward. But 59 percent of Americans in the Monmouth poll think that it would be better to just wait until the election and let people decide then."

We can turn him at office later in the year. And remember this about Nancy Pelosi. When she made the announcement, which is all it was, that this Impeachment Inquiry was getting underway, it was the night before the transcript such as it is was released. So I mean, my guess has been -- and I don't know this, but my guest has been if she'd seen the transcript ahead of time, she might not have done it."

So, he is also ahead, President Trump is ahead of Sanders in Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina. And then Elizabeth Warren polls ahead of President Trump only in Arizona. I know that's a lot of information to look at. But the overall take away is that it's very tight. My next guest who is not a big fan of Donald Trump as a candidate first time around now says he thinks this president has a clear path in 2020.

For him. They are still attainable for him. Now all the margins they are relatively small but there is a clear pattern. Biden is the strongest of the Democrats. Sanders after him.

We'll keep you close to this as we get more developments on the Kentucky governor's race. And also developing tonight, Senator Josh Hawley went to Hong Kong last month to see for himself what was happening to the protesters there under the fist of the Chinese government."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, this week, he's calling for sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials similar to the ones that have been imposed on Russia and Tehran. Officials freezing the assets of high-ranking members of the government. He also believes that a number of Chinese companies should essentially be tossed out of America. Like the company Tik Tok bought by China two years ago and used by millions of people including celebrities. Watch this. This is what it looks like."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, every parent should know about Tik Tok and should know that it's not just a social media platform. It's a platform that teenagers use now more than Facebook. And here's the problem, Martha. It's owned by a Chinese company that has ties to the Chinese government. To the communist Chinese party. And as Tik Tok scoops up massive amounts of data on our kids the communist party is able to get that data. They are able to build profiles on our children, track where they go, who their friends are, what's in their phone book. It's really alarming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you had a hearing today and you had an empty seat for Apple and an empty seat for Tik Tok. Why didn't they show up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Well because they are afraid to answer questions. Tik Tok doesn't want to answer to the fact that they take direction from Beijing. That they are exposing our kids' data to the Chinese communist government. And Apple doesn't want to answer for the fact that they are storing information in China. They are storing encryption keys in China and that, too could expose Americans' text messages or e-mails to the communist party. These are major security risks, Martha. Both of these companies need to be held accountable."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely can. And it can also include financial institutions that may be working with them in order to put the squeeze in Hong Kong. I mean, look, we know what China is capable of. China has been stealing our jobs for years. Now they want to silence Hong Kong. They want to project power all across the region. And ultimately, Martha, they want to shut us out. They want to shut us out so that we can't trade, so that we can't sell our products. We cannot allow that to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, talk to me a little bit about, you know, the larger picture here. You say that China is the Berlin of the times that we're living in. And, you know, there is a sense with the NBA scandal and all of that that people are starting to look at what China is doing in this country very differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, Hong Kong I think really represents the battle of the future. We are in for a long struggle with China. And the truth is we probably have already given up too much ground already. By we, I really mean the U.S. government. Washington has been asleep at the switch for years. They have thought that China was our friend. That China could be liberalized. None of that has happened. They have stolen our jobs. They have stolen our property. Now they want to shut us out of whole regions and one day they want to dominate the world. We cannot allow that to happen. We have got to get tough with them. Hong Kong shows what the battle of the future is going to look like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. But obviously, you know, there is a lot of business, a lot of trade that goes on with China. We're trying to get a trade deal with them. How much support do you think you are going to get for trying to impose sanctions and freeze the assets of the leadership when all of those things are at play?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it speaks to the need to keep pressure up on the Chinese government. Pressure is what they understand, Martha. The sweet- talking they don't respond to. They will make a deal with you, and then hood wink you behind your back. I mean, that is -- that's not the way to deal with China. You have got to get tough with them. The president understands this. I mean, the president's tough measure is what has brought Beijing to the negotiating table. And this, I think, is sanctioning them for their bad behavior in Hong Kong, for their repression in Hong Kong helps keep the pressure up."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, this week, renewed interest in whether serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in prison or whether he was offed by somebody who wanted him dead. A lot of people may fall into that category given the number of high-profile people who partied with and may have partaken in his obsession with underaged girls who say that they were sex slaves in his bizarre world. Then this video surfaces from Project Veritas in which ABC anchor Amy Robach says that ABC, quote, \"quashed her exclusive with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre who said she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when was 17.\" Fox News is not able to independently verify this following video."

      "speaker": "ROBACH",
      "utterance": "I've had the story for three years. I've had interview with Virginia Roberts. We would not put it on the air. First of all, I was told who Jeffrey Epstein. No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story. Then the Palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways. We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate and Will, that we -- that also quashed “The Story.” She told me everything. She had pictures. She had everything. It was unbelievable what we had Clinton. We had everything. Do I think he was killed? A hundred percent. Yes, I do. Because you want -- he made his whole living blackmailing people. There are a lot of men in those planes a lot of men who visited that island. A lot of powerful men who came into that apartment."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "ABC and Robach released statements today essentially saying that “The Story” wasn't ready for air. She said that and they said that as well not fully vetted. ABC has still not run all these years later and he is dead now the original Robach Giuffre interview. Let's bring in Jesse Watters, host of Watters' world and co-host of The Five. Jesse, what do you think of all of this?"

    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, HOST",
      "utterance": "It's a sickening and wicked scandal. And ABC news has to hire an independent investigator to get to the bottom of this. And they have to answer one big question. How many children were raped in the last three years since they spiked this story? Because as Amy says, she had witnesses. She had victims. She had photographic evidence with a Bill Clinton connection and a British royal family connection. And ABC News said that did not meet their editorial standards. What are those standards? I want them to come clean because they went after Brett Kavanaugh with 40-year-old hearsay, with no corroborating witnesses, no evidence, and a lot of that was furnished by Michael Avenatti, a scoundrel, a bankrupt tax cheat, who brought forth gang rape allegations with no evidence. So, what were those standards that allowed that to get on air? I'd like to know. And it looks like the play was we don't get access to royal family interviews on GM."

      "utterance": "But Jeffrey Epstein was, you know, linked to many powerful people for years. I mean, he wouldn't be a household name necessarily but that executives at ABC and New York City had no idea who he was, I find very difficult to believe. I mean, it also smacks of a lot of similarities of what we saw with the Weinstein story --"

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- and I think that these institutions, these corporations need to ask themselves who are we and what are we when this story comes to us and we don't air it? I mean, Roberta (Ph) -- the Virginia Roberts, you know, that story on what she had alone, the pictures she had of her and her story. How many stories do you see on ABC and NBC and everywhere where it's just, you know, this is her story. This is what she says. You can back it up. You can investigate the other side of “The Story” and say that we can't corroborate this. There is a lot of ways to get at a story like that. And as you rightly point out, none of those hoops were jumped through with the Brett Kavanaugh story."

      "utterance": "That doesn't look good. But, also, this isn't being mentioned but Hillary Clinton three years ago was in the midst of a presidential campaign. And if ABC drops a devastating blow against her husband in the midst of this campaign, that's going to blow back big on ABC News. Remember, they thought Hillary was going to win the White House. And they didn't want to jeopardize that relationship. They wanted to be on the right side of history. Now they are on the wrong side of history, and it's a tragedy if this is true."

We have had sort of three different data points this week of people raising questions about whether or not Jeffrey Epstein took his own life. And when you go back and you look at this and you look at the people and, you know, some of the names that you mentioned who, you know we know were on the plane and went to the island. We have no, you know, there is no evidence about none of these women have said that they were with Bill Clinton. But it's part of the story that he was on that plane absolutely. So, it raises questions about whether or not somebody had him killed. Michael Baden went on and he is, you know, full disclosure, is he doing work for Jeffrey Epstein's brother, but he a very renowned forensic -- forensic scientist. He said that he saw signs that he was perhaps, that he took -- that he didn't take his own life."
