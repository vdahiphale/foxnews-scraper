The president will be hosted by Prime Minister May at Winston Churchill's ancestral home, Blenheim Palace at a black-tie dinner tomorrow evening and then it is down to business on Friday with the prime minister, and then he will have a private meeting with Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle, and nobody but those flies on the wall will know what happens in there.

Theresa May, who you would probably never describe as a rabid fan of the president spoke out tonight at a NATO dinner fully supporting the president's engagement with Vladimir Putin. Let's put up on the screen what Theresa May said in part, \"I welcome President Trump's forthcoming meeting with President Putin, open channels of communication between the U.S. and Russia are key to managing the risks of confrontation.\" A stark difference there from what the president has been hearing from his critics back home. Mostly, Democrats among them saying that the president should not sit down with Putin, that he's cozying up to Russia, that it's the wrong thing to do.

So, President Trump, essentially, Marie, and let me start with you. Calling for a new world order in the post-World War II, post-Cold War era that we're all living in. He's essentially saying to the nations in Europe and to the members of NATO, \"Look, you're on your own, you've got to pull your weight, you have to pay into this alliance.\" And you know, you should think twice about entering into these deep economic connection relationships between Germany and Russia."

That is a very concerning move, it's very hurtful to U.S. national security. And look, we don't have allies as savors, we don't sign up to NATO and contribute to our mission because we're being nice to European countries, we do it because we have shared security interests and shared values. And Donald Trump is sending a signal both to our friends, but more importantly to our adversaries like Russia that if he wants to threaten Europe, we not -- we may not stand by Europe, we may not come in and stand up to Russia if he wants -- if Putin wants to push further and further into Eastern Europe like he's been doing. Martha, I'm going to be looking at the tone coming out of the Putin meeting next week and contrasting it with what we saw today. Today, he was very tough on our allies, and if he says really nice things about Putin that will be concerning to me."

And look, the real fact is, Europe should pay more. We know in Britain that we've been exceeding the two percent target for the last few years. We know that most European nations haven't, it's as much an issue for us as it is for the U.S. The European partners within NATO pay for the collective defense that we know we need for transatlantic security. So, I think it's actually quite refreshing to have a president who's willing to actually mention what he wants and bang his fist on the table and say, come on guys, enough excuses, pay-off, this is collective defense, this is what you said you're going to do, now do it."

You can't have a situation where you're taking energy from Russia, then stating it's the principal enemy you're defending against, not putting the money into the alliance you're supposed to be supporting, and going back to taking the energy, it does leave you a bit of a hostage. I'm not sure I agree with the word occupation in this contest, but I would say it's a hostage situation. The Russians can turn off the taps at any time they want to, and it makes it very difficult for the Germans to have any credibility on this issue, particularly, when they are spending so little on defense. This is the biggest economy in Europe, one of the big three in the world. What's going on that it is not spending this amount of money on a very simple pledge to get up to two percent and indeed beyond that? We need the Germans to contribute more."

Now, the U.K. is an exception to that and they have been spending to the two percent and they should probably go to a little higher as well but at least they're meeting their commitment and that's why there's such a valuable ally to the U.S."

They obviously need a fresh look and nobody really had the courage to do that because there's certain risks to doing any of that. And why would you spend your presidency trying to look at all these old agreements? But I think his rationale is that it helps the American people and it helps us through both security and prosperity and he talks about jobs, jobs, jobs. A lot of these agreements in his -- in his opinion have led to the jobs leaving the country and going elsewhere and he wants to bring those jobs back.

But what Rod Rosenstein is doing is saying all hands on deck, I need 100 lawyers working on this so that we can go through this and get it ready so the Senate can confirm him. So the Democrats can't have it both ways. They can't complain on one hand that there is such a voluminous record that we can't consider -- that we can consider it and then complain that Rod Rosenstein is pulling all these career lawyers in to do this vetting. And the vetting is not political. So this is what's called a privilege and relevance review. What that means is career lawyers go through and see what record -- go through all the records and see what can and cannot be shared with Congress. Sp there are certain things that are executive privilege. There are certain things that are not relevant to the confirmation. He worked in the White House for a long time so his communications with the president are privileged, for example. So what they are doing is doing a nonpolitical review of what is privilege, what is not privilege, what can be shared, what cannot be shared, and later there's a political review that's not done by career lawyers, that are done by political appointees that are helping him through that confirmation. This is standard operating procedure. It's just there's more of it. And so they need more lawyers to do it well."

Now they don't have a filibuster when they should have saved it for Kennedy's replacement they would have a filibuster right now and some power. So they've completely denuded themselves in this process and as long as Republicans stick together, which all signs are they will, he's going to get confirmed. So they are flailing. They are looking for issues, they are looking for anything they can come up with whether it's his name or some law reviews article that he wrote from a long time ago, they will try to throw anything at him because they understand the stakes in this confirmation are not just -- Gorsuch just secured Scalia's seat and the conservative majority with Kennedy as the swing vote. This is now replacing a swing vote with a solid -- a conservative in the mold of Gorsuch and Scalia and that's going to change the court for a generation and so they are -- and they are powerless to stop it, so they are flailing everything they can add it.

And we were talking about this earlier in terms of President Trump's vision for kind of remaking and throwing the chess board up in the air and saying, you know what, your pieces aren't necessarily where they've always been and you are going to have to get used to that. Do you think that he is working to reorder our alliances with Europe and with the U.K.?"

      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "You know what he said is pretty straightforward, isn't it? Now previous American presidents have said this, but they've never actually meant it. The point about Trump is when he says something he does mean it. Yes, Donald Trump is looking at reshaping the world in many ways and he's being rather successful with it. I think this visit could turn out for Mrs. May to be very embarrassing indeed. Because one of the worst things she's done, she's made a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K., now virtually impossible. So her Brexit deal affects not just our democracy but some American interests as well. It's going to be a very interesting couple of days."

This is a club, whether you are big or small as a country, you all pay 2 percent. She could have been the bridge, the broker between Trump and the rest of Europe. She blew the opportunity and I will be honest with you, you know, I think in my own view this is the worst prime minister we've seen in my lifetime."

It's made their lives very tough. I think in terms of the conservative party now, Boris clearly wants the job and that's why if Trump meets him when he's here it will be a big thing."

      "utterance": "I mean, I think the way I've always looked at these protests is it's one of the reasons that these two countries, the U.S. and the U.K. are so close, it's because we have the freedoms that we have all fought for. And one of the freedoms we have is freedom of speech and the freedom to express your views. And I know that that's valued very highly over here. And people can disagree strongly and still go out to dinner."

      "utterance": "Changing people's mind is a very temporary thing. I think long term people have a lot of confidence in the U.S. They love this country, they love the U.S. and the relationship is long and close and enduring based on trust and history and language and all the things that each party brings to the table. So I think ultimately it's going to be very, very successful."

      "utterance": "Well, the queen is very experienced in meeting presidents. She has met every president since Harry Truman as queen. So she knows. She knows what she's doing and it's going to be a great experience for him. It's going to be one that he'll really cherish, meeting the queen. She has been at it for 65 years. She's a true professional. And a great leader in her position. So, that's what it is."

The president will be hosted by Prime Minister May at Winston Churchill's ancestral home, Blenheim Palace at a black-tie dinner tomorrow evening and then it is down to business on Friday with the prime minister, and then he will have a private meeting with Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle, and nobody but those flies on the wall will know what happens in there. So joining me now, Nile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation. And Capri Cafaro, the executive in residence at American University School of Public Affairs, and a Washington Examiner contributor. Welcome to both of you. Great to have you here tonight. So, sort of two parts to this discussion. Nile, in terms of the protest, we've heard a lot. We know that that residence is surrounded with very high fences at this point for security. What do you do you anticipate?"

Some of them certainly will try and commit acts of violence here in London but I think the authorities are very well prepared. But I do think the vast majority of the British people believe strongly the Anglo-American special relationship and will give a warm welcome actually to the United States president who is of course a great friend of Great Britain. But without a doubt we are going to see some scenes of disruption on the streets of London and that's to be expected with the visit of any U.S. president here."

    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that there's a number of factors that play here. I mean, when you take a look at, for example, some of the interface between President Trump and the G7 at the meeting in Quebec. If you look at sort of the backdrop of how President Trump has interacted with NATO allies, for example. I think that there is a bit of a hesitation, not just in the United Kingdom, but you know, across our European allies, the traditional post- World War II allies that have really sort of created that stability globally are now questioning where does the United States stand as far as a long-term alliance is concerned? There is no question that the British people, the United Kingdom, and the American people will have the special relationship for generations to come, but right now I think that there is some tension here. I have faith that they will be peaceful protests, but there's no question there is going to be some acrimony."

She's also very curious about people. I think she's going to be very curious, is my guess, to meet Donald Trump and to have a discussion with him. What do you think, Nile?"

    {
      "speaker": "GARDINER",
      "utterance": "I think she will certainly be very much looking forward to this meeting actually. The queen of course is one of the greatest leaders on the world stage and she's meeting today with the -- tomorrow actually with the leader of the free world. So I think that, you know, this is a highly significant meeting. I think that, you know, you're dealing with two characters with tremendous charisma and I think this is going to be a tremendous meeting actually. So I'm very much looking forward and I'm sure the queen is looking forward to this."

He will be with me tomorrow night exclusively as well at 7 p.m. And as the president sits down with Prime Minister Theresa May, we are reminded of the words Winston Churchill and our quote of the night. He coined the phrase special relationship and offer this advice. \"Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. It is also what it takes to sit down and listen.\" \"The Story\" continues tomorrow night live from London at 7 p.m. Eastern. Tucker Carlson is up next in D.C.
