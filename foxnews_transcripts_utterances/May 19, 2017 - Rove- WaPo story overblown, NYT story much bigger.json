This news coming as President Trump embarks from the first overseas trip of his administration. And we get brand-new reports concerning the Russia investigation and the president's firing of James Comey, threatened to overshadow his efforts to focus on policy. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Martha MacCallum tonight. And this is \"The Story\" on Friday, May 19th. Right now, President Trump and the First Lady are in route to Saudi Arabia. The first of a nine-day tour that will take them across the Middle East and Western Europe for meetings with dozens of world leaders focusing on key issues such as ISIS, Mid-east peace, and Russian aggression. But no sooner had they left, then apparent reports hit the Internet, from the New York Times, suggesting: President Trump told the Russians that Comey's dismissal ease pressure on him from the investigation. And perhaps, more significantly tonight, the Washington Post now saying one of the president's current advisors is considered a person of interest in the Russian probe. In moments, we will be joined by Karl Rove and Marie Harf, but we begin first with Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts who is live in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where the president will be touching down in just hours from now.

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Sandra, good evening to you from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A couple of big bombshells just before the president left. Clearly, he was hoping to leave behind the controversy when he got on air force one headed for the Middle East, but the New York Times carrying that story today that in his discussions with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, the president alleged said that the White House is not disputing this, that firing James Comey took a lot of pressure off of him in regards to Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, allegedly referring to James Comey as a \"crazy person; a nut job.\" Again, the White House's not disputing that language but the Press Secretary Sean Spicer just before he left putting out this statement: \"the president has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria, Ukraine, defeating ISIS, and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people by grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The other story that you alluded to in the Washington Post; sources telling the Washington Post that investigators have identified a \"person of interest\" in regard to the Russia investigation who was inside the White House and close to the president. Sean Spicer issuing this statement, pushing back against that same quote, \"As the president has stated before, a thorough investigation will confirm that there is no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity.\" Now, a suggestion from the Washington Post as to who that \"person of interest\" might be, but two newspapers in the U.K.: the Independent and the Guardian is suggesting that person is Ivanka Trump's husband Jared Kushner. Now, no one is suggesting that it is Kushner except for those two newspapers. But what we do know is that Kushner was in touch with a lot of foreign leaders during the transition and during the campaign, trying to establish relationships that they would build on when the president was inaugurated. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And among the people that he was talking to where Russian officials; we do know that he and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was about to become the National Security Advisor, had at least one meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the United States. We are also expecting, also Sandra, that the president might name a new FBI Director before he winged his way east here. He did not do that, but now focusing on this big tour, very ambitious first foreign trip. When you compare it to Presidents from Ronald Reagan on, those Presidents would typically just cross the border into Canada or Mexico for their first foreign trip. President Trump will be here in Saudi Arabia. He's going from here to Israel, then to the Vatican, then to Belgium, then back to Rome, where he'll be in Sicily for the G7. Here in Saudi Arabia, he's expected to get a very, very warm welcome. Saudi Arabia loves the fact that he wants to be tough on terror. They also very much appreciate the fact that like the many Arab States and many of the United States Arab allies, they see Iran as an existential threat. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the president's bringing with them $110 billion arms packages to Saudi Arabia that will count as the biggest U.S. Arms deal ever. And the president may also make some history on Monday, Sandra, when he leaves Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, bound for Tel Aviv if the schedule is as it is now and doesn't include a stop somewhere between. The president may make the first publicly announced direct flights from Saudi Arabia to Israel. Sandra? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Well, first of all, minor disagreement with John Roberts, who said the Washington Post story did not echo what the two British newspapers did and sort of suggested it's Jared Kushner. I disagree with him. The only White House official, current White House official, who's named in the Washington Post article is Jared Kushner. So, they're -- they didn't say he was the subject person of interest, but they used his name. Let's be clear about this, though. Person of interest in an investigation like this means it's somebody that the FBI wants to talk to. There's a big difference and a long distance between that and being the subject of an investigation. And an even bigger distance to be the target of the investigation. So, I think the Washington Post story is a little bit overblown. Of course, they're going to talk to Kushner. He talked to Kislyak in November, he talked with officials the Russian bank that is connected to the state. He omitted these from a document that he had to fill out. Quickly told the FBI and told security officials that he had filed it prematurely and amended it quickly with these visits on it. But I think this is a relatively small ball.

And Democrats will be trying to say, why don't you join with us in condemning President Trump and building a bill of particulars against him, like you did against Hillary Clinton even though you refused to indict her, you trashed her reputation, why don't you join us in trashing his reputation? And it'll be interesting to see how Comey reacts to it all. I do want to say one other thing, though, before we leave the subject entirely. There's another part of the New York Times story that is troubling. These notes were taken from a meeting where they were four U.S. officials: the president, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and the National Security Advisor.

In fact, I would point out to Chris' point, there are two -- the two biggest mistakes that Trump has made as president so far, hiring Flynn and firing Comey, both of those were decisions where the vice president was kept out of the loop. So I think maybe the lesson to be learned here is that he should bring Vice President Pence into the loop. Pence is known around Washington, D.C., for his integrity. He is widely respected on Capitol Hill.

It seems bizarre to me that the head of the transition and the incoming vice president wouldn't know anything about this candidate to be the NSA. But it is a terrible idea to cut your vice president out of the loop, particularly because the coin of the realm inside the White House for the vice president is loyalty, particularly in the first term.

They all have to think this way. Pence has to think about it in slightly more real terms than others have. So that's part one. Part two is the fact that come 2020 or 2024, he's going to be in a position where he is the automatic front runner for the Republican nomination. If Donald Trump decides not to run -- abandons his run for a second term, or at the end of two terms, Pence is the guy, he's somebody who thought about running for president in 2016, opted against it, took a ride on the Trump train, and now is in a position where that is supposed to pay off in some terms for him for his future. And it's not unreasonable for want to do it.

He then dissolved into tears and told the court that from the time he was in congress he had compulsively sought attention from women who contacted him in social media, engaging in both sexual and nonsexual conversation. He went on to say that he's coming to grips with the depth of his sickness. Then in reference to his contact last year with a 15-year-old North Carolina girl, Weiner said, quoting here, I engaged in the same communications with this teenager, including sharing explicit images and encouraging her to engage in sexually explicit conduct. The guilty plea means that Anthony Weiner will now have to register as a sex offender where he works and lives, and he could face up to ten years in prison or no prison time at all. It's entirely up to a judge. But federal prosecutors say when Weiner is sentenced on September 8 he will likely get between 24 and 27 months. For now, the former congressman is free on bail. Producers inside the courtroom say during the hearing Weiner was wearing his wedding ring, and while he was pleading guilty, he's estrange wife, Huma Abedin filed divorce papers in Manhattan Supreme Court. Our corporate cousin, the New York Post, is reporting that the filing is uncontested, meaning she's not expecting to fight over child custody or the couples' assets. Remember, it was during the Weiner investigation when the FBI seized his laptop and found a trove of emails including classified information from Huma Abedin, a top Hillary Clinton aide. The information lead to the October surprise where then FBI Director James Comey announced he was reopening the Clinton email investigation. Nothing came of the emails, but Hillary Clinton still thinks it cost her the election. Sandra?",

But the most devastating part about this case is going to be when he's released and he registers as a sex offender because that means no more political future and probably no more employment future at all. So being able to collect your life after registering as a sex offender, believe me, I've had clients in this category before and it's extremely difficult for them.

      "utterance": "Sandra, good evening to you from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A couple of big bombshells just before the president left. Clearly, he was hoping to leave behind the controversy when he got on air force one headed for the Middle East, but the New York Times carrying that story today that in his discussions with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, the president alleged said that the White House is not disputing this, that firing James Comey took a lot of pressure off of him in regards to Russia. Also, allegedly referring to James Comey as a \"crazy person; a nut job.\" Again, the White House's not disputing that language but the Press Secretary Sean Spicer just before he left putting out this statement: \"the president has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria, Ukraine, defeating ISIS, and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people by grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.\" The other story that you alluded to in the Washington Post; sources telling the Washington Post that investigators have identified a \"person of interest\" in regard to the Russia investigation who was inside the White House and close to the president. Sean Spicer issuing this statement, pushing back against that same quote, \"As the president has stated before, a thorough investigation will confirm that there is no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity.\" Now, a suggestion from the Washington Post as to who that \"person of interest\" might be, but two newspapers in the U.K.: the Independent and the Guardian is suggesting that person is Ivanka Trump's husband Jared Kushner. Now, no one is suggesting that it is Kushner except for those two newspapers. But what we do know is that Kushner was in touch with a lot of foreign leaders during the transition and during the campaign, trying to establish relationships that they would build on when the president was inaugurated. And among the people that he was talking to where Russian officials; we do know that he and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was about to become the National Security Advisor, had at least one meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador to the United States. We are also expecting, also Sandra, that the president might name a new FBI Director before he winged his way east here. He did not do that, but now focusing on this big tour, very ambitious first foreign trip. When you compare it to Presidents from Ronald Reagan on, those Presidents would typically just cross the border into Canada or Mexico for their first foreign trip. President Trump will be here in Saudi Arabia. He's going from here to Israel, then to the Vatican, then to Belgium, then back to Rome, where he'll be in Sicily for the G7. Here in Saudi Arabia, he's expected to get a very, very warm welcome. Saudi Arabia loves the fact that he wants to be tough on terror. They also very much appreciate the fact that like the many Arab States and many of the United States Arab allies, they see Iran as an existential threat. And the president's bringing with them $110 billion arms packages to Saudi Arabia that will count as the biggest U.S. Arms deal ever. And the president may also make some history on Monday, Sandra, when he leaves Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, bound for Tel Aviv if the schedule is as it is now and doesn't include a stop somewhere between. The president may make the first publicly announced direct flights from Saudi Arabia to Israel. Sandra?"

Well, first of all, minor disagreement with John Roberts, who said the Washington Post story did not echo what the two British newspapers did and sort of suggested it's Jared Kushner. I disagree with him. The only White House official, current White House official, who's named in the Washington Post article is Jared Kushner. So, they're -- they didn't say he was the subject person of interest, but they used his name. Let's be clear about this, though. Person of interest in an investigation like this means it's somebody that the FBI wants to talk to. There's a big difference and a long distance between that and being the subject of an investigation. And an even bigger distance to be the target of the investigation. So, I think the Washington Post story is a little bit overblown. Of course, they're going to talk to Kushner. He talked to Kislyak in November, he talked with officials the Russian bank that is connected to the state. He omitted these from a document that he had to fill out. Quickly told the FBI and told security officials that he had filed it prematurely and amended it quickly with these visits on it. But I think this is a relatively small ball. The New York Times story, though, is much bigger, though."

But the direct connection between -- I've faced great pressure because of Russia and that's taken off?

And I think, it's actually -- I agree with most of what Karl said about the New York Times story. I think it's a little worse than just be, you know, \"I'll have some more flexibility\" that President Obama got caught saying? This is the fact that he seems to be telling the Russians directly that I fired him for this reason and now it's taking the pressure off me. You know, I can't imagine what it's like on that plane tonight, where they're out of -- you know, out of the press world, they are leaving D.C. Getting out of the bubble here, in some ways could be good for the administration, but they will feel very far removed especially if these stories keep coming out on what we've seen now a daily basis while they are not able to respond quickly."

And if so, why didn't you alert Justice Department officials and resign? And Democrats will be trying to say, why don't you join with us in condemning President Trump and building a bill of particulars against him, like you did against Hillary Clinton even though you refused to indict her, you trashed her reputation, why don't you join us in trashing his reputation?

Those notes were circulated, I think Marie would back me up on this, the likelihood of that being widely circulated is small. Only a small number of people at the State Department and the National Security Council would have access to this. And the idea that private notes from a Presidential meeting like this would be circulated. This is in violation of several laws and they better find out who's doing this kind of stuff, because just as they could leak this to the press, somebody could also leak this to an adversary -- leaked details of the White House meeting to our adversaries in private. Just as easy as they could link this to the public to the Washington Post and to New York Times."

And going back to the news that we just heard about, that Comey will be testifying, this is going to be a much watch T.V., a congressional hearing that I haven't -- I can't remember the last time there were would be so much attention on a congressional hearing. And I totally agree with Karl, we need answers. It will be very interesting to see how Jim Comey plays this hearing, how forthcoming he is, and what he actually reveals. This will be fascinating.

Certainly, for a first overseas visit by a President, given the fact it's nine days; it's two regions of the world; it's four countries involved, but clearly, in my judgment, what makes it historic is simply this: he is placing the United States back on the world stage as a global leader promoting stability and security. He's rolling for the counter on our adversaries. He's going to talk defeating ISIS, not only in the Middle East with our allies there but also with our European allies. He's going to discuss his willingness not just to deter the Iranians and the Russians, but his willingness to confront them. And he's going to reassure our allies that the United States has got their back that the problems they had with the Obama administration are over. That is very significant. The second thing is, and it's quite surprising, and I think is a great idea on their part, is they are going to the centers of the three great religions in the world on one single visit. And at the same time, standing up and saying there's evil in the world, the evil is radical Islam, and we need your help to defeat it.

I think most of the American people really don't care, number one; and I don't believe our allies care very much at all. They are motivated by their own self-interest. I think they recognize that this President has political chaos surrounding him. And they certainly don't want him to be weakened by that, particularly, when they recognize that they have a strong ally again in the United States. They are focused on their interest, and I think we're going to go there and talk to them about the mutual interest that we have together, and that's what's going to get their attention."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Listen -- absolutely, not. And here's the reason, Sandra: there hasn't been a President since World War II that's facing the challenges that this President is facing. We have global security and challenges that exceed on a scale that anything we've faced since the rise of the Soviet Union. So, this President is facing radical Islam that's gone into a global Jihad. He's got three adversary countries that are trapped in our interest: China, Iran, and Russia. We got a rogue nation in North Korea that's threatening to use nuclear weapons against our allies and the United States. And we've got a cyber- offensive attack that's using cyber espionage to take down information and also to take our intellectual property. No President has faced anything on a scale like that for some time. And the fact that he's looking at it straight in the eyes and says, \"I'm going after this. I'm going right after the problem.\" I think, I think it's courageous and I think it's bold on his part to do it."

And yet, these are \"bombshells.\" No, they're not. They're just more of the left-wing hatred for Trump. Trump was clear on CBS News; he told Lester Holt, he wanted to fire Comey, he thinks Comey was irresponsible. You know, now you have the leak that says, gosh, Trump actually meant what he said on CBS. This stuff is just -- all of those are done by the left, and there's a Harvard study out that shows there is more media hostility to Donald Trump than any president in modern American industry; tonight, to note, is an example. They could've said, the president leaves on a historic trip to bring into the Arab world to fight terrorism. President leaves on a historic trip to go to Israel and meet with both Palestinians and Jewish leaders. President goes on a historic trip to meet the Pope. Oh, no, they come up with garbage in order to smear the president as he leaves the country. I think it's disgusting.

But now that he's been fired -- I mean, how many people that somebody you fire turns around and decide they don't like you? So, if Comey had a beef, didn't he have an obligation to tell Congress? He appeared before congress; he was asked questions. Has any effort then to stop this? No, there has not been an effort.

Joe Lieberman's law firm has represented Donald Trump since 2001, and that is a very clear conflict of interest.

And he has done stuff like campaign with John McCain who is a noted never Trump Republican. So I don't think the idea is that he is not independent enough from Trump. I think what's really going on is that Democrats have done a really good job of obstructing anything that comes out of the Trump White House, and they would like to keep Andrew McCabe in as acting FBI director. He's someone who has very big problems with independence, and that his wife ran for office in Virginia. She was funded by people with very close ties to Hillary Clinton's campaign. He also chose may be a little bit of a pattern in following in Comey's footsteps, slow walking this Russia probe. So that I think might be the bigger goal in Democratic obstruction of Lieberman."

I'm very personally very concerned by the fact that attorney general Jeff Sessions and, frankly, Donald Trump himself both who are the focus or part of the investigation into the campaign of Donald Trump, why they are being allowed to put forward names like this to run the investigation into the campaign they're a part of. I think is very problematic. There've been a couple of very elegant solutions that have been put forward in the past. For example, the senate judiciary committee coming up with names.

What's interesting is Vice President Pence's advisors say that they're frustrated, they're offended by all of this talk of impeachment among Democrats already. But also frustrated by this chatter among Republicans that may be the vice president would be a stronger conservative at the top than President Trump is. In fact, people close to the vice president telling us over the last 24 hours that all of this is nonsense, that he is focused on pushing the president's agenda on Capitol Hill where Pence has used his experience from the house to be a big help in moving forward legislation like health care reform. Though, social media was abuzz today over these pictures of the vice president showing the president and vice president and first lady off before their first foreign trip and standing there alone, staying behind, may be to run things for a few days. Because in an unusual move, Pence has just started his own political action committee, the Great America PAC. That is something that neither Joe Biden nor Dick Cheney ever did while they were in office. Pence advisor, Nick Ayers, stresses this is a way to raise money for Republicans in the 2018 midterms and help President Trump saying, quote, he wants to support house and senate members who are helping pass the president's agenda. Pence, though, could also be collecting chips for higher office beyond vice president, a topic that top Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan do not want to engage on."

In fact, I would point out to Chris' point, there are two -- the two biggest mistakes that Trump has made as president so far, hiring Flynn and firing Comey, both of those were decisions where the vice president was kept out of the loop. So I think maybe the lesson to be learned here is that he should bring Vice President Pence into the loop. Pence is known around Washington, D.C., for his integrity. He is widely respected on Capitol Hill.

It seems bizarre to me that the head of the transition and the incoming vice president wouldn't know anything about this candidate to be the NSA. But it is a terrible idea to cut your vice president out of the loop, particularly because the coin of the realm inside the White House for the vice president is loyalty, particularly in the first term. Many times, vice presidents will run for president, you know, halfway through the second term. But at this point, four months into this nascent administration, he better be rolling in the same direction, or else they have a serious problem."

      "utterance": "Well, look, I think, obviously, when you get to a point -- and there has been a lot of overheated discussion about the 25th amendment and will there be impeachment or will there be all that, but I think it's not unreasonable to say that Mike Pence probably has to think about the possibility that he might have to assume the office of the presidency for some reason at some point. They all have to think this way. Pence has to think about it in slightly more real terms than others have. So that's part one. Part two is the fact that come 2020 or 2024, he's going to be in a position where he is the automatic front runner for the Republican nomination. If Donald Trump decides not to run -- abandons his run for a second term, or at the end of two terms, Pence is the guy, he's somebody who thought about running for president in 2016, opted against it, took a ride on the Trump train, and now is in a position where that is supposed to pay off in some terms for him for his future. And it's not unreasonable for want to do it. But the caution is this, if Donald Trump gets to think that Mike Pence -- thinking he's a bigger deal, or he's against him, or whatever, you know what happens in this White House where people with the president think are not for him is a (INAUDIBLE)."

      "speaker": "CONANT",
      "utterance": "Well, it is a real risk, absolutely. I mean, look, Mike Pence is a loyal guy. He and Donald Trump have been through some really tough fights over the last year and gotten through them together. And I don't think there's any reason to believe that they won't get through this together. However, if the facts go against Donald Trump here and impeachment becomes a real thing, I do think you're going to see members of congress say, look, I'm not going to vote for impeachment, but I would vote for President Pence. So I think that is the long-term threat, but we are a long way from there. And hopefully, the facts as they come out will exonerate the president from any wrongdoing."

Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with this story. Trace?"

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Hi, Sandra. Because this was a plea agreement, the judge asked Anthony Weiner if he was pleading guilty because he is guilty. Weiner responded, quote, I am guilty, your honor. He then dissolved into tears and told the court that from the time he was in congress he had compulsively sought attention from women who contacted him in social media, engaging in both sexual and nonsexual conversation. He went on to say that he's coming to grips with the depth of his sickness. Then in reference to his contact last year with a 15-year-old North Carolina girl, Weiner said, quoting here, I engaged in the same communications with this teenager, including sharing explicit images and encouraging her to engage in sexually explicit conduct. The guilty plea means that Anthony Weiner will now have to register as a sex offender where he works and lives, and he could face up to ten years in prison or no prison time at all. It's entirely up to a judge. But federal prosecutors say when Weiner is sentenced on September 8 he will likely get between 24 and 27 months. For now, the former congressman is free on bail. Producers inside the courtroom say during the hearing Weiner was wearing his wedding ring, and while he was pleading guilty, he's estrange wife, Huma Abedin filed divorce papers in Manhattan Supreme Court. Our corporate cousin, the New York Post, is reporting that the filing is uncontested, meaning she's not expecting to fight over child custody or the couples' assets. Remember, it was during the Weiner investigation when the FBI seized his laptop and found a trove of emails including classified information from Huma Abedin, a top Hillary Clinton aide. The information lead to the October surprise where then FBI Director James Comey announced he was reopening the Clinton email investigation. Nothing came of the emails, but Hillary Clinton still thinks it cost her the election. Sandra?"

      "utterance": "Yeah, it was nice to hear -- I'm not sure if either of you have seen the documentary, Weiner, but it was powerful in exposing how sick this man actually is, and what a fall from grace we've seen now. You know he used to be a real hot shot on Capitol Hill, and represented his district while here in New York City, and was a big fan favorite, and potentially could have ended up being mayor of New York or maybe something bigger after that. So it's incredibly sad to see this all unfold like this. And you know, at the same time that we're discussing James Comey now every 2 minutes, it's interesting to revisit the impact that the letter had on the election."

    {
      "speaker": "DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. What a surprise there. What an irony there. Well, you know what, there could be a big surprise waiting for him in September when he comes back from sentencing -- for sentencing because in my experience, federal judges in cases of sex offenses often deviate upward from the sentence. If you remember Jared, the subway guy, Jared for years ago, prosecutor in that case agreed to seat more than 12 years. They came back and the judge gave him 15. But the most devastating part about this case is going to be when he's released and he registers as a sex offender because that means no more political future and probably no more employment future at all. So being able to collect your life after registering as a sex offender, believe me, I've had clients in this category before and it's extremely difficult for them. It's going to be very tough for him. And why did Huma wait six years from the first -- one of the first sexting offense that he engage in when it's published everywhere. Why wait six years to file?"

But you know love is mysterious and we can't know what was going on there at all, you know. But I wish her the best, certainly, for their young son. I mean, there's a kid involved here."
