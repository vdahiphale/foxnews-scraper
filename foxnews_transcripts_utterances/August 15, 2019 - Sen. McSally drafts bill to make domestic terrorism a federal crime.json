Now, more than 500 workers said that that U.S. Immigration officials are perpetrating a system of abuse and malign neglect at the border. Google makes roughly $8 billion in sales from its cloud business, a space where it competes with Amazon. The employees are demanding that it not be what they called complicit by working with the agency. It's not the first time this has happened. Last year a similar situation arose when workers protested Google's work with the Pentagon. In that case it was over project Maven that uses AI in conjunction with drones. That petition had more than 4,000 signatures and even spurred some resignations at Google. Now, I reached out to Google, haven't got a response. But the last time that this happened, the CEO created some guiding principles for AI with respect to weapons. But Google did pursue the contracts nonetheless. Now, the petition raise an interesting debate. How people feel about their work contributions, should they have a say over them? And how will management, not just Google, but across tech companies handle situations like this especially in the field of controversial technology, Charles?",

And while that sounds fantastic, the truth is, that marks its slowest growth since 1990 to continuing a mostly downward trend since Q1 2018. That, of course, is adding fuel to the speculation that China does in fact want to make a deal. This statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, \"We hope that the U.S. will meet China halfway and implement the consensus the two heads of the two countries in Osaka.\" It goes on to say this. \"China hopes to find mutually acceptable solutions through dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\" Of course, later tonight a big rally for the president over the Granite State of New Hampshire. Preparations all underway for what is expected to be a rousing affair at Southern New Hampshire University. About 11,000 plus expected to attend.

Let's ask market watchers Steve Moore and Heather Zumarraga. Heather, in many ways you could have expected the market to be higher, but we did get stability. Could this be the beginning of a more tranquil market? HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VISION 4 FUND DISTRIBUTORS VP: Oh well, I sure hope so. I mean waking up this morning seeing Dow tanks 800 points is really unnerving to the average investor out there. Look, the consumer is very strong. Retail sales are up over 5.6 percent year-over-year according to the National Retail Federation. That means that the economy is on solid footing. I know the markets are tanking. Interest rates, our yields are down, but that's for a good reasons. That people around the world globally are flocking to the US. as a safe haven - flight to safety, flight to quality.

So this could - China has big problems, because there is disinvestment in China right now and I actually think that China could - if they don't get this trade deal done with the U.S., China could head for its first recession in 30 years. I see two problems. I think the Fed is just too tight. Charles, I've been saying this for a year. And when you get an inverted yield curve, when you get the 10 year Treasury now what is it below 2 percent, that's a sign of deflation - disinflation that, I think, is hurting the economy. And the second thing is, look, we need to get this trade deal done. And I would love something in the middle here, where both sides reduce their tariffs on each other. If you do that it'll be good for both China and the U.S. and the economy will fly in 2020."

And the one tweet that sent the markets lower was exactly two weeks ago that threatened 10 percent tariffs on additional 300 billion of Chinese goods. Now that is post - that will be some of that postponed, and we are in negotiations. I know changing policies like structural reforms on their state owned enterprises, that will take a long time and perhaps never happen unfortunately that they would succumb to pressure from the U.S. But they've got to stop stealing our intellectual property."

I do want to caution the audience, though. Historically when this has happened, recessions have come 22 months later. The stock market is rally for 18 months, an average of 15 percent. So the idea that even at worst case scenario that recession is around the corner, it's certainly out of the question. But many people say that this time is different for a variety of reasons, Steve."

Almost everything I've heard you know when I listen to radio and things and these kind of - it's very simple. The reason we have an inverted yield curve is the Fed is too tight. I mean nobody buys a 10 year Treasury bill at 1.9 - what is it 1.98 percent the last time I checked. If they think that there's an inflation problem. There is no inflation problem in the economy whatsoever. No inflation. Not a whiff of it anywhere. And if I look at things like commodity prices, they're down 15 percent. I do think that the Fed has created this inverted yield curve and it's easy to solve, Charles. All the Fed has to do is get more dollar liquidity in the economy. And you guys were right when you said, you know because the U.S. economy is the star of the world economy - I mean everybody wants to invest here, big strong demand for dollars. That's all the more reason for the Fed to put more liquidity in there. I would like the Fed not to wait till September 15th or whenever their next meeting is - middle of September.

That will help people go out and buy - you look at stocks like Wal-Mart, like McDonald's, those are doing very well. Amazon is doing very well.

Multiple experts tell Fox News such breaks can occur in suicidal hangings, but are more common in victims of homicide strangulation Epstein's death has been characterized as an apparent suicide. \"The New York Post\" reports, he killed himself by tying a bed sheet around his neck to his jail cell. Bunk bed and then strangled himself by kneeling toward the floor. The Chief Medical Examiner completed Epstein's autopsy on Sunday. But said the final determination of death was pending further information.

    {
      "speaker": "DR. CYRIL WECHT, FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "The reports that there were multiple fractures, including the hyoid bone. Yes, it's correct, that you can get a fracture of a hyoid bone from a hanging, but they're rare. An extensive study done by the medical examiner's office in Montreal, Canada in 239 cases of apparent reported suicides there were six that have fractures of the hyoid bone and there were only five that had fractures of both hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage, the Adam's apple. So it troubles me greatly. And I'd like to know if there were other fractures, including the cricoid cartilage, which is the top ring of the trachea, located beneath the Adam's apple, because that is even rare, with only one case out of 239 having been reported. So we have to wait and see the final report which will include the toxicology report, which will include microscopic examination. How old are the injuries, and get them precisely like in the world of fiction. But you can differentiate between acute up to which 12 or 24 hours, subacute up to 48 hours and chronic beyond 48 hours, roughly. So we're going to see those. I want to learn more about the nature and extent of the injuries in the neck. How many hemorrhages were there in these little muscles, they're called strap muscles that look like little straps up from the sternum or breastbone and the clavicle, the collarbone into the jawbone. The hyoid bone located high in the neck beneath the mandible is not a place in which the force is exerted when someone tie something around their neck and leans into a suicide. Now, I've just - a bit ago that they're saying that he may have hurled himself from the top bunk. The circumstances here are fascinating. Now we have an explanation maybe because I've been talking about where's the force, where's the velocity. You don't have any when you have a leaning into like Robin Williams tied to a doorknob. And now Jeffrey Epstein tied to a bedpost. They say he hurled himself off."

And maybe that ties in possibly with the fact that his cellmate, who I understand is an ex-cop, I believe is charged with four murders isn't it very fascinating. How fortuitous that that cellmate was transferred out of Epstein's cell the day before."

Is that unusual for them to come out and publicly state this without going to all of the required tests?"

    {
      "speaker": "WECHT",
      "utterance": "Well I think it's unusual and I think it's really quite questionable from a purely professional standpoint, I don't mean to be critical. New York City Medical Examiner's Office is a very fine institution with competent people. But I think until a thorough investigation has been completed you should not be making any statements. And by thorough investigation, every single person not only present at the jail, but even not supposedly present, but who could have access to the jail and cell should be individually interrogated. That should be done and that's going to take some time. So until you do that you can't say this case is wrapped up."

The members of Congress will be denied access to Israel based on an obscure 2017 law that allows the government to deny entry to those who encourage the Boycott, Divest, Sanctions or BDS Movement. Representative Omar released a statement a short time ago saying, \"She wasn't surprised by the decision based on Netanyahu's public positions.\" Netanyahu also released his own statement before saying that the \"Intent of this Congresswoman is to hurt Israel.\" Netanyahu's comments followed two tweets from President Trump today against the Democratic lawmakers. This afternoon the President tweeted quote \"Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democratic Party and they hate Israel.\" Just last month Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer said, \"His country would not block any member of Congress from traveling here.\" And reports today do indicate that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu was previously okay with the visit. Now it is crucial to look at President Trump's role in all of this. His tweet this morning, certainly putting on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to double down on the decision, while President Trump may be appeased by this decision from the Israelis, certainly it is going to put a strain on the relationship between House Democrats and Netanyahu's administration.

    {
      "speaker": "MCSALLY",
      "utterance": "Well, we use the definition that's already in federal law and they have to commit some other act of violence murder or manslaughter or kidnapping. But the intent is to intimidate or coerce a civilian population. Again similar to what we see with international terrorism. So this approach, again, makes it - so federal law enforcement doesn't have to take them up on other crimes. But when they identify, whether it was the Tree of Life synagogue attacks or what appears to be with El Paso or others, they're clearly motivated with hate and to terrorize. That they can use this as a tool for justice. It also allows them to really focus and then study what the trends are so that we can prevent these crimes in the first place."

And I think that both Omar and Tlaib, their actions and their words have been dangerous. And their anti-Semitism, their support to the BDS movement - I mean, they personally led an effort to ensure the House of Representatives couldn't pass a bill to condemn anti-Semitism. This is the wrong direction. We need to stand closely with Israel and not allow their dangerous ideas to be fueling any of the rhetoric that is against the Jewish people, against Israel and supporting the economic - BDS movement and others.

I think it's extremely unfortunate. Look, there is many Democrats in the House and the Senate that do support Israel. I think these two and some others have hijacked their discussions and these are really important issues for us to be bipartisan on.

That's like trying to fix a marriage with saying, \"Hey, me and my wife are fighting all the time. We made it better because now we don't see each other ever.\" I mean that's not a successful marriage and this isn't a successful campaign.

And I think that the issue that he's going to face, to your point, is that once voters start to lose that that myth of kind of viability of it comes to being able to go toe to toe with the President, that's when I think you're going to see his support hopefully crack. But I think also what we're not talking about is the fact that, why do we even have this information, right. We're talking about information that's leaking from within Biden world.

Some of the people that are working for Joe Biden might be working against Joe Biden."

You still have a party that wants to be woke and when I read \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" they don't like Biden. I mean, they'll really make it - they make it pretty clear to that they don't want to owe white guy to be the nominee. So he is on thin ice, because the media wants someone who is woke. They want Kamala Harris - I mean, no the media - the Democrats wanted Kamala Harris, but the mainstream media backing the Democrats also want a woke candidate."

And also if you look at him on some of the issues - even apart from the fact that he's an old, rich, white guy, he also was not very progressive on many issues, especially when you look at criminal justice reform and his role on things like the 1994 crime bill. And he's going to be asked about that. He has been asked about that. He hasn't really answered for it. He said, OK, well let's move forward. But I don't think when you're talking about actual lives of people that were imprisoned that you can just move forward without addressing that. And I think that a lot of the time even if he does have good things to say, these gaffes that we're talking about earlier in the segment, it's a much bigger deal with social media. Because it's not just, oh the people who are there hear it. It gets - finds out its way on social media. People watch it over and over and over again and kind of goes everywhere."

      "utterance": "Good afternoon, Charles. Well, Google employees, they are petitioning the search giant to not bid on contracts to provide cloud services for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and also ICE. Now, more than 500 workers said that that U.S. Immigration officials are perpetrating a system of abuse and malign neglect at the border. Google makes roughly $8 billion in sales from its cloud business, a space where it competes with Amazon. The employees are demanding that it not be what they called complicit by working with the agency. It's not the first time this has happened. Last year a similar situation arose when workers protested Google's work with the Pentagon. In that case it was over project Maven that uses AI in conjunction with drones. That petition had more than 4,000 signatures and even spurred some resignations at Google. Now, I reached out to Google, haven't got a response. But the last time that this happened, the CEO created some guiding principles for AI with respect to weapons. But Google did pursue the contracts nonetheless. Now, the petition raise an interesting debate. How people feel about their work contributions, should they have a say over them? And how will management, not just Google, but across tech companies handle situations like this especially in the field of controversial technology, Charles?"

      "utterance": "Hey, hi. This is one - honestly, you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to want to really get down to answers here. We've got a ton of alleged victims, underage, young ladies, and everyone in this country wants to see justice, no one is happy with how this went down. There are so many questions, how important is it that the American public at these answers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "It's very important. And just know that this investigation is not over with his death. There are co-conspirators. There are - they just executed search warrants down in his compound, on a private island in the Virgin Islands and so that will generate all sorts of evidence that can be used against these co-conspirators. But fundamentally your question is right. We need transparency. And I think one of the things that General Barr is going to have to do is make sure that the Inspector General who in addition to the FBI is investigating this and can issue a public report, does a fast and thorough investigation. I think sometimes the American people are so used to the IJ coming in and not getting very quick answers. Remember that with the Hillary Clinton investigation. We're seeing that now with the origins of this Russia investigation. And so I think the Inspector General needs to do a quick and thorough investigation and then publish his report as soon as possible so that Americans can know exactly what happened and allay some of these fears."

The warden has been put on ice. So obviously Attorney General Barr has been swift in taking certain actions. But, again, when it comes to some of these things - I mean, there's a report out today. I guess it's called the hyoid part of the neck - the way it was fractured. They say it's more common in homicide strangulation than it would be in a suicide situation. Other injuries. So this information is certainly mounting and I think it's important maybe that the public doesn't have to play this guessing conspiracy game."

      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "It is and I heard your guest earlier, the doctor, who talked about the number of suicides in a research project that had had these injuries and it was very uncommon for these types of injuries. I've also - I've seen some reporting of how infrequent suicides are at this facility. And so - I mean, there's just there's so - every day there are more questions and we are getting no answers. And so I hope that the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons can start providing at least the basic answers to these questions so that we're not all left speculating and assuming facts, not in evidence and then leading us down these rabbit holes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "I'm curious, because this whole thing was broken up and - when - there was a warrant to search his Manhattan residence and those sort of warrants obviously you had - the judge had to be presented with some sort of compelling evidence. Do you know who provided that? There's got to be some sort of link out there that law enforcement probably is in touch with to really keep this alive. And maybe we can still see justice?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "Well I think it all originated with that \"Miami Herald\" reporting that laid out sort of what had happened in 2008-2009 with his original case and that that got a lot of attention at the time. And I'm certain that law enforcement went back and looked at the facts and circumstances and we're able to develop probable cause to get a search warrant. And, again, as you know, once you execute a search warrant like that you can find a treasure trove of information. It sounds like they may have found pictures. They may have found diaries, all sorts of evidence that could be used in this case. And again, it's not over and so this death is unfortunate and the victims will be - receive their justice when others are brought."

    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "Well that case is over. And what it found was the Mueller report very clearly said there was no criminal conspiracy, no collusion, if you will, and that there was no obstruction of justice. And I really wish Congress would get back to the important work on behalf of the American people, solving some these challenges. The opioid crisis isn't over. We saw in Philadelphia last night violent crime in our major cities and drug dealers are a major problem threatening our country. And there's so many things that Congress could be helping in partnering with this administration to get solved. Immigration and our border obviously is another issue. So Charles there's so many things that they should be spending their time on instead of impeachment."

If that - if anyone else were victims - if you had six victims of any other race, nationality, occupation that would've been front page news, it could be - it would have fanned the political flames.

So they are happy to enjoy a little bit of the air conditioning. Lots of the things you see at the rallies that the president has put on this far this year, a lot of hats, a lot of T-shirts. These are folks that are very much focused on 2020 and happy to be here today. The President not slated to speak until 7 o'clock. This - the last time that he actually was here in New Hampshire in Manchester in March of 2018 to announce a plan to address the opioid crisis, which has hit particularly hard in the state. But this big event tonight, this big rally in New Hampshire, his first since the 2016 election. So all those Democrats who have spent months prior barnstorming across this crucial early voting state, no longer have it all to themselves. The New Hampshire Democratic Party, though, has coordinated a rather robust response to the President's return to the state. A protest is ongoing outside. And the state campaign leaders from 21 Democratic campaigns signed a joint statement declaring that quote \"Donald Trump's presidency has been defined by broken promises\" and onward from there. The New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley says this."

Now, outside the protesters - of course, I mean this is really classic New Hampshire stuff. Things do tend to be civil in New Hampshire. The folks up here are used to go to discussing ideas and welcoming candidates from all over the state, that's part of what makes covering New Hampshire so much fun. So it's always great to be the first - the nation primary state. And it's fascinating to be here for the President's return since his last rally in 2016.

The market - the Dow up only 100 points, before the market even opened it was down 200 points, it was up 200 points, an hour and a half ago it was down 150 points. Here's the good news folks. It was down 800 points yesterday. This is what we call stabilization on great, great news. Perhaps talk of recession premature.
