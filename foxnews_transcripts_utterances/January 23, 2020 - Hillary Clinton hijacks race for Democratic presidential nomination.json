If you're listening to this impeachment and you haven't opened your windows, you're probably dead right now. They are trying to wear us down with incessant babble. And Trump is right. These are all opinions. This can't be a trial if it's all opinions, because they're basically just saying they're mind reading. It's a historical impeachment, and that it's become something so trivial that now anyone can do it, right? So you're going to see it if the Democrats are not doing to Republicans and the Republicans will do it back to them. When they get into office, it's just going to be what -- the Democrats broke the seal on this. So I have an analogy. Impeachment is now like a tattoo. In the old days, they were exotic, right? If you saw somebody with a tattoo, you stared at it. He was a war vet or a biker or possibly both. Now, they're on bass players. They're on sorority sisters. Tattoos can be found on middle-aged suburbanites at their Peloton class. So what was once exotic is now mundane. That's what impeachment is. Impeachment has -- it's not going to be something like sequestration or government shutdowns that are going to be -- it's going to be coming background noise and meaningless. One more point, and what is exhausting to me is how people keep comparing this impeachment to the Clinton impeachment. Republicans do it to Dems, and Dems to its Republicans. They cancel each other out. So it's meaningless to keep going back and going they said this then and say this that. The bigger question is how can you have this comparison, it's because the politicians that were there then are still here now. And that should infuriate you. We're seeing the same faces that we saw in the 90s we're seeing now, and yet nothing is better in government. It's only worse. The world has progressed. We have less poverty, cheaper food, you know, reductions in major diseases.

He clerked for Chief Justice Roberts and said that it was a little bit out of character. You know, back in the 1999 trial with President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist never infused himself into the trial here. But Republicans are contending that the language by Jerry Nadler, one of the impeachment managers, was a bridge too far the way he criticized the Senate.

If you're listening to this impeachment and you haven't opened your windows, you're probably dead right now. They are trying to wear us down with incessant babble. And Trump is right. These are all opinions. This can't be a trial if it's all opinions, because they're basically just saying they're mind reading. It's a historical impeachment, and that it's become something so trivial that now anyone can do it, right? So you're going to see it if the Democrats are not doing to Republicans and the Republicans will do it back to them. When they get into office, it's just going to be what -- the Democrats broke the seal on this. So I have an analogy. Impeachment is now like a tattoo. In the old days, they were exotic, right? If you saw somebody with a tattoo, you stared at it. He was a war vet or a biker or possibly both. Now, they're on bass players. They're on sorority sisters. Tattoos can be found on middle-aged suburbanites at their Peloton class. So what was once exotic is now mundane. That's what impeachment is. Impeachment has -- it's not going to be something like sequestration or government shutdowns that are going to be -- it's going to be coming background noise and meaningless. One more point, and what is exhausting to me is how people keep comparing this impeachment to the Clinton impeachment. Republicans do it to Dems, and Dems to its Republicans. They cancel each other out. So it's meaningless to keep going back and going they said this then and say this that. The bigger question is how can you have this comparison, it's because the politicians that were there then are still here now. And that should infuriate you. We're seeing the same faces that we saw in the 90s we're seeing now, and yet nothing is better in government. It's only worse. The world has progressed. We have less poverty, cheaper food, you know, reductions in major diseases. But we have the same jerks doing the same crap."

Charlottesville, S-hole countries, they're running to the cameras denouncing him. If the Democrats had a case, it would've been a slamdunk deal. They would have been convicting him in a heartbeat. Remember they were going to convict him if Mueller had found collusion. They had their fingers in the air for two years. But the Democrats, they get their managers in there and they've totally miscalculated this thing. They're insulting the very people that they're trying to persuade. It's like a prosecutor goes and tells a jury if you don't agree with me to convict, then you're guilty of a cover-up, and you're complicit in the crime that the guy on trial is -- on the stand for.

Famous people, especially in -- whether it is sports or entertainment or politics, your family or your friends become these people who think that you might be able to help them get a job or get some sort of a contract. In this case, Biden doesn't even have to do anything to help them. He just is the vice president, so people will flock to, like his brother. I think they did charter schools down in Florida. And I don't know how those results turned out. But what's very interesting and I think is a little puzzling is last night the Biden team put out an ad in which they're trying to explain Joe Biden's role in all the Ukraine stuff. And up to then, he hadn't really had to talk about it at all. And you have his three biggest competitors, Warren, Sanders, and Klobuchar locked away in the Senate. He's got Iowa all to himself. You could talk about all the things that Iowans care about, and instead they put out an ad about Ukraine."

Let's ask Obama energy star Amos Hochstein who raised concerns about Joe Biden and his aides about hunter Biden's Ukrainian ties.

Do you think he was ever thinking he'd be involved in this? I mean, no. And think of all the strip clubs that are now suffering because he's not spending money there. It's unfair. Look, this is -- Hunter is the hood ornament of D.C. cronyism, OK. He's a kid that skates by on daddy's name. He makes a lot of mistakes. He impregnates a lot of women, enjoy some interesting recreational substances. In this case, Trump's personal and national interests overlap. Do you want to compromise candidate becoming president? So that's what -- that's where the -- Hunter Biden go to that question. Do you want to compromise candidate becoming president, and that's Joe Biden? It's a fair question.

She says he is -- he's mean, he has no friends, he's sexist, his supporters are bad, blah, blah. So she's - - I mean, she's joining the media in taking Bernie out.

He even said that going into the 2020 election, Dana, that you can't trust Trump because he was trying to cheat with Ukraine and he was even asking China now to get involved and get information on his opponents. And to me this is like very upsetting because it's almost like a patriot saying, hey, what were the Founding Fathers designed the constitution to deal with this."

Everything you hear from the media is exactly the opposite of what they say. They say the Republicans are engaged in a cover-up yet they don't want the whistleblower or Hunter to testify. They won't even let you into the skiff to see the testimony by the I.G., who's also very suspicious. RealClearInvestigation says a great piece here is some new exclusive reporting about how the whistleblower was overheard talking to the guy Schiff hired from the National Security Council in 2017 about the need to take Trump out and to get him impeach. So this goes all the way back. And again, they said Avenatti was the greatest thing since sliced bread and now he's rotting behind bars in El Chapo's old cell block."

This spectacle exists independent of reality because we know how it ends, right? We know how these ends. This is all meaningless, it's boring, it bores and moronic. Abuse of power is not impeachable because it's an opinion. Just because you don't like the way somebody does his job, you can call it an abuse of power, so it can be done -- it can be done on anybody. Meanwhile, the media is banking on the impact of their generic coverage, just having impeachment trial in their lower third is enough to make you think, oh, maybe this guy's guilty. That's what they're hoping for."

I don't think it will happen. I'm going to go on record now. I'll predict that Susan Collins of Maine will win reelection, Mitch McConnell will definitely have her back. And she will be considered one of the heroes of 2020. That's my thought."
