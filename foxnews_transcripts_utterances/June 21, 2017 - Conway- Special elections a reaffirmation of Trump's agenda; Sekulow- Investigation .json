      "sentences": "This is a Fox News Alert. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And we are broadcasting from sin city, Washington, D.C. President Trump has just finished his rally in Iowa. We'll have highlights and reaction throughout this hour. But first, Democrats -- they are in total disarray after last night's major win again for President Trump, and of course, Republicans in the Georgia 6th district. Now, the left has absolutely no idea. They're completely out of touch with you, the American people, as we have been telling you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, we will also expose tonight the biggest conspiracy theorist in the destroy Trump media. And by the way, all that and more in tonight's very important \"Opening Monologue.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, so the special election last night in the Georgia 6th district was supposed to be a big, big, huge, monumental moment for Democrats in their effort to resist President Donald Trump. And guess what? Just like with all the other special election races, it turns out to be a major win for the president and a massive, huge disappointment and failure for the Democrats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Republican candidate Karen Handel, she ended up beating 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff, the new rock star of the left, who couldn't even vote in the race. Why? He doesn't live in the district. And what's even more embarrassing for Democrats -- they spent over $30 million trying to help Ossoff win. It became the most expensive congressional House race in history, and they still came up way short. Now, liberals actually, they would have been better, you know, served if they dug a big, giant hole and threw all their money in it or maybe give it to poor people and set it on fire. Anyway, it was a total waste of time, and of course, money from a lot of Hollywood people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And here's why. Democrats right now, they have zip. They have nothing to offer to you, the American people. They're out of touch with you. And by the way, their ideas are old, they're tired. Every single thing they have tried has failed because, of course, they always believe more government is always the solution for all of our problems. Remember President Reagan once said government is the problem. For example, let's take a look at ObamaCare. That train wreck is, of course, imploding right before your eyes. Remember, you keep your doctor, you keep your plan and you save on average per family in America $2,50 per year? Well, the average increase was over $6,000 and $8,000 for American families. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And earlier tonight, the president in Iowa slammed the destroy-Trump media and the losing Democrats.

Some of the Democrats want to go far left. They want to go, you know, income redistribution, jack up the tax rates to 67 percent. And then there are the ones who are kind of struggling, kind of a little bit in the middle, and they're in no-man's land. They've tried all those ideas of globalization and big government programs, and they failed miserably. Obama had a phenomenal personality, Sean, and he was able to outdo McCain, who was a terrible candidate, and Mitt Romney, who campaigned with the 47 percent disaster comment, and he was able to win both times. But I submit had a candidate like Donald Trump really caught fire in 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama would not have won the presidency and certainly would not have been reelected.

      "utterance": "This is a Fox News Alert. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And we are broadcasting from sin city, Washington, D.C. President Trump has just finished his rally in Iowa. We'll have highlights and reaction throughout this hour. But first, Democrats -- they are in total disarray after last night's major win again for President Trump, and of course, Republicans in the Georgia 6th district. Now, the left has absolutely no idea. They're completely out of touch with you, the American people, as we have been telling you. Plus, we will also expose tonight the biggest conspiracy theorist in the destroy Trump media. And by the way, all that and more in tonight's very important \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, so the special election last night in the Georgia 6th district was supposed to be a big, big, huge, monumental moment for Democrats in their effort to resist President Donald Trump. And guess what? Just like with all the other special election races, it turns out to be a major win for the president and a massive, huge disappointment and failure for the Democrats. The Republican candidate Karen Handel, she ended up beating 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff, the new rock star of the left, who couldn't even vote in the race. Why? He doesn't live in the district. And what's even more embarrassing for Democrats -- they spent over $30 million trying to help Ossoff win. It became the most expensive congressional House race in history, and they still came up way short. Now, liberals actually, they would have been better, you know, served if they dug a big, giant hole and threw all their money in it or maybe give it to poor people and set it on fire. Anyway, it was a total waste of time, and of course, money from a lot of Hollywood people. And here's why. Democrats right now, they have zip. They have nothing to offer to you, the American people. They're out of touch with you. And by the way, their ideas are old, they're tired. Every single thing they have tried has failed because, of course, they always believe more government is always the solution for all of our problems. Remember President Reagan once said government is the problem. For example, let's take a look at ObamaCare. That train wreck is, of course, imploding right before your eyes. Remember, you keep your doctor, you keep your plan and you save on average per family in America $2,50 per year? Well, the average increase was over $6,000 and $8,000 for American families. And earlier tonight, the president in Iowa slammed the destroy-Trump media and the losing Democrats. Watch this."

And if it wasn't so serious, it's actually funny. Now, last night -- remember, they were expecting a big victory, results rolling in from the race in Georgia. President Trump mentioned this at the rally. Rachel Maddow, instead of focusing on their big loss, puts on her tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist wires.

To date, there is zero evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, nothing whatsoever! It's been a farce, a total fabrication, 11 months of lies and conspiracies made up by people just like Maddow. Now, despite these facts, today Rachel -- she was at it again, whipping up a new crackpot theory involving President Trump, the mob money and money laundering, and even Vladimir Putin made it into the mix. Now, you cannot make this stuff up. Well, I guess, apparently, she can at NBC News. Take a look."

Here are just a couple of her craziest Trump-Russia conspiracy theories. You're going to love this. Take a look. MADDOW, ON \"THE LATE SHOW\"/CBS, MAY 22: Just last week, Reuters reported on 18 new previously undisclosed contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. MADDOW, MARCH 8: U.S. investigators, including the FBI, are looking into a Russian citizen in conjunction with one of the incidents on the Trump campaign last year. MADDOW, ON \"THE TONIGHT SHOW\"/NBC, MARCH 16: Maybe he's not as charitable as he says, or maybe he's not really under audit. Like, all those little things might be true. OK, that'd be interesting to know. I don't know that that would change the world that much. But what would change the world is if, you know, Russia was interfering in the election and they weren't doing it on their own and he was in on it, you know? MADDOW, JUNE 8: The FBI director being fired by the president to try to change or stop an FBI investigation into the president's campaign and his top staffers -- that is a big freaking deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Big freaking deal? No. And by the way, you may remember, back in 2011, Maddow tried to explain away then Congressman Anthony Weiner's very graphic, very lewd tweet -- another conspiracy theory. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADDOW",
      "utterance": "If the congressman was hacked, as he said he was, if he was pranked, how would that work? How could a person do that? What would that look like? The Daily Kos writer looks at the image of the congressman's Twitter account more closely, and judging from the pixelization of the images and some other visual clues, he concludes that the damage was a composite, saved a number of times indicating it had been Photoshopped. For a theory with fewer steps, a number of other blogs have different versions of a theory of a potential hacking that looks at the information embedded in this controversial picture. A third but by no means final theory has to do with the photo-sharing service that I was talking about earlier Whyfrog (ph). It's not all that hard to generate a program that would try every possible combination using your Twitter name until you got the right email address to use this service to post pictures."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And there wasn't a hacking. Now, of course, there was also the time that Maddow theorized that Republicans may be pushing assassinations as an actual political tactic. Take a look."

      "speaker": "MADDOW",

      "utterance": "A lot of people who I think are critical of Donald Trump generally look at praise like that from somebody like Donald (ph) Duke and wonder if he is a gateway drug, if there is something beyond Donald Trump himself that means a much greater transformation of the Republican Party into something that is going to be new to mainstream politics."

You know, I knew the late Tim Russert. He never behaved -- he never reported things like this. Now, for example ,my former colleague, Megyn Kelly, moved over to NBC. Is she proud of this type of reporting? Megyn interviewed, for example -- was a big deal, made a lot of news -- conspiracy theorist Alex Jones last week. Should she now interview Maddow this week so she can be fair and balanced? What about Matt Lauer? Does he support this nonsense, these conspiracy theories that are being spewed? By the way, what about Andy Lack? He's the head of NBC. He OK with all this? Now, the only thing the Democrats, members of the destroy Trump media have left are these tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, as Rachel says, and they're using them to create distraction, to try and stop President Trump from what? Keeping his promises and his agenda, bringing them forward. And of course, we're putting on your screen right now the key points of the president's agenda. Now Democrats and the media have proven they're willing to say and do anything to stop the president from enacting that agenda. Enough is enough.

I mean, I don't -- look, I think what we see in the country right now is that there are people on the far left who are frustrated with the Democrat party because the Democrats are kind of caught -- they're caught in the middle of their own vortex. Some of the Democrats want to go far left. They want to go, you know, income redistribution, jack up the tax rates to 67 percent. And then there are the ones who are kind of struggling, kind of a little bit in the middle, and they're in no-man's land. They've tried all those ideas of globalization and big government programs, and they failed miserably. Obama had a phenomenal personality, Sean, and he was able to outdo McCain, who was a terrible candidate, and Mitt Romney, who campaigned with the 47 percent disaster comment, and he was able to win both times. But I submit had a candidate like Donald Trump really caught fire in 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama would not have won the presidency and certainly would not have been reelected. But we didn't have that candidate."

I think Karen Handel should have campaigned with Trump and should have defied Congress. She should have said, I'm coming to town, and we're going to get two pieces of legislation on the president's desk and he's going to sign those pieces of legislation. Going to make the lives of the American people better. She kind of was playing a little bit cutesy with Trump. She had the behind closed doors fund-raiser, but she was -- she was a little scared by the Chamber of Commerce that came in with a lot of money and did help Karen Handel, no doubt about it. But she was a little scared. The Chamber was, like, Whoa, play (ph) it easy on Trump. I think this election shows us once again that Donald Trump is much more popular than the Congress today that's resisting still his agenda. He was in Iowa tonight -- phenomenal speech, which reminds us we want him on the road.

People are spending their money again. What does all that mean? It means that they'll be confident when they see his health care plan. People know \"Obama care\" is broken. And what Leader McConnell and the Senate have done is he is putting together a plan that he knows rips out \"Obama care\" branch and root. And let's remind people why this is being done.

Now some members of Congress are reportedly in favor of finally cancelling one of their many scheduled vacations, this one in August, in order to keep up to speed with Donald Trump. Joining us now, two of those GOP lawmakers that favor foregoing the August recess, the Freedom Caucus chairman, Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the former chairman. He got fired. I'm sorry. I'm an awful human. Why do you even listen to me? Good to see you guys. How are you doing?"

And that's part of why we have said, you know, now is the time, Americans want results. We want results. And it's about making decisions and getting serious about the president's agenda."

And we start out with Trump-Russia collusion. Everybody, Democrats, all the former intelligence guys say that's not happening. OK, now we're going on to obstruction and now we're going to financial issues? It's crazy."

The real concern about what happens to them on Main Street, about making sure that they can make their mortgage payments, protect their job, all the things that the president campaigned on, building a border wall, which is critically important, we have to get those things done, and this is a distraction that we can't afford to let happen."

The first was at the direction of then attorney general Loretta Lynch when she instructed him to call it a matter, not an investigation. Clinton was under investigation. She said oh, no, no, don't say that. Call it a \"matter.\" He goes, really? But he did. He did it willfully and he did it intentionally. This year he furthers the perception that President Trump was under investigation when in fact he's not. So twice the Justice Department, the American Justice Department misled the American people. They're not supposed to do that."

Comey said no even though Barbara Bosserman, the lead agent in the case, was a maxed out contributor to Obama's reelection campaign. Several people called for a special counsel in the Clinton e-mail investigation. Again, the Justice Department says no. But when it's about James Comey, when it's about his reputation, when it's about someone in the Justice Department? Oh, my goodness. We've got to have a special counsel."

I want to go back to the agenda because this is important. I agree, investigate the investigators. And that needs to happen immediately. And I hope Congress, can they step in on that?"

If the Republicans want 2018 to be free and clear for them and not a challenge. I think they have got to have Obamacare completed, repealed, replaced, as now you're working on. They have got to have his economic agenda with 15 percent corporate tax, 10 percent repatriation, middle class tax cuts, jumpstart the economy. Get these people out of poverty, off of food stamps and back to work. Energy independence I think will create millions of jobs. You know what that is like in both your states."
