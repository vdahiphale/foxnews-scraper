The president and the Trump administration fought for months to get this question on the Census, the citizenship question on the Census questionnaire that goes out to hundreds of millions of people. And the Supreme Court said no, you've got to come up with a better rationale. The president overruled his Commerce Secretary and said we are going to find a new rationale, and now today announces we are giving up. How come?",

Let's bring in our panel to chew it over, Josh Holmes, former top advisor to Mitch McConnell and now president of Cavalry Consultants, Mara Liasson, from National Public Radio, and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder. So riddle me this, Josh. The president and the Trump administration fought for months to get this question on the Census, the citizenship question on the Census questionnaire that goes out to hundreds of millions of people. And the Supreme Court said no, you've got to come up with a better rationale. The president overruled his Commerce Secretary and said we are going to find a new rationale, and now today announces we are giving up. How come?"

You think something is happening, we are going to bomb Iran, and then it doesn't. And the president decided that he wanted to at least go down fighting. This is a president who knows that, first of all, the citizenship question is very popular across the board. People don't see why it's such a problem to ask a question about whether you're a citizen or not. So he is showing that he is still going to try to ask it and get that information in every way he can.

He gave up the battle -- gave up the battle on the Census question, the question on the Census, but he didn't give up the war. He's fighting another way. And he's going to take it to 2020, and he's going to be able to leverage in the campaign that the bias of the judiciary against him and political correctness run amok. To him and his supporters this is a no-brainer, why should we not be able to ask this question, and even went out of his way to have Attorney General William Barr stand up there and say the Supreme Court affirmed our right to ask this question, it is Constitutional. So that's going to be his argument."

How can you object to asking people living in this country whether or not they are actually citizens?"

We've asked it before in previous censuses, so why is this suddenly verboten and we are not allowed to ask it? And this is a classic issue for Trump. It's a classic issue for him to sort of take to the American people. And I think he thinks he's got the issue on his side. However, you saw Chuck Schumer, you've seen what Nancy Pelosi has said about this, playing the racial card on it. They are going to use this to fire up their supporters, particularly the Hispanic vote."

Who do you support for president? Biden holds a commanding lead at 35 percent with Bernie Sanders at 14, Kamala Harris at 12, and the rest in single digits.

And he is, especially among voters who want to beat Donald Trump, he is still seen -- the electability argument is still his strongest suit. And his numbers, particularly with African-American voters as you just mentioned, that's got to be very reassuring to Joe Biden because that's one of his biggest core constituencies, and if that lead to erodes, he could be in real trouble. But they are holding strong right now."

He has to do well in that debate. I don't know if he can keep on turning in a kind of weak performance like he did in Miami over and over again and keep these numbers up. But he does have a high ceiling. He has years and years of goodwill built up, especially among the black community. And don't forget, South Carolina is a lot more like the rest of the Democratic primaries than Iowa or New Hampshire is, because it's diverse, because it has a lot of African-American voters. If you can't do well in the African-American community you're not going to be the nominee."

When Nancy Pelosi points out that these are people who might have millions of Twitter followers but they couldn't get more than their own votes against that border bill, she has a point. They don't have a following in Congress yet inside the Democratic race. When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was asked if you think Nancy Pelosi is a racist, that's because her chief of staff tweeted something that compared the moderate Democrats, the blue dogs and the new Democrats, to the old southern Democratic segs. So that was a front that her own staff opened up."

Nancy Pelosi goes and gives an interview to Maureen Dowd which kicks this thing off, right, in a \"New York Times.\" And then Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fires back on Twitter. Pelosi has this caucus meeting and says let's keep our dirty laundry inside. If you've got a problem, come to me. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez then goes to \"The Washington Post\" and effectively plays the race card against her, accuses her --"

She cares more about revolution than she does compromise, and that's what's going on right now."
