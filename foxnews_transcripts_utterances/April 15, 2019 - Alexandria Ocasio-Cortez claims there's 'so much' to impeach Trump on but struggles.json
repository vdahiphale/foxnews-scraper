      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". It is 9:00 p.m. on the east coast of the United States, 3:00 a.m. in Paris, France, where Notre Dame continues to burn, constructive between 1160 and 1260. The century's old cathedral survived the French Revolution, two World Wars and so much more. But tonight, the spire, as we watched earlier today, has collapsed. Much of the building now has been destroyed, 870 years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One of Europe's most iconic structures will never be the same. Thankfully, no deaths have been reported and tonight, the cause of this inferno has yet to be determined, but we will continue to monitor the story very closely and we'll have a report on the ground. Also, Trace Gallagher will join us with the very latest. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We begin tonight to a very important preview of what is about to happen this week. This will not be reported by the tinfoil hat conspiracy theory media mob in this country. So, our \"Hannity\" watch on investigating the investigators in the deep state begins tonight because on Thursday, we know the Attorney General William Barr will release the full Mueller report with only a few reductions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to my sources, over 90 percent of the findings will be made available. Of course, the investigatory and sources and method, we can't reveal those things. Classified information must be concealed, along with any grand jury material which Democrats are calling for. You can't do that legally, but they want it made public. So, after 2.5 years of never-ending hysteria, breathless coverage, lies, conspiracy theories and everything in between, well, the rage hate Trump media mob, their friends in the Democratic Party will now embark on a last gasp, this is it, desperate attempt now to weaponize what is left of the Mueller report against Donald Trump. This is their last stand, and I promise you, it will all fail flat like it has the last two and a half years, it will fail. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as for usual, the media mob and Democrats, they will work in unison to twist, to contort some language in the Mueller report put together by 18 Democrats as a final frenzied attempt begins to prompt up their impeachment dreams that are already dead. They just don't know it yet. But don't be fooled. We already know there was no collusion, none, zero.  After 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 230 court orders, and interviews with approximately 500 people and a lot of early morning predawn raids with 27 armed guys against unarmed little wives and sons, Mueller determined, quote, this is from the Mueller report. The investigation did not establish members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That is a direct quote from the Mueller report. That was in Attorney General Barr's review. Now, Mueller's findings came after four other now separate investigations, they have reached the same conclusion. A nine- month probe by the FBI, even Strzok and Page said, no, they have nothing.  The House Intel Committee's exhaustive investigation, the bipartisan Senate committee investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, given clear, undeniable proof four times now, no Russia collusion, the left is now likely to obsess about, oh, obstruction of justice or Donald Trump's taxes. But remember, President Trump wasn't charged with obstruction of justice. Not by Mueller, not by anybody. Attorney General Barr himself, along with Rod Rosenstein, made a decision and said, quote, the evidence developed during special counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish the president committed an obstruction of justice offense. And this is important, our determination was made without regard to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. In other words, President Trump did not obstruct justice and the role as president had nothing to do with the DOJ's decision not to charge him. Now, keep in mind that is the attorney general came to that conclusion and consultation, here he is, with the deputy attorney general, the guy that hired Mueller, Rod Rosenstein. And, by the way, long with several other nonpartisan Department of Justice officials and including those in the legal counsel's office. They concluded there was no underlying crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How do you obstruct a crime that didn't happen? It's impossible. If there is nothing to obstruct, which is why President Trump let the Mueller investigation play out. How do you obstruct? He didn't fire Mueller.  Probably said so many times I should fire him. He didn't fire Rod Rosenstein, probably said that too. He never interfered or intervened to help General Flynn that we now know was set up by both Comey and McCabe. He didn't get in the witch hunt from proceeding. It all went through. And as James Comey said in terms of his firing, well, the FBI can be fired for any reason or no reason at all. They serve at the pleasure of the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, when the media mob on Thursday begins obsessing over phantom obstruction of justice charges in the coming days, ask yourself. Now, if they really care about obstruction of justice, have any of these people ever shown any outrage over the Clinton server scandal in real obstruction with real evidence? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, having top secret classified emails, there was a crime. She had it on an outside server, mom and pop bathroom closet server. That is a violation of Espionage Act, 18 USC 793. So, she had an underlying crime and then she had intentions. Why did she delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails and acid wash the hard drive with Bleach Bit and remove the SIM cards and bust up her devices with hammers? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The intent is obvious -- she wanted destroy subpoenaed evidence that prove she violated the crime, committed a crime, the Espionage Act. And so, to remove all the evidence, oh, that shows the intent. Nobody in the media that is going to try to find some intent when Trump never did it and ever fired anybody, why don't they care about real obstruction of justice? Here is my prediction for Thursday. None of the genius so-called legal analyst or any other talking heads on any other networks will ever mention this, that exposes just how abusively biased their coverage is and has been. Instead, we're going to get the last hurrah, the last rampant speculation, the last in the tinfoil hat conspiracy theories for two and a half years surrounding Russia, Russia, Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, the steady march of truth has begun. And, by the way, when they are done with that, by that Tuesday of next week, we want Donald Trump's taxes, so let's move onto the next conspiracy theory, the next weapon that they can use in their minds to destroy a duly elected president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But after Thursday, whether they faced this truth or not, the lies they have peddled for two and half years on Russia collusion are officially dead. It's over. They lost. And they're going to lose it. And soon we will have more closed-door testimony. Get this, this is what is coming, that they will now see that every bit of reporting that was done on the show, by our investigative team that we did for two years, will be proven correct. Like we saw -- oh, closed-door testimony from James Baker, Strzok, Page, Bruce and Nellie Ohr and others and more coming. The attorney general announcing his investigation into the investigation and yes he is the word spying on the Trump campaign and a witch hunt against the city president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The criminal referrals now from Congressman Devin Nunes and, of course, the Horowitz FISA investigation which we expect completed by May, and Congressman Mark Meadows and Congressman Jim Jordan, well, they said they expect criminal referrals from that inspector general report. And don't forget, we have another investigation, the Huber investigation on leaking. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then the president said to us two and a half weeks on this program, that the FISA applications, the bulk of information, of course, was obtained using Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies and dossier. As the bulk of the foundation, 302s, Gang of Eight information, all of this would be forthcoming and all of this will show exactly what we have been telling you is true, there will be indictments, there will be criminal referrals and there are likely people to go to jail that abused power, that were corrupt. Now, whether the media mob likes it or not, I hope you are ready for an avalanche. Cascading truth and justice will now fall on their heads. But they don't have the capacity to ever admit they were wrong. And, by the way, they will have nothing left to peddle. Their lies are debunked and exposed. It's over. John Solomon, Sara Carter, and Congressman Mark Meadows coming up on this very issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, we turn our attention to our \"Hannity\" watch on the radical socialist Democratic Party. Heading into the 2020 election, you saw crazy Bernie on the air tonight. Whew, that was hard to watch. Bernie Sanders for two hours, wow, gee, let's hear every communist idea we possibly can. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The left must be held accountable for pushing this two and a half year divisive hoax into the president of the United States, but more importantly, this cannot happen again. They must be held accountable for some of the most radical elements of the Democratic Party and media including Congresswoman Omar. Since being sworn into office, Omar has frequently been the subject of controversy surrounding her virulent anti-Semitic remarks, more recently facing a wave of criticism for minimizing the 9/11 attacks on this country that took nearly 3,000 of our friends, our fellow citizens, or neighbors.  She called it, oh, some people that did something. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The congresswoman is a public figure, powerful member of Congress, according to the left, and even Omar herself, any criticism of her is a dangerous incitement of violence and, of course, congressman a sitting U.S. lawmaker.

Where was the outrage when Snoop Dogg released the music video showing a person dressed up as Trump getting assassinated? Where was the outrage over this tweet from CBS show featuring an image with the words \"assassinate President Trump\"?

Almost ironic, the man who cleared Hillary Clinton of her wrongdoing, being looked at himself for mishandling classified information.

But the facts remain the facts and one of the things that Michael Horowitz more than likely will be looking at is in 2016 the leaks to Michael Isikoff and Yahoo! News about Carter Page. Remember, the FBI and the DOJ, those people that were principally involved in investigating this were piggybacking off of the same information spreading it around the exact same information and then utilizing that as separate evidence when they applied for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Warrant. So, that is something that I'm certain Michael Horowitz is going to be looking at. He's going to look at who did that? Who spreads the information? Who was leaking to reporters like David Corn, like Michael Isikoff and others and how that plays into his criminal referrals?

They were offered a plea deal at that time, but they turned it down because it included jail time. When they got hit with another charge of money laundering with a max sentence of 20 years, People magazine is now reporting at that point Loughlin and Giannulli wanted to negotiate, but prosecutors took the deal off the table. So, they had no choice but to plead not guilty and now they're facing 40 years. Clearly for first time offenders that won't happen, but experts say they could get four to six years if convicted and even if this doesn't go to trial and prosecutors decide to cut an 11th hour deal experts say it looks like Loughlin and her husband will serve years, not months because on the other hand as you pointed out Sean actress Felicity Huffman who has already pleaded guilty to boosting her daughter's SAT. score and expressed remorse is looking at maybe a few months behind bars.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". It is 9:00 p.m. on the east coast of the United States, 3:00 a.m. in Paris, France, where Notre Dame continues to burn, constructive between 1160 and 1260. The century's old cathedral survived the French Revolution, two World Wars and so much more. But tonight, the spire, as we watched earlier today, has collapsed. Much of the building now has been destroyed, 870 years. One of Europe's most iconic structures will never be the same. Thankfully, no deaths have been reported and tonight, the cause of this inferno has yet to be determined, but we will continue to monitor the story very closely and we'll have a report on the ground. Also, Trace Gallagher will join us with the very latest. We begin tonight to a very important preview of what is about to happen this week. This will not be reported by the tinfoil hat conspiracy theory media mob in this country. So, our \"Hannity\" watch on investigating the investigators in the deep state begins tonight because on Thursday, we know the Attorney General William Barr will release the full Mueller report with only a few reductions. According to my sources, over 90 percent of the findings will be made available. Of course, the investigatory and sources and method, we can't reveal those things. Classified information must be concealed, along with any grand jury material which Democrats are calling for. You can't do that legally, but they want it made public. So, after 2.5 years of never-ending hysteria, breathless coverage, lies, conspiracy theories and everything in between, well, the rage hate Trump media mob, their friends in the Democratic Party will now embark on a last gasp, this is it, desperate attempt now to weaponize what is left of the Mueller report against Donald Trump. This is their last stand, and I promise you, it will all fail flat like it has the last two and a half years, it will fail. But as for usual, the media mob and Democrats, they will work in unison to twist, to contort some language in the Mueller report put together by 18 Democrats as a final frenzied attempt begins to prompt up their impeachment dreams that are already dead. They just don't know it yet. But don't be fooled. We already know there was no collusion, none, zero.  After 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 230 court orders, and interviews with approximately 500 people and a lot of early morning predawn raids with 27 armed guys against unarmed little wives and sons, Mueller determined, quote, this is from the Mueller report. The investigation did not establish members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. That is a direct quote from the Mueller report. That was in Attorney General Barr's review. Now, Mueller's findings came after four other now separate investigations, they have reached the same conclusion. A nine- month probe by the FBI, even Strzok and Page said, no, they have nothing.  The House Intel Committee's exhaustive investigation, the bipartisan Senate committee investigation. Now, given clear, undeniable proof four times now, no Russia collusion, the left is now likely to obsess about, oh, obstruction of justice or Donald Trump's taxes. But remember, President Trump wasn't charged with obstruction of justice. Not by Mueller, not by anybody. Attorney General Barr himself, along with Rod Rosenstein, made a decision and said, quote, the evidence developed during special counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish the president committed an obstruction of justice offense. And this is important, our determination was made without regard to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. In other words, President Trump did not obstruct justice and the role as president had nothing to do with the DOJ's decision not to charge him. Now, keep in mind that is the attorney general came to that conclusion and consultation, here he is, with the deputy attorney general, the guy that hired Mueller, Rod Rosenstein. And, by the way, long with several other nonpartisan Department of Justice officials and including those in the legal counsel's office. They concluded there was no underlying crime. How do you obstruct a crime that didn't happen? It's impossible. If there is nothing to obstruct, which is why President Trump let the Mueller investigation play out. How do you obstruct? He didn't fire Mueller.  Probably said so many times I should fire him. He didn't fire Rod Rosenstein, probably said that too. He never interfered or intervened to help General Flynn that we now know was set up by both Comey and McCabe. He didn't get in the witch hunt from proceeding. It all went through. And as James Comey said in terms of his firing, well, the FBI can be fired for any reason or no reason at all. They serve at the pleasure of the president. So, when the media mob on Thursday begins obsessing over phantom obstruction of justice charges in the coming days, ask yourself. Now, if they really care about obstruction of justice, have any of these people ever shown any outrage over the Clinton server scandal in real obstruction with real evidence? Remember, having top secret classified emails, there was a crime. She had it on an outside server, mom and pop bathroom closet server. That is a violation of Espionage Act, 18 USC 793. So, she had an underlying crime and then she had intentions. Why did she delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails and acid wash the hard drive with Bleach Bit and remove the SIM cards and bust up her devices with hammers? The intent is obvious -- she wanted destroy subpoenaed evidence that prove she violated the crime, committed a crime, the Espionage Act. And so, to remove all the evidence, oh, that shows the intent. Nobody in the media that is going to try to find some intent when Trump never did it and ever fired anybody, why don't they care about real obstruction of justice? Here is my prediction for Thursday. None of the genius so-called legal analyst or any other talking heads on any other networks will ever mention this, that exposes just how abusively biased their coverage is and has been. Instead, we're going to get the last hurrah, the last rampant speculation, the last in the tinfoil hat conspiracy theories for two and a half years surrounding Russia, Russia, Russia. Tonight, the steady march of truth has begun. And, by the way, when they are done with that, by that Tuesday of next week, we want Donald Trump's taxes, so let's move onto the next conspiracy theory, the next weapon that they can use in their minds to destroy a duly elected president. But after Thursday, whether they faced this truth or not, the lies they have peddled for two and half years on Russia collusion are officially dead. It's over. They lost. And they're going to lose it. And soon we will have more closed-door testimony. Get this, this is what is coming, that they will now see that every bit of reporting that was done on the show, by our investigative team that we did for two years, will be proven correct. Like we saw -- oh, closed-door testimony from James Baker, Strzok, Page, Bruce and Nellie Ohr and others and more coming. The attorney general announcing his investigation into the investigation and yes he is the word spying on the Trump campaign and a witch hunt against the city president. The criminal referrals now from Congressman Devin Nunes and, of course, the Horowitz FISA investigation which we expect completed by May, and Congressman Mark Meadows and Congressman Jim Jordan, well, they said they expect criminal referrals from that inspector general report. And don't forget, we have another investigation, the Huber investigation on leaking. Then the president said to us two and a half weeks on this program, that the FISA applications, the bulk of information, of course, was obtained using Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies and dossier. As the bulk of the foundation, 302s, Gang of Eight information, all of this would be forthcoming and all of this will show exactly what we have been telling you is true, there will be indictments, there will be criminal referrals and there are likely people to go to jail that abused power, that were corrupt. Now, whether the media mob likes it or not, I hope you are ready for an avalanche. Cascading truth and justice will now fall on their heads. But they don't have the capacity to ever admit they were wrong. And, by the way, they will have nothing left to peddle. Their lies are debunked and exposed. It's over. John Solomon, Sara Carter, and Congressman Mark Meadows coming up on this very issue. But, first, we turn our attention to our \"Hannity\" watch on the radical socialist Democratic Party. Heading into the 2020 election, you saw crazy Bernie on the air tonight. Whew, that was hard to watch. Bernie Sanders for two hours, wow, gee, let's hear every communist idea we possibly can. The left must be held accountable for pushing this two and a half year divisive hoax into the president of the United States, but more importantly, this cannot happen again. They must be held accountable for some of the most radical elements of the Democratic Party and media including Congresswoman Omar. Since being sworn into office, Omar has frequently been the subject of controversy surrounding her virulent anti-Semitic remarks, more recently facing a wave of criticism for minimizing the 9/11 attacks on this country that took nearly 3,000 of our friends, our fellow citizens, or neighbors.  She called it, oh, some people that did something. Watch this."

She should be called out bizarre, ridiculous, insane comments and behavior. But apparently, criticizing a member of Congress is now inciting violence.  On this program, we said it many times, we must protect our politicians, freedom of thought, freedom of speech, the free and open expression of ideas and ideals and opinions. We detest all forms of violence. Vile threats should never be made against anyone. Should never be tolerated. In just a moment, we have a member of Congress who is a victim of real violence. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, he will respond to Omar.  And, by the way, if the left really agreed with us, if they really cared about stopping those who incite violence, where was the outrage? Remember, oh, Kathy Griffin's photo shoot with a severed head of Donald Trump? Where was the outrage when Snoop Dogg released the music video showing a person dressed up as Trump getting assassinated? Where was the outrage over this tweet from CBS show featuring an image with the words \"assassinate President Trump\"? Where is the outrage over the constant stream of these Hollywood leftist elites openly fantasizing about some sort of violence against the president? There is just a small example. Take a look."

They obsess about totally nonexistent obstruction of justice charges against the president all while ignoring Hillary Clinton's violation of the law, felony of the Espionage Act, and then willful obstruction of justice, deleting, acid washing hard drives, beating up devices. The hypocrisy of the left has never been this bad. All right. Joining us, former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Steve, you know, you were a victim of real violence and I want to be clear.  Just because the person shot you and others and was involved in the shooting happened to be Bernie Sanders supporter, I don't blame Bernie Sanders that some lunatic that likes his ideas commits an act of violence.  The connection they tried to make here is absurd because the comments of Congresswoman Omar are legitimate and needed to be said."

And then you shift over to what she said about 9/11 and, you know, some people did some things. Look, I was in New York last week and let me tell you, the nerves are incredibly raw. You're there in New York right now. I had people tell me, somebody I met with last week after she made these comments, I had three friends jump out of buildings that day. And for her to say that how offensive it is to them. Instead of apologizing, she doesn't apologize because she believes it and she doesn't care how many people she offends. They tried to shield her and say you can't criticize her. Look, first of all, she should not be on foreign affairs committee, Sean.  Everybody is free to have their own point of view. If you say offensive things, you ought to apologize to people you offend, she won't do that. But Nancy Pelosi puts her on Foreign Affairs where she helps shaped America's foreign policy."

We know the fire did collapse the cathedral's spire and then spread to one of the towers. But tonight, the Paris fire chief set a good portion of the church structure may have been saved. Though it goes without saying dozens of paintings, rose windows and the old organ are among the priceless things that were lost. It's unclear how many artifacts will not be recovered, but the bell towers that ring for happy and sad events were not destroyed. The fire was fueled by a massive amount of dry wood. I mean, when the cathedral was built eight centuries ago, it took 52 acres of timber. And to this day, it is still nicknamed the forest. The fire came days just before Good Friday and Easter, and the two holiest days of the Christian calendar where 100,000-plus people were expected to celebrate mass at Notre Dame. We are told firefighters will spend the night cooling for structure as much as they can. Of course, it took 800 -- 182 years to build and French President Emmanuel Macron is now pledging to rebuild -- Sean."

Also developing, we are inching closer and closer to justice in exposing all the corruption and abuse of power inside the deep state as Congressman Mark Meadows telling Fox News yesterday that more criminal referrals likely on the rise from the DOJ inspector general report. Here with the very latest, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Congressman Mark Meadows from North Carolina, The Hill's John Solomon. Congressman, let's start. We expect the Horowitz report on FISA reviews -- we already know from the Nunes, Grassley-Graham memos, the bulk of information was in fact, the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for, unverified, phony Russian dossier, mostly debunked, and that everybody at the top will flip the FBI and DOJ warned in August 2016, but they used it anyway. You expect criminal referrals with that report?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Michael Horowitz and his entire team, they're doing a great job independently looking into this, Sean. And I think if you look at the evidence, the evidence I've been able to see that Devin Nunes, Jim Jordan, John Ratcliffe and others, you know that several things happened. One is classified information was shared with the media. We also know as they went into much of this that as they started to focus on this, falsehoods were told to DOJ officials. So, I fully believe that Inspector General Horowitz and his team will look at that broadly, and out of that, look at criminal referrals that come -- that may be consistence with what Devin Nunes has already mentioned that he is referring to the DOJ as well. The bottom line is, Sean, your viewers, the American people, they want people held accountable. And they want to make sure that this never happens again to any future president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, John Solomon, we know that Hillary's investigation was rigged. Even Strzok and Page, interesting now as these closed-door hearing testimonies are coming out, we know that they were given orders from attorney general, oh, Ms. \"Tarmac and a matter of an investigation\" Lynch.  That raises question what did she know? We need to get to the bottom of that. But we know she violated the Espionage Act. We know James Baker thought she should be indicted and we also -- we have a crime, and we also have intent when she deleted the subpoenaed emails, cleaned her hard drive up and busted up her devices. We also know that in the FISA case, that that dossier was bought and paid for by her. And they never verified it, but they committed fraud on a FISA court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, you know, when you talk about the two systems of justice, just the way you lay it out, Sean, is exactly why so many Americans are frustrated. They see one set of standards applied to Hillary Clinton, another applied to Donald Trump and I think there's an interesting thing. There really are two investigations we should be watching for in the next week, in the next few months from Inspector General Horowitz. One is the one that Congressman Meadows just mentioned, the FISA abuse one, a lot of synergies between that investigation and what Devin Nunes just sent as a referral, but they're also taking a look at James Comey's handling of classified information. Almost ironic, the man who cleared Hillary Clinton of her wrongdoing, being looked at himself for mishandling classified information. And so that means one of them or more may have been leaked based on the numbers we know that were shared and we also know the FBI to go and scrub offices where that classified information was leaked. So, look for that on top of the FISA abuses, we're really going to see just how bad the Comey FBI was when these AG reports come out."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM VISITING FELLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely and I think a really important point here Sean is that, it was a two-tier justice system and that's what we've been reporting on for all these years. But the facts remain the facts and one of the things that Michael Horowitz more than likely will be looking at is in 2016 the leaks to Michael Isikoff and Yahoo! News about Carter Page. Remember, the FBI and the DOJ, those people that were principally involved in investigating this were piggybacking off of the same information spreading it around the exact same information and then utilizing that as separate evidence when they applied for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Warrant. So, that is something that I'm certain Michael Horowitz is going to be looking at. He's going to look at who did that? Who spreads the information? Who was leaking to reporters like David Corn, like Michael Isikoff and others and how that plays into his criminal referrals? So, I think that's something that everybody should be looking at as well.  HANNITY: OK. And Congressman Meadows, the important part here is this can't happen again. So, Thursday, there is nothing left. All the lies that have been told, conspiracy theories spun, and it turns out John and Sara and Gregg Jarrett and Joe DiGenova, Victoria, all these people and yourself and Jim Jordan, your questions were remarkable in these closed-door interviews, you and Jim Jordan. So, with all of that what we now know is that we have FISA applications 302s. We have gang of eight. We also have the Huber investigation, the Horowitz report. Now the AG looking into spying and the entire investigation. And all of this has - we've only begun that process. But the conspiracy dies on Thursday. It's already dead."

They were offered a plea deal at that time, but they turned it down because it included jail time. When they got hit with another charge of money laundering with a max sentence of 20 years, People magazine is now reporting at that point Loughlin and Giannulli wanted to negotiate, but prosecutors took the deal off the table. So, they had no choice but to plead not guilty and now they're facing 40 years. Clearly for first time offenders that won't happen, but experts say they could get four to six years if convicted and even if this doesn't go to trial and prosecutors decide to cut an 11th hour deal experts say it looks like Loughlin and her husband will serve years, not months because on the other hand as you pointed out Sean actress Felicity Huffman who has already pleaded guilty to boosting her daughter's SAT. score and expressed remorse is looking at maybe a few months behind bars.

And you know the one thing I would say to Cher is like when we sent our cameras to Nancy Pelosi's district. Why right outside her conclave of millionaire neighbors hasn't she built a homeless shelter that takes care of all those homeless people that are urinating and defecating in the streets and all the needles that are on the street outside of her neighborhood."

It's amazing. And there was a tweet that she actually had out Sean in 2017, where she said we need to embrace illegal immigrants undocumented people migrants bring them into our homes, other people in the industry should do the same. That's from September of 2017. But now she sees two years later what's happening to California. And she deserves all the credit in the world for being courageous here, because you could imagine she's going to be ostracized in the industry."

It had been 11 years since his last major victory. Now just three major titles away from tying Jack Nicklaus record of 18. It was the longest distance between winning the Masters than ever before. Don't forget by the way, President Trump reportedly, he played with Tiger, back in February predicted he'd be winning majors again. On top of that the President tweeted today that he will be presenting Woods with the Presidential Medal of Honor, our nation's highest civilian honor. Congratulations Tiger Woods. What a great story. Redemption, all the operations he's had a lot. Right, that's all the time we have left. We will never be the rage hate media mob. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is up now.
