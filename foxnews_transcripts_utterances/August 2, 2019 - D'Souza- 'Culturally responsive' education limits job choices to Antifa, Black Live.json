Investigators say the suspect killed three others at the festival including a six-year-old and a 13-year-old. Sixteen others were injured. Police found evidence that the suspect was planning a large-scale attack. They also discovered white supremacist literature in his Nevada home. At least one person is dead and several others hurt from a cliff collapse in San Diego. One of the injured is in critical condition, and another has serious injuries.

Phillips played a drum and sang as Sandmann and his classmates gathered around. The students were criticized by some as being aggressive and described as, quote, MAGA hat wearing teens. Among those named in the new lawsuit as having libeled the boys, the comedian and actress Kathy Griffin, Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and frequent CNN contributor, Maggie Haberman, a \"New York Times\" reporter, and Senator Elizabeth Warren. The lawsuit says in part, quote, \"Several of our senators, most-famous celebrities, and widely read journalists collectively used their large social media platforms, perceived higher credibility, and public followings to lie and libel minors they met, based on an event they never witnessed.\" And it says, quote, \"Over the ensuing hours and days the kids experienced threats, personal attacks, and life altering public attacks.\" The suit seeks up to $4.8 million in total damages against the 12 people named.

They're trying to attract that group of people. And the police - so it's very easy to attack them, because they don't respond to a call or any crime of violence, and wonder if somebody is a liberal or a conservative a Democrat or a Republican, and they just respond and they do what's appropriate at that time for whoever. So they can do anything they want. And they know the police are going to still do their jobs. And the problem is when you pick out cases that they know - that the police actually did nothing wrong and that the person that actually died or was injured, actually contributed to his own situation, they never call that person on his responsibility to conduct himself a certain way.

Well the facts are in the last 25 years violent crime has dropped by 50% in this country, property crimes have dropped by 70%. They should be proud of that record as success and that's not just elected politicians, that's police, prosecutors, judges people who make the criminal justice system go. Instead, in the debates you hear someone like Elizabeth Warren saying things like the criminal justice system is racist from front to back and blaming the police when instead they should be proud that they have dropped crime rates at such a great - at such enormous levels for a 25 year period.

I mean you can barely trust any politician any time to believe what they're going to say. And here we are trying to form our whole law-enforcement attitude across the nation because of 22 people that are running for the Democratic nomination, it's actually absurd. When you look at this they had ample opportunities many times under Barack Obama and Eric Holder to actually hold officers responsible criminally in cases where there was racial overtones - Ferguson, few other places and the Justice Department did not.

He did not apply a chokehold. He had a takedown hold. That he immediately removed his arm. His physical condition and the situation might have caused his death. We don't know and I don't think there was anything conclusive. So you have the federal government, the Department of Justice under President Obama and Eric Holder that has this case for two years and they can't seem to make a movement on it. You have a grand jury that clears the officer. Now you have the Justice Department under Attorney General Barr that says there's not enough evidence for any kind of civil rights violation. A violation that takes intent, not just the conduct of somebody that happens to create his own altercation, and now he renders himself dead. This is not a situation where there should be a civil rights violation or an indictment. But unfortunately because of public opinion that these Democrats want, they're going to actually - probably fire this officer."

      "utterance": "Well, I don't know what that's going to do to the morale, that's already, I think, fairly low and throughout the boroughs of New York City. Mark and John, thank you so much for this discussion tonight. Also tonight, as President Trump continues to hammer the failed liberal policies that wrecked Baltimore, some Democrat strongholds are still pushing policies that treat school kids like - well, they're just social justice lab rats. Just yesterday New York City officials approved a new - get this, \"Culturally Responsive\" education policy that requires schools to stop the practices that lead to predictable outcomes of success or failure for historically marginalized students, despite the fact that most NYC students aren't proficient in reading or math. Now here to make sense of all this is Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative author, filmmaker. Dinesh when you dig down about what \"Culturally Responsive\" education means, you find out that it's the same liberal educrat gobbledygook that's been confusing students and keeping them stuck for decades now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's not really education at all. It's the politics of victimology. The idea here is to reconcile minority students to their poor performance and instead of trying to improve the performance to locate a person to blame for it, namely the system or the white man. So this is actually a recipe for - it's not a recipe for creating educated students. It's not a recipe for preparing you to balance a checkbook or get a job or start a business. It might be a recipe if you want to go to work for Antifa or Black Lives Matter. But it limits your occupational choices really to those two categories."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, here's the proficiency chart for New York City, Dinesh. Now check it out, math where you see Grade 4, 26 percent are at or above proficient; Grade 8, goes up to a whopping 27 percent. Reading 26, Grade 8, 27. Science, wow, Grade 4 only 18 percent at proficient or above; Grade 8, 13 percent. Yet I just want to keep going back to \"Culturally Responsive\", because this reminds me of you - back in our alma mater in the 80s. This sort of concept started trickling in back then. This is what it says. It said that the one-page definition of \"Culturally Responsive\" says students varied perspectives. Whether tied to nationality religion, race or other backgrounds should be seen as essential assets. It also requires schools to quote \"foster critical consciousness\", Dinesh, about historical and contemporary forms of bias and suppression. That's the definition of culturally responsible, which means the Chinese students - protested at a meeting because they're like, wait, we don't get translators while the Spanish kids are getting translators. We're not getting translators. So everybody's at each other's throat now."

    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is - the New York public schools are among the most diverse in the world. You don't have to teach the kids about diversity. They are diverse. This would be like having a program to teach me about being Indian. You don't need to do that. The broader meaning of this, I think, is quite startling. Trump attacked these of Democratic party run cities as being crime-infested, drug infested, rat infested, but I think he in a way understated the case. If I were a poor kid in a slum, I would rather choose to be in a slum in Mumbai or in one of the favelas in Brazil, than in Baltimore or New York City. Now why is that? Because even in Mumbai I get a good education, I have a strong intact family. If you transplant me out of poverty and put me into a place where I have opportunity, I can thrive. The problem for the poor kids in Baltimore and New York is they're not even being prepared with the basic skills for life. So even if opportunity comes their way, they don't know what to do with it. They don't have the ability to perform at the jobs that they're not being educated for. So this is a real disaster in the making."

But we're not really giving them the skills in science or math or writing that would actually make them more productive and probably make more money in society. Dinesh, by the way, the President got a lot of heat because there was a tweet he sent about Elijah Cummings, the robbery of his home. Really bad news, he said. The Baltimore House Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad. Today, he said that - well, that wasn't a wisecrack. He said I was - I just basically reported what was in the news. So the media hopped on that and pestered him about that at his helicopter spray today and he said, I was just basically repeating what everyone else had said. But they're not letting this Cummings - Elijah Cummings things go."

    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Trump's thing was taken as being a kind of snarky, a chuckle at Cummings estate, but there's a broader point here. And that is that, usually these politicians can pursue these policies that make life miserable for other people, make these neighborhoods extremely dangerous. But they themselves live in gated communities where they're immune from the consequences of their own policies. Nancy Pelosi, I'm sure, doesn't have to live with homeless people at her door in San Francisco, for example. And generally neither would Elijah Cummings. So I think this is actually kind of an interesting case where the crime in Baltimore actually found its way to Elijah Cummings' own door."

Here now to respond is Steve Moore, former Trump economic advisors. Steve what's the biggest misconception that - of the sound bites you just heard. You heard Elizabeth Warren railing on about multinational corporations. And I probably agree with her that they have outsized influence.

The President actually seemed to even float that concept today, you know the markets are pretty jittery, the last couple of days. But where do things stand now? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"LOSING SOUTH KOREA\": Well things stand now at a point where the Chinese are not talking to us. You know, it was really interesting at the Osaka G20, President Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, negotiated an interim deal that actually was very favorable for China. It gave them a critical concession on Huawei and the Chinese agreed to buy more Ag products, which they have to do anyway from somebody. Well, you know, Xi Jinping couldn't even honor that, Laura. And I think that it says that in Beijing right now there is political paralysis, something is really wrong and you know you can't negotiate with the Chinese right now. So I think President Trump is absolutely right. If these guys don't want to talk to us in good faith, well, we'll just go on without them.

Joining me now is Jeffrey Lord, a former CNN contributor and former aide to Ronald Reagan, along with Scott Bolden, attorney and former chair of the National Bar Association PAC. Let's begin, gentlemen, with the Democrat debates where CNN's Don Lemon seemed to only be concerned with one thing."

How do you convince primary voters that you'd be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America. Mr. Yang, why are you are the best candidate to heal the racist divide in America? Why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide the exists in this country today which has been stoked by the president's racist rhetoric? What do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president's bigotry?"

And when I made the pitch for a color-blind society America and equal opportunity and all that, he shut me down by saying that I was crazy not to be judging by race. And when I suggested ever so nicely that he sounded like Bull Connor, I do believe he said we're done and shut me off. So I'm not surprised in the least that he would do this. The question is, why put a left commentator there as opposed to just a hard news group? But that's where they are."

      "speaker": "BOLDEN",
      "utterance": "Everybody on stage probably answered the same way. There is no real difference, in my opinion, whether you're racist or you traffic in it, or that you say racially offensive things. You're going to be judged whether you agree with it or don't agree with it. You don't have to use the \"n\" word to be called a racist. But we ought to get away from the racial division. That question is not problematic in and of itself, but I wish that they would have gone beyond that and talked about economic racism or the economic divisions that come from the history or the historical nature of racism to get those types of answers."

And they didn't really do much of that. It's easy to hit Trump. That's the easiest thing in the world for them to do. The hard thing is to say what we have been doing hasn't worked."

You were asking about whether or not the crowd was chanting \"send her back.\" They didn't do that, but the hot button issue of immigration could certainly be felt as a protestor was holding up a sign that said \"Immigrants Built America.\" Trump supporters tried to rip that sign out of that protestor's hands, and a brief scuffle did break out here at this rally in Cincinnati."

The economy continues to outperform expectations as evidenced in the July job reports out today, 164,000 nonfarm jobs added in the month of July, and unemployment is held steady at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low. Wages also continue to increase with the 3.2 percent year over year gain beating expectations, that's big. And this might be the most important. A whopping 370,000 workers entered the workforce, meaning more people who have been out of the labor market are now confident enough to jump back in, no sign of recession. While others might hype the demise of the American economy and hope for it, we're going to continue to bring you the facts about what is really happening. Better luck next time, experts. And now to a FOX News alert. The eight Covington Catholic high school students who were smeared by the media back in January have filed a defamation suit against high-profile politicians and media personalities. For the full story we go to FOX News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt. Jonathan?"

      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Laura. The eight Covington students filing this libel lawsuit are not named, simply referred to as the Covington boys. The action comes just one week after a federal judge dismissed a similar defamation lawsuit against \"The Washington Post.\" That was filed by Nicholas Sandmann, one of the students involved in the well-known encounter with Nathan Phillips, a Native American on the mall in Washington D.C. in January. Phillips played a drum and sang as Sandmann and his classmates gathered around. The students were criticized by some as being aggressive and described as, quote, MAGA hat wearing teens. Among those named in the new lawsuit as having libeled the boys, the comedian and actress Kathy Griffin, Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and frequent CNN contributor, Maggie Haberman, a \"New York Times\" reporter, and Senator Elizabeth Warren. The lawsuit says in part, quote, \"Several of our senators, most-famous celebrities, and widely read journalists collectively used their large social media platforms, perceived higher credibility, and public followings to lie and libel minors they met, based on an event they never witnessed.\" And it says, quote, \"Over the ensuing hours and days the kids experienced threats, personal attacks, and life altering public attacks.\" The suit seeks up to $4.8 million in total damages against the 12 people named. Laura?"

      "utterance": "I was thinking back on this week and what an incredible newsy week this has been for the country despite the fact that it's end of July, early August, usually dead. But the debates showed us a lot about this Democrat Party, where they are now, where Obama in some circles was considered too moderate. They didn't even mention Bill Clinton. So it's moving further to the left this week, provided plenty of evidence. And we were there to cover it for you. And you've all been so far ahead of the curve. You have been watching this show for past almost two years now. And I have to say a special goodbye to one of our great producers. We're going to miss her very much. Lauren Woodhull, who has been at this show since its inception, is going to be going on and doing a lot of great work for FOX Nation. She's actually going to be producing our FOX Nation show \"Laura and Raymond,\" so she'll still be with us, but not on the day to day show. Lauren, you have done a great job for us and continue to do fabulous things for FOX and all the loyal FOX viewers and FOX Nation viewers. We have a big week of shows coming up next week. Don't forget to check out my new podcast. It dropped yesterday. Just go to PodcastOne.com, get caught up with all the week's shows. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
