The selfless group of virtuous late night talk show hosts. I don't mean the great talented late- night hosts of the past, but the current witless activist ones of today.

Then blame the receding ice caps on Trump's hairspray. You can have that joke. And then there's Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee. They'll also join the crew. They're basically the professor and Marianne of the Bunch. So they'll all be selflessly devoting time on their shows for something called climate week to tell us how super urgent this threat really is. Yet, you know, it was so urgent that they had to wait until these hosts enjoyed their entire summers off like school teachers.

You know, despite doing it every night during his opening monologue. I don't want to die. It's the exact opposite thing people say well watching the show. But it's all about urgency.

Colbert noted it should be more than one night but he's too busy taking salsa lessons with Chuck Schumer at the Arthur Murray School of Dance in Brooklyn. I mean, if he really cared why would he be dancing while kids are dying? Meanwhile, what's America really concerned with? Rising crime, homelessness, untreated mental illness, rampant drug addiction. And, you know Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend's ball sack. The country is in sad shape, almost as sad as shape as Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend's ball sack. But, you know, but when you're a late night host, topics like crime and homelessness those aren't what's disgust because they're too hard. There are topics that end up having to sound like your parents, all full of common sense and incentives and rules. But climate is really easy. You don't need any of that. It's just a hyped issue that demands change and compliance and attention from the peasants. Yet the so called results are so long term, it ensures none of these people pushing it will have to be held accountable for the hypocrisy is in lies.

All one voice, one entity, a hive of fearful signalers. Knowing that if they don't play along, their days are numbered. So they back the hysteria to protect a paycheck. And so when our so called comedians have gone full Greta Thunberg it's no wonder 56 percent of young people think humanity is doomed.

Weird, I thought icon was someone who becomes a symbol worthy of admiration, you know, as opposed to a social climbing D-list TV actress turned princess overnight who whined about life in the palace demanded privacy, sat down with Oprah through the racist word around became a poster brat for woke activism, then signed multimillion dollar media deals based on her notoriety, then demanded more privacy, got more money, then posed for Time Magazine. Yes, that's an icon. For shameless self-promoters. Harry is seen here photo bombing his own magazine cover. Honey, can I be in? I'm part of the -- is it OK? She's like, as long as I'm in the front. They say they're humbled to make the cut as if they were surprised and that it wasn't completely worked out beforehand. They did an entire write up on one of Times' other picks so you can safely assume they probably even wrote or had approval on their own. But with Britney Spears, Kamala Harris, and hell even Tucker Carlson making the cut, who didn't get on the list? I'm surprised they didn't choose this girl. It's like Kat at the dispensary. Governor Sarah Palin, I keep changing it every time. What is your honest opinion about these young royals? Well, actually not young. She's over 40.",

Should not be televised on any network. That's what they want said about this show.

ABC's Jimmy Kimmel who will no doubt cry and then claim his tears are made of acid rain. James Corden, whoever that is, maybe he'll do a karaoke version of Here Comes the Rain in his Prius with AOC or Jimmy Fallon. It will pretend to laugh at everything the rest will say, and they'll still hate him. They'll still hate him. And then there's this guy. Seth. I don't know what the last name is. So purpose being there is to make the rest of them seem funny. Then blame the receding ice caps on Trump's hairspray. You can have that joke. And then there's Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee. They'll also join the crew. They're basically the professor and Marianne of the Bunch. So they'll all be selflessly devoting time on their shows for something called climate week to tell us how super urgent this threat really is. Yet, you know, it was so urgent that they had to wait until these hosts enjoyed their entire summers off like school teachers. Yes, the planet is melting, polar bears are dying, but we'll get on it right after I finished this game of corn hole with Alec Baldwin. So we've gone from Carson's Carnac to Letterman's stupid pet tricks to these sad sacks of pandering (BLEEP) discussing beach erosion happening in front of their secluded seaside estates.

You know, despite doing it every night during his opening monologue. I don't want to die. It's the exact opposite thing people say well watching the show. But it's all about urgency. He doesn't want to die. But from what exactly? Lack of laughter? Choking on your own tears? Lack of oxygen to the brain from huffing to many of Howard Stern's farts? Colbert noted it should be more than one night but he's too busy taking salsa lessons with Chuck Schumer at the Arthur Murray School of Dance in Brooklyn. I mean, if he really cared why would he be dancing while kids are dying? Meanwhile, what's America really concerned with? Rising crime, homelessness, untreated mental illness, rampant drug addiction. And, you know Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend's ball sack. The country is in sad shape, almost as sad as shape as Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend's ball sack. But, you know, but when you're a late night host, topics like crime and homelessness those aren't what's disgust because they're too hard. There are topics that end up having to sound like your parents, all full of common sense and incentives and rules. But climate is really easy. You don't need any of that. It's just a hyped issue that demands change and compliance and attention from the peasants. Yet the so called results are so long term, it ensures none of these people pushing it will have to be held accountable for the hypocrisy is in lies. And when you're that wealthy, you can create a life that allows you to shoulder the burdens you happily put on the truck drivers and plumbers who can't. And so their lockstep is more synchronized than a parade of North Korean soldiers. All one voice, one entity, a hive of fearful signalers. Knowing that if they don't play along, their days are numbered. So they back the hysteria to protect a paycheck. And so when our so called comedians have gone full Greta Thunberg it's no wonder 56 percent of young people think humanity is doomed. I wonder what our very own late night angry black male thinks."

So what's that sound like? Yes, late night talk show hosts. After all, aren't they also competing in desperate virtue signaling so the workaholics don't come after them. The sad thing is it doesn't work. CBS actually pulled this show before it aired because you guessed it, it wasn't woke enough. Yet CBS tried to go woke and the online wokesters stuck their collective finger right in the CBS eye. And that's the lesson. This isn't about virtue or doing good or helping people. It's about protecting yourself from the woke. The stupid, the losers, it's too late for those late nighters. They threw comedy under the bus to protect their bottom lines. Now they're just nut jobs scared of losing their nuts and their jobs. But I doubt they're going to listen to me. I'm just a right-wing crank. You know, just like this guy."

They say they're humbled to make the cut as if they were surprised and that it wasn't completely worked out beforehand.

According to the group Color of Change, Cops is an insidious program that distorts the truth about crime in our country. It purposefully encourages the public to support harmful behavior of police, prosecutors and other law enforcement figures. Cops and shows like it should not be televised on any network. Should not be televised on any network. That's what they want said about this show. Meanwhile in Minneapolis, that actual city, our favorite sister/wife, Ilhan Omar, has your usual complaints, this time over a judge for blocking a ballot measure to scrap Minneapolis police department.

They aren't being manipulated. You're showing us what the real life struggles of law enforcement professionals, let's focus on law enforcement professionals of color and what they're specifically put up against. That'd be an interesting way to approach this. But to pretend that just by running cameras, you're showing something that is conceived to make use route for the Cops that, that is, that's reprehensible."

I come from a huge law enforcement family, all my brothers, my dad, my uncles, I would probably have been a cop if it wasn't for this thing called a background check. And things got a little dicey in my late 20s. But no, I think we do have to support the cops. I mean, I understand maybe not the program itself, but there's a part of me that does want people to see what police work looks like. Like, I drove a cab for a long time. And I realize how primal it is, and we need to give those people our respect, because when you further the distrust between the police and the communities that rely on them the most, you -- the end result is those communities disproportionately suffering. If you look at the stats, since Black Lives Matter, undermine the cops, the murder rate has spiked."

But I will tell you one thing that gets left out of the conversation is when people are doing drugs and they are addicted to drugs, it progresses, it always gets worse. And eventually it ends in death. But before it ends there, horrible behavioral disturbances can develop and somebody's got to contain that."

It has nothing to do with her race or her gender stupid people come in every shape and size. If you don't believe me, watch \"The View,\" they're everywhere. And it's just -- she's stupid.

It's a lot cheaper than a month supply of x-lakhs. Right now, it's only at select locations in Tucson Arizona city currently ringed by Porta Potties. The plan includes a variety of options including the soft tacos, spicy taco and Doritos taco so you don't get tired of getting diarrhea from the same thing every day. Is this exciting, Governor?"
