      "sentences": "This is a Fox News Alert. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Laura Ingram, Brian Maloney, Melanie Morgan, Monica Crowley, Geraldo Rivera, Lara Trump are all here tonight. But first, Kathy Griffin faces major fallout over her vicious and vile photo shoot with a severed head that looks like the president. Very sick. And that is tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right, the so-called tolerant left, well, they're taking its unhinged hatred of the president now to a brand-new low. Kathy Griffin is only the latest offender. Now, the so-called comedian is now facing an intense backlash for a very disturbing photo shoot. We have to warn you, what we're about to show you is graphic. Now, here's Griffin posting (sic) with a bloody severed head. It is supposed to be President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Griffin apparently thought that that's funny, but then quickly apologized after realizing her actions were completely inappropriate, and by the way, more than crossed the line, and some even suggesting maybe legal issues are in play. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Earlier today, CNN announced that it has canceled its agreement with Griffin to co-host the network's New Year's Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper. And President Trump and the first lady, they responded to this awful attempt at humor by attacking the president. The president tweeted, quote, \"Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a very hard time with this. Sick!\" The first lady Melania Trump put out a statement reading, quote, \"As a mother, a wife, a human being, this photo is very disturbing when you consider some of the atrocities that are happening in the world today. A photo opportunity like this is simply wrong. It makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who would do this.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, what's most disturbing about all of this is reaction from the president and the first lady's 11-year-old son, Barron. Now, according to TMZ, well, Barron Trump was actually watching television when he first saw this disgusting image and thought it was real of his father. Now, to be fair, some in the media, they did realize that what Kathy Griffin did here was wrong and some spoke out against it because these types of attacks against the president -- it is so disgusting and despicable. It has no place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But of course, still plenty of others, well, they tried to defend it and laugh it off and even mocked the idea that people would be upset about this. For example, look at the headline from Mediaite. \"'Not worth doing': Morning Joe laughs off Kathy Griffin story before moving on to the 'covfefe' analysis.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And here's the clip.",

This latest despicable display -- in this case, Kathy Griffin -- it's only the latest example in a long list of attacks that the left has launched against the president and specifically against members of his family -- his wife, his daughter, his 11-year-old son. Now, as we often show you, liberals and the destroy Trump media viciously wake up, go after President Trump day after day, night after night, pushing all of their bizarre conspiracy theories, launching all kinds of vile personal attacks. But it goes much deeper than that. The left knows no boundaries when it comes to the president's family. Now, they've gone after the first lady, Melania Trump. They've gone after all the children, Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, Tiffany and their spouses, and of course, the president's 11-year-old son, Barron. And you can criticize the president, frankly, all you want, fair game, although some of it has been sick and obsessive and bizarrely, breathlessly, you know, conspiratorial. But really, an 11-year-old kid? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Does this not expose a massive double standard when it comes to the left? Nine times out of 10, they can cross the line and they don't face any consequences. There's no outrage, no backlash. Conservatives don't say they need to be fired and boycotted. They're allowed to do and say whatever they want, whenever they want, especially when it comes to smearing and attacking conservatives, which is probably why Kathy Griffin thought it was OK to do that in the first place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, coming up later tonight, we're going to have much more on this effort to call out the double standard and the attacks against me and the boycotts against me and the efforts to silence conservatives and liberal fascism and Brian Maloney and Melanie Morgan, who created the Media Equality Project to fight back against these efforts to silence conservative voices, they will be here to explain that they're just getting started. They're giving a preview of what's coming in the weeks ahead. But first, let me show you just a couple examples of what I'm talking about. NBC is supposed to be a news organization. NBC News with Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams, et cetera, right? Remember all of that? John Chancellor. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, NBC's Rachel Maddow, one of the worst offenders when it comes to pushing -- as a matter of fact, she is the champion of pushing unhinged, bizarre conspiracy theories. Now, here's her back in 2010 trying to explain away then-Congressman Anthony Weiner's graphic, lewd tweet, making excuses for \"Little Anthony.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "This is a Fox News Alert. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Laura Ingram, Brian Maloney, Melanie Morgan, Monica Crowley, Geraldo Rivera, Lara Trump are all here tonight. But first, Kathy Griffin faces major fallout over her vicious and vile photo shoot with a severed head that looks like the president. Very sick. And that is tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, the so-called tolerant left, well, they're taking its unhinged hatred of the president now to a brand-new low. Kathy Griffin is only the latest offender. Now, the so-called comedian is now facing an intense backlash for a very disturbing photo shoot. We have to warn you, what we're about to show you is graphic. Now, here's Griffin posting (sic) with a bloody severed head. It is supposed to be President Trump. Now, Griffin apparently thought that that's funny, but then quickly apologized after realizing her actions were completely inappropriate, and by the way, more than crossed the line, and some even suggesting maybe legal issues are in play. Earlier today, CNN announced that it has canceled its agreement with Griffin to co-host the network's New Year's Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper. And President Trump and the first lady, they responded to this awful attempt at humor by attacking the president. The president tweeted, quote, \"Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son, Barron, are having a very hard time with this. Sick!\" The first lady Melania Trump put out a statement reading, quote, \"As a mother, a wife, a human being, this photo is very disturbing when you consider some of the atrocities that are happening in the world today. A photo opportunity like this is simply wrong. It makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who would do this.\" Now, what's most disturbing about all of this is reaction from the president and the first lady's 11-year-old son, Barron. Now, according to TMZ, well, Barron Trump was actually watching television when he first saw this disgusting image and thought it was real of his father. Now, to be fair, some in the media, they did realize that what Kathy Griffin did here was wrong and some spoke out against it because these types of attacks against the president -- it is so disgusting and despicable. It has no place. But of course, still plenty of others, well, they tried to defend it and laugh it off and even mocked the idea that people would be upset about this. For example, look at the headline from Mediaite. \"'Not worth doing': Morning Joe laughs off Kathy Griffin story before moving on to the 'covfefe' analysis.\" And here's the clip."

      "utterance": "Yes, he accepts apologies, except if you're a conservative, like Rush Limbaugh. Here's my take on this, and there's a deeper story going on. This latest despicable display -- in this case, Kathy Griffin -- it's only the latest example in a long list of attacks that the left has launched against the president and specifically against members of his family -- his wife, his daughter, his 11-year-old son. Now, as we often show you, liberals and the destroy Trump media viciously wake up, go after President Trump day after day, night after night, pushing all of their bizarre conspiracy theories, launching all kinds of vile personal attacks. But it goes much deeper than that. The left knows no boundaries when it comes to the president's family. Now, they've gone after the first lady, Melania Trump. They've gone after all the children, Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric, Tiffany and their spouses, and of course, the president's 11-year-old son, Barron. And you can criticize the president, frankly, all you want, fair game, although some of it has been sick and obsessive and bizarrely, breathlessly, you know, conspiratorial. But really, an 11-year-old kid? Does this not expose a massive double standard when it comes to the left? Nine times out of 10, they can cross the line and they don't face any consequences. There's no outrage, no backlash. Conservatives don't say they need to be fired and boycotted. They're allowed to do and say whatever they want, whenever they want, especially when it comes to smearing and attacking conservatives, which is probably why Kathy Griffin thought it was OK to do that in the first place. Now, coming up later tonight, we're going to have much more on this effort to call out the double standard and the attacks against me and the boycotts against me and the efforts to silence conservatives and liberal fascism and Brian Maloney and Melanie Morgan, who created the Media Equality Project to fight back against these efforts to silence conservative voices, they will be here to explain that they're just getting started. They're giving a preview of what's coming in the weeks ahead. But first, let me show you just a couple examples of what I'm talking about. NBC is supposed to be a news organization. NBC News with Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams, et cetera, right? Remember all of that? John Chancellor. Well, NBC's Rachel Maddow, one of the worst offenders when it comes to pushing -- as a matter of fact, she is the champion of pushing unhinged, bizarre conspiracy theories. Now, here's her back in 2010 trying to explain away then-Congressman Anthony Weiner's graphic, lewd tweet, making excuses for \"Little Anthony.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC",
      "utterance": "If the congressman was hacked, as he said he was, if he was pranked, how would that work? How could a person do that. What would that look like? The Daily Kos writer looks at the imagine of the congressman's Twitter account more closely, and judging from the pixelization of the images and some other visual clues, he concludes that the damage was a composite saved a number of times, indicating it had been Photoshopped. For a theory with fewer steps, a number of other blogs have different versions of a theory of a potential hacking that looks at the information embedded in this controversial picture. A third but by no means final theory has to do with the photo-sharing service that I was talking about earlier, Whyfrog (ph). It's not all that hard to generate a program that was try every possible combination using your Twitter name until you got the right email address to use the service to post pictures."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

And also tonight, failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, she continues to lead the way in pushing these conspiracy theories about why she lost the election. Earlier today, during an interview at a tech conference, she gave a very long list of excuses, blaming everybody but herself? Watch this."

And Hillary, there's no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians! And we can't forget that Hillary's been pushing other bizarre conspiracy theories for years. Remember? She blamed all of her husband's problems on a vast right-wing conspiracy. Now, here to react to all this, the editor-in-chief of Lifezette, FOX News contributor, nationally syndicated talk show host, radio talk show host, Laura Ingraham. All right, let's first start with -- I want to ask a legal question because I had a couple of friends of mine that are lawyers. If you have a picture of a president's severed head like you're an ISIS fighter and you just beheaded him, could that be interpreted as a threat against the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "In theory, I guess. But in practice, no. And I think the reason not is that you would try to discern the intent of what Kathy Griffin was trying to do, and she was intending to get publicity for herself, which she's certainly gotten. She's intended to raise her profile and be outrageous and she said funny, although nothing about it is funny. So I think that's a stretch. I mean, you could -- you could really stretch it and say, Well, the image itself and the photo shoot itself was meant to incite further violence, but again, as a legal matter, I think that would be pretty difficult to prove. It doesn't take anything away from the fact that it is hideous and depraved and a degenerate approach to entertainment and meant to shock and also meant to dehumanize, Sean. I think a lot of what Hollywood does to conservatives is the opposite of real engaged debate. There's no debate. There's no substantive back and forth because they usually lose that. But they want to dehumanize him. So he's not -- he's not even entitled to the basic respect of the presidency. He's subhuman in their eyes. And she -- she was -- she was carrying that understanding out in that bizarre and..."

But the left's silence -- I mean, they claim that they have a monopoly of compassion on gays, lesbians, women's rights, and -- and they always accuse Republicans of being racist and sexist. How do they stay silent when the first lady has been attacked a she has, Ivanka as she has been attacked? By the way, you and Kellyanne and you have both been, Lara Trump, who's going to join us later. How do they justify never standing up for you guys or never standing up for my right to free speech when they're the champions of free speech?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, because they're not true feminists. I mean, they cloak themselves in the feminist garb, but in reality, they're just, you know, socialists, leftists, Marxists. And their goal is just to grow the government. They don't trust the people. The individual people who turned out in droves in Michigan and Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania to vote for Trump, they're subhuman, too. I mean, they don't -- they really aren't either entitled to determine their own destiny, their own understanding of marriage, their own understanding of when life begins. The very fact that they voted for Trump, in the eyes of a lot of these people from the entertainment industry and certainly from far-left politics -- their very existence is a point of embarrassment. So rather than engage people in a real conversation, they seek to perpetually and merely dehumanize them and debase them to the extent that you don't even have to - - you don't have to treat them as human beings. And that goes with -- for the sons and daughters of Donald Trump, suddenly -- you know, the left cares about the poor transgender kid who can't use the bathroom that he or she wants to use. OK, that's their point. But the child of a conservative who's treated this way -- they don't even deserve that."

Donald Trump tweeting that he will announce whether to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. eastern. Leaving the deal would fulfill a central campaign pledge but would anger international allies. Under the pact the U.S. is committed to reducing emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Eleven American contractors were among hundreds injured in a massive truck bombing in the capital of Afghanistan. The blast also killed 90 people. It happened in Kabul's heavily guarded diplomatic quarters which houses the U.S. embassy. And D.C. police say they might have prevented a potential disaster. A Pennsylvania doctor staying at the Trump hotel was arrested after cops found an assault style rifle, handgun, and ammunition in his car. The man who had allegedly made threatening remarks and is now facing charged for having illegal firearms. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to \"Hannity.\""

What the leftist media has done from the moment that Donald Trump emerged as a serious candidate for president, never mind once he became president, was attack him with really serious things like allegations of Russia collusion without any evidence whatsoever. The Kathy Griffin episode. Two small things like your pointed out that he takes all, oh, my goodness, two scoops of ice cream every night, the horror. But all of these incidents really reveal a sick pathology on the part of the left with regard to Donald Trump. For decades, Sean, the media has largely been on the left. We know that they have shown a bias against conservatives, Republicans, and in favor of Democrats and liberals. But what's different now is the level of activism and vitriol directed towards this particular president because he represents such an unprecedented threat to the establishment, and that includes the media as well. They know that they have many platforms with which to attack him. And this assault is not going to end until his presidency does. And in their mind, if they can accelerate the end of his presidency, so much the better."

At the very least in their minds they stop his agenda. And if they stop his agenda, then maybe that puts the House at risk in 2018. Maybe that creates an opportunity for impeachment. But God knows no reason at this point at all, but they've been talking about it from day one."

The president has just returned from this nine-day trip to the Middle East and to Europe. By the time he got to the group shot of the European Union members, and he pushed aside the Montenegrin president in a big photo because the president of the United States and the five big powers traditionally have the front row. So he edged the guy around, the newest member of the EU."

Rather than talking about what happened in Saudi Arabia, good or ill, what happened in Israel, good or ill, the pope visit, how that -- they were talking about Trump the bully. It was the symbol how this was the personification of -- it is so stupid where we are right now with the press trying to stop this guy in the back. It is so disheartening. It is so unnecessary. And I just think that at some point it becomes unpatriotic."

And now the level of activism here is really quite unprecedented because, again, Donald Trump is an unprecedented figure. He must not be allowed to succeed. That's the view of everybody in the establishment, including the media, and that's why the long knives that were out for every Republican president are certainly out for Donald Trump, but even more so because he represents something wholly different. He is going to set this country and the way things are done on a completely different trajectory, and that's why he has got to be destroyed."

And how has this impacted the president's 11-year-old son? And then later President Trump expected to announce he will pull out of the Paris climate agreement.

International the entire Trump family has been subjected to these horrible attacks by Democrats and members of the mainstream media. Donald Trump, Jr., last night tweeted this about Kathy Griffin's vile so-called joke, quote, \"Disgusting, not surprising. This is the left today. They consider this acceptable. Imagine a conservative that did this to President Obama.\" Joining us now with reaction, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump.

The fact that we live in a society that thinks something like this is acceptable, and let's not forget -- it probably wasn't just Kathy Griffin. She has many people around her. There was a photographer involved. I'm sure she has a publicist that works with her. There were a lot of people around that could have said, you know what, this crosses the line. And the fact that nobody said that this crossed any line is appalling. But it tells you the society that we live in today and what some people deem acceptable. And this is exactly right.

Or what has been said about our first lady. Or what has been said about Ivanka Trump. Now the vicious attacks against Jared, seems like deep state leaks again. Then you have got Don and Eric. You've been attacked. You are expecting your first child. And everybody else around the president, anybody that likes the president, it seems, is subjected to this. I've never seen it this bad. As a family, have you talked about it, and how are you dealing with all of it?"

We have taken it for almost two years. And we understand that this is the world we live in, and we have accepted it in a way. But I think what is not acceptable is that people do things like what Kathy Griffin did. There were people out there that would rather see our president fail rather than see our country succeed. And it's very dangerous and we live in a very, very dangerous place right now. And it's very frightening to all of us."

Here Ivanka, Melania attacked, you've been attacked. And I have not heard a peep out of any prominent Democrat saying, OK, can we please stop attacking these women because it's so vile and vicious? And then you got Hillary -- they're such hypocrisy. They're not champions of free speech. They take money from sharia countries that persecute and abuse women, kill gays and lesbians, persecute Christians and Jews people. They buy silence from people like Hillary, and not a peep. I think I'm the only person in the country that points out the hypocrisy. And look at, for example, Ivanka, look at the horrible things Bill Maher said about her and she can't promote her recent book."

      "speaker": "LARA TRUMP",

And as a woman who works myself, I have read it, and I think it is going to be very helpful whenever I have a child in September to help me along the way. She can't promote it. She says she won't promote it. And so I would love for people to go out and read it because it's an incredible book. But what these people have said, Sean, on the left is they are teaching the young women of this country who are all paying very close attention right now that you can support other women but only if these other women have their interests aligned exactly with yours. And anything outside of that is unacceptable."

Make America great again.\" Joining us now with reaction, senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Chris Horner. Chris, this would be a really bad idea.

We would cede what you could call energy sovereignty or policymaking when it comes to energy to others who have their interests at heart but not ours, as candidate Trump said when he promised to cancel U.S. participation. And it's clearly a treaty in which President Obama just pretended it isn't and therefore circumvented the Senate, further weakening our treaty process, which it had a good run but I suggest we try to restore it soon. The policies are not popular here. They wouldn't be approved. That's why President Obama went through EPA. And undoing those rules would be much harder if President Trump broke his promise."

      "utterance": "You and I not quite 20 years ago talked about the Kyoto treaty. That had one and contemplated two compliance periods. This goes on forever. It solves that problem. It requires us to impose the energy rationing policies of the Kyoto treaty, of President Obama's global warming rules, increasing the price, as President Obama put it, causing your electricity rates to necessarily skyrocket because they have to price the most abundant, affordable, reliable energy out of your reach to force stuff that doesn't work, that's failed for 125 years into the system to, as President Obama said in numerous speeches, finally make renewable energy profitable. This is too great a costs to reward some campaign contributors, and by the way, not Trump campaign contributors. This is about rewarding Clinton supporters. It was a priority for them. So it tightens every five years in perpetuity. This is the agreement. It's done. There is no seat at the table. And I hope President Trump's advisors remind him that lame talking point of Washington wise men, well, you have to have a seat at the table, they solved that here. It requires a tightening every five years in perpetuity of us. Most countries really don't have an obligation. You are talking about increasing energy poverty, killing seniors and the most vulnerable for a gesture. There is no detectable climate impact even projected."
