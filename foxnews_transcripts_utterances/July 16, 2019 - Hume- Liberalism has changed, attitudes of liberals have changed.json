This year -- this Congress, I should say, we're on record for 10,000 threats against Members of Congress and I condemn them whether they're against Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, you know, this is just no way to operate within our country. And I just wonder like, is it the fact that I've been a critic of some of the senior officials at the F.B.I. that maybe leads to different treatment for the people who threaten me as opposed to the people who actually get arrested who have threatened Eric Swalwell, you know, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib -- those people actually get arrested, whereas when people threaten conservatives, I hope there's not a double standard.

This is tough for people like Cory Booker who grew up in an affluent family. Both parents were IBM executives. He was a Rhodes Scholar. He went to Yale Law School. But they're pretending to be oppressed anyway. Others like Joe Biden have found themselves in the wrong side. Biden is now described as an oppressor, told to shuffle off the ash heap of history. Pete Buttigieg in a weird position though. Buttigieg wants to be president, so he has to be a victim. But it's kind of hard to pose this one. He went to Harvard, child of a college professor then he got a Rhodes scholarship. He was a consultant for McKinsey. Now he's Wall Street's favorite Democratic candidate at the age of 37. How can he possibly claim to be a victim or oppressed? Easy, Pete Buttigieg is the victim of racism. \"Huh?\" You say. True. On Sunday, Buttigieg tweeted this and we're quoting, \"As an immigrant and a citizen, my dad cared deeply about this country. Once, when he was speaking at a campus protest against Reagan's accommodation of apartheid, a passing student noticed dad's brown skin and unique accent and called out 'go home.' He answered, 'I am home.'\" Poignant moment. Keep in mind, Pete Buttigieg's dad, who seems pretty European really was a professor at Notre Dame, one of the country's elite colleges. And yet even he couldn't escape America's all-consuming racism. And that's the most important thing for you to know. America is racist, says Pete Buttigieg, hateful and racist. And he's been a victim of that racism. But you know what? You can atone for that racism by making him the President. That's his pitch. Great story of the year. Pete Buttigieg, a judge the victim of racism. It's just another sign that the Democratic Party is spiraling completely out of control and becoming something very different. In Washington, the group led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez now appears to set the agenda or some of it anyway. Across America, Antifa terrorizes American citizens while CNN cheers them on. What is happening exactly? And what does it mean for the country for the long view? We go, as we always do to Brit Hume. He is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us tonight. Now, it's pretty easy, Brit, as you well know, and I sometime fall victim to this, to lose perspective, get spun up, kind of forget that it's still America. Give us some perspective here.

And what I see is people have such conviction and certainty, that their views are right and wise and obviously correct, that they therefore believe that anyone who holds up opposing views cannot possibly be doing so for any sincere reasons. And therefore, they must be acting out of some ulterior motive, some nefarious motive, whether it be racism, or greed, or whatever it is. And that kind of viewpoint leads to a kind of rage where you see how can anybody possibly think this? How can anyone possibly say this? I mean, I get this all the time. You know, it's said to me all the time. I hear this on Twitter all the time, \"You know, you used to be a good journalist, you used to be respected. But then you sold out and went to Fox News.\" Well, this comes from people who want my years as a journalist at ABC News and elsewhere, you know, I kept my opinions to myself, so nobody knew what I might have thought. Now, that I'm -- as an analyst and commentator, able to express, some people find out that well, I might be a conservative. Well, you can't possibly be a conservative for the right reasons. You must have sold out. You must be doing it for money. But once you start to take that view of people of opposing views, it's not very far to the kind of rage that you see in which the word racist is hurled around with such abandon, in which violent threats are being made because, you know, if people hold these absolutely untenable views, and do you think they're going to ruin the country with them, well, next thing, you know, this is what you get.",

He moved steadily left over those years, as justices tend to. He was succeeded in his seat by Current Justice Elena Kagan. Even after his retirement into his late 90s, Stevens remained active. Just last year he wrote an op-ed calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment and then attacked Trump Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh as unfit to serve on the Supreme Court. He became a wild eyed crazed partisan in his final years, unfortunately. Speaking of Brett Kavanaugh, a brand new book has new insights on the epic conformation battle that all of us watched.

Second, even though it's disgusting, it is true, and given that fact, we live in a world where there are a limited number of admission spots that are going to go to people, and if you tell people that you're going to give an admission spot to somebody who is the son of privilege, who happened to be related to a politician from New York, then what you're effectively telling as a middle class kid or a lower income kid, you don't get that spot because that spot is going to go to somebody who is a child of privilege. And then the third big thing that we have to be worried about is that part of the reasons why our university system is so corrupt and doesn't work well for the broad middle of the country, is that it isn't actually represented, and it doesn't have the broad middle of the country taking part in its classrooms and taking part in its public debates.",

Well, treason and bribery are fairly clear cut, you know what those are, but what exactly are high crimes and misdemeanors? Scholars have debated that very question for centuries now. But no longer. This week, a group of newly elected Democratic Members of Congress finally defined the term. Here it is. \"A high crime and misdemeanor is when you insult liberals.\" This weekend, the President wrote a series of nasty tweets about four Congresswomen, and you may have read about it. They were Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna, Pressley and Rashida Tlaib. Doing that, sending those tweets we soon learned is tantamount to bribery and treason. Watch."

What he has said now in clarification is that this is not China, this is America. And in America, if you hate our country, you're free to leave. Now, he said that in response to the behavior of the four Congresswomen that you're talking about, the so-called \"squad.\" I'm not sure the President should exchange playground insults with them. You know, when you try to argue with a fool that proves thereto. But the President decided to do so. That simple fact of the matter is that the four Congresswomen think that America was wicked in its origins. They think that America and its people are even more wicked now that we are all racist, and misogynistic, and evil. Now, this is -- they're entitled to their opinion. They're Americans.

It's clearly an indication that Nancy Pelosi with Donald Trump's help, has lost that fight with the squad. She was of course herself called -- well, the inference was that from Ocasio-Cortez that Nancy Pelosi was a racist for simply disagreeing and criticizing them for their vote against border aid -- aid for the border facilities, and then that fight began. What we then saw though, was Nancy Pelosi really trying to marginalize and move them away from being the face of the Democratic Party. And that is in part we believe, because of an internal Democratic poll that became public through Axios that indicated that, in fact, these four women are not part of a movement. They are not liked. It was a poll of Trump swing voters, people that the Democrats need to win back and the approval rating of like Ilhan Omar was at nine percent, of Ocasio-Cortez 22 percent. Socialism is toxic as a discussion and as an issue, and there are suddenly a realization that these people are dangerous for the future of the party. Now, you would know that if you weren't in a coma, the politicians need polls to show them. But this is why suddenly and even Representative Clay chimed in from Missouri, saying that they're effectively immature and ignorant, and then suddenly enter Donald Trump and with his tweets, bringing back this argument to the nature of what is going on in the Democratic Party and forcing the Democrats to once again embrace them. And it just shows you the lack of control Nancy Pelosi as she must have known that this is what was going on. The President is always underestimated. Yes. David Axelrod called his approach cold and hard. Well, you know what? The future of the country is at stake and all of our futures with our families is at stake. And I expect the President to be cold and hard in making sure that Americans know exactly what's going on. He's done that. It was chaos on the floor.

This is what liberals and Democrats are doing to each other now that there is -- it's a zero sum game, that there is such a reservoir of bitter hatred, because that's what they promote politically. Yes, everyone's a racist, and if everyone is well, then you know, my friend, I'm sitting next to over here is a racist, and that there can be no part given to the issue of finding common ground with Americans in general. Dr. Wen is a medical doctor. And she there's a suggestion obviously here that maybe politics is not what Planned Parenthood should be doing. That's what Americans also believe that Dr. Wen will be proven correct here, and it's time I think, for the Federal government, especially to see Planned Parenthood not as a recipient of its largess in grants, and that they're the political organization that we believe them to be."

The Tacoma terrorist himself Willem Van Spronsen appeared in Bell's episode. This ran on CNN. Here are the screenshots to prove it. So let's be clear, Antifa a terror organization. They use violence for political ends. They don't hide that, they brag about it. Since Van Spronsen's terror attack over the weekend, Antifa has celebrated him as a martyr. This is the group that CNN called heroes. Has this weekend's terror attack changed their mind over at CNN? Well, today we contacted Kamau Bell to find out. We asked him if he regretted promoting Antifa. He did not reply to us. So then we contacted as CNN spokeswoman to see if the channel stands by Bell's Antifa documentary and to see if CNN plans to air it again, complete with the picture of the dead terrorist. CNN didn't respond to that request. So then we call the network's parent company, AT&T and asked those questions. Will this air again on CNN? As of tonight, AT&T has not gotten back to us, nor has Jeff Zucker, who runs CNN. We're going to keep trying to get an answer to that question. We think it's important. A domestic terrorist tried to murder Federal agents. CNN egged him on beforehand. Now, they're pretending like nothing ever happened. And it's not just them, by the way, it's the attitude of the entire left. Not a single Democratic presidential candidate has condemned Van Spronsen as of tonight. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar initially ignored questions about it, as if condemning a terror attack requires careful thought. And those are just -- those are the good reactions actually. Some journalists have been praising Van Spronsen, the dead terrorist, outright. This is insanity, and it leads in only one direction. Political violence isn't like other crime. It's far worse than that. It destroys countries. America is fortunate that unlike, for example, Somalia and just about every country in Latin America, we've got many generations without serious political violence in this country.

      "utterance": "Yes, well, I was in Antifa when I was just 16. So like, almost 10 years ago, and I'm telling you this, back then it was just a group that went out and go protest against what people we thought were anti-fascist. However, Antigfa is far more violent today than it ever was. There's multiple professors -- to really understand Antifa, we have to go into the college campuses. Throughout the country, we have a lot of different professors who are advocating for violence. We have Mark Bray from Dartmouth University, who wrote \"Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook\" where he praises and he advocates for political violence. And then most recently, at the Leadership Institute Campus Reform, we had a professor from Colorado State University, who said that she was done talking to people on her opposition and that she was ready to punch them in the neck. And unfortunately, we are seeing a resurgence of political violence by the left."

And I'm actually really excited to start a college tour, where I'm going to be talking to college students throughout the country about my story and why I joined Antifa. And I know you mentioned about how CNN is basically inoculating Antifa, but it goes far beyond that. We also have to look at where their sentiment comes from. I am Mexican and I grew up watching Telemundo and Univision, and I can tell you that they are far worse than CNN. They like to teach their audiences that President Trump is the worst person in the world. And a lot of people in Antifa are taking a lot of ideas from these networks."

According to Gaetz, the F.B.I. has already identified the person you just heard, the person who threatened him. But a Federal prosecutor has decided not to bring charges.

      "utterance": "No, I received word late last week that the U.S. Attorney's office where this individual lived had reviewed the information and had deemed these messages and I'm quoting directly, \"a nonthreat.\" It's obviously a crime -- a Federal crime to make these types of threats against any Federal official. This year -- this Congress, I should say, we're on record for 10,000 threats against Members of Congress and I condemn them whether they're against Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, you know, this is just no way to operate within our country. And I just wonder like, is it the fact that I've been a critic of some of the senior officials at the F.B.I. that maybe leads to different treatment for the people who threaten me as opposed to the people who actually get arrested who have threatened Eric Swalwell, you know, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib -- those people actually get arrested, whereas when people threaten conservatives, I hope there's not a double standard. But I mean, you heard the messages. And there were even other messages where they threaten my family, Tucker."

And it's really people on the left who want to talk about threats to our democracy. Our democracy is served when our representatives have fidelity to the constitution and to our constituents, when you have to have fidelity to some concern that someone is going to, you know, kill you or kill your family or harm you at a public event, it erodes the representation that every Member of Congress should be able to provide their district regardless of their viewpoint."

One fantastic Democratic Congresswoman, Stephanie Murphy of Florida condemned it. She was the only one since then. A Pete Buttigieg staff member said that people should throw urine on me and then I received these threatening messages and no Federal prosecutors so far seem to be interested in in those cases. And you know, just -- this is no way to get together and solve the problems we have to solve for the country. It's no way to govern and I wish there would be more bipartisan support for nonviolence."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the Democratic presidential race has devolved into the victimhood Olympics. You've got to be a victim or you can't compete. This is tough for people like Cory Booker who grew up in an affluent family. Both parents were IBM executives. He was a Rhodes Scholar. He went to Yale Law School. But they're pretending to be oppressed anyway. Others like Joe Biden have found themselves in the wrong side. Biden is now described as an oppressor, told to shuffle off the ash heap of history. Pete Buttigieg in a weird position though. Buttigieg wants to be president, so he has to be a victim. But it's kind of hard to pose this one. He went to Harvard, child of a college professor then he got a Rhodes scholarship. He was a consultant for McKinsey. Now he's Wall Street's favorite Democratic candidate at the age of 37. How can he possibly claim to be a victim or oppressed? Easy, Pete Buttigieg is the victim of racism. \"Huh?\" You say. True. On Sunday, Buttigieg tweeted this and we're quoting, \"As an immigrant and a citizen, my dad cared deeply about this country. Once, when he was speaking at a campus protest against Reagan's accommodation of apartheid, a passing student noticed dad's brown skin and unique accent and called out 'go home.' He answered, 'I am home.'\" Poignant moment. Keep in mind, Pete Buttigieg's dad, who seems pretty European really was a professor at Notre Dame, one of the country's elite colleges. And yet even he couldn't escape America's all-consuming racism. And that's the most important thing for you to know. America is racist, says Pete Buttigieg, hateful and racist. And he's been a victim of that racism. But you know what? You can atone for that racism by making him the President. That's his pitch. Great story of the year. Pete Buttigieg, a judge the victim of racism. It's just another sign that the Democratic Party is spiraling completely out of control and becoming something very different. In Washington, the group led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez now appears to set the agenda or some of it anyway. Across America, Antifa terrorizes American citizens while CNN cheers them on. What is happening exactly? And what does it mean for the country for the long view? We go, as we always do to Brit Hume. He is Fox's senior political analyst and he joins us tonight. Now, it's pretty easy, Brit, as you well know, and I sometime fall victim to this, to lose perspective, get spun up, kind of forget that it's still America. Give us some perspective here. How much has the Democratic Party changed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, it's -- the Democratic Party has changed in the sense that liberalism has changed and the attitudes of liberals have changed. And what I sense in all of this, among other things, is a loss of humility about one's own political viewpoint. And what I see is people have such conviction and certainty, that their views are right and wise and obviously correct, that they therefore believe that anyone who holds up opposing views cannot possibly be doing so for any sincere reasons. And therefore, they must be acting out of some ulterior motive, some nefarious motive, whether it be racism, or greed, or whatever it is. And that kind of viewpoint leads to a kind of rage where you see how can anybody possibly think this? How can anyone possibly say this? I mean, I get this all the time. You know, it's said to me all the time. I hear this on Twitter all the time, \"You know, you used to be a good journalist, you used to be respected. But then you sold out and went to Fox News.\" Well, this comes from people who want my years as a journalist at ABC News and elsewhere, you know, I kept my opinions to myself, so nobody knew what I might have thought. Now, that I'm -- as an analyst and commentator, able to express, some people find out that well, I might be a conservative. Well, you can't possibly be a conservative for the right reasons. You must have sold out. You must be doing it for money. But once you start to take that view of people of opposing views, it's not very far to the kind of rage that you see in which the word racist is hurled around with such abandon, in which violent threats are being made because, you know, if people hold these absolutely untenable views, and do you think they're going to ruin the country with them, well, next thing, you know, this is what you get."

Steven served on the court for almost 35 years. He retired at the age of 90. He was appointed in 1975 by President Gerald Ford, but later became known as one of the court's more liberal members. He moved steadily left over those years, as justices tend to. He was succeeded in his seat by Current Justice Elena Kagan. Even after his retirement into his late 90s, Stevens remained active. Just last year he wrote an op-ed calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment and then attacked Trump Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh as unfit to serve on the Supreme Court. He became a wild eyed crazed partisan in his final years, unfortunately. Speaking of Brett Kavanaugh, a brand new book has new insights on the epic conformation battle that all of us watched. We've got its authors, after the break."

You'll remember, the fate of the Supreme Court hinged on hazy college memories and mysterious writings in high school yearbooks. Brett Kavanaugh in the end was confirmed, barely, but his name was tarred forever. Did we learn anything from what happened? Mollie Hemingway covered every minute of it. She's a senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" She was on this show during a lot of it. Carrie Severino is Chief Counsel and Policy Director at the Judicial Crisis Network. They just co-wrote a book, which is one of the bestselling books in the country right now about the confirmation saga. It's called \"Justice on Trial.\" We just spoke with them. Here's what they said."

Well, Carrie and I wanted to write the book because we thought this was the most important thing that the country went through last year, and as we were researching and reporting on it, we did draw a lot of lessons including that thus far, really, a lot of people haven't been held accountable for what happened to Brett Kavanaugh. And so we looked and kind of go through in detail different people who fell down on the job, whether that we -- you know, we talk a little bit about how the media covered the story, how the Senate broke down in various processes, and how, if we want to avoid from happening again, we have to be knowledgeable about what happened. We also have to hold people accountable for what they did."

It's a crime to lie to the F.B.I., it's the same criminal penalties apply to lying to the Senate. And so there were people who admitted in the real time, \"Oh, I didn't think you were going to be taking this seriously. I'm just tweeting these things out,\" or \"I put postings up on Facebook,\" and some of them were referred for prosecution by Senate Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, we haven't heard much. Of course, most famously, Julie Swetnick, Michael Avenatti were also referred for criminal prosecution. I guess they have to take a number on that one. It can get in line. But we would like to see that there's something -- some follow up because this is -- it's not just damage to Brett Kavanaugh's reputation, which is horrible. It undermines the process and it undermines the ability of the Senate to actually investigate real claims when you have people putting forth spurious allegations like that."

So first, you have universities, which are effectively the gateway way to a better life if you come from a lower, or even a middle income background, and I think that's really a disgusting way to structure society to say that you have to go through this particular social test, you have to get into these particular colleges, if you want to have a good job or raise a good family. Second, even though it's disgusting, it is true, and given that fact, we live in a world where there are a limited number of admission spots that are going to go to people, and if you tell people that you're going to give an admission spot to somebody who is the son of privilege, who happened to be related to a politician from New York, then what you're effectively telling as a middle class kid or a lower income kid, you don't get that spot because that spot is going to go to somebody who is a child of privilege. And then the third big thing that we have to be worried about is that part of the reasons why our university system is so corrupt and doesn't work well for the broad middle of the country, is that it isn't actually represented, and it doesn't have the broad middle of the country taking part in its classrooms and taking part in its public debates."

And not just say, you get a special spot if you happen to be a child of privilege or if you meet certain social tests. We should want the entire country represented in these institutions, which of course are not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you had an extraordinary and unusual experience. And coming from the middle of the country from a working class background, winding up at Yale Law School, you wrote a great book about it. But as you looked around when you were there, you must have seen very few people like you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VANCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's one of the things that actually motivated me to write the book is I got there, and I sort of felt like, you know, my spaceship had crashed landed in Oz and that I was just completely out of place at an institution like that. But, you know, again, Tucker, given how important these places are in creating the country's elites, how many of our politicians come from Yale, Harvard, or Stanford Law School? How many of our business leaders? How many of the people who actually call the shots in politics, finance, even are nonprofit organizations? And so the fact that we're creating this system that is so -- that creates such a bottleneck for having a good life, and yet at the same time, we give precious spots to people who don't deserve them, it's really just the worst of both possible worlds. And I think, you know, we want to need to build a society where you don't have to go to Harvard Law School to be able to have a pretty good life, and two, where, even if that's true, those institutions are a little bit more open to people who actually represent the country that those institutions deign to govern over."
