      "sentences": "All right. Hello, 911. I'd like to report an act of journalism. The A.P. actually reported something that's true. First, their weekend headline, one verdict, then six police killings across America in 24 hours, the subhead at least six people were fatally shot by officers across the U.S. in the 24 hours after jurors reached a verdict in the murder case against Chauvin. Now, this is usually how the media works. It looks at the current crisis and thinks, hmm, how can we make it worse? Firefighters put out burning building but people still died. Hospitals save lives, but people still died. We won World War II but people still died. So the headline focuses on one variable, six killings until you get down into the article, where the A.P. momentarily changes their tune. Looking at the cases they write the circumstances surrounding each debt differ widely. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Some happened while officers investigated serious crimes. Police say some of the people were armed with a gun, a knife or a metal pole, one man claimed to have a bomb. The deadly encounters are only a small snapshot of the thousands of interactions between American police officers and civilians every day, most of which end safely. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Wow, did I just run headfirst into a fact? I might need to follow FNC's concussion protocol. I thought the media banned context. Of course then they added, uneventful encounters, not an issue. Their definition of uneventful of course is good police work. Remember the media's old adage, if it bleeds, it was the cops fault. So on this rare occasion, reporters admit police actually do do a good job which destroys the narrative. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A more accurate headline might have been. Most interactions are resolved peacefully or police face unknown dangers. But who would click on that? So what happens when the media stresses just one variable? Well, it becomes a moment on the Oscars. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } TRAVON FREE, ACTOR/WRITER/COMEDIAN: Today, the police will kill three people. And tomorrow the police will kill three people. And the day after that the police will kill three people because on average the police in America every day killed three people, which amounts to about 1000 people a year. And those people happen to disproportionately black people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Seriously, de Blasio broke this city quicker than a toy made in China. Shootings have doubled since 2019. And last week alone shootings jumped a full 250 percent, rapes rose 15 percent, felony assaults 42 percent, grand larceny is 81 percent. Murders were up only six percent but that's after a year where killings already jumped 45 percent. Now I could get into the kids being shot but then the left might say hey, Greg, getting shot is what kids do if they don't have knives. While the hate crimes have shot up 500 percent but at last the perp's mugshots aren't exactly what the media wants. So they ignore it like it was a kid killed in a gang crossfire. If only the purpose were angry white males like this guy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And I get it, telling people that cops are killing blacks with impunity may cause blacks to fear cops. But there's also another pattern going on. It's one in which one shooting is covered and another isn't. This is some serious selective bias. I get it. No one covers a safely landed plane. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But imagine doing this with reckless driving only covering accidents in which the paramedic arrives at the scene and the driver still dies. You'd be left with a warped view that paramedics kill with impunity. (BLEEP)I don't want to give the left any ideas. Ilhan Omar might start calling to defend the EMTs. The current narrative about policing is based on isolated events taken out of millions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Who does this help besides the guy remodeling Jeff Zucker's beach house? It doesn't help the people truly in trouble. I made a chart. Look at that. Spent all weekend on it. In life, bad things happen. illnesses, accidents, vending machine, honeybuns. These can all cut your life shorts. But life choices the environment you live in and bad luck can lead you to a place where it can only end badly. Such terrible endings are often preceded by failed social programs and the far left that makes excuses for them. Sadly, the media ignores the problems that get you up there. Until you get to that moment at the end. Then all attention is thrusted upon the person who shows up when no one else will, the cop. And because we ignored all the factors leading to that moment. We blame that person. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course he or she could do a terrible, terrible job so terrible that a jury finds him guilty of murder. Others however, don't do a terrible job but only participate in an endless cycle to the best of their abilities. And when they do it right, we don't care. And when they don't we take them apart. You know, it's estimated that 250,000 people die a year due to hospital mistakes. If CNN could tie that to race, their network would look like a Grey's Anatomy marathon. Cops are -- cops are like offensive lineman in the NFL. The only time their names are mentioned or when they commit an infraction. The false narrative that cops are unjustly killing minorities at an increasing rate has an unhappy ending. Gone is the decades long decrease in crime. Lawlessness isn't going anywhere for a long time. The left truly will have no justice and no peace. If you're a victim of crime, too bad. You weren't clickbait. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you expect the protesters to help, sorry, they only read the headlines. Even after the children verdict, protesters blocked the Brooklyn Bridge. They're demanding to remove the police from the city engulfed in a massive Crime Wave. Who will show up then? Who will show up to help the innocent. It won't be the marchers, that's for sure. But they will call 911 if someone steals their skateboard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But one question remains: If she doesn't rewind was he faced the death penalty? The woman says she only became aware of the charges after getting married in Texas, that happens, and being unable to change her name. Apparently, the county clerk ran her name through Ask Jeeves. The Oklahoma store she rented from doesn't even exist anymore. And what was the tape you ask? \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" who is now 53. According to the woman, it was actually her roommate with young children that rented the video. Same exact excuse I use when renting Pippi Longstockings. Once again, children are the source of all evil. We've been talking about this for a month, the only show that talks about this. The charges have since been dropped. But it got me thinking about all the tapes I failed to return over the years because I just wanted to hold on to them forever. For example, \"Barbie and the Diamond Castle,\" one of my favorites, and then there's a \"Barbie A Fairy Secrets.\" I won't tell you the secret, but it is mind blowing.

It's like MSNBC hired a bunch of actors, or it is national reviews, Kyle Smith, put it, \"If a single five-minute period went by without someone reminding us of something horrible, I guess I missed it.\" The show's ratings have dropped to 58 percent from last year, as it's gotten more political and preachy, even with people trapped inside. The show is as predictable as the celebrities you see in rehab. Maybe it's a coincidence, or maybe people just aren't that interested in listening to rich stars whine about how much everything sucks.

      "utterance": "All right. Hello, 911. I'd like to report an act of journalism. The A.P. actually reported something that's true. First, their weekend headline, one verdict, then six police killings across America in 24 hours, the subhead at least six people were fatally shot by officers across the U.S. in the 24 hours after jurors reached a verdict in the murder case against Chauvin. Now, this is usually how the media works. It looks at the current crisis and thinks, hmm, how can we make it worse? Firefighters put out burning building but people still died. Hospitals save lives, but people still died. We won World War II but people still died. So the headline focuses on one variable, six killings until you get down into the article, where the A.P. momentarily changes their tune. Looking at the cases they write the circumstances surrounding each debt differ widely. Some happened while officers investigated serious crimes. Police say some of the people were armed with a gun, a knife or a metal pole, one man claimed to have a bomb. The deadly encounters are only a small snapshot of the thousands of interactions between American police officers and civilians every day, most of which end safely. Wow, did I just run headfirst into a fact? I might need to follow FNC's concussion protocol. I thought the media banned context. Of course then they added, uneventful encounters, not an issue. Their definition of uneventful of course is good police work. Remember the media's old adage, if it bleeds, it was the cops fault. So on this rare occasion, reporters admit police actually do do a good job which destroys the narrative. A more accurate headline might have been. Most interactions are resolved peacefully or police face unknown dangers. But who would click on that? So what happens when the media stresses just one variable? Well, it becomes a moment on the Oscars. TRAVON FREE, ACTOR/WRITER/COMEDIAN: Today, the police will kill three people. And tomorrow the police will kill three people. And the day after that the police will kill three people because on average the police in America every day killed three people, which amounts to about 1000 people a year. And those people happen to disproportionately black people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "It is one variable, but it's not just the peaceful or heroic police encounters that go ignored, but also the primary reason why police show up at all crime. By the time the police are called to a situation it's already bad. No one calls 911 just to say hi, well unless you're Kat. Here's a New York Post rundown of the Democrat ruin city that I live in, NYC. Seriously, de Blasio broke this city quicker than a toy made in China. Shootings have doubled since 2019. And last week alone shootings jumped a full 250 percent, rapes rose 15 percent, felony assaults 42 percent, grand larceny is 81 percent. Murders were up only six percent but that's after a year where killings already jumped 45 percent. Now I could get into the kids being shot but then the left might say hey, Greg, getting shot is what kids do if they don't have knives. While the hate crimes have shot up 500 percent but at last the perp's mugshots aren't exactly what the media wants. So they ignore it like it was a kid killed in a gang crossfire. If only the purpose were angry white males like this guy."

      "utterance": "Have you look at nearly all police involve fatalities? Patterns emerge, non-compliance, illegal drug use mental illness, and even fear. And I get it, telling people that cops are killing blacks with impunity may cause blacks to fear cops. But there's also another pattern going on. It's one in which one shooting is covered and another isn't. This is some serious selective bias. I get it. No one covers a safely landed plane. But imagine doing this with reckless driving only covering accidents in which the paramedic arrives at the scene and the driver still dies. You'd be left with a warped view that paramedics kill with impunity. (BLEEP)I don't want to give the left any ideas. Ilhan Omar might start calling to defend the EMTs. The current narrative about policing is based on isolated events taken out of millions. Who does this help besides the guy remodeling Jeff Zucker's beach house? It doesn't help the people truly in trouble. I made a chart. Look at that. Spent all weekend on it. In life, bad things happen. illnesses, accidents, vending machine, honeybuns. These can all cut your life shorts. But life choices the environment you live in and bad luck can lead you to a place where it can only end badly. Such terrible endings are often preceded by failed social programs and the far left that makes excuses for them. Sadly, the media ignores the problems that get you up there. Until you get to that moment at the end. Then all attention is thrusted upon the person who shows up when no one else will, the cop. And because we ignored all the factors leading to that moment. We blame that person. Of course he or she could do a terrible, terrible job so terrible that a jury finds him guilty of murder. Others however, don't do a terrible job but only participate in an endless cycle to the best of their abilities. And when they do it right, we don't care. And when they don't we take them apart. You know, it's estimated that 250,000 people die a year due to hospital mistakes. If CNN could tie that to race, their network would look like a Grey's Anatomy marathon. Cops are -- cops are like offensive lineman in the NFL. The only time their names are mentioned or when they commit an infraction. The false narrative that cops are unjustly killing minorities at an increasing rate has an unhappy ending. Gone is the decades long decrease in crime. Lawlessness isn't going anywhere for a long time. The left truly will have no justice and no peace. If you're a victim of crime, too bad. You weren't clickbait. If you expect the protesters to help, sorry, they only read the headlines. Even after the children verdict, protesters blocked the Brooklyn Bridge. They're demanding to remove the police from the city engulfed in a massive Crime Wave. Who will show up then? Who will show up to help the innocent. It won't be the marchers, that's for sure. But they will call 911 if someone steals their skateboard."

In other words, we want less government but also favor big government. Just like a Republican Senator. Fact is, we don't know what we want. It's like the time I went to Baskin Robbins and asked for a 32nd flavor. All right, Jonathan, we want less government, but we favor big government. Why do we so torn on this?

A former Oklahoma resident, aren't they all, recently learned she had been charged with felony embezzlement over a videotapes she failed to return in 1999. That's over 21 late years of adult fees, late fees. Adult fees? Oh my god! Which comes to $25 million, Doctor, whatever you, you are. That's according to something I just made up. Where am I in this? But one question remains: If she doesn't rewind was he faced the death penalty? The woman says she only became aware of the charges after getting married in Texas, that happens, and being unable to change her name. Apparently, the county clerk ran her name through Ask Jeeves. The Oklahoma store she rented from doesn't even exist anymore. And what was the tape you ask? \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" who is now 53. According to the woman, it was actually her roommate with young children that rented the video. Same exact excuse I use when renting Pippi Longstockings. Once again, children are the source of all evil. We've been talking about this for a month, the only show that talks about this. The charges have since been dropped. But it got me thinking about all the tapes I failed to return over the years because I just wanted to hold on to them forever. For example, \"Barbie and the Diamond Castle,\" one of my favorites, and then there's a \"Barbie A Fairy Secrets.\" I won't tell you the secret, but it is mind blowing. And then, there's \"Tinkerbell and the Grand Fairy Rescue.\" That was exciting. And of course \"Deliverance.\" So, I forgot to return that one on purpose.

It's like MSNBC hired a bunch of actors, or it is national reviews, Kyle Smith, put it, \"If a single five-minute period went by without someone reminding us of something horrible, I guess I missed it.\" The show's ratings have dropped to 58 percent from last year, as it's gotten more political and preachy, even with people trapped inside. The show is as predictable as the celebrities you see in rehab. Maybe it's a coincidence, or maybe people just aren't that interested in listening to rich stars whine about how much everything sucks.

So, it's always a joy for me to see other celebrities out and about and not afraid not wearing a mask. Like, I saw Nicolas Cage jogging through Central Park yesterday afternoon. He was great. He was out there enjoying it. He didn't care who saw him. It would have been nice if he wore some pants. But Nicolas Cage, he does -- he's uncaged when it comes to his pants, he doesn't need pants at all. Nicholas Uncage, that's what he is. Look at him go. Good job, Nicolas Cage. I loved you in the \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call,\" one of the greatest unsung movies of all time. Now, let's just have a little bit of time. Joe, do you have anything you want to plug?"
