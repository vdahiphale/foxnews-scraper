I think the Democrats might have thought they got some shots in today but they're kind of ephemeral. I would say this, the Democrats spent a ton of time today talking about process. And in my experience, if you're talking about process, that probably means you don't have much else to go on and it doesn't last very long because as soon as we get into the hearing tomorrow where you have the nominee finally answering questions that are, hopefully, of substance, then the process questions will probably fade away. The Democrats have decided that they had to do something to show that their base that their willing to fight. They've had nine weeks. They have not come up with a coherent, long-lasting argument against Brett Kavanaugh. They're just against him overall. I do think it was interesting, Jesse, that the Democrats never seem to be mad at Senator Harry Reid who made the decision to break those protocols years ago, and that has led to this moment where you only need 51 votes to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. The Democrats best hope would be to try to win more elections, of course.

I don't think he knew what was happening. You're right, Jesse, if you're watching the hearing this morning, every 2 minutes there was another yell and a scream and protester.

They've already made up their decision. They're saying it is for the benefit of the American people. I see what you're saying. It's the way that they go through these things. I think one of the most interesting speeches today was Ben Sasse, Senator Ben Sasse who basically gave a schoolhouse rock of the three branches of government, and the role that the legislature is supposed to play, article one of the constitution.

      "utterance": "Well, I think the Republicans think that they are playing a longer game, so they're looking right now. The reason we have these hearings is, as Bret said, it's just part of our process. But if you're a Republican and you're in the Trump White House, you're thinking, well, four days of a hearing for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, not so bad. I think the Democrats might have thought they got some shots in today but they're kind of ephemeral. I would say this, the Democrats spent a ton of time today talking about process. And in my experience, if you're talking about process, that probably means you don't have much else to go on and it doesn't last very long because as soon as we get into the hearing tomorrow where you have the nominee finally answering questions that are, hopefully, of substance, then the process questions will probably fade away. The Democrats have decided that they had to do something to show that their base that their willing to fight. They've had nine weeks. They have not come up with a coherent, long-lasting argument against Brett Kavanaugh. They're just against him overall. I do think it was interesting, Jesse, that the Democrats never seem to be mad at Senator Harry Reid who made the decision to break those protocols years ago, and that has led to this moment where you only need 51 votes to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. The Democrats best hope would be to try to win more elections, of course. But what they did today, Jesse, is they put Democrat senators in red states, those ones who are up for reelection, in a real bind. They already have it tough. It does not make it easier for them."

Like, oh, if we just had a little bit more information about him, it might sway the tide and we might support him. While you have Cory Booker, while he's saying those things, sending out fund-raising email saying stop Kavanaugh. And I'm sure that was going for many Democrats across the board.

But also, you know, to be fair, what Senator Booker is saying is that I've already decided I'm not going to vote for you, but it is my duty to uncover everything I can so that my constituents have full information. Again, I agree with you, it is futile if you're already going to vote against him. And I thought at the beginning when they started that, that Senator Grassley could have said, oh, Senator Hirono, you are open-minded on Brett Kavanaugh. That's great. What can we do to help you get to a yes? And she would have said there's nothing you can do."

And there's an image that's going around the internet when Fred tried to approach the nominee and tried to shake his hand afterwards. And it's being played in the media as the nominee rejecting the handshake of a Parkland shooting victim. But if you see the video, and I want you guys to react to that, it was a chaotic, quick moment. And the video shows Kavanaugh kind of being confused and having someone come after him with an extended hand. And, you know, the hearing had been very rowdy all day. And, you know, security kind of stepped in and he moved into a different direction. This now, this gentleman, and we have, you know, great empathy for him because he lost his son, is on CNN and MSNBC tonight. Is this a moment you think that, you know, is going to make an impact with these hearings and in the rest of the country?"

And, actually, if you look at the character witnesses from both sides of the aisle that have spoken about what a great man he is, that this is not something that Brett Kavanaugh would do if under normal circumstances. I don't think he knew what was happening. You're right, Jesse, if you're watching the hearing this morning, every 2 minutes there was another yell and a scream and protester. His children had to be escorted out during that period. And when they go to take the first break, he's been sitting there for three hours. His back is turned. The man comes up to him. I have no doubt in my mind that had he known, he would have been willing to shake his hand, but when the security, like, let's go because you don't know what is happening in the room, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt. But I would not underestimate the power of an image like that and especially in the age of social media for it to get around and for them to try to make it stick."

Listen, as you see in the video, it's even slow down. It's only a second long. The still image is obviously right there. But it had been a morning full of protests. And let's not forget that this is a Supreme Court nominee who now has a lot of security. And it is, you know, it's a precarious time. And he doesn't know who's walking up from the outside.

I think there's been a lot of attention paid to what Democrats were doing today, some of the things that they're saying, some of the smears that they've lobbed toward this nominee. Kamala Harris essentially accusing Brett Kavanaugh of being racist and not applying the law equally and fairly depending on who he was -- who was in front of him in terms of his decisions. You had Lisa Blatt who's a self- described feminist attorney on the left, talking about her experience with him. You had Condoleezza Rice, who you work with, saying that she, hands down, could vouch for his character and his integrity and saying that he seeks truth and facts. Can you just talk a little bit about how important those statements were that came at the end of the day?"

Those are very credible people that have come with a lot of integrity and decency. So I think that that helps a lot. There's a few other things, remember, the ABA, which is pretty left leaning, the American -- excuse me, the lawyers association, gave him a well-qualified rating. That's their highest rating. But also, if you look at his decisions over the past 12 years on the D.C. circuit court, his colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, have been appointed for those lifetime appointments. They've voted with him or sided with him about 90 percent of the time on average. So that says to me that he's ruled for and against Republicans and Democrats, and that he just looks at the law.

The questioning is tomorrow. So they have 24 more hours to look at the 42,000 documents and they can ask a lot of questions based on that.

Sorry, every politician was just as bad if not worse than our current crop. They were just better at hiding their dirty tricks and better at having their henchmen sling the mud for them, spreading rumors about troubled wives, illegitimate kids, drinking, pills, animal cruelty, bullying, and, of course, not-so-subtle accusations of racism. And, as always, the media helped. Yes, Trump insults you. We get it. But the political hacks who condemn him now did so much more into each other. They only forgave each other over it because they knew they were all as guilty as sin. So while it's nice to hear about the good old days of bipartisanship, remember that's just code for losing. All the phony hugs dissolve like butter on a hot plate as you just saw on the hearings as one side paints the other as evil and the media will sit on his hands because they set the stage for it. So save your lectures on respect. It disrespects us. All right, Juan, people always talk a good game about civility but they always forget their uncivil moments.
