      "sentences": "What would America look like under four more years of President Trump versus a new term under President Biden? Well, that really is the question all voters should think hard on before November 3rd. The media is biased anti Trump view is what it is. We know it. But it should have zero impact on your decision. Tonight, we're going to examine some of the keyways that your life in America will change if either Joe Biden wins the White House or President Trump wins reelection. We break it down into four categories: the economy, crime and justice, race, and culture. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We all know where Trump is taking us. We experienced it for three years pre-COVID. The economy was thriving. Wages were heading up, historic low unemployment among Hispanics, women and African Americans. Consumer and investor confidence was off the charts. We had criminal justice reform, better border enforcement and China was finally challenged by tariffs. Even the Democrats must know if it weren't for the Wuhan virus, Trump would probably be cruising to a Reagan type landslide. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As for Biden, and Harris, well, they've been exceedingly vague on specific policy proposals. They instead traffic in cliches and bromides. But still, we can infer a lot from what they say, and what they don't say, and from what their most ardent supporters, including their donors are demanding. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } \"The Angle\" has devoted significant time and study to what we call Bidenology. And from now on until the election, we're here to help translate Biden's talking points in meandering statements and will tell you where this globalist Foreign Policy and far left domestic policy will take us. Now, we've already seen through blue state governors' draconian responses to COVID, how they're going to use the virus to take away our basic freedoms. But it's time to dig deeper than that. So we all know what's at stake at this pivotal time for America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We start tonight with a warning from President Trump himself on what America would look like under a Biden administration.

Wages were heading up, historic low unemployment among Hispanics, women and African Americans. Consumer and investor confidence was off the charts. We had criminal justice reform, better border enforcement and China was finally challenged by tariffs. Even the Democrats must know if it weren't for the Wuhan virus, Trump would probably be cruising to a Reagan type landslide. As for Biden, and Harris, well, they've been exceedingly vague on specific policy proposals. They instead traffic in cliches and bromides. But still, we can infer a lot from what they say, and what they don't say, and from what their most ardent supporters, including their donors are demanding. \"The Angle\" has devoted significant time and study to what we call Bidenology. And from now on until the election, we're here to help translate Biden's talking points in meandering statements and will tell you where this globalist Foreign Policy and far left domestic policy will take us. Now, we've already seen through blue state governors' draconian responses to COVID, how they're going to use the virus to take away our basic freedoms. But it's time to dig deeper than that. So we all know what's at stake at this pivotal time for America. We start tonight with a warning from President Trump himself on what America would look like under a Biden administration.

And so down the line - and he's also going to do away with the - he's going to bring back some of the Obamacare taxes that the Republicans got rid of. So this tax increase is going to hit everyone. When you have a lousy economy, that hurts people. They can't get way raises in wages, they don't get jobs, they can't get higher pay. So this is going to be an unmitigated disaster.

Germany's GDP shrunk 10 percent, Italy's fell more than 12, France took a nearly 14 percent hit, and the U. K. , they lost 20 percent of its GDP.

And you look at Sweden, which had no lock downs, kept the schools open, and their death rates are no worse than other European countries. And that we're seeing here in Florida, even though they had a surge in this summer, their death rates are a fraction of New York's. You're more - youŸ_Tre four to five times more likely to have died in New York than in Florida, because unlike New York, Florida did not stuff people with COVID in nursing homes, which New York did, killing unnecessarily 6, 000 to 12, 000 people.

And so the economy was slowing down under Obama, picked up under Donald Trump. Those are irrefutable facts. And in terms of in terms of the future, we've seen in Europe, what high taxes and high regulation have done. Why would we want to replicate that here? And by the way, they don't tell you that some of the way they pay for these freebies in Europe is with the high national sales tax. Is Biden going to introduce that here - 25 percent? And what about payroll taxes? We have 15 percent payroll tax here. In France and elsewhere, it's 30 to 50 percent. And so those things, they don't tell you how they pay for all this free stuff. Government doesn't create jobs. All government does is take resources from the economy and reallocate them. But people have to produce those resources, and that's what these Democrats don't realize.

So when you think about the taxes that Steve Forbes just talked about, when you talk about the banning of fracking, and when you talk about canceling tariffs on the Chinese, what you're doing is you're inviting more infiltration into our society.

It doesn't matter how hard you or I work, we can't make ourselves 6'8, 300 pounds. We can't play on the field the way they can. So they, in that sense owe us, because they're beneficiaries of this privilege. They know that. And with it comes fantastic economic privilege. Think of the way LeBron James lives, for example, domestic staff, a private airplane. So how does a guy like LeBron James, for example, how does he get to lord it over? What - how could he make a moral claim over some plumber who makes $50, 000 a year? He makes do 2, 000 times more than that guy. So what does he do?

      "utterance": "That interview took place last week, but you get the point. Joining me now is John Eastman, Claremont senior fellow and constitutional scholar. John, as a former federal prosecutor herself, doesn't she know better than to prejudge a case like that? Again, as bad as that videotape looks, this has happened before, has it not, when a videotape at first glance is not borne out by the subsequent evidence and witness testimony that comes in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "It's a huge problem, particularly for somebody at the top of the chain of command to be rendering judgments like that without all the evidence being in. It skews the jury pool. It alters the public perception of a case. There's a reason why we conduct investigations and grand jury information in secret, so that the whole process isn't tainted. And yet there she is on the front end tainting it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And John, this happened, obviously, before, and we have seen dribs and drabs of information coming in about the horrific death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Again, we don't have all the facts. It looks really bad and it looks like a killing of a man on tape. Leaning on his neck, it just looks horrific. But again, the original medical examiner's report says there was a lot of fentanyl in his system, a dose that could kill normal people, et cetera, et cetera. It's like no one wants to talk about it, but isn't this supposed to be a system where everyone gets a fair trial and you don't prejudge the evidence? It seems like that is just out the window because there is a roving mob that is threatening to burn down a lot of buildings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "That's right, the presumption of innocence has gone out the window. And look, the Obama Justice Department, and we could expect the Biden Justice Department, God help us if that ever happens, to do the same thing. They took these incidents and then they used them to create consent decrees with the police departments to accomplish all sorts of social justice nonsense agendas. Like, in Baltimore, they actually required the police department in the consent decree that followed the investigation of the killing up there to start using gender preferred pronouns."

    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And one of the things, John, that Biden and Harris have discussed around the edges, especially their most radical supporters are going to have a lot of demands if they win, is this type of relaxation of prosecutorial norms. You and I talked about this. We were so far ahead of the curve of this, the Soros funded local prosecutors. We're thinking, why is George Soros putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into local races? Now we're finding out why, because they're not prosecuting a lot of these Antifa and BLM radicals even when they're violent or have gun charges. We've got an example, a list. We have the St. Louis attorney Kim Gardner charged in McCloskeys. We have the Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx, she dismissed the case against Smollett. San Francisco district attorney Chesa Boudin, Philadelphia D.A. Larry Krasner threatened federal officers with criminal charges. The Baltimore D.A., you talk about Marilyn Mosby, that is just a few, John. What can we expect more in a Biden administration?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "In a Biden administration you'd expect a lot more of that. But on the flipside, you'd expect them to bring charges. Kamala Harris has already said that she doesn't see the Department of Justice would have any choice but to bring charges against President Trump. So they are going to be dropping things where there's clear evidence of crime. They're going to be letting thugs off the hook. They're going to be releasing people already in jail, as Obama did, and then they are going to bring up trumped up political charges against their political opponents. This is the most dangerous threat of politicization of the Department of Justice we have seen in our nation's history. It happened under Obama and it would happen on steroids under a Biden administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "They're certainly trying to put that out there. It's like an extortionate threat. Voters, we're going to set your country on fire unless you vote the way we want. That's extortion, and that ought to be prosecuted as well. But I think the left in the Democrat Party has let the genie out of the bottle, and I don't think they're going to be able to put it back in no matter who wins the election in November."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The left loves to brand President Trump as a hateful bigot, but as with many other leftist insults, it's just projection. In fact, all the Biden campaign and the left have to offer, at this point, African Americans are threats and just dehumanizing insults for those who do not vote the way they are supposed to. Compare that to the positive and uplifting message to black Americans from Trump supporter and GOP rising star Kimberly Klacik."

      "speaker": "KIM KLACIK, MARYLAND GOP CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS",
      "utterance": "We don't want this paint on the streets. We want careers, we want opportunity, and we want equality. And I think people are understanding you get that from President Trump rather than what we had in the past. We are definitely listening to that message, and it is resonating."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Joining me now is Horace Cooper, co-chair of Project 21 and author of \"How Trump Is Making Black America Great Again.\" Horace, there couldn't be a more, I think, stark contrast between what the GOP is offering all Americans, but especially minority Americans, versus what Democrats are serving up -- a lot of insulting language, a lot of threats, a lot of demands. But where are the solutions? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: The policy question is really what's going to be the deciding factor for black America in this vote. And the policy question is, on the one hand you've got conservative policies that are good for your family, good for your pocketbook, good for your communities. Black Americans are saying we want more law enforcement. We don't want to defund the police. Black Americans are saying we want better schools. We want school choice. And black Americans are increasingly saying, why are the abortion clinics only in our communities? On the other hand, the progressives are going around saying misgendering, that's the biggest problem that faces your community, and we're going to make sure that that is a priority. And by the way, don't let the bad bogeyman racists get their way. That's the extent of what our options are, and I think people are going to be in for a huge wake-up call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We played that Kimberly Klacik soundbite because I find her so refreshing. I find so many of the voices, obviously, Horace, you're an old friend of the program and you've been doing this for a long time, but I just find it -- I find it so impressive and positive and optimistic that we have people with great courage who know they are going to be called uncle Toms, part of a minstrel show. I worked for Clarence Thomas. They did this to him, did this to Tom Sowell, Walter Williams, all these great thinkers. But I find this so uplifting because they are saying we're not buying what you're selling. I am my authentic self, and you're not going to make me think anything differently. But I've got the playlists. This Yamiche Alcindor, who is a journalist in Washington, she spoke out about what black people feel today. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YAMICHE ALCINDOR, PBS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "There were so many people on the president's doorstep telling him we don't like the way that you're handling the virus and we don't like the way you're handling this racial reckoning. Black people are simply fed up. People of color understand that they are being treated like second-class citizens, and frankly, a lot of white Americans are waking up to the privilege that they have had and saying that this is not right."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COOPER",
      "utterance": "There is a reckoning coming. We had eight years of the Obama-Biden administration policies where black Americans suffered at the front of the line -- lost more jobs, had to have more food stamps, lost opportunities, didn't get to keep their houses due to foreclosures. It is going to be very difficult to trick people into saying the racial bogeyman is so bad that I want to wipe out all of your economic opportunity. And by the way, when you contrast that with what happened over the last three years, this is recent. American people and particularly black Americans are saying they won't be fooled again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Horace, I think this bears out your point. Look at these new polls that came out this week. Trump's approval rising among black and Hispanic voters, this is a Hill-Harris pull, from 15 percent in August 8th through 11th through 24 percent, 22nd to the 25th, and Hispanic voters tick up by two percent, so not bad. Do you think that's freaking out the Democrats, or are they just going to dismiss it, the numbers don't really matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COOPER",
      "utterance": "The magic number is 85. The left needs black America to give them at least 85 percent of their support. And any number that drops below that -- and by the way, it's not about how many votes vote conservative. As long as they get 85, you can vote green, you can vote conservative, you can vote Republican, as long as they get 85. We're looking at numbers that demonstrate that they're not going to reach that, and that is crisis mode. Black men in particular are very much concerned about the policies, as I say, that prioritize misgendering over pocketbook issues."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I think we've laid it out pretty clearly tonight, this election is for the whole shebang, everything. The culture, the economy, foreign policy, crime and justice, law and order, it's all on the line. And that means everyone, I don't care what state you live in, blue state, red state, don't think your vote doesn't count. It does. Go out and vote. Otherwise, we can't complain, can we? And fly your flag, love your family. We have to spread a lot of love around in very difficult times. I hope you enjoy tonight. We enjoyed putting it together. It took a lot of people to do it.
