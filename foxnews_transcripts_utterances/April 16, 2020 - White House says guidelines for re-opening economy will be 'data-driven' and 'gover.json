President Trump to outline brand new guidelines for reopening a nation under lockdown, he's set for a major news conference just one hour from now, the theme, opening up America again. Officials say the guidelines won't be one-size-fits-all. Instead, they will be data-driven, tailored for each individual state focusing on a governor- led approach, the president's medical advisors, Birx, Fauci and Redfield, all signing off on the guidelines. That news comes as a group of seven Midwestern governors have announced a partnership to reopen their regional economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, the economy getting pummelled by a brutal new jobs report today, more than five million Americans filing for benefits just last week.

We will be here to help you if you need it. And the testing thing, I'm going to set that aside just for a moment, because I think it's a little bit separate. I think these regional packs that you will see that are bipartisan, they are happening on the west coast and now in the Midwest and you have one in the northeast. I think that those make a lot more sense, and they are trying to do a one- size-fits-all approach. So I think all of that shows that people can start to, you know, lift their gaze a little bit and see that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel, and that they are not going to be under some one-size-fits-all approach, because we all know that doesn't make sense and that that won't happen. On the jobs numbers, I just wanted to mention, you know, 22 million people filing for unemployment. That is overwhelming, right? And you have to think that each of those people has a family. So you extrapolate that out. And it's millions of people who are impacted by this economically.

And how long those five days are going to feel for you until Congress figures out a way to get past this impasse and get it done? That is really should be our absolute priority. And the president, I think if he put his shoulder behind it and push them, he should try to get this done.",

I do love how all of this is now governor-lead. And it makes me think that Trump just pulled, like, a Tom Sawyer painting the fence stunt. It's like when he said I am in control and then he said no, no, no, you don't. He said, OK, you guys call the shots. So now, what's interesting is the governors have skin in this game.

A virus is scarier than the unemployment numbers, even though the unemployment numbers could end up killing as many people. But the problem is we can't count that. It's too amorphous and anonymous.

That feels really essential. And it feels just as suffocating and serious and threatening to them and to their livelihood as getting sick from the virus does.

President Trump to outline brand new guidelines for reopening a nation under lockdown, he's set for a major news conference just one hour from now, the theme, opening up America again. Officials say the guidelines won't be one-size-fits-all. Instead, they will be data-driven, tailored for each individual state focusing on a governor- led approach, the president's medical advisors, Birx, Fauci and Redfield, all signing off on the guidelines. That news comes as a group of seven Midwestern governors have announced a partnership to reopen their regional economy. Meanwhile, the economy getting pummelled by a brutal new jobs report today, more than five million Americans filing for benefits just last week. That means over 22 million jobs have been lost in the past month, the president pledging to restore the economy back at full speed."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "-- also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed. And we really think with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we're going to have an economy that really comes back quickly. And would like to see it more than match what we had before. What we had before was a miracle. And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle. We are going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Dana, I was curious about what you thought about reopening. Given that we don't have a rigorous testing regime in place at the moment, what are you thinking about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think if you look back even -- it's Thursday. So I think it was Monday that there was a lot of sort of discussion and debate about who has the authority to reopen the economy. The president, the governors, etcetera. And what you see by Thursday is that the governors are working well in coordination and conjunction with the federal government. And to the president of the United States is giving them really good guidelines and guidance in saying here's what we suggest. We will be here to help you if you need it. And the testing thing, I'm going to set that aside just for a moment, because I think it's a little bit separate. I think these regional packs that you will see that are bipartisan, they are happening on the west coast and now in the Midwest and you have one in the northeast. I think that those make a lot more sense, and they are trying to do a one- size-fits-all approach. So I think all of that shows that people can start to, you know, lift their gaze a little bit and see that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel, and that they are not going to be under some one-size-fits-all approach, because we all know that doesn't make sense and that that won't happen. On the jobs numbers, I just wanted to mention, you know, 22 million people filing for unemployment. That is overwhelming, right? And you have to think that each of those people has a family. So you extrapolate that out. And it's millions of people who are impacted by this economically. And I think it's atrocious that you have the Democrats who are resisting refilling the small business loan fund. It is out of money as of yesterday, out of money. So they're not even back in session until next Monday. Think of how many days that is as a small business person. You didn't get your loan. And how long those five days are going to feel for you until Congress figures out a way to get past this impasse and get it done? That is really should be our absolute priority. And the president, I think if he put his shoulder behind it and push them, he should try to get this done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. I think they're going to have to negotiate and do so urgently. Greg, I wanted to come back to this whole notion of reopening, because so much of it has to do with trust. That you can say things will reopen, but for you and me, are we going to, like, get back, you know, to a restaurant or get on a plane, or decide we are going to stay at a hotel if we are not quite sure in our hearts that we are safe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, it's -- I go back to what I said before. I think we are willing at this point to take that risk, because we kind of -- we all kind of like getting that feeling. That, like, you know what, we are doing the best we can. But right now, maybe it's time we start -- you know, as Dana would say, lifting our gaze. I've never heard that before. It's very nice. But we have got to leave the vulnerable at home. If the vulnerable -- the older people with underlying conditions, if they are at home, the younger, the healthier people, the people that -- can go back to work. I do love how all of this is now governor-lead. And it makes me think that Trump just pulled, like, a Tom Sawyer painting the fence stunt. It's like when he said I am in control and then he said no, no, no, you don't. He said, OK, you guys call the shots. So now, what's interesting is the governors have skin in this game. And it's really important, when you are criticizing the commander in chief or anybody that you have skin in the game, because that changes and alters the way that you criticize, because basically, you could be held responsible. Lastly, it will be a challenge to tabulate. You can count the deaths by a virus, but you have a hard time counting the casualties of a shut down. Whether it is suicides, failed businesses, hopelessness, like, consequences. A virus is scarier than the unemployment numbers, even though the unemployment numbers could end up killing as many people. But the problem is we can't count that. It's too amorphous and anonymous. And I think that's always going to be a challenge for a lot of people to not -- they won't be able to see the invisible death."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's a good point. Jesse, let's speak to that point, because I think that you have a situation now where people are saying we want to get back to work. We have got these record-level unemployment figures. But at the same time, if we reopen too quickly, it could damage the economy, because then if there is a second wave, a second peeking in terms of the curve. That will crater the economy once more."

And you can tell this country is ready to stop holding its breath and get above water and get a gasp of air, because if you keep staying underwater, you have already seen depression-level economic jobs losses in just one month alone. This country's not going to make it to May 1st. And that's why you see some states are going to have to open in phases. From what I understand about the plan, it is a three-phase plan. Before you even start phase one, a state has to demonstrate a two-week downward trajectory on cases. It has to have robust healthcare performance, and it has to have robust testing among those frontline workers. Only then can you get into phase one. And phase one is just limited amounts of people going back to work. Phase two, you open up bars. You open up restaurants. And that is only with limited capacity seating and social distancing. And they suggest nonessential travel, kind of really be curtailed. Only until phase three, the -- have, you know, schools and camps and things like that and large events, still with certain amounts of social distancing. Because right now, I don't know, man. You can feel this country getting angry. And it's not just at the Chinese. It's -- they are getting angry at the governors. They are not allowed to go to church. You know, they don't have freedom of association. They can't pursue happiness. This is getting pretty ugly. And we can't take it anymore."

Because as Jesse said, when people feel continually that they are pushed in a corner and that they're continually told that they are not essential, when they are looking at their kids and not stocking their freezer full of $13 Ben (ph) ice cream like Nancy Pelosi is in San Francisco and they're on an even tighter budget than maybe they were before, and they are worried about what the next two months are going to look like for -- look like for their family. That feels really essential. And it feels just as suffocating and serious and threatening to them and to their livelihood as getting sick from the virus does. And so there has to be a balance with these governors, and not overstepping their bounds, not telling people they can't do things on their own private property, not telling them they can't grow their own food, as the governor in Michigan has effectively done by banning the buying of seeds. If you overstep those boundaries, you're going to have a revolt. And Americans are smart. They have done very well at being cooperative throughout this process. But there will come a time when they are not willing to trade this non-freedom that they now have, and pushing the rights away for some kind of security that they feel that they have given up already."

Fox News sources say there is, quote, \"increasing confidence among the U.S. intelligence that the deadly virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan after sloppy handling, as opposed to a nearby wet market, as China originally claimed.\" China pushing back, saying there is no direct evidence the lab was involved. The sources also adding that the World Health Organization helped China cover it all up. Katie, let me go to you first about this development. And I guess it helps. This has sort of been out there. But it helps sort of pin the tail on the donkey here about where this would have come from, and what the important point that it wasn't intentional, apparently."

      "utterance": "Yeah. As far as we know, The Pentagon says that they are still looking into that. But they do say, on the record, that they believe it is natural. Now, Senator Tom Cotton has been floating this theory for months now. And The Washington Post actually called him a conspiracy theory who was peddling something very dangerous. Well, now, we have State Department cables and also evidence out of China that this is likely what happened. Why would China not allow the CDC into the labs there to take a look at what was going on? Why did they destroy evidence? Why did they get rid of a number of people working in these labs? Did it come from a lab? And Dana, one thing that I think is going to be the bigger question here moving forward, is are we going to take China seriously when it comes to them stealing our information in America by working in labs here and going back to China. Because it is part of Bret Baier's reporting that said this lab was trying to compete with Americans in terms of the kind of technology in science that we have. Well, they have been in our universities. Last year, they introduced a bill to try and bar Chinese military scientists from working in American labs. Do you think that that would be something we would not want going on? The visa program for Chinese students is riddled with spies who come here and steal information from PHG programs. Harvard, that professor was arrested in January who was a top chemist at Harvard who was working with the Wuhan lab. So this is a bigger box of issues that are certainly going to have to be addressed. But I'm not surprised at all that this is where this is going."

And again, to reiterate what Katie just said, it's not that they created it, but that they were sloppy in their handling of a virus, as they were competing with the U.S. to say we can handle viruses and the like. To my mind, what you get then is a situation where the real and provable sin is that China covered it up. That's what -- it strikes me is that, you know, let's not get away from China -- you know, the fact that they are culpable here for having worsened the situation. And one other point on, I would say, is why are we going after the WHO when we should be going after China? But finally, none of this, it seems to me, mitigates the idea that our own government was slow to respond, and that we have to deal with, you know, sort of what's right here in front of us at the moment, which is a slow response has put us in a situation where we have been on lockdown and we see these high unemployment numbers."

Nobody wanted to hear about -- talking about Chinese cultural practices that might lead to disease, i.e., the wet market. So the most vital questions that needed to be asked, including the origins of the pandemic, were sacrificed for gossip, chatter, and finger-pointing blame. Oh, we were too late. Oh, we didn't act fast enough. The problem is, the villain being foreign, just isn't a top media narrative for our press. The media is like every single Law and Order episode. You know, if the villain -- the villain has to be the rich American socialite, or they will kill the script. So they weren't interested in the fact that China was the villain or it came from the lab, because that is a foreign villain. It isn't Trump or America, which is why Juan had to go back and say our response was slow, because he wasn't content with it being China's fault."

It's not a conspiracy. And now it looks pretty accurate. He said the Chinese in this lab were conducting such dangerous and risky research on this virus in a city next to 15 million people in a sloppy lab with the bad protocols that the U.S. had to actually pull out of their collaboration. He says this is gross medical malpractice. It's extremely reckless. And it was made worse by the communist government. Think about it like this way. And I'll speak to Juan on this. Imagine if ExxonMobil was doing some sort of chemical research at a facility and cutting corners in order to save a buck, and the thing got loose and ended up killing tens of thousands of people, and taking a trillion out of the U.S. economy. And ExxonMobil covered it up, and the Trump administration then covered it up and pushed a propaganda plan to cover it up. And if that was uncovered, ExxonMobil would be bankrupt. They'd be paying billions in settlements. And Donald Trump would be hauled in front of The Hague for war crimes. That's how serious this is.

OK, so there is collaboration and the governors help make decisions based on some guidelines you get from the federal government. Look, I understand that Joe Biden is in a bind. That's bad. But what she is suggesting, one, it is a terrible idea if you are a patriotic American, because you cannot have two presidents at the same time. You have one president at a time. And I'm sorry they're in this predicament where they have to try to campaign during a pandemic, but that's the situation they're in. This idea is like what I used to do with my sister when I got home from school after I had an after-school snack. I would make her play school with me. And this is like playing government.

What would you do? When would you start the economy? How would you do it? They can't -- they can't say it, because they know they have a 50 percent chance of being wrong. So they're petrified of actually raising their hand and going, oh, I have an idea. Let's do it now. They can't. So instead, they're not going to step forward. What they're going to do is they're going to wait for President Trump to flip the switch or the dimmer and any collateral damage that there is, then they will leap forward and they would go ha, we wouldn't have done that. No surrey, we wouldn't have done that. You did that too late or you didn't do enough or you did too much, or you're an autocrat or you didn't take control.

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

So what you get is he's now on T.V. more than ever. And of course, he's doing those live streams from his basement in Delaware somewhere. So he's on a lot of T.V., and he has also, as I mentioned, these streaming efforts that are going out, so I think it's gotten much better. In terms, of a grade, I'd say initially, not so good, and now pretty good. But, you know, he's up against President Trump, who has this daily press briefing. That's, you know, as the President likes to say on par with the bachelors finale and Monday Night Football. I do think that you know, in answering this question though, you've got I think everyone I've met who's run for President thinks they're about to win. And so if you're going to win in this environment, you better have a plan. And I don't think there's any reason that he shouldn't be saying to the American people, here's how I would be dealing with it. And I think that he's been pretty clear, and I think others have said so as well, we need to do a better job when it comes to testing in this country, providing supplies to our medical workers, making sure that, you know, the bank computers don't get all screwed up when we try to deliver stimulus checks to our workers.

I mean, he was against the travel ban and allowing, you know, people going in and out of the country while the virus was spreading around the world.

Well, we can't tell you because everyone is staying home due to the coronavirus, and that's also the case on Sesame Street. Take a look at how they're dealing with being unable to get together with their neighborhood friends."

In addition, Elmo, Cookie Monster, Grover, we're joined by celebrities Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tracee Ellis, and Anne Hathaway. This is another example, folks, of Americans helping each other as we get through this crisis together. Way to go USA. Greg, you're up."

First one, look at this poor dog just watching this groundhog eating a slice of pizza. He's social distancing. There's a pane of glass between him. Life is so unfair. Look at that groundhog taunting him. Oh, I'm hungry now for pizza and a groundhog. Groundhog pizza would be delicious. Anyway, here's another one. This is a what happens when you fill a cup full of whipped cream. This fella shows up. There he is. Let's see that again. You fill up that cup and what happens? What happens? There it is. Yes. Anyway, I'm done."

You know those roundabouts that they have mostly in Europe? This guy in Poland, he couldn't figure it out, just drove right through it. It's not a Polish joke, it just happened to be in Poland. The guy is fine. I like showing crazy video. He's not injured. He's recovering at the hospital. But that's one way to do a roundabout, probably not the smartest way but whatever."

Big birthday today, so Happy birthday to you out in Denver. And also I've been dying to show you this \"ONE MORE THING.\" So there's this Texas couple, and they're using the hit show Tiger King to have a little fun. So they have a question right there on their door and it says did Carol Baskin kill her husband? Yes or no? And then the Amazon delivery people decide whether they're voting yes or no. So far, it's a big yes, big yes. That's the Tim and Agata Scott out there in Texas."
