      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. A ton going on as always, but we couldn't resist noting that actor, Jussie Smollett, finally went on trial this week for faking a hate crime in Chicago way back in 2019. I want to put a little bow on that news story, which you probably remember well. Smollett faces six felony charges for what he did. He could spend three years in prison if he is convicted on all of them. Smollett's lawyers have argued hilariously that he is quote \"the real victim\" in this story, but of course no sober person on the planet believes that. Jussie Smollett definitely faked a hate crime. The question is, how did anyone anywhere ever fall for this story even for a moment? Looking back, particularly in retrospect, it was maybe the most obvious hoax ever perpetrated and in case you've forgotten the details of them, I'd like to savor them tonight, well here is what Smollett claimed. Smollett claimed that he left his apartment in Chicago alone one freezing January night at 2:00 AM to pick up a Subway sandwich, something that no one who isn't homeless has ever done. As he walked down the street, two white men approached him and began screaming in his face for being black and gay because of course, you're not allowed to be either one of those things in the City of Chicago. They called him the N-word, they punched him in the face, they poured a chemical onto his body and then needless to say, they wrapped a noose around his neck because you know -- Chicago. They didn't bother to rob him. Their motives were purely political. \"This is MAGA country,\" they screamed about a city that voted more than 83 percent for Hillary Clinton. So, that's the story that Jussie Smollett told the police that night, a noose still hanging around his neck. The police, it is fair to say were highly skeptical. The leaders of the Democratic Party, however, were not skeptical at all. In fact, the story he told was the story they were already telling. That same year, several Democratic senators including notably, Kamala Harris of California, a personal friend of Jussie Smollett sent a letter to the Justice Department. The letter claimed that attacks from white supremacist Trump voters were among this country's greatest threats -- attacks by black supremacists by contrast were not even real. In fact, Harris lectured the D.O.J. saying the very term black supremacist is a quote \"fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,\" end quote. In other words, only Trump voters commit hate crimes, and of course the media had been telling us that ever since. Here is one recent headline from CNN quote, \"Hate crime reports said the U.S. surged to the highest level in 12 years, F.B.I. says.\" Where is all this hate coming from? Well according to CNN, it's anti- immigrant rhetoric. NPR covered it at your expense, it's National Public Radio, and in their coverage, they came out and blamed people who voted for Donald Trump. All these white supremacists, NPR explained are mad about COVID, so they're beating up Asians in the streets of San Francisco and New York, just as Kamala Harris told us, white supremacy is the problem. So where do these numbers come from, the numbers upon which all these stories are hung and all these political points are made, all these lies are told? Well, here is how the Department of Justice under Joe Biden concluded that we have quote, \"more hate crimes that we've had in 12 years.\" First they changed the definition of hate crime. Now a hate crime - - by the way, is that even a real category of crime, how is it different from a crime? But it is, apparently -- and it now includes something called discrimination based on gender identity. Well, no one can quite agree on what that is, but it's a crime. Then the F.B.I. noticed that nearly 90 percent of law enforcement agencies across the country had been reporting no hate crimes within their jurisdictions because actually, there is not a lot of hate in the country because it's a pretty nice country. Most people are not racist at all, most people are really kind, they're Americans. But that's not a conclusion we can sell to CNN or NPR or get elected on in the midterm, so the Biden Justice Department badgered an additional 600 Federal law enforcement agencies and local police departments into reporting hate crimes under this new expanded definition of the term hate crime. So if you're following this, hate crimes, whatever those are, didn't actually rise in frequency. The number of agencies that were commanded to report hate crimes went up quite dramatically, and then the F.B.I. encouraged law enforcement agencies to report any possible hate crime even if the crime derived from an obviously false report and that's why more than 80 percent of the hate crime suspects investigated by the Feds from 2005 to 2019 were never prosecuted. Why is that? Because they were fake -- but they still show up in the statistics and they still allow NPR to tell you that people who would disagree with Anthony Fauci are beating up Asians on the street in New York. Right. So it's a fiction, it's yet another lie engineered by the by the administration and carried forth as fact by the media. They did it for political reasons. They've been doing it for years in fact. In fact, they've done it for so long they started to believe it was actually true and that ladies and gentlemen is why they took Jussie Smollett seriously when no normal person would. The story was absurd from the very first day, but they believed it completely. In case you've forgotten, here was their response.",

Anyway, this is America in 2019, we just heard from CNN, and that was true actually, but not in the way the robot on CNN meant it. By 2019 in America, it was actually getting pretty difficult for the average black person to get beaten up on the street for having the wrong skin color as Jussie Smollett found out personally. If you wanted to have racists throw bleach in your face and hang a noose around your neck, you had to pay Nigerian bodybuilders to do it, and the going rate at the time was 3,500 bucks. That's not cheap, but then violent anti-black racism was getting extremely hard to find. It was a rare commodity and yet somehow ABC News was not aware of any of this. At ABC News, it is always 1958 in Mississippi, so to the geniuses at ABC News, this sounded totally plausible, completely. Jussie Smollett could sense this, and he took full advantage of it.

So if you lived here at the time in America, 2019, that makes a kind of sense. Back in 2019, very few actors had the bravery to criticize the fascist Trump regime. They were just too afraid. So instead, they went along with it like quislings. The Oscars were like a MAGA rally that year, to speak out against Donald Trump from Hollywood was to risk your very life. White supremacist thugs were likely to attack you with nooses on your way back from Subway, and that's why we remembered Jussie Smollett for his unique courage. Virtually alone in our media landscape, Smollett was willing to take the risk. He publicly admitted that he votes for the Democratic Party. Now, his friends pleaded with him to stay quiet about this and to stay safe. That's the kind of man Jussie Smollett is, he wouldn't. Some called him a hero for that. His friend Kamala Harris did. Harris describe what happened to Jussie Smollett as a quote, \"attempted modern day lynching.\" Nancy Pelosi said it was \" ... a homophobic attack and an affront to our humanity.\" Eric Swalwell of California told us there were countless Jussie Smollett's in this filthy racist nation of ours quote, \"Hate crimes like this are happening more frequently egged on by careless hate-filled rhetoric.\" Notice the redundancy? Senator Cory Booker meanwhile demanded anti-lynching legislation, as if we didn't already have that and so on. So in a landscape like this with the most powerful people in the country cheering him on like a modern Dietrich Bonhoeffer, is it really surprising that Jussie Smollett just pushed it as far as he could? No, it is not very surprising. What's surprising is that absolutely nothing Smollett said, no matter how transparently ridiculous or melodramatic or embarrassing or obviously non- factual, no matter what he said, none of it aroused even the slightest hint of skepticism of any kind from hardened newswoman Robin Roberts of ABC. Jussie Smollett could have claimed absolutely anything, Trump killed my family, Trump and Vladimir Putin burned a cross in my yard and Robin Roberts would have had the same reaction -- awe struck love.

It's all about MAGA country in Downtown Chicago. So obviously there is a pretty inconvenient story for the people who bought it hook, line, and sinker. Not only are they dishonest, but a lot of them are really dumb. That's their main secret. So, after this happened, Kamala Harris's allies got to work making the story go away. Michelle Obama aide reached out to a partisan DA in Chicago called Kim Foxx and had charges against Jussie Smollett dismissed. Oh that's what happens when you have friends. You're so powerless, you can't get Michelle Obama to make it go away. But now, thankfully for the sake of the justice, Smollett says he wanted, that decision has been reversed. So finally this week, the Smollett trial is underway. He is on trial for lying about the attack, and as part of the trial, we are learning some pretty interesting new information about the extent of the scam. For example, the same day that Jussie Smollett cried in his interview with Robin Roberts, which she described as \"Beautiful, Jussie. Beautiful.\" He was texting one of the people he claims beat him up because he is black and gay and here's what he wrote, \"Brother, I love you. I stand with you,\" Smollett wrote. \"I know 100 percent you and your brother did nothing wrong.\" These are people he paid to put a noose around his neck. Smollett was also on videotape conducting a dry run of the attack the day before it happened. You're not hearing a ton about this in the media. Why is that? Because it undermines the core claim that they are making, which is people who vote for candidates they don't like are dangerous, people of a certain color are dangerous. The violence in America is committed by their political enemies, when in fact that's a lie and we know it's a lie because there are real numbers out there, and you're welcome to look them up if you like, and they do not tell you that Trump voters are the ones behind the crime wave currently in progress. So once you learn that one thing is a lie, you might start to ask yourself, hmm, what else are they lying about? And that's not a process they welcome. Jessie Kelly is the host of \"The Jesse Kelly Show,\" we're happy to have him join us tonight. Jesse, thanks so much for coming on. I mean, look, everyone kind of knows what we're learning in this trial, but there is something about seeing this get memory-holed, like the attack in Waukesha that drives me crazy as someone who cares about facts. Do you think they will be able to make this go away? JESSE KELLY, HOST, \"THE JESSE KELLY SHOW\": Oh, absolutely, they'll make it go away. Tucker, you just brought up Waukesha, that's the largest domestic terrorist attack in how many years here? And it's already out of the papers. Ten people, if you go ask 10 people right now if they know who Darrell Brooks is, they don't have any idea who you're talking about. They would say, \"Who?\" \"Does he play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers?\" They would have no idea who he is. They'll make this whole thing go away. I mean, I've enjoyed walking through memory lane with you listening to him crying. The best part wasn't Robin Roberts's closed eyes, it was the whispering, Tucker, the whispering.

In fact during several visits, Clinton and Epstein were photographed together and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend appears in at least one of those White House photos. Now that's important because Maxwell is currently on trial for recruiting underage girls for Epstein and that alleged recruitment would have coincided with Epstein's numerous trips to the White House. He visited four times in 1993 and 12 times in '94 and after Bill Clinton left the White House, flight logs show that he flew on Epstein's private jets known as the Lolita Express at least 26 times.

When he said he was a President i.e. Fauci, he almost got it, he is more like a monarch. He has got legislative, judicial, and executive power all in one, and you know he is mad now, Fauci is mad, too and Biden is that people don't feel that -- they feel they weren't treated right, but they didn't treat the American people right. Fauci from the beginning just couldn't talk about the damage the lockdown was inflicting economic, social, medical -- from spousal abuse to missed surgeries -- he just couldn't say natural immunity acquired through prior infections may be as effective as a vaccine. He wouldn't do it, not to mention he couldn't say this is a red state model of Florida and Texas. This is a blue state New York and California, they have strength, let's look at them empirically. He couldn't do that. He had to demonize one at the expense of the other. But when he got to the vaccinations that you mentioned, Tucker, he really jumped at shark because he basically -- we remember that they weaponized that issue from the very beginning with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on the left saying they wanted nothing to do with it if Donald Trump's fingerprints were on it, and then suddenly they claimed parenting it, but when they came into office, they said -- you know Joe Biden went so far as to say no one was vaccinated until I came, even though 17 million were. And then we had this ridiculous situation now where we have four and a half million Federal workers and soldiers that are going to have mandated vaccinations, but we in the scheduled fiscal year are going to have two million people come across the border and we're not asking anything of foreign citizens, but we're asking everything of citizens. It's just absurd. And then, you know, in addition to that, there was this demonization of sort of the white working class didn't get vaccinated, they were Trump ignoramuses, clingers, but when you actually looked at the percentages of groups -- not that it matters -- but by ethnic affiliation, it wasn't the so-called white voter who wasn't getting vaccinated it was Latinos and Blacks at least until recently hadn't been vaccinated proportionally into their numbers on the general population. So almost all the information that he was giving was not just inaccurate, but it was weaponized, and I guess, you know, I don't listen to Jane Fonda much, I don't think anybody does, but she did say something at the beginning of all this. She said, COVID is God's gift to the left, and what she meant was I think that everything from making Election Day irrelevant with 102 early and mail-in ballots and two, really depriving citizens of free choice and the Bill of Rights was possible through the hysteria that happened to this very serious plague, but -- and that's what happened.",

Eighty Republicans just voted with Democrats to pass a bill to fund a government vaccine database. You think we need that? If the law passes, it would expand the C.D.C.'s powers. Think we need that? They're now an Intel Agency.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. A ton going on as always, but we couldn't resist noting that actor, Jussie Smollett, finally went on trial this week for faking a hate crime in Chicago way back in 2019. I want to put a little bow on that news story, which you probably remember well. Smollett faces six felony charges for what he did. He could spend three years in prison if he is convicted on all of them. Smollett's lawyers have argued hilariously that he is quote \"the real victim\" in this story, but of course no sober person on the planet believes that. Jussie Smollett definitely faked a hate crime. The question is, how did anyone anywhere ever fall for this story even for a moment? Looking back, particularly in retrospect, it was maybe the most obvious hoax ever perpetrated and in case you've forgotten the details of them, I'd like to savor them tonight, well here is what Smollett claimed. Smollett claimed that he left his apartment in Chicago alone one freezing January night at 2:00 AM to pick up a Subway sandwich, something that no one who isn't homeless has ever done. As he walked down the street, two white men approached him and began screaming in his face for being black and gay because of course, you're not allowed to be either one of those things in the City of Chicago. They called him the N-word, they punched him in the face, they poured a chemical onto his body and then needless to say, they wrapped a noose around his neck because you know -- Chicago. They didn't bother to rob him. Their motives were purely political. \"This is MAGA country,\" they screamed about a city that voted more than 83 percent for Hillary Clinton. So, that's the story that Jussie Smollett told the police that night, a noose still hanging around his neck. The police, it is fair to say were highly skeptical. The leaders of the Democratic Party, however, were not skeptical at all. In fact, the story he told was the story they were already telling. That same year, several Democratic senators including notably, Kamala Harris of California, a personal friend of Jussie Smollett sent a letter to the Justice Department. The letter claimed that attacks from white supremacist Trump voters were among this country's greatest threats -- attacks by black supremacists by contrast were not even real. In fact, Harris lectured the D.O.J. saying the very term black supremacist is a quote \"fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,\" end quote. In other words, only Trump voters commit hate crimes, and of course the media had been telling us that ever since. Here is one recent headline from CNN quote, \"Hate crime reports said the U.S. surged to the highest level in 12 years, F.B.I. says.\" Where is all this hate coming from? Well according to CNN, it's anti- immigrant rhetoric. NPR covered it at your expense, it's National Public Radio, and in their coverage, they came out and blamed people who voted for Donald Trump. All these white supremacists, NPR explained are mad about COVID, so they're beating up Asians in the streets of San Francisco and New York, just as Kamala Harris told us, white supremacy is the problem. So where do these numbers come from, the numbers upon which all these stories are hung and all these political points are made, all these lies are told? Well, here is how the Department of Justice under Joe Biden concluded that we have quote, \"more hate crimes that we've had in 12 years.\" First they changed the definition of hate crime. Now a hate crime - - by the way, is that even a real category of crime, how is it different from a crime? But it is, apparently -- and it now includes something called discrimination based on gender identity. Well, no one can quite agree on what that is, but it's a crime. Then the F.B.I. noticed that nearly 90 percent of law enforcement agencies across the country had been reporting no hate crimes within their jurisdictions because actually, there is not a lot of hate in the country because it's a pretty nice country. Most people are not racist at all, most people are really kind, they're Americans. But that's not a conclusion we can sell to CNN or NPR or get elected on in the midterm, so the Biden Justice Department badgered an additional 600 Federal law enforcement agencies and local police departments into reporting hate crimes under this new expanded definition of the term hate crime. So if you're following this, hate crimes, whatever those are, didn't actually rise in frequency. The number of agencies that were commanded to report hate crimes went up quite dramatically, and then the F.B.I. encouraged law enforcement agencies to report any possible hate crime even if the crime derived from an obviously false report and that's why more than 80 percent of the hate crime suspects investigated by the Feds from 2005 to 2019 were never prosecuted. Why is that? Because they were fake -- but they still show up in the statistics and they still allow NPR to tell you that people who would disagree with Anthony Fauci are beating up Asians on the street in New York. Right. So it's a fiction, it's yet another lie engineered by the by the administration and carried forth as fact by the media. They did it for political reasons. They've been doing it for years in fact. In fact, they've done it for so long they started to believe it was actually true and that ladies and gentlemen is why they took Jussie Smollett seriously when no normal person would. The story was absurd from the very first day, but they believed it completely. In case you've forgotten, here was their response."

We should know by the way that Jussie Smollett apparently is also a -- in addition to being an actor, a musician. What instrument? We have no idea, but he is a musician, too. Anyway, this is America in 2019, we just heard from CNN, and that was true actually, but not in the way the robot on CNN meant it. By 2019 in America, it was actually getting pretty difficult for the average black person to get beaten up on the street for having the wrong skin color as Jussie Smollett found out personally. If you wanted to have racists throw bleach in your face and hang a noose around your neck, you had to pay Nigerian bodybuilders to do it, and the going rate at the time was 3,500 bucks. That's not cheap, but then violent anti-black racism was getting extremely hard to find. It was a rare commodity and yet somehow ABC News was not aware of any of this. At ABC News, it is always 1958 in Mississippi, so to the geniuses at ABC News, this sounded totally plausible, completely. Jussie Smollett could sense this, and he took full advantage of it.

      "utterance": "She is the highest paid woman in television, but as Jussie Smollett explained to her, \"I came really, really hard at 45,\" meaning Donald Trump. So if you lived here at the time in America, 2019, that makes a kind of sense. Back in 2019, very few actors had the bravery to criticize the fascist Trump regime. They were just too afraid. So instead, they went along with it like quislings. The Oscars were like a MAGA rally that year, to speak out against Donald Trump from Hollywood was to risk your very life. White supremacist thugs were likely to attack you with nooses on your way back from Subway, and that's why we remembered Jussie Smollett for his unique courage. Virtually alone in our media landscape, Smollett was willing to take the risk. He publicly admitted that he votes for the Democratic Party. Now, his friends pleaded with him to stay quiet about this and to stay safe. That's the kind of man Jussie Smollett is, he wouldn't. Some called him a hero for that. His friend Kamala Harris did. Harris describe what happened to Jussie Smollett as a quote, \"attempted modern day lynching.\" Nancy Pelosi said it was \" ... a homophobic attack and an affront to our humanity.\" Eric Swalwell of California told us there were countless Jussie Smollett's in this filthy racist nation of ours quote, \"Hate crimes like this are happening more frequently egged on by careless hate-filled rhetoric.\" Notice the redundancy? Senator Cory Booker meanwhile demanded anti-lynching legislation, as if we didn't already have that and so on. So in a landscape like this with the most powerful people in the country cheering him on like a modern Dietrich Bonhoeffer, is it really surprising that Jussie Smollett just pushed it as far as he could? No, it is not very surprising. What's surprising is that absolutely nothing Smollett said, no matter how transparently ridiculous or melodramatic or embarrassing or obviously non- factual, no matter what he said, none of it aroused even the slightest hint of skepticism of any kind from hardened newswoman Robin Roberts of ABC. Jussie Smollett could have claimed absolutely anything, Trump killed my family, Trump and Vladimir Putin burned a cross in my yard and Robin Roberts would have had the same reaction -- awe struck love. Watch this."

The cops interviewed the people in the end who Jussie Smollett had hired to beat him up, the two black guys. It turns out Smollett had paid for the noose and the bleach, so you've got to ask once the evidence arrived, how did all of his supporters react? How did for example, his friend, Kamala Harris respond to this news? Well, here she is."

      "utterance": "So would you like to adjust your hysteria to the facts? Would you like to acknowledge reality? No, I don't think so. It's still about white racism. It's all about MAGA country in Downtown Chicago. So obviously there is a pretty inconvenient story for the people who bought it hook, line, and sinker. Not only are they dishonest, but a lot of them are really dumb. That's their main secret. So, after this happened, Kamala Harris's allies got to work making the story go away. Michelle Obama aide reached out to a partisan DA in Chicago called Kim Foxx and had charges against Jussie Smollett dismissed. Oh that's what happens when you have friends. You're so powerless, you can't get Michelle Obama to make it go away. But now, thankfully for the sake of the justice, Smollett says he wanted, that decision has been reversed. So finally this week, the Smollett trial is underway. He is on trial for lying about the attack, and as part of the trial, we are learning some pretty interesting new information about the extent of the scam. For example, the same day that Jussie Smollett cried in his interview with Robin Roberts, which she described as \"Beautiful, Jussie. Beautiful.\" He was texting one of the people he claims beat him up because he is black and gay and here's what he wrote, \"Brother, I love you. I stand with you,\" Smollett wrote. \"I know 100 percent you and your brother did nothing wrong.\" These are people he paid to put a noose around his neck. Smollett was also on videotape conducting a dry run of the attack the day before it happened. You're not hearing a ton about this in the media. Why is that? Because it undermines the core claim that they are making, which is people who vote for candidates they don't like are dangerous, people of a certain color are dangerous. The violence in America is committed by their political enemies, when in fact that's a lie and we know it's a lie because there are real numbers out there, and you're welcome to look them up if you like, and they do not tell you that Trump voters are the ones behind the crime wave currently in progress. So once you learn that one thing is a lie, you might start to ask yourself, hmm, what else are they lying about? And that's not a process they welcome. Jessie Kelly is the host of \"The Jesse Kelly Show,\" we're happy to have him join us tonight. Jesse, thanks so much for coming on. I mean, look, everyone kind of knows what we're learning in this trial, but there is something about seeing this get memory-holed, like the attack in Waukesha that drives me crazy as someone who cares about facts. Do you think they will be able to make this go away? JESSE KELLY, HOST, \"THE JESSE KELLY SHOW\": Oh, absolutely, they'll make it go away. Tucker, you just brought up Waukesha, that's the largest domestic terrorist attack in how many years here? And it's already out of the papers. Ten people, if you go ask 10 people right now if they know who Darrell Brooks is, they don't have any idea who you're talking about. They would say, \"Who?\" \"Does he play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers?\" They would have no idea who he is. They'll make this whole thing go away. I mean, I've enjoyed walking through memory lane with you listening to him crying. The best part wasn't Robin Roberts's closed eyes, it was the whispering, Tucker, the whispering. Don't you understand?"

This information came from the Clinton Presidential Library through the Freedom of Information Act and \"The Daily Mail\" reports that it shows Jeffrey Epstein visited the White House 17 times. The first being in February of '93, a month after Bill Clinton was inaugurated. The logs show that Epstein would normally visit the West Wing, which is a good indication he was there to see the President. In fact during several visits, Clinton and Epstein were photographed together and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend appears in at least one of those White House photos. Now that's important because Maxwell is currently on trial for recruiting underage girls for Epstein and that alleged recruitment would have coincided with Epstein's numerous trips to the White House. He visited four times in 1993 and 12 times in '94 and after Bill Clinton left the White House, flight logs show that he flew on Epstein's private jets known as the Lolita Express at least 26 times. Clinton has always denied any wrongdoing -- Tucker."

Fauci from the beginning just couldn't talk about the damage the lockdown was inflicting economic, social, medical -- from spousal abuse to missed surgeries -- he just couldn't say natural immunity acquired through prior infections may be as effective as a vaccine. He wouldn't do it, not to mention he couldn't say this is a red state model of Florida and Texas. This is a blue state New York and California, they have strength, let's look at them empirically. He couldn't do that. He had to demonize one at the expense of the other. But when he got to the vaccinations that you mentioned, Tucker, he really jumped at shark because he basically -- we remember that they weaponized that issue from the very beginning with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden on the left saying they wanted nothing to do with it if Donald Trump's fingerprints were on it, and then suddenly they claimed parenting it, but when they came into office, they said -- you know Joe Biden went so far as to say no one was vaccinated until I came, even though 17 million were. And then we had this ridiculous situation now where we have four and a half million Federal workers and soldiers that are going to have mandated vaccinations, but we in the scheduled fiscal year are going to have two million people come across the border and we're not asking anything of foreign citizens, but we're asking everything of citizens. It's just absurd. And then, you know, in addition to that, there was this demonization of sort of the white working class didn't get vaccinated, they were Trump ignoramuses, clingers, but when you actually looked at the percentages of groups -- not that it matters -- but by ethnic affiliation, it wasn't the so-called white voter who wasn't getting vaccinated it was Latinos and Blacks at least until recently hadn't been vaccinated proportionally into their numbers on the general population. So almost all the information that he was giving was not just inaccurate, but it was weaponized, and I guess, you know, I don't listen to Jane Fonda much, I don't think anybody does, but she did say something at the beginning of all this. She said, COVID is God's gift to the left, and what she meant was I think that everything from making Election Day irrelevant with 102 early and mail-in ballots and two, really depriving citizens of free choice and the Bill of Rights was possible through the hysteria that happened to this very serious plague, but -- and that's what happened."

They shouldn't be forced to get a vaccine they don't need. The Republican Party exists to protect these people, it hasn't been. As a measure of how profoundly it hasn't been, 80 House Republicans just voted to give the Federal government power to track your vaccine status. Let's hope every one of them loses. Plus Black Lives Matter is pushing for a Black Christmas this year and that means you're not allowed to support white businesses. Amazing. That's ahead. We'll be right back."

In many cases because they've had COVID, they've recovered, they are protected against it, probably more durably than they would be with a vaccine, but they are being forced to get an injection they don't want because they're being fired. Where is the Republican Party? Why is no one defending these people? What are they doing instead? Well here's part of what they're doing. Eighty Republicans just voted with Democrats to pass a bill to fund a government vaccine database. You think we need that? If the law passes, it would expand the C.D.C.'s powers. Think we need that? They're now an Intel Agency. And the database should be used among other things to remind patients when they are due for a recommended vaccine, as if you need to be harangued by the government more about your health. Do you think you do? Joe Kent doesn't think you do. He is a former member of the Army Special Forces. He is running to represent the third congressional district in Washington State. The Member of Congress who currently occupies that seat voted for this database bill. We are happy to have Joe Kent join us tonight. Joe, thanks so much for coming on. So why do you think at a moment when Americans are literally losing their jobs over these mandates that Republicans are spending their time creating a Federal vax database."

I mean, the Republican Party right now is supposed to be the one that is defending us from this tyranny, from this assault on all of our liberties, but really, they are going along with the interests of both Big Government, Big Pharma, and their big corporate donors. The woman I'm running against, Jaime Herrera Beutler, she is taking money from Johnson & Johnson. She has done nothing about the tyrannical vaccine mandates coming from Joe Biden and from our tyrant Governor Jay Inslee who just referred to the unvaccinated as a threat to public health today.

When we have, you know, the vaccine has been approved now for five to 16-year-olds, when are they going to tell us that we have to get our kids jabbed? If we don't start pushing back, they are going to keep taking more and more of our liberties and the Republican Party is absolutely derelict in their duties right now."

Our kids have been forced back into having masks the, high school kids are being threatened with having to get COVID tests, so right now, this is up in everyone's lives and where are the Republicans? Jaime Herrera Beutler continues to go along with this. She just voted for this database that's going to be used to track us and now the C.D.C. is an Intelligence Agency and we know how out of control the Department of Justice is, going after people who don't comply or push back against the narrative, so that's in the forefront of every American's mind right now. And the Republican Party is derelict.

Sean Duffy is a former Member of Congress from the State of Wisconsin.

We have recipes from the Doocy's, favorite playlist, pictures of Jesse Watters and his war on Christmas, so if you love Christmas, if you are sick of the war on Christmas, this is a great way to celebrate it and if you have a family member or someone you have to get a gift for, this book is a great gift for a FOX News fan."

Now her mom survived, but they put that fake Christmas tree up every year as a remembrance of that Christmas where they had a great neighbor and they celebrated their mom's recovery. I mean, I never knew that about Emily. There are stories like this all over the book that I didn't have any clue about that people shared with us and again, it was heartwarming and again I see you for an hour a night, Tucker. I see some others for three hours a day. You see them on TV, but you don't see this inner side of them that we expose in the book, which makes it so cool unlike Black Lives Matter that's trying to take down Christmas in this Cultural Revolution, we are celebrating it at FOX."

Recently, the union held a conference to discuss how to indoctrinate school children without their parents knowledge. One first grade teacher called Blaire Wyatt explained that it's best to hold meetings for gender identity clubs during lunch time so that parents never know."

      "speaker": "BLAIRE WYATT, FIRST GRADE TEACHER",
      "utterance": "Yes, that lunch time is kind of that sweet spot where the kids don't need to come earlier, stay late, and it kind of eliminate a little bit of that parent interaction if there are kids who would like to attend, but maybe their parents are unaware that they're interested in participating or unaware that they are out at school. So if we can get it to happen at lunch, that seems like a really good structure to you know, protect the kids identities and protect and allow them to attend."

Documents from the conference also show that teachers admit they read students' Google search histories, looking for signs of interest in gender issues so they can take advantage of them. We wouldn't know any of this was happening if it weren't for Abigail Shrier, she broke the story. She is the author of \"Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze,\" and a very brave person. She joins us tonight. Abigail, thanks so much for coming on, for breaking this story. It looks on the face of it from what we just presented that these teachers are intentionally trying to hide what's going on from the parents of the kids. ABIGAIL SHRIER, AUTHOR \"IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE\": That's right. The deception is actually the point, it is explicit and in fact in both the reporting I did on that conference you mentioned in October and then I've since seen more recent videos of the California Teachers Association specifically guiding teachers statewide in deception of parents about the clubs, about the membership that even at the elementary school level, eight and nine- year-olds telling them to rename the clubs things like Prism Club so that the parents won't know uh what's going on in the club and won't be able to you know supervise."

      "utterance": "Well, you know in one of the videos I watched put out by the California Teachers Association, the teachers instructed other educators that children as young as seven need support in their sexual identity and they believe it is their job to provide that and look, if this were a matter of parents coming in and saying their child had a particular sexual or gender identity and they wanted the school to support it, that would be one thing. But instead, what the California Teachers Association is doing is, they are deciding how to recruit students to these clubs, how to coach them in you know, solidifying this gender identity or sexual orientation identity, and they're doing this by deceiving parents specifically telling teachers how to keep the existence of the clubs and the membership from the parents."

I want to be really clear about that. These are activist teachers. They are looking to peel the children away from the values of their homes and supplant those values with their own."
