Where does the bureau go from here? Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former assistant FBI Director James Kallstrom will be here live for that.

I do believe we need a serious investigation, I do believe this administration ought to be more aggressive in going after these things and more aggressive in going after these leaks.

Newt, we know what happened when you're in public. Sally Yates and Jim Clapper over and over again last week saying, I know the answer but I can't tell you. Yes, I know the answer to that but I'm not going to reveal it in a public setting. Is that what Jim Comey wants? He wants to be in public setting so that he could say I can't reveal anything?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "No, I think what Jim Comey wants is to avoid one or two people leaking their version of what he said. If I were Comey, I absolutely would insist on testifying in public. I wouldn't trust either side because the democrats are going to take anything he says that seems to hurt Trump and they're going to distort it and leak it. The republicans will take anything he says which seems to exonerate Trump, they'll distort it and leak it. We live in a period unfortunately where we are surrounded by 24-day leaks and I think we're much better off to have these things out in the open. Let it flow and let Comey tell his side of the story and just let it be out there. I'm not worried about the kind of \"oh, I can't tell you because this or that\" and frankly on some of the things that they won't tell you about because it affects the ability of doing it and goes out to sources and our methods. I don't want him to particularly say that in private either because you know it'll leak."

      "utterance": "Well, we know that there were leaks and we know that it is illegal to pass information on that is critical information to the media and where is the investigation around that? This whole idea that these agencies have become politicized has been outrageous, Newt. I spoke with Rand Paul the other day - not sure if you heard what he told me on Fox News on Thursday, but listen to this. This is something I have to get your take on. Watch."

I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. I've asked the White House to look at the logs of all the previous Obama administration people to see if are they were searching my name and unmasking me in any way. I know one of the senators who's already confided to me that he was surveilled by the Obama administration including his phone calls."

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Look, you had an enormous breakdown in the rule of law. You had it with the Clinton foundation, you had it with Hillary Clinton, you had it with Barack Obama, you had it with his staff. I mean, when you send the National Security Adviser out to lie on six different television shows about Benghazi, the Sunday after an American ambassador is killed, and she knows she's lying. You can tell that there's a collapse of any kind of honesty and any kind of measure of enforcing basic sound principles. I'm not at all surprise that the - that the Obama administration was prepared to flout the rules. And look, their core model was a radicalism going back Saul Alinsky in which middle-class rules and middle-class laws don't count. And I think that we ought to take seriously what their intellectually pedigree is. I do believe we need a serious investigation, I do believe this administration ought to be more aggressive in going after these things and more aggressive in going after these leaks. But the truth is, you now have a news media that's totally out of control and that thinks it's more important than the President of the United States, it's more important than the constitution, it's more important than the rule of law and at some point there's going to be a collision over that. And I actually applauded what the President said the last few days. I think it might be very healthy for the White House Press Corps to suddenly not have a space, to suddenly not have the daily opportunity to taunt whoever the spokesperson is. You know, let him go over the Starbucks and drink coffee and re- speculate in what's happening in the White House. But the game that we now have going on is really sick."

And I'm just wondering if that's one of the reasons the President fired Jim Comey because here we are constantly hearing about this charade of an investigation over potential collusion between Trump and the Russians with no evidence whatsoever and yet where is the investigation of the unmasking? Where's the investigation of the passing of classified information to the media? Is it happening?"

Now, remember, 95 percent of all donations by federal employees went to Hillary Clinton. 97 percent of all donations at the Justice Department went to Hillary Clinton and 99 percent of all the donation at the State Department went to Hillary Clinton.

I mean, everyone in the FBI knew because you knew where the donations were going, what should he have done, step down? Can he have just said look, \"I'm stepping down? I'm not going to have this on my shoulders?\" Rather than becoming the judge, jury, and the executor during the election."

At that point, Comey's job was to report to Deputy Attorney General who I think at the time was Yates."

Frankly, I finally lost total faith in Comey at that hearing about a week ago where he goes off on how it almost made him nauseous to do this. And that I thought you know, we don't need psychotherapy on national television. The Director of the FBI ought to be somebody who knows what they're doing, he's prepared to defend it, does it with dignity and is willing to take the consequences."

      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "So the Commission is looking at more than just the 2016 election. It's looking at the entire issue of voting irregularities and fraud and registration problems. So what we'll be doing is for the first time in our country's history, we'll be gathering data from all 50 states and we'll be using the federal government's databases which can been very valuable. The Social Security Administration has data on people when they pass away. The Department of Homeland Security knows of the millions of aliens who are in the United States legally and that data that's never been bounced against the state's voter rolls to see whether these people are registered. So, we'll be doing like that that have never been done before and we'll try to get some numbers, some actual statistics because you know, this debate is so contentious but often times the debate doesn't have enough facts in the - in the debate and we're going to be providing those facts, putting them on the table and letting the people decide in going where the facts take us."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think it's terrific that you're doing this especially after all of the conversations surrounding this issue in the last couple of elections. Let me ask you, how do they do it? Somebody dies and then they just get their name, they - and they use their identity? How do they do it? What's the typical track that these people are taking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "You know, I think voting the names of deceased people, although that's, you know, sort of the subject of lore in Chicago and places you hear about people talking about that. I think that's one of the less frequent forms of voter fraud, but I could be wrong. We'll find out. But the way that would happen is a person dies for whatever reason the county doesn't know that and the name remains on the voter roll and then somebody - it's a matter of public record the voter role, somebody discovers that so-and-so's name is still on the voter roll and then benefits the state the state without photo I.D., they can just walk out and say I am that person. But the more common forms of voter fraud - I think the most common that I have seen in Kansas is double voting. People voting twice in the same election. Either in Kansas and in another state or in two different counties of Kansas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Or you can also argue that what we've been talking about in terms of spying on people is also a form of voter fraud. Right? I mean, we have just been talking about this situation where Rand Paul says he was surveilled and another senator has confided in him that he too was spied on by the Obama administration reading the record of their phone calls and their correspondents, etcetera. Doesn't that fall under the umbrella of voter fraud during the election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "It might very well be a crime and it certainly is in the case as you've described but well, depending on the circumstances of whether he had - whether there was consent and who was doing the spying. But in - we usually don't define those as voter crimes. You're right that it might have some direct effect in the election. But the voter crimes are classically ones where you are trying to vote in somebody else's name, you're trying to alter a ballot, you're trying to commit vote by mail fraud. We'll be looking at - you know, the things that are classically defined as election fraud."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, Secretary, what about for example the IRS targeting conservatives? I mean, the IRS was targeting conservatives, right? And we know that John Koskinen is still in charge of the IRS. A lot of people scratching their heads about that one. How is he still in that job after we know that targeted conservatives. Is that under the umbrella of voter fraud?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "Probably not because again - and by the way, these are great topics that you know, maybe deserving of their own commission to look into it. But the subject of voter fraud is itself pretty vast. I mean, you're talking about maybe eight or ten different forms of fraud. We'll also be looking at the effect on voter participation. You know, one of the argument you hear from people that oppose things like photo I.D. which we have here in Kansas is they say, well, depresses participation rates. We haven't seen that in Kansas but we'll look at the evidence from the other 49 states and see what it shows. So we're trying to keep it - you know -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't understand that. How is it possible that in some areas of the country you don't need an id to vote? I mean, you need an I.D. for everything. You need an I.D. to buy a beer and you don't need your I.D. to participate in a Presidential Election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "I agree. I mean, look, you need an I.D. to get on a plane, you need I.D. to enter a federal building, to open a checking account and pretty much need photo I.D. to function in an American society. You even need - you need one to buy kind of suit of feds that work too if get a call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, how does that fly -- how does that even fly? That OK, we're going to use - we're going do away with I.D.'s and that's politically incorrect. I don't understand the thinking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "Well, so, I mean, what happened in those states is they didn't have I.D. requirement for the - or you know, the early years of the 20thcentury going all the way to1980's and then states started realizing that voter fraud was happening. And so, state by state we starting adapting. So now, you've got about a dozen states like Kansas that have a very strict voter I.D. requirement. And you've got another maybe six or eight states that had ones with loopholes in them and then there's a whole bunch of states, in fact, the majority still don't have it. And our constitution allows the states to define the rules of voting. I - we'll see if more states adopt it and maybe this commission can shed some light on the subject."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "Well, I can't forecast what the conclusions would be but I can give you some idea of what we might do. So, one thing that's never been done before that I eluded to earlier is the Department of Homeland Security has a database of all known aliens, green card holders, temporary visa holder in the United States. And that is never been bounced against the state's voter rolls to say well, hey, how many of these people with these names these date of birth so you can get an exact match. How many of them are registered to vote in state A or state B. We can do something like that again which would be very informative and I don't know what the results will yield but I know that for example in Kansas, we have seen a large number of noncitizen register on voter rolls and that's one of the subjects were actually locked in battle of the ACLU in court right now."

The leader at the FBI should be someone who's really vested in experience in investigation, a solid person, smart, articulate, a good communicator. Someone who can motivate the agents to excel, you know, for the good of the country. Somebody who can deep - get deep down into gut of patriotism. You know, the FBI works for the American people, it doesn't work for either party, it never should. And that was Jim Comey's big mistake. Was big mistake, that's criminal referral comes over briefly you know, and says, you know, you can't call it criminal, no grand jury. He needs to stand up at that point in time, have a press conference and resign from the FBI. The FBI, you know, cannot be whiplashed around for political reasons. As soon as it does, you know, that's the end of it. That can't happen."

So he really need to step down, Jim Comey."

So what was Jim Comey thinking five months down the road when he has this sort of shallow investigation, but there was so much evidence that they found files of it anyway and that they articulated. You know, really, a lot of evidence."

You know, you look back to the Boston - you look at the Boston marathon and all those other cases, right? It turns out that the FBI knew about those people, right?

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Very important point that you make there. So I know that the President and yourself have been talking with China in terms of a lot of issues, not just the North Korea issue, but certainly on trade and getting American companies a better foothold than China.

They've always been reluctant to do really tough things with the North Koreans because they worried about the collapse of the regime more than they're worried about a nuclear North Korea. The administration is saying to them, worry more about a nuclear North Korea because if you can't do something about the path that they are on, we will have to."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSS",
      "utterance": "Well, at Mar-a-Lago we initiated two dialogues, a strategic dialogue which deals importantly with North Korea, and the economic dialogue which is the part that I've been involved with. In terms of the strategic, it's my impression that what the Chinese are worried about is if the regime does collapse, there would be a huge flood of refugees into China, and they really don't want that. And they're already getting quite a little flow just because of the turmoil. So, I can understand they're in a very tricky position."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, sure. Understood. They want to see change, they want to see a nonnuclear North Korea but they don't want it to mean a democratic North Korea, changing leadership in that regard, they don't want to see refugees flowing into China. I understand they have a balance to walk. Having said that, the U.S. and China agreed to take action by mid-July to increase access for U.S. financial firms and expand trade in beef and chicken among other steps as part of the drive to cut its trade deficit with Beijing. Tell us what's most important in this most recent trade deal with China, Wilbur, and what you're expecting out of China in terms of working with the U.S. on trade?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSS",
      "utterance": "Well, the most important things that we got from the Chinese were the deal on beef. China already is a $2.5-billion a year market for beef but that represents a very, very small amount per person. About $1.70 per person. So, with the rising standards of living there, it's pretty clear that this already big $2.5-billion market could grow very rapidly. It's been quite a few years that there's been discussion about opening that market. We finally have gotten them to agree to a precise state by which the beef imports into China would start from America. So the American livestock industry is quite thrilled with that."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Wow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSS",
      "utterance": "Second thing that we got is LNG Exports. As you probably remember, LNG prices have been very depressed in the U.S. but now we're opening it up that there could be even long-term contracts to supply China. And China is the world's largest consumer of LNG than the world's largest importer, so while there have been a few scattered little spot shipments, the idea of having big, long-term contracts is very, very attractive to our industry. And then, the third and fourth and fifth things that we've got where they had sort of banned our credit card companies from doing dual currency, dual label cards with the Chinese banks. Now, they've agreed to let them do that, and to take on the U.S.-based electronic payment services. So, that helps the service industries. And then lastly, they've agreed to grant two licenses to foreign-owned firms in order to underwrite bonds and to clear the trades. And then lastly, in food biotechnology, there are quite a few applications. I think something like Eight Pending and we've agreed on a protocol for going forward with them where by the end of May, those fellows will know if there are any remaining problems in their application, if not, it will go forward. So, it's --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And lot more because a lot of people wonder if American companies will ever get a shot to actually own something in China rather than just being part of a joint venture where a financial firm can only own 49 percent because American companies want to sell to the 1.1 billion people of China."

There's a host of issues. But, strategy here was get a few quick kills, a few tangible deliverable items that could be done quickly, make sure that there was actual performance on them because many of these things had been premised for a long time. Now, it's time for delivery, assuming that those are delivered, then we'll go into a one-year program of negotiations. If that produces more deliverables, we'll go into a longer-term period of negotiation."

And this, if you'll remember the judge in Hawaii found a constitutional right for non-resident aliens based on the first amendment, we don't think that's right, so we're hopeful that they'll overrule that, and instead, base it on clear federal statutes that gives the president the authority to do this."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAXTON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's interesting for us because we filed a lawsuit based on the Syrian refugees coming to our state without us knowing much about it. Now, we were told by a federal judge that the federal government has complete authority over immigration. And so, it's a little surprising to us that now that we're with a different President, that we have courts all over the nation saying the President doesn't have - does not have the authority to do that when we think clearly under federal statute that he does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. So, I mean, obviously the Ninth Circuit has been against the president. And so, it keeps coming from the Ninth Circuit but can the Ninth Circuit keep this up and actually create a barrier for the President to get his executive order on immigration to throw it all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAXTON",
      "utterance": "Well, you make a good point. We had - you know, we had the first travel ban, the lawsuit was in Washington State, which was the Ninth Circuit, then the second one was in Hawaii, which is the Ninth Circuit. Obviously, there's a reason they're filing it in Ninth Circuit, tends to be more liberal court. But ultimately, I expect this to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. I think the Supreme Court, obviously, now that it has all nine justices, we're, you know, more hopeful that we're going to get ruling on this."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAXTON",
      "utterance": "So, you know, we actually filed a lawsuit, as I said on this - related to Syrian refugees and we basically pulled out of the program, the federal program because we had no way of monitoring who was coming into our state. So the program still continues for us but we're not part of that as a state, and the reason we're not part is our governor did not feel comfortable saying that we were going to be part of a program where we could not vet these people and know who was coming into our state. So, we're very concerned about this, and obviously, we have a huge issue here with crimes in our state with illegals, and so, we want to make sure that this is resolved."

I think this -- and we need a strategy. This was the worst week, I think, this President has had, and it's all self-inflicted. He could have gotten rid of Comey on January 20th, he couldn't gotten - remember Comey this last week and what he should have done is sat down, as Jim said, I want to make a change, you want to resign by the end of the week or I'm going to fire you, and even firing him, he should have said thank you for your service and move on. The problem is he made it into a much bigger story than needed to be. The White House staff basically is all over the place.

And this next week, these foreign leaders will look him in the eye and they're going to make a judgment, and the judgment had better be that he -- this is a significant leader, he can take this country in a new direction. And I think if he doesn't do that, it fails on that front because he's distracted by all the rest of this stuff, it'll be a terrible, terrible month here, and I think it's very key at this point."
