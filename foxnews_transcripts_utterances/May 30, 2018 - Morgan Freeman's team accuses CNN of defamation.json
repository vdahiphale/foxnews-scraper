Republican representative Trey Gowdy disputes Trump's claim that the FBI spied on his campaign. We invited him on tonight, he declined. I guess he declined for the week. We hope he comes on next week but Dan Bongino is going to respond to the Congressman tonight. Meanwhile legal experts saying that Morgan Freeman has a good case for defamation against CNN, Ramon Arroyo has that. And a preacher who feels God as called him to have a fourth private jet, seen and unseen tonight. Plus we are going to bring you a story that no one else will talk about. One that blows the lid off Democrats claim to be the party of compassion. And last night we told you about foreign cartels infiltrating states where pot is now legal. Well a sheriff from one of those states was watching and we is with us tonight with the inside story, the truth from the front lines. But first, Roseanne and the race to blame Trump, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Wouldn't you know it, we solved a Twitter mystery? Well it turns out if you believe the left that ever Trumpers, Donald Trump himself may have taken over Roseanne Barr's account and tapped out the tweet that lead to the demise of her hit sitcom, and her entire career.

We know he is trying to rid their communities of gangs like MS13. And the President is now even working with Congress to pass prison reform. We'll get into a little about that later on. All of this has caused his support to grow among minority groups, modest gains.

The major media are selectively reporting the FBI and DOJ's briefing of key law maker's last week about that informant in the Trump Presidential campaign. It's typical of today's headlines. ABC's website blared, \"Gowdy disputes Trump's spy claim, says FBI acted properly\". But that ignores a number of key points Oversight Chair Trey Gowdy made on Fox last night. The first was that the DOJ made clear that the President was not and is not a target of the Russia investigation despite the Democrats' constant disinformation on that point. Gowdy also could not explain why the FBI did not simply do that defensive briefing on the campaign instead of relying on an informant inside his campaign.

Eight months about the investigation when prior procedure was to notify Congress quarterly on sensitive investigations. Another question for you, if they ran it by the book, how it is that suspiciously potentially felony leaks of information happened in both October and January to the New York Times and Washington post.

Republican representative Trey Gowdy disputes Trump's claim that the FBI spied on his campaign. We invited him on tonight, he declined. I guess he declined for the week. We hope he comes on next week but Dan Bongino is going to respond to the Congressman tonight. Meanwhile legal experts saying that Morgan Freeman has a good case for defamation against CNN, Ramon Arroyo has that. And a preacher who feels God as called him to have a fourth private jet, seen and unseen tonight. Plus we are going to bring you a story that no one else will talk about. One that blows the lid off Democrats claim to be the party of compassion. And last night we told you about foreign cartels infiltrating states where pot is now legal. Well a sheriff from one of those states was watching and we is with us tonight with the inside story, the truth from the front lines. But first, Roseanne and the race to blame Trump, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Wouldn't you know it, we solved a Twitter mystery? Well it turns out if you believe the left that ever Trumpers, Donald Trump himself may have taken over Roseanne Barr's account and tapped out the tweet that lead to the demise of her hit sitcom, and her entire career.

And who can forget this 2005 gem that was conveniently hidden from public view by the photographer for years. Oh, that's a beaut. Well we never saw that pic until Obama left office. Well you see the left protects and defends their own because they're immune to criticism for their unsavory political associations.

And this is who MSNBC wheels out as an expert? Sharpton on bigotry and civility in America? Please. The left has to tag Roseanne's racial misdeed to Trump, why? Well because they have no substantive answers to the problems facing minority communities today. So their only recourse is only to do what they do best. Race bait and demonize their opponents. Meanwhile President Trump is actually delivering undeniable results. We know unemployment among blacks and Hispanics is down to historic lows. We know he is trying to rid their communities of gangs like MS13. And the President is now even working with Congress to pass prison reform. We'll get into a little about that later on. All of this has caused his support to grow among minority groups, modest gains. But the left of course refuses to applaud any of Trump's progress or work with him, even on issues where they have common ground. That's how fanatical they are. Instead what the left does is they plot away on how exploit the next moment of racial outrage.

Trey Gowdy by the way seems to be at odds with what the President calls Spygate. He has many Conservatives upset, Dan Bongino has a message for Gowdy, next. The major media are selectively reporting the FBI and DOJ's briefing of key law maker's last week about that informant in the Trump Presidential campaign. It's typical of today's headlines. ABC's website blared, \"Gowdy disputes Trump's spy claim, says FBI acted properly\". But that ignores a number of key points Oversight Chair Trey Gowdy made on Fox last night. The first was that the DOJ made clear that the President was not and is not a target of the Russia investigation despite the Democrats' constant disinformation on that point. Gowdy also could not explain why the FBI did not simply do that defensive briefing on the campaign instead of relying on an informant inside his campaign. On the Angle last night Former Federal Prosecutor Andy McCarthy laid out his theory."

Dan Bongino first let's go to you on this. We invited Gowdy on the show. We want him to come on, he's a really smart guy, a little confusing the way he approached this issue although a little misrepresented I think in the press.

And what he said is completely out of line and factually incorrect. Let's just run through some basic facts here okay. So according to Gowdy, the FBI read it by the book how the Americans would have wanted them to run the investigations. Really? So why didn't they notify Congress for eight moths Laura. Eight months about the investigation when prior procedure was to notify Congress quarterly on sensitive investigations. Another question for you, if they ran it by the book, how it is that suspiciously potentially felony leaks of information happened in both October and January to the New York Times and Washington post. Is that an example Mr Gowdy of a finely tuned investigation run like the Americans would have wanted? By the way, hidden from Congress? Seriously, give me a break.

And so the fact that he then announced that he was recusing himself because he was an integral player in the campaign and therefore could not oversee an investigation into the campaign should not have been a surprise. The other problem that I see as a former federal prosecutor about the way that Trump views Sessions and the attorney general is that he seems to be talking a lot about wanting someone who's loyal to him, which on its face is fine, he gets to choose his cabinet and I get that. But what he's really indicating and implying in making that statement is that he wants someone loyal to him at the top of the justice department who will squash an investigation into either him or his campaign associates, children or whatever you have of it."

So I think like that loyalty went real deep between the two of them whether it was the IRS investigation, the way that they handled Fast and Furious, how they did the Rosen Oversight, whether the President knew anything about any of this was never briefed on it.

      "utterance": "I get it. I get it. Everyone has their resistance mode when the other party is in power. But at some point, guys, they are supposed to govern. If you can make people's lives better, and I'm for smaller government, but in this case more choice, they're supposed to be all prochoice, I think if you want to build out your majority, you have to do something."

      "utterance": "Look, finally we did something right here. But if the Democrats have had their way, to Garland's point, they may have tried to block it. But they're going to have to answer for this. And we all know people. I have got a good friend whose mother was dying of breast cancer years ago at a top New York hospital, and her family was willing to pay whatever it costs out of their own pocket for experimental treatment, and she was denied. Now those kinds of patients will have a shot, a final shot at life. And what greater gift, thanks to the president."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We told you last night about a shocking report that found that laws legalizing marijuana have not driven organized crime out of the pot trade, just the opposite. They have created a huge gold rush for foreign drug cartels. Our guest Mason Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project disagreed."

    {
      "speaker": "MASON TVERT",
      "utterance": "When states like Colorado and Washington and California, what we are seeing is that the demand amongst the population in those states is being met by a new legal market where the product is being controlled. It's being grown and sold by licensed businesses."

      "utterance": "That statement really irked Sheriff Bill Elder of El Paso County in Colorado and he joins us now from Denver. Sheriff, you are on the front lines. You see the results of pot legalization. I have been a staunch critic of this move to legalize drugs for years now. You see the money in it, it is huge money. Corporations and lobbyists are swarming all over Washington. I want to play for you what Chuck Schumer said about this. Let's watch."

      "utterance": "I studied the issue, and we now have some evidence, the state of Washington, other states, where it has done lots of good and no harm. Justice Brandeis said, let the states be laboratories. Now we've had a few states, we've had a few laboratories. The experiment has been a success. Let's nationalize it."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And it was said yesterday that the only reason this is happening, Sheriff Elder, is because all the other states have a need for the pot. You can't buy it in all the other states where it's not legal. And once it's legalized nationally, then the cartels will move out. Do you buy that argument?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "Not at all. The cartels have infiltrated Colorado right and left. Right now we are tracking over 600 grows in El Paso County alone, another 150 or 200 in Pueblo County that are all cartel controlled black market marijuana. And that marijuana is being packaged and sold all over the east coast at two or two and a half times its value in Colorado. This is ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They just say once all these other states legalize it -- it's driven by the desire, by the market. The market demands that pot be sent all over the country and all these other states need to get with it. I do want to show our viewers statistics that they may not see anyone else. Here's the changing crime from 2013-2016 during the legalization period in Colorado. Colorado was up five percent, nationally it was down nine percent. Violent crime, same period, Colorado up 12.5 percent, and nationally up five percent corresponding to the periods of legalization. Does that comport with your own experience with the violent crime increase, sheriff?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "It absolutely does. We have now legalized marijuana for medicinal uses as well as recreational uses. We didn't put any caps on it. Before you could grow up to 99 plants in a residential zone. Today we have limited data to 12 plants in a residential zone, and every one of these grows that we have taken down since the first of the year has had well over 100 plants. Since the first of the year, we have executed 64 search warrants and recovered almost 5,300 marijuana plants that were destined for the east coast. This is no longer an experiment."
