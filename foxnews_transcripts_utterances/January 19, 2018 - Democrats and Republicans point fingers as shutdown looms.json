      "speaker": "ALLEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, you were talking about the rabbit out of the hat. If this brinkmanship pays off, if something happens in the next couple of hours, you are going to have to give credit to President Trump as a dealmaker because he took the risk earlier today of really upsetting Republican leaders by bringing Senator Schumer down there, two New Yorkers, hashing this out, leaving out the speaker and the Senate Republican leader. And it looks like there is movement. We just saw Mick Mulvaney at the White House saying that it looks like there is a deal to be had."

      "utterance": "Yes. Now if they go -- they want four weeks. But it doesn't sound like the Democrats are going to give them four weeks. They want to have a little bit shorter time to get their back up against the wall on DACA. March 5th is the deadline for the DACA situation. So does five days work, does 10 days work?"

      "utterance": "More than five days and less than four weeks. And also, you have to think is the deadline really a deadline, because Mick Mulvaney, again, was talking about, well, the next federal pay day is next Friday. Of course, if you can do something this weekend and get it cleared up before Monday, then people can come back to work. We've all been thinking Friday midnight, but they've had Saturday and Sunday to work on this too. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
