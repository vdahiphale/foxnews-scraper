Top generals testifying today on Capitol Hill and directly contradicting a key claim made by the commander-in-chief. All three military leaders say they warned Biden to leave thousands of troops in the country to avoid a catastrophe, but he didn't listen.

I don't care about their politics. I don't care where they come from, what they look like. It's about pursuing happiness in America. And so, we tell their stories of how they struggled, how they pushed through the hard times and really took advantage of the American dream through hard work. So, it's everybody from Wynonna Judd, Richard Petty, Gavin DeGraw, Eddie George. It's the gambit of great Americans. And I think it reminds us what we still have in common in this country.

President Biden has a big problem when it comes to the truth about getting out of Afghanistan. Top generals testifying today on Capitol Hill and directly contradicting a key claim made by the commander-in-chief. All three military leaders say they warned Biden to leave thousands of troops in the country to avoid a catastrophe, but he didn't listen. And then, he claimed it didn't happen."

And that was increasingly so in the spring of this year, April of 2021, as a decision was being made. I think the president made it in April right before -- the beginning of April 2021. And I thought, well, they better hope that that turns out to be true. But of course, it didn't. And I thought that was the big headline that came out of today, is that -- now, it is okay if a commander-in-chief wants to get briefed and then go in a different direction and make a different decision. He's the decider. But what he did is say, I made a decision but it was based on not on something that they told me. And now they're contradicting him. And I wouldn't have wanted necessarily to be in their shoes today, right? Because their having to defend a failure that they know was partly because Biden didn't take their advice. And they don't want to completely throw the commander-in-chief under the bus. But then this other piece when Senator Inhofe had Milley say that basically we have no counterterrorism on the ground. Also Milley said it was a logistical success but a strategic failure. I think it's hard to spin leaving Americans behind and interpreters and all of our helpers behind as a logistical success. I understand that they got a lot of people out, but again, who were the people that they got out? They weren't the people that we were supposed to help."

So, he spent all this time talking -- this is -- looks -- Milley looks to me like the kind of guy not only reads the books, but like frames them and puts them on the wall like for everyone to read. But he said a couple of things or a couple of really stunning moments there. Hawley caught him pretty good when -- well, that was Austin, but hearing when they got them to acknowledge it. You guys left Americans behind like just cut the crap. Like there are Americans there right now. Like just stop saying you didn't leave Americans behind. You did. Admit it. Apologize profusely for it. Get them out and do your thing. But Milley did something in the hearing. A lot of people didn't catch it and I don't know how they missed it here. He said two entirely contradictory things. He's talking about the call to China which he claims now has been misrepresented, we'll see, where he spoke to the Chinese Communist Party and usurped the role of the commander-in-chief and basically said, I was there to defuse the situation. So he didn't misinterpret anything. That's not his job."

But then later on, did you catch it? So he's in the decision-making chain there and he's like no big deal. Later on when asked about the decision to withdraw from Bagram, he totally passes the buck. I'm not a decision maker folks. I'm just a conduit. So, what is it, General? Are you a conduit or are you a decision maker? I am surprised nobody caught that. I talked about it on my radio show. He had two contradictory thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's how he got out of all answering questions today. Yet he told Bob Woodward every conversation he had with Donald Trump. So let's just go to this other stuff. I mean, there's a lot of finger pointing. Military is pointing at State Department. State Department points at the Afghan army. Military points at the White House. No one's accountable, but they want a bipartisan commission in a few years. What do you think is going to happen then?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTIR",
      "utterance": "I think it'll be quite important I think the American public is happy actually to see the people who were advising the president on this decision that everyone agrees with the intent but doesn't agree with the execution to see what they actually said or not because we all saw the Stephanopoulos interview and so we thought that President Biden had been on the same page with the people who would know better and were actually reading the intelligence on the ground. So I actually don't see these particular ones as wasted hearings whereas I usually do and I see them as kind of grandstanding and everyone just trying to get in their cable news, hence --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well the one thing that did come out of it as you mentioned that was productive, they're going to have a written recommendation that the brass delivered to the white house and it was in writing, and they'd asked for that. So, once they get it in their hands, that's pretty explosive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "It certainly could be. We'll wait to see what it is. And I would remind everyone at the table, not that you've necessarily forgotten in the audience that Bob Menendez, Democrat and a strong ally of President Biden has been the one leading the charge on trying to get this information. To Dana's point about Milley saying logistical success, strategic failure, I think that what he was trying to convey was how dire the circumstances were when Biden said we are leaving in like two weeks. And so what can you get done in that amount of time. I thought that to Dan's point about the call with China, the reason that he wasn't actually usurping the commander- in-chief's power is because Mark Esper told him to do it and was behind the decision he was making."

We told him to do this, but he did that and we don't know why. Is that not effectively calling out the president of the United States? They're not in the brig. They've still got their jobs.

But what about defunding the police, no cash bail, and other soft on crime policies. Keep in mind, the FBI just released new numbers and show murders soared nearly 30 percent in 2020. John, blaming COVID, I mean isn't this fairly obvious? You let bad guys out of prison, they do bad stuff. Like that kind of happens once in a while."

They want these things why? So they can have more control over their town. Maybe the wilder it gets, the more they can clamp down. That's the only reasoning I can find behind it because if you ran your household like that as a dad, if I just told my two kids, okay, now you can do whatever you want, nobody's in trouble. I wouldn't have a house waiting for me in Nashville when I came back home. That's not the way humans react. There has to be consequences.

Another important component of the FBI data that the short-term increases was in all regions not just in those liberal cities, all regions. That means in places where conservatives are. That means that this can't all be because of bail reform, defund the police, yada, yada, yada. And also the murder rate and the crime rate overall is lower than it was in the 1990s.

I mean, you're luring them across the border thinking they can just come on in, which they can, but what happens in the meantime? Child trafficking, fentanyl coming in by the bail as we would say in the country right now. You know, women being raped and assaulted as they come across. And they're willing to give all that up and put themselves in that kind of danger to have a shot at America. But we're not handling it correctly.

That was closed because 20,000 people decided to enter illegally who ironically got in before the legal truckers got in. They didn't open up the checkpoint for weeks later. Think about for a second. Everyone at home like processes horse blinders for a minute, right? People walked up to our fictitious -- there's no southern border. Please, let's stop the nonsense. You walked up illegally. You got in the country quicker than a trucker who works for a living with that pass, that global entry pass. He had to wait two weeks or drive to a port entry 90 miles down the road.

We have resources. We had all, you know, we had internet access. We could go through the -- I could call up the Congressman and they'd take my call and that's how, you know, we were able to do the system. And I remember saying to Peter at one point, you can imagine why people do this illegally because we're educated people and it's completely difficult for us to figure out. So the legal immigration system is -- needs attention desperately. And all of this illegal activity is making increases in legal immigration much, much harder. I also believe that there's something we need to remember. The criticism from the left about Obama as deporter-in-chief and now Biden as somebody they think it's horrendous that he sent some of the young people, the single men back to Haiti. They think that that is like human rights violation. So, where we have uh a thought of like we should have a legal order, like, I think we need to understand, like, they're pulled -- they're being pulled in a completely different direction. And one of the things is President Biden, when he campaigned, he was the moderate guy, turned to normal, everything's going to be -- everything is going to be calm.

I don't care about their politics. I don't care where they come from, what they look like. It's about pursuing happiness in America. And so, we tell their stories of how they struggled, how they pushed through the hard times and really took advantage of the American dream through hard work. So, it's everybody from Wynonna Judd, Richard Petty, Gavin DeGraw, Eddie George. It's the gambit of great Americans. And I think it reminds us what we still have in common in this country. Is there anything we still have in common, Dan? Yes it's called the right to pursue happiness. That's what we celebrate on this show. I'm excited to be on Fox Business."
