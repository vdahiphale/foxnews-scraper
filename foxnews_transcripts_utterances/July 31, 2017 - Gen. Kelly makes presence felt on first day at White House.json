What better way for General Kelly on day one, our one practically this morning, to say there is a new sheriff here, we are turning the page. Scaramucci, basically with all the antics and all of the rest, made it actually quite easy for the new chief of staff to say, here is somebody I can throw aside. And, you know, some of the other folks inside the White House, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and others, they wanted to see Reince Priebus go. So, for them, Anthony Scaramucci took care of business if you will, got Priebus out, got Sean Spicer out, and now you have General Kelly, hopefully for, if you're Jared Kushner or Ivanka Trump, hopefully starting a whole new chapter for their father and father-in-law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And instead, the President, they are claiming the Washington Post tonight, directed this himself and put out a misleading statement. This was about Russian adoption, it wasn't about the campaign. And as we all know now, new details keep dribbling out after that. So, bottom-line tonight, that is something that a lot of people are going to be hyperventilating about overnight, there is no crime, though in a misleading statement that is put out. The question for the President is going to be, wait a second, is this a part of a larger pattern of firing James Comey and other things that made it at least look like he didn't want the truth to come out, the facts to come out on Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course, the President would reject that narrative, but that is the case \"The Washington Post\" is trying to make tonight. I can tell you, I just spoke a moment ago with one of the President's top advisors outside the White House, who told me after reading this \"Washington Post\" story, this advisor said, this is a problem, because it is making it look like the President directed the misleading statement, and was more involved in it than we knew before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A lot more facts are going to come out, as we have seen with other stories.

And it raises a few questions: Why is it always the left but does this stuff? Whether it's MSNBC editing footage to hide the race of a black man with a rifle at a town hall, remember that? Or Katie Couric's doctored gun documentary. They're always employing tricks to create truth, it is like they can't depend on the facts. Which leads to a final point: If Donald Trump is so evil, why would you need to make up evil stuff about him? The stuff should be there right in front of you. Maybe you realize in quieter moments that he may not be as bad as you think. Perish the thought. If you hate somebody so much, Dana, you are more likely to believe anything bad about them and suspend your skepticism. DANA PERINO, FOX \"The Five\" SHOW HOST: It's before you can see on Friday when these tweets started coming out, all the celebrities follow each other, so it becomes a groupthink exercise. I agree with you. When you first look at that, there is no way, there has to be more. And in this day and age, you just have to use your brain, hit pause, you don't have to tweet everything that you see. It's almost as if, if you wait a day, or sometimes even a couple of hours, the truth will come out. I felt bad for the President on this one. It was unfair to him, but it does actually play into what you're talking about. If you distrust in the media, or twitter, and celebrities, this will reaffirm your beliefs.",

The Republicans have the opposite policy, so they must not have good intentions, therefore they are evil. So, when Trump doesn't shake a boy's hand who is handicapped, it's because he is evil. If you want a border wall, it's because he is racist, when he wants tax cuts, it's because he hates poor people. And the Democrats need to keep this charade up, because it allows them to smear Republicans, and when they lose their moral authority, then they can still - they don't do the ends justify the means.

What better way for General Kelly on day one, our one practically this morning, to say there is a new sheriff here, we are turning the page. Scaramucci, basically with all the antics and all of the rest, made it actually quite easy for the new chief of staff to say, here is somebody I can throw aside. And, you know, some of the other folks inside the White House, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and others, they wanted to see Reince Priebus go. So, for them, Anthony Scaramucci took care of business if you will, got Priebus out, got Sean Spicer out, and now you have General Kelly, hopefully for, if you're Jared Kushner or Ivanka Trump, hopefully starting a whole new chapter for their father and father-in-law."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, the press release was interesting. You're right, Kimberly. Because it said that Anthony Scaramucci had gone to the new chief of staff General Kelly and said he wanted to offer him a clean slate, so he can put his own team in place. That put it, you know, sort of framed it, as Scaramucci stepping aside and resigning basically. When Sarah Huckabee Sanders came out, she made it sound like a lot more of a firing saying that the President was offended by some of the language that Scaramucci used in that New Yorker interview, that maybe there's too much going on. And it sounded more like he was pushed out, and frankly, it was confusing about whether or not he was going to go back to the export import bank, which is where he was before he came in as communications director, because you're right Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, flatly, he does not have a role in the administration right now, basically. So, maybe the door is open after the dust settles for him to go back to the Export Import Bank, but even if he does that, that is a whole lot different than the job he was boasting about ten days ago when he said, I have got access to the Oval Office. I report directly to the President. I don't have to go through Reince Priebus. Things have changed, and they have changed directly."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the idea and I'm glad you brought that up again. I mentioned in a moment ago to Kimberly that, you know, the story going around from the White House is the President was offended by the profanity from Anthony Scaramucci. That has a lot of the President's critics tonight kind of rolling their eyes, saying, really, the President, locker room talk? He was offended like that? That sounds a bit more like cover. What was really going on here was General Kelly wanting to put his stamp as the new chief of staff on this White House. And with Anthony Scaramucci, he had a great opportunity to do that. And in fact, there are people close to Scaramucci suggesting over the weekend, he was trying to get some sort of a vote of confidence from General Kelly, and it never came. And it is interesting that we got some pictures of Scaramucci, in the Oval Office, when the press got in about 9:30, 9:40 this morning after the new chief-of- staff was officially sworn in. He was in the Oval Office, and then about a half hour or so later, the President has a cabinet meeting, with no sign of Scaramucci. So, he was pushed out pretty quickly."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, it is interesting, because when you talk about calming, the President started today with a tweet saying that with the stock market rising to a record level with the Southern border being secured, some of his accomplishments being laid out that he doesn't think the mainstream media is giving him credit for, he put out this tweet saying, there is no chaos here at the White House. Making it like, yes, General Kelly is coming in and it is all going to be tranquil, and then a couple of hours later, yes, there is even more tumult. So, frankly, what I have been hearing from advisors of the President and some staffers around here, is that they are hoping that General Kelly is turning the page and bringing, restoring some order here in the medium term. But in the short term, this with Scaramucci leaving so abruptly is yet another example of why a lot of people in this administration are on edge, because they don't know how many more people General Kelly will bring in to put his own stamp on the White House, and how many people will be moving out. So, in the short term, there is a lot of uncertainty."

I don't want to hammer him too hard, he'll end up working here. I don't want to make it awkward in the men's room. But I don't think it's about restoring order at all. It's about establishing order. We haven't had any order, and maybe you can agree with me, because that's what I'd like you to do, I think this is a good thing. And the reason why I think it is a good thing is because all of these reporters, Jesse included -- are sad to see him go for purely the entertainment value. That he will always be giving these gasps. He is an endless fountain of craziness. So, it is a good thing to deprive the media of this opportunity for gasps. It might mean an establishment of order, of everything settling down as Dana says."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, if you strip away all of the other media gibberish about this and that, and what's going on, some of what the President is tweeting about is absolutely true. The stock market keeps reaching record levels. General Kelly at the Department of Homeland Security has been cracking down on illegal immigration. People, you know, sharply reduced number of people, illegals are trying to cross the border, because they know there is literally a new sheriff in town. He is actually succeeding at some of the things he promised to do. But there are other big things, like tax reform, like health care, that he has not yet succeeding at, or struggling at in the case of health care. Tax reform, glass half-full, because they are just starting to tackle that. And so, the bottom line is, you go back to the Obama days, you can use the pen and the phone, and do all the executive actions you want. That is larger what this president has done, but I think the lesson of the Obama years, among other things is, a new president comes in and undos all of the, as many as those executive actions as they want. You have to lock in legislative gains. So the sideshows with Scaramucci if that is out of the way, this president can finally, maybe, maybe, maybe, focus on those legislative goals he promised the American people."

They say it is misleading, and it's not very well sourced, so I'm wondering what your take on this is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, some of this is probably hyped. Because \"The New York Times\" had already reported that on the way back from the G-20 Summit, the President and some aides were on Air Force One crafting that statement and had a direct role in what Donald Trump, Jr., was going to say at the New York Times when that story first broke about the Trump Tower meeting in the summer of 2016. What is new tonight from the Washington Post is they're saying, it wasn't just the President and his aides on Air Force One crafting a statement, they are claiming, from their sources, that it was the President himself sort of ripping up the statement, almost disavowing the advice of his advisors, to be more transparent and getting all the details out there. And instead, the President, they are claiming the Washington Post tonight, directed this himself and put out a misleading statement. This was about Russian adoption, it wasn't about the campaign. And as we all know now, new details keep dribbling out after that. So, bottom-line tonight, that is something that a lot of people are going to be hyperventilating about overnight, there is no crime, though in a misleading statement that is put out. The question for the President is going to be, wait a second, is this a part of a larger pattern of firing James Comey and other things that made it at least look like he didn't want the truth to come out, the facts to come out on Russia. Of course, the President would reject that narrative, but that is the case \"The Washington Post\" is trying to make tonight. I can tell you, I just spoke a moment ago with one of the President's top advisors outside the White House, who told me after reading this \"Washington Post\" story, this advisor said, this is a problem, because it is making it look like the President directed the misleading statement, and was more involved in it than we knew before. A lot more facts are going to come out, as we have seen with other stories. There is the screaming headlines at night, and the next day, sometimes, other facts come out that make it sound a lot less innocuous, but tonight, I can tell you talking to one of the President's advisors, they are a little concerned about this."

And yet, a lot of news organizations are putting out stories that are, well, anonymous sources say this, were not sure, you know, really, whether, you know, if we're going to lock this down or not.

The more you demonize him, the more it guarantees him greater sympathy. America will trust him more, while trusting the media, academia, people on Twitter and celebrities less. And it raises a few questions: Why is it always the left but does this stuff? Whether it's MSNBC editing footage to hide the race of a black man with a rifle at a town hall, remember that?

If you hate somebody so much, Dana, you are more likely to believe anything bad about them and suspend your skepticism. DANA PERINO, FOX \"The Five\" SHOW HOST: It's before you can see on Friday when these tweets started coming out, all the celebrities follow each other, so it becomes a groupthink exercise. I agree with you. When you first look at that, there is no way, there has to be more. And in this day and age, you just have to use your brain, hit pause, you don't have to tweet everything that you see. It's almost as if, if you wait a day, or sometimes even a couple of hours, the truth will come out. I felt bad for the President on this one. It was unfair to him, but it does actually play into what you're talking about. If you distrust in the media, or twitter, and celebrities, this will reaffirm your beliefs."

      "utterance": "By that time, it is too late, because the initial tweet gets millions. And the apology only gets a few thousand. They think Trump is evil, and here's why. This is my gut implementations. The Democrats base all of their policies on intentions. If you have intentions that are good, then you are good person. The Republicans have the opposite policy, so they must not have good intentions, therefore they are evil. So, when Trump doesn't shake a boy's hand who is handicapped, it's because he is evil. If you want a border wall, it's because he is racist, when he wants tax cuts, it's because he hates poor people. And the Democrats need to keep this charade up, because it allows them to smear Republicans, and when they lose their moral authority, then they can still - they don't do the ends justify the means. They can't get away with anything in breaking the law, shredding things because they believe they are so inherently good, that they can afford to draw outside the lines."

I would like to say that Fareed said that because he hates white people, he is a racist. He is an impulsive bigot. I'm merely using his tactics. Why would Fareed say that? Clearly, he is a bigot, because why did you vote for Trump, because clearly you're a big. The problem with his logic is that it can be used right back at him.

Do they just become racist in the last couple of years? I think that Trump one not just because of white voters, but because of people like Fareed Zakaria who are so out of touch for the last eight years. Thinking that everything was going so great in the economy, everything is going well, and they kept talking about back bathrooms and occupy Wall Street, while the rest of the country was saying, hey we are getting hammered over here, what about us.

You take ingredients and innovation from all over the place. You take in ideas from other people outside your own expertise. We don't do that with health care. We just sit there and say, it's either this or this. There are two viable options that are pretty simple but you can come up with, I pay for the small stuff, the government handles the catastrophic.
