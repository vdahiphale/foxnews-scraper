He said, we didn't find sufficient evidence to charge Trump with a crime. I would have liked to have known did he find evidence that Trump committed a crime, because previous independent counsels special counsels, even if they didn't indict a sitting president per the OLC guidelines, at least told the world that, in Nixon's case, there was evidence he obstructed justice, in Clinton's case, there was evidence of perjury and obstruction of justice.

He has muddled things to the point where I think the pressure will increase for him to testify. One of the problems is I think he is using two different standards, Mara, within the same report. When it comes to Russian collusion, the standard seems to be whether there is sufficient evidence to bring charges. But when we turn the tables to obstruction of justice, the standard is exoneration, a much higher barrier to clear. So that is within the same report.

      "utterance": "He has lost his notion of American fairness. As a lawyer it's astounding that he's expounding on can we exonerate or can't we exonerate, or can we do this or can we do that? The reality is, he doesn't have a case. He doesn't have a collusion case, doesn't have an obstruction case. If he was constrained by this Justice Department rule, then why did he do the investigation at all?"

    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "The argument that he was constrained by the rule I think is a dodge, Bret. He was hired to do an investigation to make a recommendation. Whether the attorney general then decides to follow that recommendation is not up to him. But there was nothing that prevented him from recommending an obstruction of justice charge if he felt that there was sufficient evidence to do so."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Or if he thought even he couldn't recommend it, why not say that at the beginning of the investigation? He clearly, Matthew, wanted to hit to the point of Russia and the specifics and the report that it seemed like he feels nobody read. He is like, hey, Congress, read the 448 pages, there is a lot of Russia stuff in here."

    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "Mueller is absolutely right that Russian interference in the election is a big deal, one that all of the government needs to organize around combating. The problem is once you dangle that glittering ball of the possibility that Donald Trump obstructed justice in the course of this investigation, all of Washington -- Republican, Democrat, media, lobbyist - - is going to focus on the question of obstruction. They're not going to focus on the interference, which is exactly what Mueller wants us to do."

    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, but the real reason that people I think are not focusing enough, or at least as much as Mueller wants them to on Russian interference is also because the president of the United States has not consistently acknowledged that it even happened. That's a big deal, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right. Mara, what is striking is that Mueller says there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy. That's how he characterizes part one. But writing in part one from volume one, page four, \"The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the Russian agency,\" or page 14, \"the investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation,\" the Russian interference operation. It was much more murky in his delivery today than it was in his own report."

And not just handing it to Democrats, maybe putting his thumb on the scale there in terms of whether he thinks impeachment proceedings are justified, which, again, I think speaks to how he did nothing to clarify matters or to save himself from increased pressure to come testify and talk more about this. The country is not about to put this behind them, but Robert Mueller behind us, or anything along those lines. And if that was the intent today, I think he just did a very poor job."

The America Bar Association in its professional conduct says \"The prosecutor in a criminal case shall refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.\" Obviously, it's a different scenario with a special counsel, but a lot of people looking at Comey and what he said about Hillary Clinton to what Mueller said about President Trump."

And I don't think Bob Mueller is Jim Comey, I don't expect him to start writing op-eds for \"The Washington Post\" attacking the president. As he said, he has done. On the other hand, by reopening this issue in the middle of the highly combustible debate over impeachment, he has inserted himself in the debate in the same way that Comey did in 2016."

But I donŸ_Tt think that it changes the underlying politics of this, which is that in Pelosi's view if you formally open impeachment hearings and it does not lead to the president's removal, you have handed him a huge victory and made it more likely that he is going to be reelected. That's what she thinks."

Pelosi is like the character in \"Game of Thrones\" who is holding the door against the zombies who are coming to impeach President Trump, because she knows that if she lets that pressure released, the political backlash might not only ensure Trump's reelection, it might cost her her majority, which is very narrow."

What I want to know is who are that Democratic Justin Amashs, and by that I mean somebody who is going against the will of their district and taking a political risk, which he is doing. He already has a primary challenge, and the president will certainly be supporting that person."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "The problem Justin Amash has, and I wouldn’t impugn his motives here, but the problem is he doesn't represent most Republicans, he doesn't represent most Americans. And I think so long as the president enjoys the support of the vast majority of Republican voters, Amash is going to be out there alone, even if there are people in his caucus who secretly do agree with them. They are not going to stick their neck out so long as President Trump's approval rating is as high as it is upon Republican voters."

      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "If you look at what they are doing right now in terms of the court, the litigation part that Pelosi talked about, it's not pursuing the Mueller report. It's going after Trump's financial records, his tax returns, the accountant, the bank statements. I believe the Democratic strategy is to continue these investigation in searching for something in perhaps in those financial records that they can then use to impeach Donald Trump, because they're not going to get it from the Mueller report."
