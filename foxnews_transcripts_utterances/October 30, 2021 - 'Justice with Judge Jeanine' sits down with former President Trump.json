Thanks so much for being with us tonight. A big show with President Trump, you'll not want to miss a second of this interview. Plus, breaking news as Alec Baldwin speaks out on camera for the first time about the death of cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. His shocking statement and the latest in the investigation. And outrage tonight as reports of a plan from the Biden administration to pay illegals separated at the border almost a half a million dollars each. The latest in this developing story on this very special edition of JUSTICE. But first we start with my exclusive sit-down with President Donald Trump in Florida where he was in great spirits and as fired up as I've ever seen him, his prediction for the Virginia gubernatorial race, his reaction to Biden's disastrous administration and so much more.

I want to take the tents -- you know the big tents that hold the equipment and the planes -- I want everything out. Getting the planes out, you just fly them into Pakistan and then take them over to our country. It is so easy. They left everything. But I remember Milley saying -- and he told me this -- and I lost a lot of respect when he said it. Sir, we'll save money if we leave the equipment. I said, save money if we leave a $50 million airplane or a $10 million dollar tank? You think we're saving money by not putting it into a plane or flying it out? I said what does that mean? Sir, it's cheaper to leave it than it is to take them. And I said that's a fool talking. When Milley said that, I lost such respect for him. I said, give it to me again. Tell me again.

I had the pipelines going, Keystone XL pipeline. Amazingly, I ended the Russian pipeline. I was not good to Russia. I got along well with Russia, I got along well with Putin, but they weren't happy with Trump. I can tell you that. But Biden opened up this big massive pipeline all over Europe, but he closed down the XL, and I have to say, because you heard it a thousand times.

It's going to follow and it's going to go a lot higher than that and Biden sent people to go see Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other members of OPEC that we need help, because we don't have enough. Now when you talk about inflation, the biggest factor in my opinion is no energy. The trucks, the factories, everything, the deliveries, the planes, everything -- it is so energy based that the energy now is so expensive to get. We don't have enough oil. You know I filled up the Strategic Reserves for almost nothing. When oil hit bottom, we had -- we were almost empty with the reserves and nobody thought of it. I said you know, this would be a great time to fill it up. We'll buy it cheap. I never got credit. I don't think anybody has ever mentioned it, but I bought 75 million barrels, I believe it was. Seventy five million barrels, which is a massive order. It was good for two things. The prices got so low that it was hurting our energy jobs, and we bought it cheap as hell and it's -- now, he wants to use that energy, that oil that I bought at a great price. It should be used in cases of emergency. He wants to now drain it so that the prices come down."

I got the vaccine done. Three vaccines in less than nine months. They said it was going to take five years and it probably wouldn't get done. I got them done and they do work, and they're great.

Now what's happened is, they're talking about one caravan, 120,000 people are going to be -- that's like an army. If you look at that front line, they look like they belong in the NFL. In fact, they should be signed some of them for the NFL. You look at -- they burst through tough Mexican Police who tried to stop them. They had no chance. We have to stop them. We can stop them, but we have to get very tough. But we cannot let -- our country is being poisoned. It is being poisoned, and you know what else? It is being poisoned also with drugs.

Baldwin faced photographers earlier today in Vermont where he and his family have been in seclusion since the deadly shooting on a movie set in New Mexico. Baldwin says he is in constant contact with Halyna Hutchins' family. He called Hutchins a close friend. Baldwin fired the fatal shot not knowing his prop gun was loaded. An investigation into the accident continues. And the race for the Virginia governor is tonight final stretch. Tuesday's outcome could test the metal of the Democratic Party going into the 2022 midterm elections.

They are horrible at destroying crime. They are letting these people that are killers go out. You look at Chicago. You look at New York what's going on with the crime in New York. New York is like a different place. Here is the good news. It could be changed, okay? You know, otherwise, it would be so sad. You wouldn't even want to talk about it, but what's happened to New York -- de Blasio is the worst mayor. It is filthy dirty. People are living on Park Avenue. They're living in tents on the most incredible streets where people come from all over the world and they pay tax, which gives our police the money. They have to refund the police they have to give the police more money, but what's happening in New York and what's happening in Chicago where 88 people were shot last month and six died.

You are owed nothing by the American taxpayer, like I said, but a deportation and a removal notice. Every American should be so lividly angry with this.

This is nothing more than blood money to the ACLU and these unions. Criminals getting profit by crossing over the border and will create a magnet for others to cross the border. They wouldn't pull this stunt during the Trump administration, they're doing it right now on the Biden administration because the Biden administration is pro-illegal immigration.

And you know what they're giving that money for, guys? They're giving them money for anxiety, fear of strangers, and nightmares. Excuse me. Did they not travel 2,000 miles on foot with coyotes? Suffering all kinds of injuries and injustices? And they're going to get more money now that they're living in America, in the land of the free and the cornucopia that we provide for them than some of the families of the 9/11 victims whose family members were killed? So they come here, I guarantee they're not going to pay taxes. I'm outraged by this thing. I am so furious about this when hard-working Americans are simply trying to make a living. All right, let's talk about Virginia. Tomi, the election is on Tuesday. We've got, you know, we've got McAuliffe like parents have no right to get involved in their kids' education and we've got Youngkin. What do you think?"

Now parents, whether they voted for Donald Trump or Joe Biden they have one thing in common, they want the best education for their children and they're going to stand up for that education and that school environment, so they made a horrible decision weaponizing the Justice Department against parents. And we know that this is playing out before our eyes and Virginia is a perfect example of this. This is going to be a litmus test for the nation. I think we're going to see a great victory for Republicans and it's going to usher us into the midterms and then right into 2024, we take back the white house and make America great again."

As a former teacher, every parent has the right to be concerned about their kid's curriculum. You can talk about the Democrats who are trying to deny parents the right to see and review the curriculum, plus this critical race theory, which is outright pure racism. The Virginia parents speak for every parent in this country because as Tomi said, education is the key to breaking the poverty cycle and more importantly, the education is the key for advancement in this great country.

We largely turned away from Cuomo, we turned away from his brother. The best thing that they could do is to both disappear off the radar in shame, but they are too narcissistic to do that. So whether he is charged or not, I have a feeling that we're going to be seeing him much more often. This is how the Democrats operate.

      "utterance": "I am not asking that. I am just asking a simple question, was it a prop gun or a real gun, do you know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "I think it's a real gun."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so, we've got live ammunition in a real gun. We've got a cart that is brought out and Alec Baldwin takes it and he shoots. You have been on 600 movie sets as an armorer. Tell me all the mistakes that are made from the get-go in terms of this gun."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "Well, the fact that the guns were never checked properly. They were never laid out unloaded. The ammo should be been out also, and it should have all been blanks, obviously. I don't know where the armorer was the first AD just grabbed the gun, which never happens and handed it to Mr. Baldwin without -- and he says, he checked it, but obviously, it wasn't a very thorough check if he did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, so when you say first AD, we are talking about Dave Halls, and the armorer here is this Hannah Gutierrez-Reed who is the daughter of a very famous armorer. She is only 24 years old, and there were several mishaps we heard about on this set. Are you familiar with what those mishaps with the gun were?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "I think there were negligent discharges of the gun. In other words, it went off when it wasn't supposed to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Right. Right. And that's twice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so now, the fact that there is a live round in this gun that's a real gun, why is it even pointed at an individual when I think the rules are, you should be 20 feet away and never point at an individual."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "You are correct, Judge. I believe that this was rehearsal and I think they were lining up a shot where in the shot Mr. Baldwin was supposed to be pointing the gun right off of camera."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so the problem is the camera is held by a human being. This isn't a remotely controlled camera. So we've got him close, within 20 feet. We have got him with a real gun with live ammunition and we have also got him with this drawback. So, he has got a gun. He has got to pull the hammer and pull the trigger in order for that gun to shoot. Am I correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "You are correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, so there is a lot of actions, and we don't know quite exactly what the role of Alec Baldwin here. We know he is the executive producer, but isn't the executive producer involved in the hiring of security and safety?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "Not necessarily. Sometimes that falls to just a line producer or the UPM. He may not have been involved."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, and what about the fact that in the eyes of law enforcement, they have got three people at the very least in their sight right now -- within their sights, and there is a crime of negligent possession of a gun, I believe. It's a misdemeanor in New Mexico. Who could get charged with that, Mike?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "I believe the armorer could get charged, the first AD could get charged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Dave Halls."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "Yes, Dave Halls. He could get charged. I don't know about Mr. Baldwin because he was told it was a cold gun, in movie terms that's an empty gun."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, Mike, we don't have much time. Thank you so much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRISTANO",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Judge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, next, a Halloween surprise with some unexpected and furry visitors right here in my studio. Don't go anywhere, the chaos is about to begin and you're going to love it, I promise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And finally, tonight, you all know that I was heartbroken when my little Prince Lancelot passed to join Mikimoto at the Rainbow Bridge. Stella and I were very depressed and I decided the only way to resolve this was to get another dog. But instead, I got brothers, Red and Ted. They are inseparable. In fact, they are very separated from Stella who has buyer's remorse, but things always work out in the end with the brothers. And now the three of them are here to celebrate Halloween. Turn around, Ted, say -- this is Red, this is Ted. Ted, turn around they need to see your hat. Excuse me. Ted, turn around. Turn around, Ted. Turn around. Okay. All right, and this is Stella, who is very laid back as you can see. Stella stand up, she is very -- I didn't say lay back, I said stand up, Stella. Anyway, I hope you have a great Halloween.
