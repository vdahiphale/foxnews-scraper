I said General, it is a bad deal here. I got leather shoes on the bottom. And I'm going to fall, I'm not going to let them if I'm not. So I walk down tiny little steps. What's wrong with the President is the biggest story? Normally they have like some little groups. Nothing was like an ice skating rink. I think it was a trap.

      "sentences": "You know, we don't deserve him. But that wasn't the big news. The big news you didn't hear because it doesn't align with the legacy media's highbrow corruption infused narrative. According to the FBI, there was scant evidence the January 6th capital riot was part of a plot to overturn the election. We knew that, you knew that. All it took was one look at the role playing insurrectionist to tell you. They were more interested in organizing a game of Dungeons and Dragons than a government coup. There was far more evidence to overturn the election on Hunter Biden's laptop. But it didn't lead any newscasts because like one of Hunter lap -- Hunter's laptops. It was one of those stories that just disappears. For seven months, hacks lectured us on the big lie. Hacks you've been wrong more times than Chris Cuomo playing patty cake. Oh, they screamed insurrection every day. It being worse than 9/11 or the Civil War combined. Except it was preplanned as Biden's evacuation of Kabul. Yes, well, Biden yakked on and on about evil Trumpers. He completely bypassed a mass evacuation of Americans and allies, fearing it would signal the imminent collapse of the Afghan government, which is kind of exactly what happened. The collapse of the Afghan government as well as Biden's presidency. So like his spouse has been cheated on. We've been lied to an awful lot about masks, inflation, law enforcement, China, race, whether our president has enough mental capacity to dress himself. And God forbid we question it. From morning Hello to Don Suck a Lemon. They reserved their disdain for you, the person who dare question the liars. Meanwhile, these cretins, hobnob with the real liars. How some of them most meatheaded are related to the liars? This swirling swamp mixture of media and government elites gave us Afghanistan, as well as bedridden Grandpa Joe from Willy Wonka, who's now our president. And what are they really trying to cover up besides our maskless faces and their own asses? The realization that they covered up a mess of a war so that it would continue. We've been part of a divisive game they created to keep us powerless. It's us versus us. So it's never us versus them. The construct of Democrat and Republican as distinct leadership's turns out to be as fake as the teeth in the President's mouth. Afghanistan's a perfect example. In overwhelming majority of left and right wanted us out. The war is the only thing less popular than Chrissy Teigen. Yet it lasted 20 years. Even the Spice Girls couldn't last that long. They tried. And it was made possible by the lie that our -- that since our politicians were behind it we had to be too. And maybe for a year or two or three, we were. But after that we filed it away is something our competent government is taking care of which is like trusting your kids with Uncle Hunter for the weekend. Oddly we were putting our trust in institutions run by mouth breathing morons who hate you. George W. Bush's CIA Director General Michael Hayden retweeted a photo labeling Trump supporters, our Taliban and replied, good idea when a Twitter user suggested sending the quote MAGA wearing unvaxxed on planes to Afghanistan. That's (BLEEP) among an aristocracy of that Now President Biden is pretending that he was always saying this was a bad war, a war that he backed strongly. Someone needs to put smelling salts in a pretty woman's hair. So when Biden sniffs it, he wakes up to reality. But a president before him was different. That was Trump. He said it before he even was president. He knew it was becoming a waste of blood and treasure these foreign wars. So once again, Biden is like that student that cheats off the smarter kid sitting next to him, and yet he still gets an F. But the swamp didn't care. So Biden came along like an untrained magician and pulled out the tablecloth from under the table --from out from the table falsely thinking everything laid on top would magically stay in place. But that can only be done by someone who knows what they're doing. Now the Taliban is giving us a deadline. Seriously, how is it up to them? But maybe with the clowns we have in power. They are.",

Apparently he made inappropriate remarks about Jews, women and other groups on a podcast in 2013 and 2014, which are dug up by a writer for theringer.com. That's got to be the worst thing a man named Michael Richards have ever said in public. Am I right? Please, said Rich, what's with that name? Richards in his statement said \"It is humbling to confront a terribly embarrassing moment of his judgment.\" Thoughtlessness and insensitivity from nearly a decade ago. Looking back now there is no excuse. Of course for the comments I made on this podcast that I am deeply sorry. Richards did tape a few episodes as hosts and they'll air next month. And for now he'll remain his executive producer. As for the new host. LeVar Burton seems to be the internet's choice. He's a decent pick I guess. My vote is for Betty White, but she'll never pass because of a racist name. But if you -- if you look hard enough, you can find something terrible from everyone's past.

      "utterance": "You know, we don't deserve him. But that wasn't the big news. The big news you didn't hear because it doesn't align with the legacy media's highbrow corruption infused narrative. According to the FBI, there was scant evidence the January 6th capital riot was part of a plot to overturn the election. We knew that, you knew that. All it took was one look at the role playing insurrectionist to tell you. They were more interested in organizing a game of Dungeons and Dragons than a government coup. There was far more evidence to overturn the election on Hunter Biden's laptop. But it didn't lead any newscasts because like one of Hunter lap -- Hunter's laptops. It was one of those stories that just disappears. For seven months, hacks lectured us on the big lie. Hacks you've been wrong more times than Chris Cuomo playing patty cake. Oh, they screamed insurrection every day. It being worse than 9/11 or the Civil War combined. Except it was preplanned as Biden's evacuation of Kabul. Yes, well, Biden yakked on and on about evil Trumpers. He completely bypassed a mass evacuation of Americans and allies, fearing it would signal the imminent collapse of the Afghan government, which is kind of exactly what happened. The collapse of the Afghan government as well as Biden's presidency. So like his spouse has been cheated on. We've been lied to an awful lot about masks, inflation, law enforcement, China, race, whether our president has enough mental capacity to dress himself. And God forbid we question it. From morning Hello to Don Suck a Lemon. They reserved their disdain for you, the person who dare question the liars. Meanwhile, these cretins, hobnob with the real liars. How some of them most meatheaded are related to the liars? This swirling swamp mixture of media and government elites gave us Afghanistan, as well as bedridden Grandpa Joe from Willy Wonka, who's now our president. And what are they really trying to cover up besides our maskless faces and their own asses? The realization that they covered up a mess of a war so that it would continue. We've been part of a divisive game they created to keep us powerless. It's us versus us. So it's never us versus them. The construct of Democrat and Republican as distinct leadership's turns out to be as fake as the teeth in the President's mouth. Afghanistan's a perfect example. In overwhelming majority of left and right wanted us out. The war is the only thing less popular than Chrissy Teigen. Yet it lasted 20 years. Even the Spice Girls couldn't last that long. They tried. And it was made possible by the lie that our -- that since our politicians were behind it we had to be too. And maybe for a year or two or three, we were. But after that we filed it away is something our competent government is taking care of which is like trusting your kids with Uncle Hunter for the weekend. Oddly we were putting our trust in institutions run by mouth breathing morons who hate you. George W. Bush's CIA Director General Michael Hayden retweeted a photo labeling Trump supporters, our Taliban and replied, good idea when a Twitter user suggested sending the quote MAGA wearing unvaxxed on planes to Afghanistan. That's (BLEEP) among an aristocracy of that Now President Biden is pretending that he was always saying this was a bad war, a war that he backed strongly. Someone needs to put smelling salts in a pretty woman's hair. So when Biden sniffs it, he wakes up to reality. But a president before him was different. That was Trump. He said it before he even was president. He knew it was becoming a waste of blood and treasure these foreign wars. So once again, Biden is like that student that cheats off the smarter kid sitting next to him, and yet he still gets an F. But the swamp didn't care. So Biden came along like an untrained magician and pulled out the tablecloth from under the table --from out from the table falsely thinking everything laid on top would magically stay in place. But that can only be done by someone who knows what they're doing. Now the Taliban is giving us a deadline. Seriously, how is it up to them? But maybe with the clowns we have in power. They are."

Apparently he made inappropriate remarks about Jews, women and other groups on a podcast in 2013 and 2014, which are dug up by a writer for theringer.com. That's got to be the worst thing a man named Michael Richards have ever said in public. Am I right? Please, said Rich, what's with that name? Richards in his statement said \"It is humbling to confront a terribly embarrassing moment of his judgment.\" Thoughtlessness and insensitivity from nearly a decade ago. Looking back now there is no excuse. Of course for the comments I made on this podcast that I am deeply sorry. Richards did tape a few episodes as hosts and they'll air next month. And for now he'll remain his executive producer. As for the new host. LeVar Burton seems to be the internet's choice. He's a decent pick I guess. My vote is for Betty White, but she'll never pass because of a racist name. But if you -- if you look hard enough, you can find something terrible from everyone's past.

As a successful black conservative, Elder defies every stereotype the race hustlers need to advance their toxic agenda.

To normal people, that means the leftist boobs, there's that word, who've run California into the ground are getting scared. Gavin Newsom's hanging on by one hair gel slicked hand.

A new study finds that mothers with young kids were drinking 323 percent more between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year. I'd give a more precise figure but I was drunk too. Bottom line drinking was up across the board in 2020 but spiked the most with moms who had kids under five. Researchers even interviewed one mother who had been boozing so much that she had no idea that the pandemic even existed. We went to her for comment."

First of all, I want to know of the 323 percent increase how many of those functioning alcoholic moms which by the way, there's nothing wrong with that. A is for quitters. And I have a random list that I don't have time to go through as to why I drink as much as I do. I want to know if those functioning alcoholic moms had working husbands at home because that number would have tripled easily from my professional opinion. Because if my husband would get out of my basement, I probably would drink. Well, I'd still drink but maybe not 323 percent more."

They can't say that, it's the drunk wife making us do all the chores in the house and yelling at us because they were going to be prom queen, and they had big plans and they ended up with you.
