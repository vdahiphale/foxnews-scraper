      "sentences": "They are having fun. Come on! Doesn't that look fun? Sad to see President Obama go because he echoed their worldview. As Samuel Jackson said, he had that Hollywood cool factor. Let's face it. Trump, even though he had a hit show with 'The Apprentice,' he was never really part of their world because on some key issues he thought differently, and he dared to speak up. When so many in the entertainment arena put all their money, their chips on Hillary, they raised so much money like Clooney and Anna Wintour. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's face it, when Trump was elected, they were embarrassed and furious. Most of the entertainment and sports in crowds, they see from supporters as either ignorant, racist, or bible-thumping fanatics. George Clooney to his credit put blame where it belongs, on Hillary. He told 'The Daily Beast' after she lost, 'It was frustrating because I never saw her elevator game. I never saw it. And I had a lot of liberal friends who were like she's not good at this.' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, I agree, George. Let's face it, top-tier celebs surrounded by P.R. people, managers, agents, and millions of adoring fans, they can get pretty used to coasting on political cliches. They are used to dishing it out against conservatives. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sometimes in the vilest of terms without ever having to explain themselves and without ever getting called on it. So, when celebs wade into politics as we are seeing today with Jennifer Lawrence and George Clooney, they win fans on their political side, but then they can alienate many more. You think of what happened, for instance, when the NFL's Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem. What happened was he spurred other players to do the same. Then the NFL lost tens of millions of dollars in advertising revenue during the regular season as viewership took a sizable hit and attendance was down. People were furious. So, if too heavily infected by politics, the sports, stage and screen, they kind of just become like everything else in Washington, nasty and polarizing. Call me crazy, but I think we need more, not fewer places where we can gather, cheer, and even boo without worrying about politics. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Everyone has the right to speak their mind, but stars on screen and those on the field should know that when they practice hate hateful political vitriol they are likely to get some pushback just like the rest of us in politics or political analysis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, now it's your turn, Clooney and Jennifer Lawrence. Why don't you explain beyond just epithets or bromides, cliches, or sometimes maybe insults, your own ideas on how to grow the economy, how to increase the standard of living for the poor and middle-class Americans, how to decrease violence and drug addictions. You see, if you really want to get into the political ring, really, you can't just talk to your fans or even write a check. You need to be daring enough to go into unfamiliar and even hostile territory and answer tough questions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Think about Oprah, maybe for a millisecond she mulled dipping her toe into the political pond, then she quickly pulled it out. If there were rumors of Kid Rock running for the Senate. Rumors that \"The Rock\" may hit the trail. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now Clooney, who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, good on him for earning that cash, he is shoveling money at gun control. It's his right to do that. But as Democrats watch, worry and hope that someone is there next Obama, maybe even Clooney because he is the star with a killer smile and a cool factor, it got to think about what the repercussions will be. Our celebrities really the best candidates? Celebrities that are not quite Ronald Reagan, because remember he was an actor and people say Laura, you worked for Reagan, don't you have a double standard here? No, no, no. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's true I did work for President Reagan, I'm a Reagan conservative, but remember what he did. He spent at least two decades studying, reading, debating anyone who would debate him and writing on politics. He was masterful. He was a successful two-term governor of California. He ran for president in 1976. He lost the nomination by a hair and then had to come clawing his way back four years later to change politics forever. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It did not happen overnight. He didn't just write a check or launch into insults against his opponent. He did more than just drive by hits on his political adversaries or just raised money for his political friends. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think what most of these celebrities will find out is that the talents that make them megastars, acting, sports, or music, don't always translate into politics, at least not without a lot of really hard work. And you can't just issue ad hominem attacks on your political opponents without making a substantive argument at some point. Politics is not ease coverage on the red carpet. There's also a big downside for people in need of adoration. In today's environment, the moment you enter politics, national politics, let's face it, you alienate half the country. Millions of people will instantly dislike you. Many will hate you. Others will lie about you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Still others, just to elevate themselves and win back power will say vile and hateful things that are demonstrably false. Let's face this, most celebrities have no desire to risk their cushy lives to really make that up big time in politics. Thinking about it, the only one I can remember post-Reagan who did this is the one celeb, also a businessman like Clooney, that they are now vilifying 24/7, and that's THE ANGLE. Joining us now with reaction, actor, Antonio Sabato Jr., Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney, and Lauren Wright, a Princeton University professor who is examining the issue of celebrities in politics. It's great to see both of you -- all of you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Antonio, I want to start with you on this. This is pretty wild. Jennifer Lawrence, you don't get any bigger than she is as a star of the big screen. She announces today she's taking a year off and she's going to devote all of her time to a nonpartisan group. She insists that it's only about corruption. What do you say? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This is a really big issue. Nobody wants to step in feces. I have children, I don't want to do that either. I don't like finding used needles.

After all, they had helped her husband, who had been a very successful two-term president, minus that impeachment thing, and stayed in the Lincoln bedroom, they flocked to the White House Correspondents Dinner. It was all hunky-dory. But Hollywood was cut out of the picture under George W. and Hollywood mocked him endlessly and viciously. So, when the most left-wing president ever was elected, Barack Obama, it was nirvana for all those entertainers who had felt disrespected and offended by the very existence of Bush and certainly of conservatives.

      "utterance": "They are having fun. Come on! Doesn't that look fun? Sad to see President Obama go because he echoed their worldview. As Samuel Jackson said, he had that Hollywood cool factor. Let's face it. Trump, even though he had a hit show with 'The Apprentice,' he was never really part of their world because on some key issues he thought differently, and he dared to speak up. When so many in the entertainment arena put all their money, their chips on Hillary, they raised so much money like Clooney and Anna Wintour. Let's face it, when Trump was elected, they were embarrassed and furious. Most of the entertainment and sports in crowds, they see from supporters as either ignorant, racist, or bible-thumping fanatics. George Clooney to his credit put blame where it belongs, on Hillary. He told 'The Daily Beast' after she lost, 'It was frustrating because I never saw her elevator game. I never saw it. And I had a lot of liberal friends who were like she's not good at this.' Well, I agree, George. Let's face it, top-tier celebs surrounded by P.R. people, managers, agents, and millions of adoring fans, they can get pretty used to coasting on political cliches. They are used to dishing it out against conservatives. Sometimes in the vilest of terms without ever having to explain themselves and without ever getting called on it. So, when celebs wade into politics as we are seeing today with Jennifer Lawrence and George Clooney, they win fans on their political side, but then they can alienate many more. You think of what happened, for instance, when the NFL's Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem. What happened was he spurred other players to do the same. Then the NFL lost tens of millions of dollars in advertising revenue during the regular season as viewership took a sizable hit and attendance was down. People were furious. So, if too heavily infected by politics, the sports, stage and screen, they kind of just become like everything else in Washington, nasty and polarizing. Call me crazy, but I think we need more, not fewer places where we can gather, cheer, and even boo without worrying about politics. Everyone has the right to speak their mind, but stars on screen and those on the field should know that when they practice hate hateful political vitriol they are likely to get some pushback just like the rest of us in politics or political analysis. Well, now it's your turn, Clooney and Jennifer Lawrence. Why don't you explain beyond just epithets or bromides, cliches, or sometimes maybe insults, your own ideas on how to grow the economy, how to increase the standard of living for the poor and middle-class Americans, how to decrease violence and drug addictions. You see, if you really want to get into the political ring, really, you can't just talk to your fans or even write a check. You need to be daring enough to go into unfamiliar and even hostile territory and answer tough questions. Think about Oprah, maybe for a millisecond she mulled dipping her toe into the political pond, then she quickly pulled it out. If there were rumors of Kid Rock running for the Senate. Rumors that \"The Rock\" may hit the trail. Now Clooney, who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, good on him for earning that cash, he is shoveling money at gun control. It's his right to do that. But as Democrats watch, worry and hope that someone is there next Obama, maybe even Clooney because he is the star with a killer smile and a cool factor, it got to think about what the repercussions will be. Our celebrities really the best candidates? Celebrities that are not quite Ronald Reagan, because remember he was an actor and people say Laura, you worked for Reagan, don't you have a double standard here? No, no, no. It's true I did work for President Reagan, I'm a Reagan conservative, but remember what he did. He spent at least two decades studying, reading, debating anyone who would debate him and writing on politics. He was masterful. He was a successful two-term governor of California. He ran for president in 1976. He lost the nomination by a hair and then had to come clawing his way back four years later to change politics forever. It did not happen overnight. He didn't just write a check or launch into insults against his opponent. He did more than just drive by hits on his political adversaries or just raised money for his political friends. I think what most of these celebrities will find out is that the talents that make them megastars, acting, sports, or music, don't always translate into politics, at least not without a lot of really hard work. And you can't just issue ad hominem attacks on your political opponents without making a substantive argument at some point. Politics is not ease coverage on the red carpet. There's also a big downside for people in need of adoration. In today's environment, the moment you enter politics, national politics, let's face it, you alienate half the country. Millions of people will instantly dislike you. Many will hate you. Others will lie about you. Still others, just to elevate themselves and win back power will say vile and hateful things that are demonstrably false. Let's face this, most celebrities have no desire to risk their cushy lives to really make that up big time in politics. Thinking about it, the only one I can remember post-Reagan who did this is the one celeb, also a businessman like Clooney, that they are now vilifying 24/7, and that's THE ANGLE. Joining us now with reaction, actor, Antonio Sabato Jr., Harmeet Dhillon, a civil rights attorney, and Lauren Wright, a Princeton University professor who is examining the issue of celebrities in politics. It's great to see both of you -- all of you. Antonio, I want to start with you on this. This is pretty wild. Jennifer Lawrence, you don't get any bigger than she is as a star of the big screen. She announces today she's taking a year off and she's going to devote all of her time to a nonpartisan group. She insists that it's only about corruption. What do you say?"

But let's face it, how are you going to help the community? Are you really going to get involved in politics? Are you really going to go out there and talk about the issues that we are dealing with, especially in California? Homelessness skyrocketing, we are number one in that department. Regulations, taxes. If you go to San Francisco now it's unwatchable what they've done what liberals have done to that city and especially Los Angeles as well. So, are we going to talk about the issues to American people, are we going to help the veterans? What are we actually doing here we just going to blame everything on the president as usual?"

You feel it now and I'm saying this because Trump is actually winning on the issues. You see the popularity of the tax cut today, a new poll out. Majority of Americans like what they are seeing. The economy is generally getting better. People are less stressed, business confidence way up. They are looking for the next Obama and maybe it's Oprah, maybe it's Clooney, a combination, maybe it's a new person. So, they lurched to the celebrity, yet when they are hit even remotely criticized, they go bananas. They've never been criticized in their lives.

Celebrities in Hollywood, they put all of their chips on Clinton and then when she lost they were kind of at a loss, and they live in a shallow world that it's all about their appearances and so they haven't really been able to cope very well. When anyone challenges their worldview, they lash out with this incredible vitriol and bitterness, as you mentioned. It's really the last refuge year of what is acceptable criticism and oppressive violence in our culture today. It is against conservatives and particularly conservative women who speak up on behalf of conservative values in this country that got Donald Trump and other conservatives elected. Sarah Palin if fair game. You are fair game. Ann Coulter is fair game, Michelle Malcolm, all of these people who challenged the orthodoxy of Hollywood have all come in for threats of rape, violence, the most horrible things are said about you and other women and it is accepted in Hollywood. I have a theory, I think that sometimes these Hollywood stars get into these projects like Jennifer Lawrence, who is 27 years old, knows nothing about going state house to state house to get legislation passed. I think that's an admirable goal, but it's a joke if you think it's easy as memorizing lines or taking your clothes off on TV, but I think they do that because some of the violence and some of the very negative things that they perpetrate in society that is coarsening our society. A lot of what you see out of Hollywood is not positive."

They were worried specifically about people getting involved in politics and getting elected especially who were practicing and what they call the little arts of popularity, fame in other words. So, I think what we have to watch for is celebrities are running for office for themselves, not advocating for other people, because they are masters at garnering support on their own behalf. They are not so good as we can see from the research that we have had advocating for other people."

Antonio, I know you give a lot of speeches. Talking is one thing, but actually getting involved in the nitty-gritty of legislation, policy proposals, that is kind of the drudgery of politics. I've never written legislation. I wouldn't know the first thing about how to write legislation. I've been doing this for about 30 years now. I've learned a little bit. But what about the atmosphere right now in Hollywood, Antonio. You've talked about it, the lack of ideological diversity -- or I would say even curiosity about people with whom they disagree."

She was able to raise over a billion dollars for her campaign and look at the scandals, look at the things she's done. Benghazi being one of them. How could you vote for a person like that? So, I think at this point we need to have people in Hollywood who are going to stand up for the Constitution and stand up for the great laws we have in this country. Not for themselves. So, I want to step up. My campaign is about the people. It's not about myself. I left Hollywood to work for the American people. That's my concern. My community (inaudible), District 26.

Trump is mostly a businessman. He did \"The Apprentice,\" that was hugely successful. But he's mostly a businessman until he got involved in \"The Apprentice\" stuff. Clooney is a star. He's a big star. I just don't see George Clooney giving up his life to just be another politician hitting the trail. He has a lot of fun doing what he does. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know."

But I don't think the politicians think about the downside. When you look at some of the Hollywood people were coming out of the woodwork the last couple of days, it tends to be people who are kind of on the down slope. You've got Ellen Pompeo came out and said some negative things and threaten violence against you, I believe. I thought she was retired. I didn't even believe her career was still going. This is one like to get it alive. Michael Rappaport, who lost his job recently and using vile threats attack people on Twitter is a way to get celebrity back for these people. It's cheap. It's fleeting and ultimately, it's not going to make a difference in our society. We need to look for leaders who are more substantive."

To meet guns with the bad guys had guns and I was happy the cops had more guns. But I'm going to put my cards on the table. I am a D.C. firearm licensed citizen. I couldn't have this a decade ago until a man named Heller sued Washington, D.C., and won. But in that, Scalia, who I think we can all agree it was conservative, he said there are limits to the Second Amendment. You can't tell people they can have guns, but you can put reasonable prohibitions on guns. It's hard to for me to understand how bump stocks -- we've been on air for a minute and 50 seconds. Stephen Paddock held that trigger for 11 minutes straight. We will sit here for maybe 5 more minutes. Imagine a machine gun going off into a crowd killing 58 people. That was a bumps stock.

What actually would work is what Candidate Donald Trump used to talk about, and that was repealing gun free zones so that the good people can shoot back at the bad people and unfortunately, we didn't have that there in Florida.

Up next we're going to show you how they turned a beautiful city into a rancid garbage dump. Don't go away."

According to a survey by a local news station, Bay Area NBC's investigation of 153 city blocks including popular tourist spots found trashed on every block, 300 piles of feces on 96 blocks, lovely, 100 discarded hypodermic needles on 41 blocks. That's all. So this is a sanctuary city, is it? Here's a local deli owner. He's fed up."

Not exactly a paradise for businesses or workers. Joining us now in San Francisco, San Francisco Republican Party vice chair Ken Loo is also a commissioner with the BART police-citizen review board, an Ethan Bearman, a political commentator and Bay Area radio host. Ethan, I love San Francisco. I love it. I have family there. I have friends there. I've been going for a long time. It has a major problem. And I don't care if you're a democrat, Republican, or somewhere in between, it's not getting better, it seems to be getting worse. What do you think?"

      "utterance": "It's true. It is problematic. I will say that under Mayor Ed Lee, who recently passed away, we produced a number of veterans who are homeless in the city of San Francisco. We are taking an approach. But remember, we are being handcuffed by a number of laws that prohibit the ability of taking care of people with mental health issues and making them get the psychiatric care that they need, getting them the addictive care. We allow people under the guise of civil liberties to be free and not put them in places to get the help that they need to protect and help themselves, let alone others, and allow them to become contributing members of society again. This is a really big issue. Nobody wants to step in feces. I have children, I don't want to do that either. I don't like finding used needles. But there are approaches and the city is trying, but we actually need some federal help in this case, in my opinion, because a lot of the homeless are not from San Francisco. They come because they are not going to freeze to death when we are having a cold snap, unlike the rest of the country."

But this is supposed to be the progressive paradise of San Francisco. It's a super Democrat majority, the board of supervisors for years -- going back to Gavin Newsom when he tried to get rid of the cash -- remember the cash for the homeless? He wanted to do the vouchers. They fought him back then. He was my first guest, by the way, on my radio show that I ever had 17 years ago, it was Gavin Newsom. But to me it's gotten worse and worse even with some modest improvements around the edges. Go ahead. I think we are having -- are we having audio problems?"

      "utterance": "Yes. So San Francisco hasn't had a Republican elected to office for multiple decades now. So one of the problems that we have seen in terms of the homeless year can't be attributed to the Republicans at all in San Francisco, simply because we don't have a single Republican elected to office representing San Francisco. The homeless epidemic that we have right here is just getting worse. In fact, every year -- I was born here in San Francisco and I can see progressively every year the problem has been getting worse and worse every year with no solutions. I've met with multiple board of supervisor members here in San Francisco, and they just keep asking for more money. When they ask for more money it is basically rewarding a program that doesn't have any benchmarks. There is no solution in their solution is to just throw more money at the problem."

      "utterance": "Ken, what they're also doing is declaring themselves year after year, we are a sanctuary city, we're a sanctuary state. We see the problem in Orange County, we see the problem in L.A. We have tent cities in both places, and we are bringing more people into the situation. More people who are indigent and themselves are without jobs and a way to support themselves. So I don't see how the sanctuary status of San Francisco or the state is doing anybody any favors. Ethan and Ken, great segment, thank you so much. There's a lot to get through on this and we're going to have to have to talk about creative solutions that don't just require a big huge piles of federal money. That's not going to work. And the mainstream media is begging us to listen to the kids on gun control. What we're going to tell you what they are not doing with another kids group who also have a very, very large presence, next."

      "utterance": "Of course teens who have survived a mass shooting have every right to express themselves and be heard. That's America and that's a good thing. But I can't help but notice that the media has a little double standard problem here. Considering the longest running annual march in U.S. history called the March for Life. That's that pro-life event that draws hundreds of thousands of people to Washington every January. By the way, it's usually in the bitter cold or rotten weather. There's no gauzy features or extended interviews about this march in the media, and of course journalists conveniently ignore the fact that the pro-life movement is winning. 'The Washington Post' was recently astonished to discover in 2017 a Quinnipiac poll that found 18-34-year-olds were the second most likely age group to oppose late-term abortions. So let's say we give those had some mention as well and maybe a little empathy, or at least a little fair coverage. That would be nice. The kids count, that means all of their views. Stay with us."

They get almost no media coverage. I'm glad they got media coverage today for the kids going to Tallahassee, but the press is abysmally unfair. All kids' voices count, you bet. We'll see you back here tomorrow night."
