      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. One swamp to the other. Welcome to “Hannity.” if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today is day 35 of the Democrats' secret Soviet-style impeachment coup attempt, although it's really been their goal -- think about it -- from the day that you, we the people, elected Donald Trump as president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Breaking just moments ago, the Democratic Party may be starting to fracture. Look at this -- at least one Democratic congresswoman now reportedly planning to oppose his party's latest, unfair -- which we'll explain -- impeachment measure. We'll have a full report tonight from Capitol Hill. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, another day of secret meeting, secret hearings, secret transcripts, a secret whistle-blower, non-whistle-blower, hearsay whistle- blower, all because of a phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. But, tonight, let me just cut to the chase here. None of this really in truth matters. The fake whistle-blowers' thoughts, their feelings, they don't matter. Anonymous sources don't matter. Witnesses to the phone call, they don't matter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } None of this circus that Democrats are now dragging the entire country through matters because we have the actual transcript. It is public and it shows zero, none, no misconduct whatsoever by the president. The transcript not only exonerates the president but it clearly features a president of the United States upholding his sworn duty to execute the laws of the United States and investigate foreign election interference. So, nothing the Democrats have supposedly cared about for three years all of a sudden matters. By the way, there was even a court decision in Ukraine and that found that their government interfered in our 2016 elections in an effort to help Hillary Rodham Clinton. I thought Democrats cared about foreign interference in our elections. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to a very credible report from \"Politico's\" January 11, 2017, they went into specificity and detail about how Ukraine worked in concert with the DNC in 2016 to smear Donald Trump and help elect Hillary Clinton. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, the DNC literally colluded with Ukraine, how ironic, to help Clinton win and to hurt Donald Trump. Now, asking a country, in this case Ukraine, to cooperate in an investigation, that's actually not a crime. It's not bribery, not a misdemeanor, it's certainly not treason. It's actually the president's job to faithfully uphold and execute the laws of the land. That is his oath, that is his constitutional obligation. But the leader now of this new witch hunt, we have the corrupt, compromise, coward, congenital liar, Adam Schiff. He wants you to believe something much different. Schiff, who won't come on their show to defend himself, he goes on every other show, has zero fidelity to truth. He is a pathetic liar. And for three years, he has worshiped at the altar of his impeachment lies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's constant lies. He's got all the evidence we would ever need about Russia, Russia, Russia collusion. It was a hoax and conspiracy, lies, didn't work out. Now, let's try Ukraine. It's evolving narratives, they're now calling it. In other words, you have the coward Schiff trying really hard to get his lies straight. Remember, first, according to Schiff, there were multiple, direct quid pro quos from the president's call with Ukrainian president. And the president released the transcript. That proved to be a lie, too, that allegation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And when Ukraine's president and their foreign minister both said they felt zero pressure whatsoever -- well, then, there's Schiff, he claimed it was some kind of behind the scenes effort then to shake down Ukraine over time by withholding aid. But what we found out the money was actually released without any conditions whatsoever, and that the Ukrainian government didn't even know that the money was delayed at the time of the call, Schiff had to change his narrative again, calling in witness after witness but only behind closed doors, without real Republican due process at all to speculate on the president's intentions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know what -- you know who hasn't testified? Interesting. They're not talking anymore about the so-called whistle-blower non-whistle-blower, who started the entire process. Now, why is it? Because Schiff's office we now know was in contact, apparently even advising him from the very beginning. Now, Republicans, if we ever get that guy under oath, well, they'll be asking a lot of questions about that and that guy supported Joe Biden. Now, they told him apparently, according to reports, to get a lawyer. They encouraged him to file a complaint with the inspector general. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that means Schiff is a fact witness in the case. He blatantly lied about this coordination as we have proven on TV. Schiff is compromised. He's a fact witness in the case in which he is now presiding. He should recuse himself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He is compromised, corrupt, a coward, and a congenital liar. That's who's leading the new witch hunt. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, today, when Democrats said they were alarmed -- they were alarmed by the testimony of Alexander Vindman, a national security expert -- I understand -- a war hero, thank you, sir, for serving our country. He was on the phone call. But the problem is, keep in mind, the Democrats' interpretation of his interpretation of the phone call. But we don't need his interpretation because we have the transcript. It doesn't matter, frankly -- with all due respect, and I mean that sincerely -- what he or anybody else thinks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's all feigned outrage. They're acting -- wow -- somebody else interpreted it the sick way we do or the corrupt way we do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK. Well, that's their interpretation but it's a matter of law. Even the Department of Justice investigation concluded today, no conclusion. There was nothing wrong, nothing illegal about the president's call. But the corrupt Democrats, they could not care less. You have Schiff. You have Pelosi. They are now ready for phase two of their impeachment coup attempt. And today, they cooked up a resolution, I've got it right here in front of me, it's not worth the paper that is printed on, I wasted paper. I hurt trees in the process. That would make their coup proceedings public. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One big catch, when you actually read the document, which I have done, well, there is one huge, massive, gigantic caveat that the compromised congenital liar Adam Schiff and his fellow Democrats, they actually can veto any Republican attempts to call witnesses, subpoena evidence, and pretty much anything else. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They need the compromised Schiff's approval for everything, and maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi is refusing to call this an official impeachment resolution. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

She doesn't want to mirror that. What this is, is smoke and mirrors. They are trying to make you think it's something that it is not. It is not fair. It is not what Newt Gingrich offered to Clinton.

NBC News reporting that New Jersey Congressman Jeff Van Drew will likely vote against the impeachment measure. It's important to note: Van Drew is one of 31 Democrats, they represent districts who voted for Donald Trump in 2016.

      "sentences": "Good evening, Sean. Well, the resolution today, that's the first official step codifying the impeachment process in the House. This goes to the rules committee tomorrow to prep the resolution for the floor and then expect a full House to debate the plan Thursday morning.

That's more than enough to adopt a resolution on the House floor. Now, just tonight, freshman Democratic South Carolina Congressman Joe Cunningham, who flipped a district from red to blue last year, told FOX that he backs the resolution. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Five Democrats, all from swing districts, remain vague as to whether they support the resolution -- New York's Anthony Brindisi, Maine's Jared Golden, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has just talked about, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. The first four were Democratic pickups in 2018. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Peterson has been in Congress since 1991. He's won with 52 percent of the vote the past two cycles. But President Trump won Petersons district by a staggering 31 points in 2016. Now, today, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer quibbled with calling the measure an impeachment resolution. So, I asked Hoyer if Democrats were concerned with it being perceived as impeachment. Hoyer said, quote, I want to be very careful with my verbiage, close quote. FOX was told that moderate Democrats were concerned about public interpretation of the resolution. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There's a risk for Republicans, too, in this. The top Republican on the Oversight Committee, Jim Jordan of Ohio, predicted no GOP defections. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise urged a no vote. Republicans from battleground districts could face a choice: vote for the impeachment resolution or break with our colleagues and get a primary challenge, and that's to say nothing of igniting the ire of President Trump. Now, also, this impeachment resolution gives great latitude to the House Intelligence Committee. That's rare in an impeachment investigation. The Judiciary Committee would ultimately write articles of impeachment, but Republicans argue that President Trump may only get rights to defend himself if there are Judiciary Committee meetings. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, in the last presidential impeachment, House Judiciary Committee -- the House Judiciary Committee heard from independent counsel Ken Starr. They heard him make him case against President Clinton on November 19th, 1998. Then, Clinton's attorney David Kendall got to question Starr in the committee itself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, it's unclear, Sean, if President Trump's counsel will get the opportunity to pose similar questions in this scenario. Back to you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He controls the witness list, the rules, the evidence, and Republicans must raise their hand and get permission from the congenital liar and psychotic Trump hater. He is the judge, jury, the executioner in what will be nothing but a public show trial designed to convince and stack the deck against the American people, and this president deserves to be impeached and we are being fair when they're not being fair. As Congressman Jordan noted from Ohio, these public changes in proceedings -- well, it's like putting lipstick on a pig. But until the charade goes public -- well, Schiff's top secret Soviet style impeachment coup attempt is going to continue.

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker. One swamp to the other. Welcome to “Hannity.” Today is day 35 of the Democrats' secret Soviet-style impeachment coup attempt, although it's really been their goal -- think about it -- from the day that you, we the people, elected Donald Trump as president. Breaking just moments ago, the Democratic Party may be starting to fracture. Look at this -- at least one Democratic congresswoman now reportedly planning to oppose his party's latest, unfair -- which we'll explain -- impeachment measure. We'll have a full report tonight from Capitol Hill. But first, another day of secret meeting, secret hearings, secret transcripts, a secret whistle-blower, non-whistle-blower, hearsay whistle- blower, all because of a phone call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. But, tonight, let me just cut to the chase here. None of this really in truth matters. The fake whistle-blowers' thoughts, their feelings, they don't matter. Anonymous sources don't matter. Witnesses to the phone call, they don't matter. None of this circus that Democrats are now dragging the entire country through matters because we have the actual transcript. It is public and it shows zero, none, no misconduct whatsoever by the president. The transcript not only exonerates the president but it clearly features a president of the United States upholding his sworn duty to execute the laws of the United States and investigate foreign election interference. So, nothing the Democrats have supposedly cared about for three years all of a sudden matters. By the way, there was even a court decision in Ukraine and that found that their government interfered in our 2016 elections in an effort to help Hillary Rodham Clinton. I thought Democrats cared about foreign interference in our elections. According to a very credible report from \"Politico's\" January 11, 2017, they went into specificity and detail about how Ukraine worked in concert with the DNC in 2016 to smear Donald Trump and help elect Hillary Clinton. In other words, the DNC literally colluded with Ukraine, how ironic, to help Clinton win and to hurt Donald Trump. Now, asking a country, in this case Ukraine, to cooperate in an investigation, that's actually not a crime. It's not bribery, not a misdemeanor, it's certainly not treason. It's actually the president's job to faithfully uphold and execute the laws of the land. That is his oath, that is his constitutional obligation. But the leader now of this new witch hunt, we have the corrupt, compromise, coward, congenital liar, Adam Schiff. He wants you to believe something much different. Schiff, who won't come on their show to defend himself, he goes on every other show, has zero fidelity to truth. He is a pathetic liar. And for three years, he has worshiped at the altar of his impeachment lies. It's constant lies. He's got all the evidence we would ever need about Russia, Russia, Russia collusion. It was a hoax and conspiracy, lies, didn't work out. Now, let's try Ukraine. It's evolving narratives, they're now calling it. In other words, you have the coward Schiff trying really hard to get his lies straight. Remember, first, according to Schiff, there were multiple, direct quid pro quos from the president's call with Ukrainian president. And the president released the transcript. That proved to be a lie, too, that allegation. And when Ukraine's president and their foreign minister both said they felt zero pressure whatsoever -- well, then, there's Schiff, he claimed it was some kind of behind the scenes effort then to shake down Ukraine over time by withholding aid. But what we found out the money was actually released without any conditions whatsoever, and that the Ukrainian government didn't even know that the money was delayed at the time of the call, Schiff had to change his narrative again, calling in witness after witness but only behind closed doors, without real Republican due process at all to speculate on the president's intentions. You know what -- you know who hasn't testified? Interesting. They're not talking anymore about the so-called whistle-blower non-whistle-blower, who started the entire process. Now, why is it? Because Schiff's office we now know was in contact, apparently even advising him from the very beginning. Now, Republicans, if we ever get that guy under oath, well, they'll be asking a lot of questions about that and that guy supported Joe Biden. Now, they told him apparently, according to reports, to get a lawyer. They encouraged him to file a complaint with the inspector general. And that means Schiff is a fact witness in the case. He blatantly lied about this coordination as we have proven on TV. Schiff is compromised. He's a fact witness in the case in which he is now presiding. He should recuse himself. He is compromised, corrupt, a coward, and a congenital liar. That's who's leading the new witch hunt. So, today, when Democrats said they were alarmed -- they were alarmed by the testimony of Alexander Vindman, a national security expert -- I understand -- a war hero, thank you, sir, for serving our country. He was on the phone call. But the problem is, keep in mind, the Democrats' interpretation of his interpretation of the phone call. But we don't need his interpretation because we have the transcript. It doesn't matter, frankly -- with all due respect, and I mean that sincerely -- what he or anybody else thinks. It's all feigned outrage. They're acting -- wow -- somebody else interpreted it the sick way we do or the corrupt way we do. OK. Well, that's their interpretation but it's a matter of law. Even the Department of Justice investigation concluded today, no conclusion. There was nothing wrong, nothing illegal about the president's call. But the corrupt Democrats, they could not care less. You have Schiff. You have Pelosi. They are now ready for phase two of their impeachment coup attempt. And today, they cooked up a resolution, I've got it right here in front of me, it's not worth the paper that is printed on, I wasted paper. I hurt trees in the process. That would make their coup proceedings public. One big catch, when you actually read the document, which I have done, well, there is one huge, massive, gigantic caveat that the compromised congenital liar Adam Schiff and his fellow Democrats, they actually can veto any Republican attempts to call witnesses, subpoena evidence, and pretty much anything else. They need the compromised Schiff's approval for everything, and maybe that's why Nancy Pelosi is refusing to call this an official impeachment resolution. Take a look."

This goes to the rules committee tomorrow to prep the resolution for the floor and then expect a full House to debate the plan Thursday morning. The vote itself will come midday Thursday. Now, FOX counts 228 Democrats as supporting the impeachment inquiry resolution. That's more than enough to adopt a resolution on the House floor. Now, just tonight, freshman Democratic South Carolina Congressman Joe Cunningham, who flipped a district from red to blue last year, told FOX that he backs the resolution. Five Democrats, all from swing districts, remain vague as to whether they support the resolution -- New York's Anthony Brindisi, Maine's Jared Golden, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has just talked about, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. The first four were Democratic pickups in 2018. Now, Peterson has been in Congress since 1991. He's won with 52 percent of the vote the past two cycles. But President Trump won Petersons district by a staggering 31 points in 2016. Now, today, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer quibbled with calling the measure an impeachment resolution. So, I asked Hoyer if Democrats were concerned with it being perceived as impeachment. Hoyer said, quote, I want to be very careful with my verbiage, close quote. FOX was told that moderate Democrats were concerned about public interpretation of the resolution. There's a risk for Republicans, too, in this. The top Republican on the Oversight Committee, Jim Jordan of Ohio, predicted no GOP defections. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise urged a no vote."

Now, also, this impeachment resolution gives great latitude to the House Intelligence Committee. That's rare in an impeachment investigation. The Judiciary Committee would ultimately write articles of impeachment, but Republicans argue that President Trump may only get rights to defend himself if there are Judiciary Committee meetings. Now, in the last presidential impeachment, House Judiciary Committee -- the House Judiciary Committee heard from independent counsel Ken Starr. They heard him make him case against President Clinton on November 19th, 1998. Then, Clinton's attorney David Kendall got to question Starr in the committee itself. Now, it's unclear, Sean, if President Trump's counsel will get the opportunity to pose similar questions in this scenario. Back to you."

This is just one more dirty political tactic to smear the president, the kind of legal purgatory, if you will, where Democrats can pretend they are holding an official and fair proceeding without affording any rights to the president or to Republicans. Look at your screen. Now, these were the rules during Bill Clinton's impeachment. Newt Gingrich was the speaker of the House. The House openly debated. They held an official vote. The president had the ability to call witnesses. His attorneys did submit evidence, build the case. Now, the corrupt, compromised Schiff, he gets to veto whatever the hell he pretty much wants. He controls the witness list, the rules, the evidence, and Republicans must raise their hand and get permission from the congenital liar and psychotic Trump hater. He is the judge, jury, the executioner in what will be nothing but a public show trial designed to convince and stack the deck against the American people, and this president deserves to be impeached and we are being fair when they're not being fair. As Congressman Jordan noted from Ohio, these public changes in proceedings -- well, it's like putting lipstick on a pig. But until the charade goes public -- well, Schiff's top secret Soviet style impeachment coup attempt is going to continue. Unlike any, say, Cuban style show trial, the whole truth always takes a backseat to the preferred -- well, propaganda political narrative.

Now, if there really was a blatant crime -- bribery, treason, misdemeanors -- Democrats could just reveal the evidence. Hold an official vote. Let all sides participate fairly. But again, we have the transcript to the call in question for all to see. So, I encourage everyone to read it. There's no crime. There's no misconduct whatsoever. And, by the way, what you will read is the president and doing his sworn duty, upholding the Constitution of the United States and faithfully executing laws. And what's more? No money was withheld. The president of Ukraine claimed there was no pressure ever applied where they didn't even the money was held up for a period. In order to believe there was an illegal quid pro quo, you'd have to suspend all basic logic but belief on objective truth, all common sense, all reason. You'd have to be a propagandist. You have to buy the big lie. It's like 1984, a bunch of walking zombies. They just repeat themselves and hypocrisy on a level I frankly have not seen in my 31 years on radio and 24 years at FOX. But that's what the Democrats want you to do. Suspend, literally, all of your intellectual thought process, ignoring on-camera evidence. Now, we do have direct evidence of a quid pro quo, how ironic in this case. It happens to be of Joe Biden. The hypocrisy is spectacular. Look at your screen. It's pretty simple. Vice President Biden, he becomes the point person for Ukraine in 2014. His son, Hunter, after that, gets hired to serve on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas giant. Now, did he have experience in oil? No. In gas? No. In energy? None. In Ukraine? None. He was asked -- well, why do you think you got hired and were paid millions? I don't know. Do you think you might how to do with the facts that your father is the second most powerful men in the United States? Probably. Now, Burisma was clearly not paying for his experience.

So, you know, that resolution is just more of the same and I'll tell you, you mention that you haven't seen this in your many years in radio and TV, I have never in my life seen anything like what happened today. I mean, they have been bad and most of these depositions but to interrupt us continually, to coach the witness to decide whether or not what we are going to be able to ask a witness, and we don't even get witnesses at this point, and it doesn't look like we're going to get any ever, but do not let us ask questions, I have never, ever had that.

I mean, my goodness, if that's on a quid pro quo, I don't know it is. But of course, that's why the Democrats wanted to uphold the smoke screen, they don't want you to look over there, they show you that shiny object behind a tree and they try to create all this innuendo about President Trump who, by the way, the law that says that the president, before he gives taxpayer money to any country, has to go and verify, actually verify, that they are not participating in corruption. In fact, that's a law that Adam Schiff himself voted for and so when you look at what President Trump is doing, he is trying to root out the corruption of stomach that started in 2016 with the Russians trying to interfere with our election, some of that went through Ukraine. Of course, he's got a legal obligation to root out corruption and that's what President Trump is doing creative that's why they want to impeach him instead of looking into the real quid pro quo that he bragged about."

Number two, they didn't know money was delayed at the time. And number three, they got the money without doing a darn thing.

All of these supposed geniuses at the State Department and here in the swamp, well, they don't know anything about this 2000 -- what happened in 2016. Ukraine is great. Ukraine never did anything wrong.

Don't get any sicker than that. Not only did the Washington Post call him an austere religious scholar who dies at 48. Now they have a columnist who is under fire for actually challenging President Trump's assertion that al-Baghdadi died a coward. And it gets worse because even prominent Democrats are so consumed with anti-Trump rage and psychosis that they're actually hitting the President for his tone after bringing the world's most wanted terrorists to justice. Can't make this up, so I've got to show you. Here's the evidence."

Biden Obama didn't do that. Here with reaction, the author of the new book Exonerated, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino along with Fox News Correspondent at Large, Geraldo Rivera.

I mean if you were to vote right now among the American people whether they think this lame phone call to the Ukrainian President is an impeachable offense as envisioned by the framers of the United States Constitution, they would say absolutely not. This is a waste of the country's time. There are a dozen bills, crucial bills funding the government that will lie idle as we pursue this futile exercise. The House is clearly a stacked deck. The Senate will quit the President as soon as they get it in their chamber. This is appalling and I really have to say that I am deeply disappointed in the mainstream media for the equivocal nature of their reaction to the death of this mass murdering dog. This person who cut people's heads off, who conquered a swath of land created a nation, robbed tens of millions of dollars, killed thousands and thousands of people, almost wiped out the Yazidis, an ethnic group. I mean this was a gigantic achievement by American special forces, our operators. We should be celebrating it the way we celebrated the death of Osama bin Laden.

Sean, you just pointed out one. I'll just give you one major. You're all hypocrites, you Democrats. I'm not talking about voting Democrats in the country. I'm talking about the hill swamp rat Democrats. I'm sure there is good people out there, genuinely care. But the hill is infested with TDS level 6 Trump derangement syndrome. You know you told us for two years foreign collusion in an election matter. Yet we know for a fact, you know facts liberals, those things you have a really hard time with that the Ukrainians colluded with the Democrats to try to damage Trump in the election. You don't give a damn about that. You know we heard today by the way that said that a decorated military officer who claims to have some information that you can't scrutinize him, Sean. You can't - and thank him for his service, he deserves it. But having said that, it's funny how Mike Flynn, we not only can we scrutinized Mike Flynn, we're going to - we should crap on Mike Flynn at every single opportunity, if you're a liberal. That's OK. You liberals are frauds, America is tired of you. I'm tired of you. Sean, one more thing just to hit on Geraldo's point too. And just in the last few years, we've had the Democrats, I had to make a list, defend MS13, infanticide, we had Bill Murr calling for recessions and now they're defending a rapist, murderous, pig, dog, cockroach who are special forces and our dogs were braver than this guy and they're defending him.

But we got his successor. So, Pelosi got to distract from that. Can't have her party sympathizing too long with al-Baghdadi.

So, they've come up with a phony temporary measure. You Republicans can suggest witnesses and you can suggest questions, but you've got to get our permission first. And so, you know this is ridiculous. If they were really honest about wanting a fair and impartial system of investigating this matter in which the President had his rights, they keep saying, he's not above the law. Well, apparently, they believe that he's not under the law either, because it doesn't apply to him. They would have passed the same rules that were in effect for the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton and for the 1973, 1974 impeachment of Richard Nixon. They would have allowed the minority to call witnesses, the minority to take depositions, for statements to be made public, for the President to have a lawyer, President and all of the staff meetings to suggest witnesses, to ask questions and at the end of the presentation of the evidence, to state the President's position on that material.

And Karl is right. Look, I think the Republicans, I think the leadership on the Republican side, you Sean so many others have done a great job in pushing back on the issue of this being totally procedurally flawed. The American people are getting it that this is a hose job. It actually started I thought Matt Gates last week by charging into the star chamber was brilliant last week, people gave him a hard time about, but he shed light on what was happening. But what I'd like to see Sean now the Republicans have to start pushing back on the merits. They've done a good job on procedure, but like a motion to dismiss, the White House Counsel's office put out a three page paper and say look, if everything you say is true Democrats, if everything you said is true about President Trump, this is why your case should be dismissed because it doesn't state a claim upon which a relief can be granted.
