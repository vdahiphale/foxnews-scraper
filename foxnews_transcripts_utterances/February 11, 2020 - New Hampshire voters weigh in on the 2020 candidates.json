So let's look at some of the issues that are driving voters to get out today. This is what they told us, roughly equal numbers side health care and climate change as the number one issue facing the country that is moving their votes. The Democratic field is basically proposing when it comes to health care, were formed two different ideas both are favored by sizable majorities. Seven in 10 say they've got a favorable view of the single payer plan this is the one proposed by Senator Sanders and Warren. Sometime it is called Medicare for all, basically the government running your health care. Now the public option plan backed by Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar even more popular and nearly nine in ten favor this plan. In this scenario Americans could buy into a government plan if they wanted to but it would be optional. Now both of these plans are considered liberal, and for Democratic primary voters here liberal is not a bad word. Four in ten calls themselves liberal and one quarter identifies what they call very liberal. At the same time as many as six in ten believe it would actually be tougher to beat President Trump in November if the Democratic nominee has strongly liberal progressive far left views, and that includes one in five who believe it would be a lot harder to take the President on that way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The night is still young and we are still interviewing voters.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: It's very early. You know, two things stand out to me. Thirty-two that's a big number. Boy, if he maintains that, that's really great for Bernie. It's not what he did last year. I mean, last -- I'm sorry not last year but in 2016 when he won here by about 30 points. But that's pretty incredible if that holds.

And don't forget Mike Bloomberg standing out they're saying, hey, if these guys falter, I'm coming in the centrist lane. That's the competition. We were just talking moment about Klobuchar's rise. I think a lot of her rise are women, especially here in New Hampshire who would have gone for Warren coming from the neighboring state but who have - - instead picked up on Klobuchar's outstanding performance in the debate in the sense that she has momentum at the moment. That's a big loss for Warren. Because when we looked down the road, and that's what I've been trying to do, neither of these women really have a 50-state strategy. I think Warren has better ground game going towards South Carolina and Nevada. Klobuchar doesn't have that yet. She doesn't have the money either. It's going to be very tough for her.

The polls as you just heard are about 25 seconds away for closing for good this season in the state of New Hampshire, the first primary. And there is no caucus in this time. We'll understand the results when they come in. They are imminent. You'll see them as they come. In a minute we'll give you our take on what this all means. The Democratic race has become a frantic struggle to destroy Bernie Sanders' supporters. But first, we're going to check in for an overview with the best we have.

He spent part of the day today thanking his volunteers for knocking on tens of thousands of doors in New Hampshire while he was tied up in Washington, D.C., at the impeachment trial. And he also spent part of the day today bragging about having the biggest New Hampshire crowd of any Democrats this cycle 7500 at a Strokes Concert that Sanders headlined. Sanders himself would not predict a victory this evening but it did predict that if a Democrat is going to beat President Trump in November it's going to take the largest voter turnout in the history of the country and it's got to be better than the turnout in Iowa which was not as great as a Sanders campaign wanted it to be. Sanders usually at his campaign events, gives unscripted speeches that hit on the same themes Medicare for all, tuition free public college and legal pot in every state. But tonight we are expecting something different because they've got a teleprompter set up on the stage very unusual for him. Bret and Martha?"

Bernie Sanders likes to brag that he has no support from those, Brett says it better than I do he calls it millionaires and billionaires. Since he is now a millionaire I guess he doesn't talk about millionaires anymore he talks about billionaires all the time. There are a lot ways to look at that and one of them would be - yes the most -really most successful business people in this country don't want him to do - but I think you know that's where the lines are drawn. It would be quite striking if we ended up with socialism versus capitalism."

He is it appears going to be the front runner for the Democratic nomination as of tonight. And you know we talk about socialist when you look and talk to them on \"Fox News Sunday\" about his plans, and sometimes he says he knows how much that costs and he says he doesn't know how much it costs. You add up Medicare for all and the green new deal and free college tuition and a guaranteed federal job, its $60 trillion in new spending over the next decade. The federal government has already projected to spend $52 trillion over the next decade so his plans more than double government spending. It's a pretty extraordinary agenda and at this point it seems to be the agenda that is getting the most support the most traction in the Democratic primary. All be it in Tuesday but, that's where the race is."

I remember back in I'm sure Chris remembers as well too back in the campaign in 1980, the Democrats were all saying oh, boy they could are just licking their chops running against this Reagan guy, they washed out the far right old actor and they found out the hard way that it's not a good idea.

And it is because he was selling electability. He doesn't have a great dramatic agenda he obviously doesn't - he's not Barack Obama or Jack Kennedy with the new face on the scene. He was selling tried and true and electable and it appears he's going to be none of those things at the end of tonight if the results go the way they do. I think he's really in serious trouble and, you know, I know he says we will have Nevada and then we're going to have South Carolina, two more races, and yes they dine line up in a demographic sense more favorably to him because he does much better among minorities especially with minorities and African-Americans. They are looking at these results, too and they want a winner. I can see it you are already beginning to see some of the support for Biden in South Carolina in the polls at least peeling off and going to Bernie Sanders. If he finishes fourth or fifth tonight, I think the bottom begins to fall out of the Biden campaign. He can continue running."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "\"Fox News At Night\" Anchor Shannon Bream is here with what we found. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR, \"AT NIGHT\": Hi guys so the polls just about an hour away from being closed here in New Hampshire. So let's look at some of the issues that are driving voters to get out today. This is what they told us, roughly equal numbers side health care and climate change as the number one issue facing the country that is moving their votes. The Democratic field is basically proposing when it comes to health care, were formed two different ideas both are favored by sizable majorities. Seven in 10 say they've got a favorable view of the single payer plan this is the one proposed by Senator Sanders and Warren. Sometime it is called Medicare for all, basically the government running your health care. Now the public option plan backed by Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar even more popular and nearly nine in ten favor this plan. In this scenario Americans could buy into a government plan if they wanted to but it would be optional. Now both of these plans are considered liberal, and for Democratic primary voters here liberal is not a bad word. Four in ten calls themselves liberal and one quarter identifies what they call very liberal. At the same time as many as six in ten believe it would actually be tougher to beat President Trump in November if the Democratic nominee has strongly liberal progressive far left views, and that includes one in five who believe it would be a lot harder to take the President on that way. The night is still young and we are still interviewing voters. And you can stay tuned for much more Fox News Voter Analysis. But guys, you know if they are worried about the liberal folks being able to take on President Trump, I could tell you something about the way they decided to go tonight as we standby."

We want to thank the volunteers who turned out for the Trump campaign. I had been in a number of polling locations across the state today. We've got enthusiasm and we're hoping for a big showing tonight. I think there are 16 or 17 people on the Republican Primary ballot. Remember the highest percentage an incumbent President has ever received in New Hampshire for reelection was Ronald Reagan in 1984 he received 86 percent of the vote. Barack Obama when he ran for reelection here as the incumbent received just under 81 percent of the vote and I think tonight you are going to see a Republican Party that's unified behind Donald Trump and we're going to be looking around 90 percent of the vote tonight."

    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's clear that the Republicans failed the President, when they had control of the House for the first two years. They did not pass a health care bill that allowed individuals to purchase health insurance across state lines. It's something that should have been done and something that should still be done. We are in such a hyper-partisan environment right now, and I don't think any of that legislation are going to get done in the remainder of this year. And I don't know if the voters are going to hold the House responsible for that or the administration. But I think they are going to look at the totality of the of administrations record and be very supportive, particularly in the economy."

Why should New Hampshire keep this honor of being first in the nation for the primary?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well look, let's just be clear. Barack Obama won the Iowa Caucus and so it's not that they don't understand a good candidate when they see it, and no candidate in modern political history going back to 1976 did not finish first, second or third in Iowa and has ever been elected President of the United States. So they've done a fairly good job. I think if you look at our primary, Donald Trump won it here four years ago, by 19 points went on to become the President of United States. The luxury of New Hampshire is, we get to that people, and we get to spend time with them. We get to look him in the eye ask them tough questions go to the rallies here about it. And we make good decisions here. Look Bernie Sanders won it last time he probably should have been the nominee. I think if the process was different he would have been the nominee and we'll see what happens. And I think Bernie is going to win here tonight and we know Donald Trump is going to win here tonight."

He does it with that experience of having worn the uniform and deployed on a set of orders. I also think that what some people are criticizing, to me, it's one of his greatest strengths. You know, to be mayor for eight years of a city that saw the bottom fall out, that saw thousands of industrial jobs lost and he's had to work to reinvent himself and reimagine itself and chart a new course. There are so many communities across the country just like that. And I want a president who is connected to those communities."

And I think at the end of the day, you know, what voters are looking for when they choose a president is someone they trust to do the right thing, someone they believe has the ability and the temperament to do that job.

That's a strong field. You got, as you said a former vice president of the United States, two neighboring state senators. So, we'll see what tonight brings. But I think that the theme of this campaign is that as people have gotten to know Pete and see him face-to-face, they've seen in him a person who can be commander-in-chief."

As we are getting a first look at some of these numbers, Juan, let me start with you. As your look at these Democrats and Bernie Sanders as expected out in front at this very early stage. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: It's very early. You know, two things stand out to me. Thirty-two that's a big number. Boy, if he maintains that, that's really great for Bernie. It's not what he did last year. I mean, last -- I'm sorry not last year but in 2016 when he won here by about 30 points. But that's pretty incredible if that holds. The other thing that stands out to me is the absence of Joe Biden. I don't even see him on the screen."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I don't -- well, the thing is, what does he have to do. In my mind, just politically speaking, I think he's got to at least get into double digits but if he doesn't get into double digits I don't see how he can say that this is anything but a massive failure and potentially, then sink his campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, this was always going to be a very tough place for Joe Biden to compete because it's right next door to Elizabeth Warren's state, right next door to Bernie Sanders' state. So already he had expectations working a bit in his favor. He was not expected to win. But fifth place is a long way from a strong third-place finish, for instance. And so, you can see why his campaign must have seen this coming and why he decided to get out of the state early and get to South Carolina, but this is really bad news for him and puts all the more pressure on that South Carolina contest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

Pete Buttigieg is in -- those numbers are only 3 percent but that's very tight, so it could in fact be inverted and she come in second, and Buttigieg could come in third which would be bad for him. But I think the story of the night in the race to watch is the third-place race. Because there are three tickets out of Iowa -- out of New Hampshire. And if Klobuchar gets that and Elizabeth Warren doesn't get that, that's pretty bad for her because she's got nowhere else to go. She's -- Joe Biden has had South Carolina. So, what's her South Carolina? What's her blue wall state where she can come back? This was it. So, she had to do really well here tonight and if she can't pull at least third, she's dead."

      "utterance": "Well, there is no question. I mean, let's just step back for a second, we got really numbers and I think everybody is quite occupied with them. But step back for a second, Martha, and you see the fracture in the party. I don't think there's any question you have Sanders representing the progressive or left wing or the liberal wing of the party, and then you have people like Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Warren, Biden all representing what they would say is the centrist one. And don't forget Mike Bloomberg standing out they're saying, hey, if these guys falter, I'm coming in the centrist lane. That's the competition. We were just talking moment about Klobuchar's rise. I think a lot of her rise are women, especially here in New Hampshire who would have gone for Warren coming from the neighboring state but who have - - instead picked up on Klobuchar's outstanding performance in the debate in the sense that she has momentum at the moment. That's a big loss for Warren. Because when we looked down the road, and that's what I've been trying to do, neither of these women really have a 50-state strategy. I think Warren has better ground game going towards South Carolina and Nevada. Klobuchar doesn't have that yet. She doesn't have the money either. It's going to be very tough for her. But hopefully, you know, from her perspective with the good performance here tonight, that picture then begins to take shape."

However, as the voters in early stages have begun to have their say like so many of my fellow Democrats, I found myself grappling with the options and realize the Democratic Party of 2020 is ready for a fresher voice.

There are a lot of Democrats across the country that may be early on in this process, so I like Joe Biden. He was vice president. He was Obama's guy. Sure. And they would tell pollsters like me that he was their choice. But now that more people in the field are getting more exposure and Biden has really begun to falter when he's put to the test at the ballot box, it's giving someone like Klobuchar an opportunity. Now, Juan is right, though. She has to be able to seize it to get the money to be able to compete with the rest of the field in these later states."

Marc, you know, as we look at these numbers, what we're not talking about obviously is Joe Biden. He is hoping that South Carolina can save him, but at some point, South Carolina is looking at these numbers too."

The people in each state they're watching tonight and they are seeing what the results are. So, I just don't see how Biden recovers from tonight. And of course, Mike Bloomberg is sitting out there watching these results too and feeling much and much better about his prospects. I mean, the -- but here is the interesting thing that's emerging. If Biden falls out and you have Sanders, you have Buttigieg and you have Bloomberg sort of as emerging as front runners, is all of them have a problem with the African-American vote. The way -- the reason that Democrats lost in 2016 is because they were not able to energize the Obama coalition and bring out their traditional supporters in the African-American community. And right now, all the people who are leading the Democratic race have real problems with the African-Americans especially -- and especially Bloomberg now after what came out this afternoon."

      "utterance": "Ninety-five percent of your murders -- murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. They are male minorities, 16 to 25. That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, there is two ways to look at this. One is to say, well, the numbers support what the mayor -- the former mayor just said. I mean, if you look at where the crime rates are highest, et cetera. The other way to look at it and I look at this of course as an African- American is to say, when my son or sons go out the door, I don't want the police to immediately identify them as a criminal and a suspect. Nine out of 10 of the people subjected to stopped and frisk were not arrested or stopped for anything. They have anything on them. So that creates a certain antagonism between the police and the community. And there's you know, just stop and think. Everybody, blacks, Latinos, whites want good policing. We want to be safe in our neighborhoods and in our homes. But if you create a situation where you feel like, in fact, the police are a force that's antagonistic to you and your family and your children, that creates an inflammatory, combustible situation. And I don't think the mayor understood that at the time in that language, the way that he is thinking is so indifferent to the minority experience."

One is, Biden still has the lead in South Carolina. We talked about these things that are not taken in silos that in fact they --"

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. Right. What you saw in that Quinnipiac poll recently, Bret, was a decline in black support for Joe Biden because of the decline and the notion that he was the most electable, the guy who could do the best job of battling in possibly defeating Donald Trump. I'll say this. I still think that he has a ground game. He still has a ground game in South Carolina and Nevada. The guy who can unseat him here, and I think where you see some of this black support and Latino support going, no surprise as we sit here in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I think that's an interesting phenomenon for the Sanders campaign who has seen all kinds of different folks from different groups coming to his support."

    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "And this is something to keep in mind. Remember in 2016, there was Donald Trump and then there were a lot of other Republicans and there was this thought, well, as other Republicans drop out, they were support will go to a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. You can look at that chart up on the screen and think you'll condense the Buttigieg and Klobuchar lines altogether, but in practice that's not what happened. In practice, for some of them Bernie Sanders might be their second choice. And so, this idea that you can just collapse all of the moderates together and that's how they'll beat Bernie Sanders I think is mistaken. I think he is able to pick up support from a lot of different placements in that coalition."

    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "But the problem is that what the Democrats need is not just for black support in the primaries to go to somebody. They need -- the promise of Joe Biden was that he can bring out the Obama coalition, that he has great support with the African-American people community. He was the most electable because the Obama voters will come out for him, the African- American voters. That's gone now. There is no candidate out there who's making -- who really has that promise and at the same time, you saw Donald Trump make an incredible push for African-American votes in the State of the Union. He spent half of his Super Bowl ad on a criminal justice reform. He doesn't have to increase his black vote very much but if he increases a little bit he wins."

The polls as you just heard are about 25 seconds away for closing for good this season in the state of New Hampshire, the first primary. And there is no caucus in this time. We'll understand the results when they come in. They are imminent. You'll see them as they come. In a minute we'll give you our take on what this all means. The Democratic race has become a frantic struggle to destroy Bernie Sanders' supporters. But first, we're going to check in for an overview with the best we have.
