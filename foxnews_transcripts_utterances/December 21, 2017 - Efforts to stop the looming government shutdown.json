Lindsey Graham saying, you bet we are going back at it without the mandate ObamaCare is going to take some hits pretty quickly."

      "utterance": "This is really a rip that they took repealing the mandate because that is what gets more people who are healthier into these marketplaces and makes them more, keeps them more competitive. The people in the pool are going to be sicker and older, the cost for the coverage is going to be more expensive. And so you heard President Trump say we are going to replace it later was something that is going to be much better. This is the last thing that they want to do, to go back to the drawing board on ObamaCare. It's why the speaker tried to put it off. But it is going to be politically perilous for them come the middle of the spring or summer inching towards that midterm election, maybe we are not at magical six percent economic growth as a result of the tax cut bill and the public has really soured on what has happened to the ObamaCare exchanges, begging Congress to do something about it. That is really a political risk going into those elections."

      "utterance": "Getting rid of the individual mandate was important because it was a horrible assault on people's liberty and it was a regressive tax on the poor. But A.B. is right, the regulations that accompany ObamaCare are what caused so much trouble for the efficiency and the cost of that program. And Congress did not handle that this year, and it is something that they need to deal with. So get ready."
