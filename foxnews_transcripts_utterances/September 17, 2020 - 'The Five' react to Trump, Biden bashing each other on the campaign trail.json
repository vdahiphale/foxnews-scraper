He's out of control. And that's what drives so many people crazy. His advisers can't control him. His lawyers can't definitely control him. The deep state, they tried to control him. I mean, he doesn't do what people tell him to do. He marches to the beat of his own drum. Contrast that with Joe Biden. Joe Biden is totally controlled. He has his advisers putting scripts in his teleprompter. They tell him to stay in the basement. He does it. His VP controls him. You know now it's the Harris-Biden administration. AOC controls him.

So it's basically like someone whose can't be controlled versus someone who is totally controlled, a leader versus a follower. And if you look at Joe Biden's policies since he got into this race, he's gone far left on immigration, guns, taxes, and the climate. And now, AOC is saying he's going to get pushed around on foreign policy, where, exactly? I mean, Donald Trump killed terrorists, cut peace deals, and brought our troops home. Where exactly does AOC want to push him? It's basically another change election. Donald Trump remains the agent of change, and Biden wants to go back to the failed radical policies that got us into the mess in the first place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Dan Scavino said something very interesting at the RNC. He said they say it is chaos, but President Trump calls it change. And that's what is going on here because he's forged new paths for trade, for immigration, and for foreign policy. And there's a lot of resistance to that change in the country, in the Democratic Party, and within the administrative state. So there's that clash. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the people behind Donald Trump want that change.

I do think that Joe Biden comes across as somebody who can be pushed around, partly because he's not very forceful. He's not forceful when he talks about the positions that he would take.

It's one of the things President Trump can do is to get Biden to react angrily. That will be probably something -- like a point in President Trump's favor in that debate. Because something that Biden does, he will say I can't be pushed around. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK, but you say you're going to support this. Some of the budgets he's supporting are very much in line with more progressive thinking. And it just reminds me of one other thing. I worked for a congressman in 1995, so if remember the Republican's sweep, not only Congress but all across the country in 1994. In 1995, the congressman I worked for had been there about if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } 12 years. All of a sudden, in one of the articles, it says that he -- they called him a moderate. And he came to my desk. And he wanted a correction. He said how did I become a moderate? I'm a conservative. And I said I think it's just because when other people came in, they said that they were more conservative than you. So then everything moves along. I think for Biden, he is more progressive than he was even five years ago.",

Because what you're doing is you're planting a seed that it's entirely possible that scientists would put out an unsafe vaccine. It's not Trump's -- he's not putting it out there. It's an idiotic thing to say. But my question about what Biden said yesterday -- if Donald Trump is doing such a bad job with COVID, why did Joe have to go to such great lengths to manufacture problems that don't exist? What was he talking about yesterday? He says we don't want to politicize the vaccine. Nobody is doing that. He wants vaccine transparency. What does that even mean, right? He's worried about favoritism, OK? He wants vaccine equity. This is all like this weird gibberish created in some kind of focus group with his -- or with his campaign handlers.

Why hasn't anybody thought of that? But I don't blame Joe for using this as an opportunity because he doesn't have much left. He backed the wrong horse, right? In the BLM fiasco, these are Democrat riots. These are the Biden brawls. So he's got to deflect. And also, he's kind of lucky.

She also makes an interesting point about Biden and all these people doubting the vaccine speed, Warp Speed. The reason we got Warp Speed delivered so quickly is because Congress passed legislation in the tail end of the catastrophe, which was the Biden-Obama response to the swine flu where 60 billion Americans were infected. And it was so widespread they just stopped testing altogether. What they did was they -- you now assess the trial results as they come in instead of waiting for the end to assess them then. So that really like doubles and triples the amount of time you get to then assess these vaccines. That's why it's called Operation Warp Speed. One more thing, I've been looking at all the states. All 50 of the states in terms of on the trends of the deaths, every single state in the United States is seeing a decline in the amount of deaths. You can nitpick. There's a few states like Nebraska that have, like, six deaths one day and eight deaths the next. It's sad, but it's statistically insignificant. The fact that all 50 states are seeing a decline in deaths is a huge testament to how well we've done so far.",

The fight for the White House playing out in must-win battleground states today, President Trump heading to Wisconsin for what looks to be a big rally. And Joe Biden is trying to win over voters in Pennsylvania. Lately, the Democratic nominee has been courting Americans in the middle, politically, telling them he's a moderate. But progressives in the party want Biden to be more liberal, Senator Bernie Sanders warning Biden that he has to do more to excite progressives, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saying this."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "He will do whatever they tell him to do. Election is very funny when you think about it. You have very stark choices. President Trump is someone that cannot be controlled. He's out of control. And that's what drives so many people crazy. His advisers can't control him. His lawyers can't definitely control him. The deep state, they tried to control him. I mean, he doesn't do what people tell him to do. He marches to the beat of his own drum. Contrast that with Joe Biden. Joe Biden is totally controlled. He has his advisers putting scripts in his teleprompter. They tell him to stay in the basement. He does it. His VP controls him. You know now it's the Harris-Biden administration. AOC controls him. Bernie controls him. He will do whatever Barack Obama says when he calls him on the phone at 1600 Pennsylvania. So it's basically like someone whose can't be controlled versus someone who is totally controlled, a leader versus a follower. And if you look at Joe Biden's policies since he got into this race, he's gone far left on immigration, guns, taxes, and the climate. And now, AOC is saying he's going to get pushed around on foreign policy, where, exactly? I mean, Donald Trump killed terrorists, cut peace deals, and brought our troops home. Where exactly does AOC want to push him? It's basically another change election. Donald Trump remains the agent of change, and Biden wants to go back to the failed radical policies that got us into the mess in the first place. And Dan Scavino said something very interesting at the RNC. He said they say it is chaos, but President Trump calls it change. And that's what is going on here because he's forged new paths for trade, for immigration, and for foreign policy. And there's a lot of resistance to that change in the country, in the Democratic Party, and within the administrative state. So there's that clash. But the people behind Donald Trump want that change. They're fighting for something, because it's a movement. And that's why they're so much more enthusiastic than Joe Biden supporters."

And I was thinking. If he did support these things, wouldn't it make him an easier target for Donald Trump's claims that he's a socialist? Or, you know, Trump has a new ad about Biden being weak on China? Wouldn't that just open the gate to Trump attacks?"

      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think -- I think Jesse makes a lot of good points. And I believe that AOC is a little bit more of a good -- she's probably a better strategist than people give her credit for. Because what she just did there was to subtly reassure people that are in her sort of wing of the camp, that don't worry, everything's going to be fine. But that leaves Biden and Kamala Harris to be out there saying other things, and especially they're in Pennsylvania. I do think that Joe Biden comes across as somebody who can be pushed around, partly because he's not very forceful. He's not forceful when he talks about the positions that he would take. And when he does try to be forceful, he almost sounds angry. So I think when you look to the debate, which will be -- just like -- it is less than -- it's about 10 days away. It's one of the things President Trump can do is to get Biden to react angrily. That will be probably something -- like a point in President Trump's favor in that debate. Because something that Biden does, he will say I can't be pushed around. OK, but you say you're going to support this. Some of the budgets he's supporting are very much in line with more progressive thinking. And it just reminds me of one other thing. I worked for a congressman in 1995, so if remember the Republican's sweep, not only Congress but all across the country in 1994. In 1995, the congressman I worked for had been there about 12 years. All of a sudden, in one of the articles, it says that he -- they called him a moderate. And he came to my desk. And he wanted a correction. He said how did I become a moderate? I'm a conservative. And I said I think it's just because when other people came in, they said that they were more conservative than you. So then everything moves along. I think for Biden, he is more progressive than he was even five years ago."

Those aren't the people who are supporting Biden, right? They just don't want to vote for Trump. So Joe has to do more to excite the progressives. But what more could they want? I mean, do you want to have more riots, more looting, more arson, less police? You want to bail out more rapists and murderers? You want to tear down more statues, elevate more criminals? Re- introduce segregation to campuses? Destroy the classroom with critical theory? Ban more speech, cancel more careers, accuse more people of racism in America of oppression? Take all the fun out of sports? Destroy biology and gender, obliterate pronouns? It seems to me, the last 30 years progressives have gotten a hell of a lot. So why give them more? You like my shirt?"

To me, he's, like, he's clearly changed from his days of the Obama administration. But he's like the emperor's new clothes, in that he keeps using long-term memory despite these talking points from that era. But his actual policies that he's putting forth, A, shows the success of that Volturi (ph), and B, shows that he's actually undercutting the people in the industries that he's professing to support. So let me make two examples really quickly, biofuels and fracking. So with biofuels, he says he claims that he's a stronger supporter of Iowa farmers than the president. But he supports boosting electric vehicles. That would decimate corn and ethanol production out of Iowa and eliminate natural and electric fuels, or natural fuels industry. And so I see that as having a devastating effect on those small farm family-owned farms in Iowa. And then fracking, we know that he let it slip in that debate with Bernie that he was against it. And then he flew to Pittsburgh to assure the voters, oh, I didn't mean it. But remember his policy is power generation, fully renewable, 100 percent by 2035. Where does that leave the demand for natural gas?"

Or he says that he up-played the virus when we all know that we can hear him on tape saying that he downplayed the virus. And then you get into a situation, Dana, where he undercuts his own CDC Director, Robert Redfield, after Redfield, in sworn testimony before the Senate, says really the earliest we're going to have masks, doses of the vaccine available is the last half of 2021. I think, again, it sounds like he's putting political pressure on a doctor. And I think that's why people -- I think it's like 62 percent of Americans say they worry that all of this politicization is going to rush the vaccine out to the marketplace before it's safe."

I would wear a mask if I was going to be indoors at an event. How do you see the science community trying to keep up with this in the middle of an election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that you have to take Biden to task. I mean, if you are suggesting that somebody would put out an unsafe vaccine, that's not about Trump. He's not making the vaccine, right? You're actually going after the science and the scientists. That's pretty harsh stuff. Because what you're doing is you're planting a seed that it's entirely possible that scientists would put out an unsafe vaccine. It's not Trump's -- he's not putting it out there. It's an idiotic thing to say. But my question about what Biden said yesterday -- if Donald Trump is doing such a bad job with COVID, why did Joe have to go to such great lengths to manufacture problems that don't exist? What was he talking about yesterday? He says we don't want to politicize the vaccine. Nobody is doing that. He wants vaccine transparency. What does that even mean, right? He's worried about favoritism, OK? He wants vaccine equity. This is all like this weird gibberish created in some kind of focus group with his -- or with his campaign handlers. And then he mentions that Trump said he would inject bleach, which is an absolute hoax that has been debunked over and over again. Then he says I'm going to have the governors come to the White House. How idiotic is that? I mean, they have Zoom now, Joe, if you haven't noticed. And he did talk to the governors. He said we're going to make sure that everybody has availability to the vaccines. Why hasn't anybody thought of that? But I don't blame Joe for using this as an opportunity because he doesn't have much left. He backed the wrong horse, right? In the BLM fiasco, these are Democrat riots. These are the Biden brawls. So he's got to deflect. And also, he's kind of lucky. You can't prove that you were going to do a better job on COVID because there's no parallel universe, so you don't have to prove it. All you have are opinions untethered to facts. It's beholden on us to try to remind everybody what Joe has been saying or has not been saying for years."

      "utterance": "Well, I just want everybody to remember what Juan just said. He said I don't want to politicize Coronavirus. I am going to hold you to that, Juan Williams, for the rest of the year. So thank god you said that. I want to call attention to an op-ed in the New York Post by Betsy McCaughey. And it was so good. I didn't steal the credit. I actually gave her a shout out on the air. Because this is good stuff, this is what she calls attention to. Biden's little adviser, Zeke Emanuel, he says Coronavirus guru. This is his plan for vaccine distribution. He says no, no, no, I don't want to do what Trump is doing by giving the vaccines to the elderly and at risk people first. They're going to die soon anyway. Why would you give an 80-year-old the vaccine when they just have a few years left? Let's give it to young people instead. It's basically the death panels all over again. She also makes an interesting point about Biden and all these people doubting the vaccine speed, Warp Speed. The reason we got Warp Speed delivered so quickly is because Congress passed legislation in the tail end of the catastrophe, which was the Biden-Obama response to the swine flu where 60 billion Americans were infected. And it was so widespread they just stopped testing altogether. What they did was they -- you now assess the trial results as they come in instead of waiting for the end to assess them then. So that really like doubles and triples the amount of time you get to then assess these vaccines. That's why it's called Operation Warp Speed. One more thing, I've been looking at all the states. All 50 of the states in terms of on the trends of the deaths, every single state in the United States is seeing a decline in the amount of deaths. You can nitpick. There's a few states like Nebraska that have, like, six deaths one day and eight deaths the next. It's sad, but it's statistically insignificant. The fact that all 50 states are seeing a decline in deaths is a huge testament to how well we've done so far."

There is nothing farther from that truth. Abrogation of duty, dereliction of duty, or abject failure of duty is not a preference dispute. And the major of Seattle, Jenny Durkan, sent out the tweet and said this is chilling. This is once again an example of abuse of power by the Trump administration, and he's using the AG, the Attorney General, as his, you know, lap dog. She said but it's not about me. The story is not about me. It's about the president. It's about the AG. And as a Seattle resident, I want to say it's not about them either, sister. It's about us, the residents.

We should get him on The Five. I don't know why he feels -- and by the way, you know, just -- I don't share Emily's view about what he -- you know, apparently, you know, the idea of threats against the mayor. That's a local official. A local official should be responsive to local constituents who -- if they feel that she's failed them, OK. But to go after the President's critics and the mayor there has been a critic, now, the mayor in Portland, apparently, they explored whether or not there should be charges there. You know -- and then to say to his own -- this is the thing that gets me. Even his own prosecutors within the Justice Department, he's saying you guys have been too easy on the protesters and suggesting that they should use the charge of sedition against people involved with protests. So, you know, to me, this is the guy who got involved with the Roger Stone case, got involved with the Michael Flynn case, and now, he's the whole idea of equal justice under law, it's all about partisan politics under the color of law.

I don't know whether he was basically just trying to make a point, but I do think that there are some good ideas. Our own Andy McCarthy has put them forward about using the RICO laws in order to try to see about the coordination and try to stop this in terms of specially the fundraising. And I noticed that in Minneapolis today -- I'm sorry, in Wisconsin today. We had a reporter there that was basically showing, Hillary Vaughn, that a lot of those businesses that were rioted, where they were looted, that it's still not cleaned up.

They get their bail taken care of by organizations that Kamala Harris tweets about, rapists and murderers Damn straight, we need adults here. And he's an adult who understands the concept of disincentives. If you have disincentives, people won't engage in these practices. Like the judge who just did that million-dollar bail on the -- on the sorority girl, she went from kappa delta to sigma clink. Suddenly people go oh, we're not going to riot in Lancaster because we're going to go to jail and there's going to be a huge bail. So, I think that like the problem here, and it's a problem you see every day, people in the media and politicians are so far removed from crime. They don't think cops really need to exist except when they need their private security. And it's the same thing with arson, right? Nobody is covering arson because it's not in their town.

So, we are so glad to know that Chris Rock watches THE FIVE. On January 24th, the questions were due for impeachment, and that was the day that basically there was also a hearing on Coronavirus, you're remembering it correctly.

We all know they knew how bad it was because they all dumped stocks, remember? Like, 12 of them dumped stocks afterwards. So, did they talk about Coronavirus? No. They talked about impeachment. And none of them really lifted a finger to help the president. It was Cuomo who did a lot of this stuff in New York. Schumer was nowhere to be found. Nancy said come on into Chinatown and party.
