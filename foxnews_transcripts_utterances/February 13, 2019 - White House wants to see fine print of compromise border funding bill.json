We don't know. The inclination that the president is going to sign it, but he says he's going to look for landmines. You have things up there wires that are riders they can put in legislation, all kinds of stuff that can happen in the final hours of the must sign bill. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes.

We have known for a long time that Democrats and even a large number of Republicans are not in favor of doing something like this on the border in terms of a wall. The fact that Donald Trump was able to get what he has gotten out of it I think is a positive thing. I think the more important thing, just a week ago, Democrats were talking about actually reducing the number of detention facilities and the number of beds for holding people who illegally cross the border. That is in essence abolishing ICE. The fact that we are talking about now is, and again, as you point out, we haven't seen legislation, adding facilities, adding space, that's a huge victory for the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think that as disappointing as it is for conservatives, there's probably some wisdom in taking the money you get. If you can get more from El Chapo, that's even better. But then trying to build on it from there. I think it is a reasonable starting point.",

And Democrats are going to say, Trump didn't get is border wall, although the $1.3 billion will fund about 55 miles of wall, not that much but something. And then Trump will be able to say I got money for a border wall. I think the x-factor in this is does he do an executive order which allows him to move funding around, take money out of other pots of the federal government, move it toward a wall.

      "utterance": "Anyway, let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\", national security analyst Morgan Ortagus, and David Catanese, senior politics writer for \"U.S. News and World Report.\" Charlie, this is kind of in flux now. We don't know. The inclination that the president is going to sign it, but he says he's going to look for landmines. You have things up there wires that are riders they can put in legislation, all kinds of stuff that can happen in the final hours of the must sign bill. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes. And of course, the sticking point here, the five, wherever, between six and $1 billion dollars for the wall, that's pretty small change for the things going on in Washington. But the big picture, I think, is this. We have known for a long time that Democrats and even a large number of Republicans are not in favor of doing something like this on the border in terms of a wall. The fact that Donald Trump was able to get what he has gotten out of it I think is a positive thing. I think the more important thing, just a week ago, Democrats were talking about actually reducing the number of detention facilities and the number of beds for holding people who illegally cross the border. That is in essence abolishing ICE. The fact that we are talking about now is, and again, as you point out, we haven't seen legislation, adding facilities, adding space, that's a huge victory for the president. And I think that as disappointing as it is for conservatives, there's probably some wisdom in taking the money you get. If you can get more from El Chapo, that's even better. But then trying to build on it from there. I think it is a reasonable starting point."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Right. And I think that that is an indication of the president's campaign of trying to paint the Democrats as being for open borders, being extreme. Going back to Charlie's point here, I wish the freedom caucus would learn to protect the quarterback a little bit more. There's some wins that Charlie just talked about in this bill. He also got more money for judges. Nancy Pelosi said that the president would not get a dollar for the wall. He has $1.735 billion. Now, the entirety of that can't be used for the wall, but it went from not getting a dollar to getting some real wins in this bill. And what he's ultimately going to be able to say as he goes into 2020 is finish the wall, and that is going to go with the keep America great slogan. And he's going to be able to say, I'm now fighting this fight on my own terms. I'm the only who can do this. So is it perfect? Nothing is ever perfect in Washington. So I think there's enough wins for the president to move forward."

      "utterance": "So asked the question a different way, FOX Poll Two, budget deal that includes money for a barrier, security, humanitarian aid, and look at the numbers. DAVID CATANESE, SENIOR POLITICS WRITER, \"U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT\": Huge, because it doesn't say the word \"wall.\" And this is what we are arguing about, semantics. The Democrats were putting out messaging points this week, saying there is no money for the wall. Then I get an inbox from Senator Dianne Feinstein that says this is a good compromise because it has some wall funding. So look, a deal is something that both sides can claim victory on. And Democrats are going to say, Trump didn't get is border wall, although the $1.3 billion will fund about 55 miles of wall, not that much but something. And then Trump will be able to say I got money for a border wall. I think the x-factor in this is does he do an executive order which allows him to move funding around, take money out of other pots of the federal government, move it toward a wall. That is where you will get more Democratic backlash."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. And as you point out, we haven't seen the legislation, we don't know what the language is exactly. But that is why I tend to focus on the enforcement part of this, the part about detention facilities because that is the part where Democrats really looked like they were not going to budge, and it turns out that they did budge. And then finally, in terms of turning towards 2020, President Trump has proved that this is a very good issue for him. And he capitalizes on it very well. And I think that proceeding in the direction of we have more to do, keep voting for me, is probably a smart strategy."
