COVID confusion rocking the White House as their state of course handling of the pandemic is colliding with reality. Cases continue to surge hitting nearly 1.5 million infections that we know of and the country still does not have enough tests despite the president's pledge that help is on the way. Former members of Biden's transition team are giving the administration a wake-up call, calling for an urgent strategy reset or risk losing credibility with the public.

It's very clear as in my case that if you are vaccinated, this virulent disease that, Dana, as you pointed out that hit 1.5 many people yesterday alone in this country.

The -- here's a story about every pandemic political article that's been written, Dana. Is that, Joe Biden was supposed to stop this pandemic dead in its tracks. He was supposed to shoot lasers out of his aviators and destroy every single wave as it popped up. Now why did we believe that? Because the Democrats and the media told us that Joe cared more than Trump. That he was going to follow the science so that he was competent. Now was any of that true? It was a political narrative that they sold us to win the election. It was fake news. And now Joe Biden has fallen victim to his own fake news hype machine. And don't take it from me. Take it from Joe. He told ABC News that he -- nothing has been good enough. He told ABC News that he didn't see the last two waves coming. He's been slow on therapeutics, he's been slow on testing, he's got a bigger death toll than Trump. And now we are almost reaching 2,000 deaths per day. We haven't had that since the peak of Delta in September. So, at this point, you have no more major legislation that's going to come out of the Biden administration. At this point, they only had COVID relief and infrastructure, not sexy enough to turn out anybody. Build Back Better is dead, this voting takeover thing is dead. They are going to come in, they are going to -- Republicans are just going to make gargantuan gains in the midterms. They are going to control all the committees. They are going to drive Fauci crazy.

And now, finally, we got to look at our Republican patsies. You got played by the Dems with this January 6th anniversary. I'm wondering next year how they are going to use January 6th again, what catastrophe will the next anniversary feed into? Will they be able to ban forms of speech because of January 6th? Will they be able to force more CRT in the schools because of January 6th? Every year we get to look forward to the use of January 6th as a ploy to create a scared population, to scare them stupid so they are actually on the same wavelength as Joe Biden.",

The -- here's a story about every pandemic political article that's been written, Dana. Is that, Joe Biden was supposed to stop this pandemic dead in its tracks. He was supposed to shoot lasers out of his aviators and destroy every single wave as it popped up. Now why did we believe that? Because the Democrats and the media told us that Joe cared more than Trump. That he was going to follow the science so that he was competent. Now was any of that true? It was a political narrative that they sold us to win the election. It was fake news. And now Joe Biden has fallen victim to his own fake news hype machine. And don't take it from me. Take it from Joe. He told ABC News that he -- nothing has been good enough. He told ABC News that he didn't see the last two waves coming. He's been slow on therapeutics, he's been slow on testing, he's got a bigger death toll than Trump. And now we are almost reaching 2,000 deaths per day. We haven't had that since the peak of Delta in September. So, at this point, you have no more major legislation that's going to come out of the Biden administration. At this point, they only had COVID relief and infrastructure, not sexy enough to turn out anybody. Build Back Better is dead, this voting takeover thing is dead.

He didn't expect people recovering from being cooped up for a couple of years to want to spend money. Even as prices were going up, people still want it to buy. Demand is still in intense. And I think that ultimately is a good thing, unemployment just 3.9 percent. He should really be singing the virtue of an economy that's humming. And I think that Powell and the Fed guys will control inflation in the next quarter or so. I'm not frightened by it. I think that bare shelves now will mean abundant shelves in a couple of weeks."

So, Peter goes out, goes to all the stores. There's no cold medicine. The only thing that they had for a sore throat was something that like a spray for children. So, I got that.

Maher explaining in a new interview why he actually loves performing in red states while pushing back against those on the political left who consider themselves to be superior. He said, \"I constantly say it. You can hate Trump. You can't hate all the people who like Trump. It's half the country. And you can't set yourself up as some sort of superior moral paragon, because this is your political belief and somebody else has another one. I feel like that's the Achilles heel of the left right now. They identify issues mostly by what they can feel superior to another person for.\" I heard that, Greg, and it was very interesting to me because it reminded me of the book I read almost 10 years ago. They use the language of outrage to score points against people they don't like, what make themselves feel important. I hate the outrage so much. You can say I'm outraged by their outrage. A funny thing about tolerant people, they're really only tolerant when you agree with them, said Greg Gutfeld, in Joy of Hate. So, great minds think alike. But it is true, isn't it that, you know, there is this superiority of one faction over the other?"

So, you're not supposed to talk to Trump supporters, you're supposed to have ideas of segregation. And if you -- and if you dare mix with these people, well, then you'll get infected too and you'll be just as evil as they are. What he's trying to say is the only way you're going to get out of your bubble, is by talking to people who are different from you.

And the other thing is about Bill Maher, whether you can -- you can trace it back to one particular moment, I think, on the campaign trail that led to the Trump supporters feeling very much like they could all band together, and that was when Hillary Clinton called them a basket of deplorables. And many of -- you can imagine what was happening in progressive cloakrooms all across the country and in the bars. They were saying, yes, exactly. She nailed it. And then they realize their mistake, and they've been trying to make up for it in a way ever since. It'll be interesting to see if Bill Maher is recruited to run for the presidency, actually, because it's only somebody like that. The last thing I would say is that we grow up and we learn about the importance of forgiveness and grace. And there's also the great American tradition of this melting pot that we have, lots of ideas. We need to return to that in some way. Well, in a big way, right away."

Can you imagine like, you take the panel on The View and multiply it by 100 or 1000, and you have to perform in front of that. Though sneering gasbags.

It turns out so this Achilles kid in Greek mythology, the doctor said he was going to die young so his mom took him to the River Styx and dipped him in this very enchanted water and made him invincible. But when she dipped him in, she grabbed them by the ankle. So, the Achilles heel didn't actually get dipped in the magical current.
