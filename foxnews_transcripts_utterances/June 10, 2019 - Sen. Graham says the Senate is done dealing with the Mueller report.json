It is abundantly clear that the Justice Department is working on several tracks here and they are very dogged in their investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Who started it?  When did they start it, and what was the motivation? Note this telling line in the letter that was sent out from the DOJ deputy today, to Chairman Nadler, describing what their review is focused on.  \"The review is broad in scope and multifaceted.

The panel of three judges on the Army Appeals Court, two women and one man pointed out the alleged rape happened during field training where sex was not allowed, that many other cadets were nearby to where she claims the rape happened and that she had a crackling space blanket nearby. So given the proximity of the fellow cadets and the noise the blanket would make, it was difficult to conclude that the victim \"would not make any reflexive noise or movements upon being awakened\" which would have alerted multiple others to his criminal activity. And Cadet Whisenhunt also testified that \"both parties try to avoid detection and even stopped and held their breaths after hearing a nearby noise. Advocacy groups say the verdict being overturned is upsetting in the light of the Me Too movement and the fact that recent survey found that between 2016 and 2018 sexual assaults in the Military were up 38 percent. Some also believed Military Appeals Courts are the most inexperienced courts in the country, though it's worth noting the Military does not require a unanimous verdict and the jury or panel as it's called is handpicked by the general who convenes the court.

The order was the Legionaries of Christ and when I turned in my letter to say I want to leave, they flew me to Mexico to meet the founder, who told me listen, this never happened. Don't ever tell anyone about this again. And then strangely, moved up my ordination to the priesthood by two years. Let me give you a positive example though, I mean a happy -- Cardinal Dolan, my former boss, my -- I hope forever friend, I've shared with him my own struggles as well and he has been with me, close by my side. He's told me go slow, think about this. There's always a chance for you -- ask for forgiveness and you start over. But then when I said, your Eminence, I really -- I'm done. And I know this is what God wants for me. He has supported me like a friend would and like a father would. And that's what I have experienced from him and there's a lot of good going on in the church and maybe it's crazy for me to have done this interview. But you know what? I'm so happy I did.

It is abundantly clear that the Justice Department is working on several tracks here and they are very dogged in their investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Who started it?  When did they start it, and what was the motivation? Note this telling line in the letter that was sent out from the DOJ deputy today, to Chairman Nadler, describing what their review is focused on.  \"The review is broad in scope and multifaceted. It is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of the U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals.\" In other words, heads up James Comey, John Brennan, perhaps British intelligence is suggested here, and also outside individuals.

For example, during the period of the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, once we were made aware of it, we were in constant communications with the Justice Department to inform them what was happening. We use that process to make sure that not only did we tell the government what was going on, but we also, at least, in my case, I try to also get the RNC to be a part of what we were trying to do and protect our democracy."

He decided not to bring any charges regarding obstruction of justice because there is no crime here. The bottom line is what the House is doing is politically motivated, trying to destroy the Trump presidency, and I can assure you that we're done with the Mueller investigation in the Senate. They can talk to John Dean until the cows come home. We're not doing anything in the Senate regarding the Mueller report, but we are going to try to harden our infrastructure to protect it against 2020 interference."

How did it get so off track? Was the FISA Court defrauded by the FBI, the Department of Justice? Was there a legitimate reason to have a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign? And why did -- why wasn't Trump told what Donna Brazile was told?

I was very involved in this. And the president has delivered a deal that I think will make us far more safer. Mexico is stepping up. And here is what the New York Times would have you believe that Donald Trump negotiated a great deal with Mexico, for two months, didn't tell anybody about it. Do you think Donald Trump would have a great deal and not tell anybody about it? This whole narrative that this was done before is ridiculous. He pushed Mexico, Mexico took the tariff threat seriously. We're going to have better cooperation on the Mexican side, but here is the problem. I wish the Democrats would help President Trump as much as Mexico has. If the Democrats will work with me to change our asylum laws, this would be fixed overnight."

They're going to help us keep some people in Mexico while they wait for a hearing here in the United States. But what I'm doing is saying that if you're from Central America, you can't apply for asylum in the United States, you have to do it in your home country. I've been told if you do that one simple change, 90 percent of this stops overnight and that's what I am pursuing is trying to end this disaster at the border."

Joe Biden gets weighed on his decades-long stance on abortion. In part, by this former actress apparently. And she's also - - you remember her as a -- an anti-Kavanaugh crusader. Watch. ALYSSA MILANO, ACTRESS & ACTIVIST, HOST, \"SORRY NOT SORRY\" PODCAST: These are serious bills, although absurd, and the reason why they are absurd is because they're going to end up in court.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Big applause but that prompted that wait, what, kind of reaction from a lot of moderates as Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden did an about-face on its 40-year stance on abortion funding, flip-flopping on the Hyde Amendment which says that federal funds cannot be used, taxpayer funds to fund abortions. And it seems that the turnabout was pretty quick. The Atlantic reporting \"Alyssa Milano who has become a major online presence on issues of women's rights, as well as a friend of the Biden team, spoke by phone Wednesday with Biden's campaign manager Craig Schultz telling him that the candidate needed to change.\" Some reports said that she spoke directly to the former V.P., we're not sure about that but Biden's history on this issue is going to make this a little tough to explain in some states on the campaign trail. Biden has supported the Hyde Amendment since it was passed in 1976. In 1981 he pushed something called the Biden Amendment which sought to make sure that federal dollars could not be used for abortion research overseas.  In 93 he voted again in support of the Hyde Amendment. He explained why while campaigning in '07."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIDEN",
      "utterance": "I still have opposed the public funding to abortion. And the reason I am is again, it goes to the question of whether or not you are going to impose a view to support something that is not a guaranteed right but an affirmative action to promote."

Here now, Mollie Hemingway Senior Editor at The Federalist, Robert Wolf is CEO of 32 Advisors and a Democratic donor and supporter, both a Fox News Contributors. I know -- Robert, let me start with you, that you have spoken with Vice President Biden over the course of you know, his decision process in this campaign. Were you surprised about this flip?"

      "utterance": "I wasn't surprised. Most of the -- most of the candidates actually supported the Hyde Amendment while they were voting for the Affordable Care Act even though most of them didn't want to support it, it was the only way it would have passed. The vice president -- former vice president has obviously seen what's going on in Alabama, Missouri, and it's clear that he thinks a woman's right to choose is part of their right -- that health care is a right."

      "utterance": "Well, this really is a noticeable change for someone who has for decades held to a fairly mainstream position. There aren't that many things in the United States when it comes to abortion that people agree on, but one of them is definitely that people should not be forced to fund violence in the womb against their conscience. And this is something that is definitely helping him in the Democratic primary but it might be troubling once he get back into the general. The whole point of the Biden candidacy thus far has been seemingly that he's going to be in the moderate, sort of the middle of the road while other people try to stake out far left positions. But as this suggests, he might be able to be bullied into taking a far left position pretty quickly as he did in last week."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He's going to be pressed on this, Robert, in a -- in a major way because he has a very long history here saying that you know, it's based on his faith, it's based on his experiences in life. Here's the NPR Marist Poll that is from June of this year, this month, which shows that abortion views in the country have actually moved more in favor of pro-choice 57 percent, pro-life or at 35 percent. There are other polls that show that 71 percent of Americans believe that abortion should only happen in case of rape and incest. So you know how is he going to respond to these questions under the gun?"
    },

      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think that's a fair question. I don't agree that the Vice President has shifted left. He's a -- I would call him a progressive moderate versus a populist progressive. He didn't support Medicare for all. He's not supporting the Green New Deal. He's supporting climate change. He is supporting gun reform. He's supporting immigration reform. But he's not -- he hasn't shifted left where Senator Warren and Senator Sanders are, just the opposite which is why I think right now he's polling better than President Trump in most of the states at their head-to-head."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well I'm not sure if -- I really don't think that the Republican nominee will be in trouble in Texas. But it is interesting when you talk about polling about abortion. Generally speaking, people do support the legalized abortion in the first trimester of a pregnancy. What we have in this country is actually far more radical. And it's far more radical than what you see in Europe or other civilized countries where you see the limit -- you see abortion regulated to that first trimester. And we heard mention of the Alabama law, we don't hear a lot of mention about some push by Democratic legislatures such as in New York to permit abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, to not protect children who survived abortions. These are pretty radical things that will come up in the general election. Joe Biden's big claim to fame was that he would be able to appeal to people who were not far left, Democratic voters. And when you'd start sticking out these positions that are well outside of the mainstream, it makes it less comfortable for people who are pro-life to vote for someone like him."

California will now become the first state to offer free health care to illegal immigrants in the state of California. Under Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, state lawmakers reached an agreement to provide coverage to adults aged 19 through 25. Once approved by the state legislature, nearly 90,000 people will receive the benefit at a cost of nearly $100 million per year to the state of California. So also developing tonight, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib pitching a plan to fight poverty and income inequality with cash. The Democrat -- the freshman Democrat introduced the \"Livable Incomes for Families Plus Act.\" It would give between $3,000 and $6,000 per year to all low income and middle-class Americans including a full cash payout with no -- for those with no income at all.

      "speaker": "CRENSHAW",

OK, so it's a misunderstanding of economics because one, we always have to ask the question how we're going to pay for it? Are we going to put our children in even more debt? Are we going to raise taxes on somebody else? We already have one of the most progressive tax systems in the entire world. And -- but it also -- it also doesn't make sense because it basically entices people not to work, OK. If you're making $49,000 a year, then you're going to have an incentive not to take that extra job or extra promotion because you're going to lose your benefits. It is not a smart or efficient way to do welfare policy. A better way is on income tax credits or work requirements for able-bodied people to receive welfare, that encourages them to actually get a job and to keep working and to promote themselves, OK, to actually be self-reliant. That would be the moral thing to do. It's also misunderstands human nature because it's basically making people dependent on government. You know, we have to ask ourselves the question, why wouldn't she just propose a tax cut? She's not proposing a tax cut because she wants you to be dependent on government. This is deeply immoral, OK, and it's just -- it's not the right thing to do. We don't want another bureaucracy handing out money, we just want people to keep more of their money. So why doesn't she work with us on tax cuts?"

There are ways to allow people to keep more of their own money and then there's a program that gives people handouts which is what she is in favor of here. I want to ask you about your bill.

A Military Appeals Court has overturned his conviction, saying there was not enough evidence to prove that sex with a classmate in 2016 was not consensual. In moments, we will speak exclusively with the lawyer for that cadet, Jacob Whisenhunt but first Trace Gallagher in our West Coast newsroom with the backstory."
    },

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha, the female cadet identified only by the initials LM testified that she was in her sleeping bag and woke up to Cadet Jacob Whisenhunt raping her. She told the court she remained frozen in the fetal position during the entire assault. Cadet Whisenhunt said it was consensual and that it began with a series of escalating and consensual touching. The panel of three judges on the Army Appeals Court, two women and one man pointed out the alleged rape happened during field training where sex was not allowed, that many other cadets were nearby to where she claims the rape happened and that she had a crackling space blanket nearby. So given the proximity of the fellow cadets and the noise the blanket would make, it was difficult to conclude that the victim \"would not make any reflexive noise or movements upon being awakened\" which would have alerted multiple others to his criminal activity. And Cadet Whisenhunt also testified that \"both parties try to avoid detection and even stopped and held their breaths after hearing a nearby noise. Advocacy groups say the verdict being overturned is upsetting in the light of the Me Too movement and the fact that recent survey found that between 2016 and 2018 sexual assaults in the Military were up 38 percent. Some also believed Military Appeals Courts are the most inexperienced courts in the country, though it's worth noting the Military does not require a unanimous verdict and the jury or panel as it's called is handpicked by the general who convenes the court. Cadet Whisenhunt was kicked out of West Point and sentenced to 21 years in prison. He served 25 months and went back to West Point last week. Martha."

Certainly nothing in there, if anything, of the abuse or of the illegal anything, but I put it in my statement that for years the duties and obligations of the Catholic priesthood have been very difficult and especially not being able to marry and have a family. I'll be super personal right now. I remember when I was 28 years old, I was still studying to be a priest at the time and all these time I was like, I do not feel like I should be here but I don't want to let people down. And I met somebody, this is -- so this is long time ago, I was 28 and had a one-time relationship with that person. And I wrote a letter immediately to my superiors and said I am gone. I need to leave. And it was -- I was part of an order that turned out to be, the founder was a total fraud, abuser of children and many other things. The order was the Legionaries of Christ and when I turned in my letter to say I want to leave, they flew me to Mexico to meet the founder, who told me listen, this never happened. Don't ever tell anyone about this again. And then strangely, moved up my ordination to the priesthood by two years. Let me give you a positive example though, I mean a happy -- Cardinal Dolan, my former boss, my -- I hope forever friend, I've shared with him my own struggles as well and he has been with me, close by my side. He's told me go slow, think about this. There's always a chance for you -- ask for forgiveness and you start over. But then when I said, your Eminence, I really -- I'm done. And I know this is what God wants for me. He has supported me like a friend would and like a father would. And that's what I have experienced from him and there's a lot of good going on in the church and maybe it's crazy for me to have done this interview. But you know what? I'm so happy I did. You know --"

Do you feel -- I mean, you know, you've been living for 25 years with this one nagging part of you and you're one of the best priest I've ever known. I mean nobody gives a sermon like you do. You're a wonderful, wonderful priest. So, do you feel relieved now that you've finally followed your heart?"

      "utterance": "No. I did. I did but, you know, why am I this interview? Because, most people -- when a priest leaves, the priesthood or even an evangelical pastor, a minister or Protestant minister, usually they disappear. They want to start over, it's totally fresh and I get that. There's a certain part of me that says I would love to just disappear, but I don't think it's the right way, at least in 2019. All of us no matter our past, no matter our present, all of us, clergy, laypeople alike, we have to give our best and I'm going to try."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I got to you ask this, just one last question about the big picture, what's going on in the Catholic Church because I'm sure a lot of people listen to this and they say, are you leaving because you are disenchanted with the hierarchy of the church. Is it -- have they blown it? Because, a lot of people are having that struggle right now with their own decisions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRIS",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's been disasters that have happened in the hierarchy and all along and -- but let me tell you there's a lot of great men and women out there leading and I will be in their pews -- let me just say this to the priests and to the laypeople, I will be in the pews next to you and I will be serving alongside of you. Because, God's grace is sufficient, God's grace is enough for us to do wonderful things in tough times. The church has been in much worse situations in the past, much worse. It's going to get through this too. I don't mean just the Catholic Church but the people of God."

Jim Deal (ph) is a 96-year-old Army veteran, stormed the beach in Omaha in 1944, youngest of 12 children. He was drafted at the age of 18 and he was among 750 young men who formed the 737th Tank Battalion, which was a very famous battalion, known as Patton's Spearheaders, he was awarded a Purple Heart for his service. He told me that he watches \"The Story\" every night, so you better be watching right now, Jim, and I promised him we would personally say \"Hello, Jim.  Thanks for your service.\" Good to see you, Jim. Nice to meet you. See you tomorrow night, everybody. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
