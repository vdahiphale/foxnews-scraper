PAUL I have been troubled from the very beginning that I think people were dishonest in the intelligence community to go after President Trump based on a dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign and they didn't tell the judge it was paid for by the Clinton campaign. That sounds like lying from the get go. It sounds like an agency run amuck with maybe feelings of hatred towards the president, and so yes, I have been very worried about bias at the CIA and I want to make sure that it never happens again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The revelation that since there was no criminal evidence that they came across, they began a counter-terrorism investigation to kind of cast a wide net and see what they could find. And also, that they planted at least one government informant in the Trump campaign. Leading the president to charge the revelations are \"bigger\" than Watergate he said today. And remember the judge who called out Mueller's team in court in the Manafort case? Saying, \"Come on, man, you don't care about Manafort, you are just after Trump.\" So, he wanted to see the scope memo to see what the definition of scope of their whole investigation is.

So, criminal referrals that are most likely to come out of that type of investigation would be for false statements or other types of violations in relation to the Inspector General office itself, those could be serious, obviously. What has long disturbed many of us is that the Clinton email investigation was anything, but regular. I mean, it was - the level of deference given to the Clinton staff was pretty remarkable. I mean, they had possession of computers and other information that is deemed government material, and yet they went through all of these negotiations and had conditions upon which they would allow that material to be reviewed, even though it could in some cases did contain classified information.

It's easier to establish. There are also fewer procedures for review or notifications in those times of surveillance orders. This would be disturbing because this has often been a complaint by many people that you see things shift over to counter-intelligence when they don't have the facts on their side. Now, many of these new allegations would seem to support the President's initial objections that his campaign was under surveillance and that extraordinary steps were made targeting his campaign.

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Well, there are two different things. What John Bolton was saying which I Donald Trump completely agrees with is we are not going to cut a deal with Kim Jong Un like the Iran nuclear deal that Obama cut which is sanctions relief and billions of dollars in cash up front. Weak inspection regime, no material handed over to the west, and sun set clauses at the end. President Trump has been pretty clear that we are not cutting deals. He doesn't cut deals like that because he pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. What John Bolton was saying was that when we cut this deal, when we did this deal with Libya, we sent US planes over to Libya and they loaded up the Libyan nuclear program and put it up on planes and took them back to Oakridge, Tennessee, and that's the kind of denuclearization we are talking about. You're not going to get cash, Kim, for just promising to denuclearize and then not doing it the way your father did, you're going to actually have to do something substantive and he said in the interview specifically, it might not be the Libyan model, but he might have some better ideas of how to do it, but it has got to be actual denuclearization. That's what Bolton is saying and Trump agrees with that."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's just fascinating to watch the president working on this and working on preserving this, and it's also interest, there was a tweet today by a reporter who had been in North Korea and he was told by somebody there that they are reading the \"Art of the deal.\" They are reading \"Fire and Fury.\" I don't know if that is going to fill them into well, there's a lot of things that were not truthful in that book."

He said, \"We have not heard that this is called off.\" Our people are talking, they are talking about the rules, the possibilities to set a meeting, but then, there is sort of an implicit threat, maybe, I don't know, I guess, if threat is the right word, he says, if you don't take this deal, the next deal doesn't look so great."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, no absolutely. I mean, the president - that's exactly the right message that the president needs to send, which is if you don't show up at the summit and we don't have a deal, it's not the status quo. The sanctions are going to get tougher. The military action could be on the table. This is not going to be good for you. And this is why the North Koreans are kind of squealing right now. It is like a cornered animal, it tends to lash out. He has done a very, very good of boxing the North Koreans in. He accepted the agreement to the surprise of probably Kim Jong Un to meet with him, so put us on track for negotiations very quickly, which no one expected. He has made clear he is not going to cut a deal by withdrawing from the Iran deal. He sent a signal, I don't cut deals like that, he sent Bolton out to deliver this message that it's going to be real denuclearization and not fake denuclearization and then Mike Pompeo went out and said something very interesting which he promised if North Korea does this, we will help them achieve prosperity on par with South Korea. Now, if Kim shows up at the summit and turns all of that down, all of a sudden, he can't blame the west for the lack of prosperity in his country. If they don't a really good job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You make a great point. I think the economic prosperity promise is something that is hugely tantalizing to the current leadership in North Korea. How long can you go on this way? We don't have that many countries left in the world where people try to escape by running across the border and get shot doing it. I mean, that's what we grew up with in the Soviet Union, right? I mean, people trying to run across the border and getting shot. So, I don't know how long you can last with that kind of environment and I think you are so right, Marc, when you say that the status quo is not really an option. So, if he is talking to his advisers in North Korea, keeping things the way they are is just simply not going to last, is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "No, it's not. And look, what is happening here is that Bolton is playing the bad cop and Pompeo is playing the good cop, which is the classic negotiating tactic, Bolton is laying out the hard line about the nuclear agreement. Pompeo is laying out the carrots. He is saying, \"We are going to provide you with security. We are going to provide with security guarantees. We are going to provide you with prosperity, and that is exactly the way to corner him. So, they have really done a masterful job of setting up this negotiation in a way that Kim Jong Un is really boxed in, if they actually go through, which means maybe why he may not show up."

PAUL I think it may be over-stating the case, protection may be from us invading and having regime change, that's what happened in Libya. The West did invade Libya. The West did affect regime change in Libya, and it's been a model that resonates with all up and coming nuclear powers - Iran and North Korea, that they wonder about our sincerity. It's also why some of us have argued it is a bad idea to get out of the Iran agreement because it sends a signal that we are not going to be consistent and following through with our agreements."

What are your concerns now that she will be the CIA director? PAUL You know, I think the confirmation process at least gets candidates to say things they hadn't said previously. She did finally come out and say that she thought that water boarding did not work. She never got to the point where she said it was immoral, but she got closer to where a lot of us think we ought to be is that that's it's not what we are as a people. You know, that torture and water boarding is really not we should be doing. But I am still concerned about the reports that Trump was surveilled. I asked her several questions today, and she did deny that the CIA had anything to do with British intelligence, and in the end, she actually said to me and this is supposed to come in writing, but she says that there was no communication between the British intelligence and John Brennan giving them information about the Trump campaign. If that is true, it contradicts a lot of news reports that is out there.

Are you disturbed by this \"New York Times\" piece that came out last night that says that the reason that there was a counter terrorism investigation even opened up was because they really didn't have any criminal charge, so they opened the counter terrorism operation sort of in the hopes of finding something? PAUL I have been troubled from the very beginning that I think people were dishonest in the intelligence community to go after President Trump based on a dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign and they didn't tell the judge it was paid for by the Clinton campaign. That sounds like lying from the get go. It sounds like an agency run amuck with maybe feelings of hatred towards the president, and so yes, I have been very worried about bias at the CIA and I want to make sure that it never happens again."

PAUL Herein lies the problem. All of these Republicans go home to the Rotary Club and they say, \"I am for the Balanced Budget Amendment,\" and the Balanced Budget Amendment balances in five years, so I gave them a chance to see whether their promises to the people are correct. Remember, they also promised to repeal ObamaCare, and then six or seven of them changed their mind and refused to vote to repeal ObamaCare, now today, 30 of them or close to 30 of them would not vote for a budget that balances in five years. Now, I want to correct one thing, it's not a cut of $13 trillion, it was a cut of only $32 billion dollars per year, that's is the 1%. When you say $13 billion, you are saying against proposed increases, so cut $13 trillion of proposed increases from a baseline that starts with what we spent last year, it's only 1 percent a year, $32 billion."

It said, yes, to cut 1 percent of the total, but it said the appropriations committees could decide where to cut it. Now, the appropriations committees could have said it would be the defense appropriations, but that's very unlikely since the Republicans control it and don't want to cut defense. But the bottom line is, you do have to look at military and non-military and entitlements, the whole ball of wax, and if you cut one penny out of the dollar, it would balance. But I think this shows the hypocrisy of many Republicans who say they are for balanced budgets, but are unwilling really to take the tough vote."

Also tonight, a closer look at what was buried in the air time story that we brought to you last night on cross- fire hurricane, which was the FBI's name for their Trump investigation during the election. The revelation that since there was no criminal evidence that they came across, they began a counter-terrorism investigation to kind of cast a wide net and see what they could find. And also, that they planted at least one government informant in the Trump campaign. Leading the president to charge the revelations are \"bigger\" than Watergate he said today. And remember the judge who called out Mueller's team in court in the Manafort case? Saying, \"Come on, man, you don't care about Manafort, you are just after Trump.\" So, he wanted to see the scope memo to see what the definition of scope of their whole investigation is.

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, we obviously have to wait to see the report. I think that if it is true that a criminal referral is going to be made, the most likely thing is that it's going to relate to the investigators themselves because Horowitz was not really re-investigating the email controversy, he was looking specifically and how it was investigated. So, criminal referrals that are most likely to come out of that type of investigation would be for false statements or other types of violations in relation to the Inspector General office itself, those could be serious, obviously. What has long disturbed many of us is that the Clinton email investigation was anything, but regular. I mean, it was - the level of deference given to the Clinton staff was pretty remarkable. I mean, they had possession of computers and other information that is deemed government material, and yet they went through all of these negotiations and had conditions upon which they would allow that material to be reviewed, even though it could in some cases did contain classified information. That's a level of deference we haven't seen before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, you think about the immunity that was given to high level Clinton staffers, and some of whom were in the room with her when she was questioned. There is all kinds of very relevant questions that Michael Horowitz has been looking into it, and of course, when that report comes out, we will get a better handle on it, the early word is that they are still a few weeks away, potentially the beginning of June, we are going to get our own look at what is in this. Now, with regard to this other cross-fire hurricane story, a very dramatic name taken from a Rolling Stones song for what they were doing in the early stages of the Trump campaign in order to look into it, what do you make of the revelation that they opened a counter-terrorism investigation rather than a criminal investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, unfortunately that type of change or transition is known to many of us who practice criminal law. It is easier to get surveillance as a counter intelligence matter because you can use powerful tools like the FISA court even though FISA has a probable cause condition, it is not the same probable cause we have in the 14th Amendment. It's easier to establish. There are also fewer procedures for review or notifications in those times of surveillance orders. This would be disturbing because this has often been a complaint by many people that you see things shift over to counter-intelligence when they don't have the facts on their side. Now, many of these new allegations would seem to support the President's initial objections that his campaign was under surveillance and that extraordinary steps were made targeting his campaign. He was attacked for that statement, and I have in some columns including one in \"The Hill\" newspapers that he does seem to be vindicated now in terms of those statements that he made"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "That's what I find obviously, the most disturbing. If you put those stories together, it's quite troubling. If they didn't have enough evidence to get for example a Title-3 warrant, a conventional warrant or to proceed with a criminal investigation and they had someone in the organization, that's very troubling because it indicates that they took this extraordinary step of violating the confidentiality of a political party or campaign, but they didn't have enough evidence to maintain a criminal investigation. So, that's what we really have to look at. If those facts are true, there is ample reason for everyone to be concerned."

Four in 10 GOP candidates for Congress so far have actually praised or echoed the President in the course of their political advertising in this cycle and perhaps, as interesting, not a single one of them is criticizing or openly distancing themselves from the President.

Those are the folks out there that are still hurting. Their health insurance, if they can even get it, continuous to be unaffordable because of Obamacare. So, we need to focus on all areas of our state and make sure they're growing just like Atlanta, Augusta and Savannah is, you know, quite honestly, the medical marijuana is definitely an issue in our state, and the state had made some movement on that. But, as far as cultivation and other things, I don't think you'll see that any time soon in our state. But I certainly understand the families and what they're going through with their kids. And I think there needs to be more clinical research on that. But, you know, I'm sticking to my message, Martha, of conservative values, cutting government, making it more efficient, defending our Second Amendment. We have a whole public safety reform of tracking and deporting criminals and going after street gangs in our state, because as a father of three teenage daughters I'm concerned about their safety, and I'm concerned about other Georgian's safety."

And I think that's stronger than things like Stormy Daniels and Russia. You even look at the recent poll about Mueller, and the majority of Americans believing it was political in nature to some -- to one point earlier, you can even look at states like Montana where Jon Tester is isn't going after President Trump. You look at least of these five -- hotly contested senate races in the general election, you're not going to see Democrats like Joe Manchin go after President Trump. You're not going to see people like Claire McCaskill going after him as well. You're going to see them try to positions themselves as, look, we're reasonable.

You could outlaw heroin and there are more addicts than there is on the streets of New York. You're trying to control the opioid crisis, that's not a pharmaceutical problem, that's a street drug problem. So, when you start hitting the patient, the patient that has a pain disorder or a cancer, when you start going after them, they become the victim, not the actual street customer."

I don't think -- if you're not asked to be a commencement speaker, that's a badge of honor, because they actually see you as a risk, they see you as dangerous. And, by the way, most of the stuff they give you is cliche path. They always tell you to follow your dreams. That's a bad idea. What if they're terrible, terrible dreams? You don't want to follow bad dreams. And they always say never give up. You know who never gives up? Stalkers. Sometimes you have to give up, Martha.

Also, today, Meghan Markle confirmed that her father will not be walking her down the aisle, and we're not sure exactly who will be doing the honors.

There is disagreement on the Iran nuclear deal. But I shouldn't exaggerate, we shouldn't exaggerate. We agree on the objectives, an Iran without nuclear weapons, an Iran that behaves better in the region, rather isn't developing ballistic missiles. The difference is, we want to keep the current deal and work on ballistic missiles and regional behavior, and this U.S. administration wants to re-negotiate the current deal.

It's a very different time for the royal family, isn't it?"

Longest reigning monarch in British history. But, you're right. The younger rolls, Prince William and Prince Harry are charismatic, hugely popular, have connected with the British public, particularly among the younger generation. And this wedding is a -- the interest in it and the enthusiasm is a demonstration of that. Also, I say as ambassador to the United States, it's wonderful that Prince Harry is marrying an American. It's a symbol of the strength and depth of our relationship."
