But tonight, we're going to start with some questions and several come to mind. Here's the most obvious one. What exactly is the allegation here in this new claim?

      "sentences": "Seemingly raped says Senator Blumenthal. What does that mean? It's important to ask because everything turns on that question. Is Swetnick claiming that Brett Kavanaugh raped her?

Did Brett Kavanaugh commit rape? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } None of that is clear from Swetnick's account, which is far more suggesting than it does stating. Read it yourself and see. Now Swetnick does claim that she herself was raped by a number of boys. Was Brett Kavanaugh among them, we don't know, which itself raises more basic question, why doesn't Swetnick's sworn and written statements spell out clearly what she claims Brett Kavanaugh did? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What is clear is that, according to Julie Swetnick, horrible things happened at a series of parties in suburban Maryland in the 1980s. We're not talking drunken high school naughtiness, these are war crimes level atrocities, the kinds of crimes the UN investigates in third world countries. Groups of young women drugged and gang-raped, it's horrifying. So why hasn't anyone taken all of this to law enforcement? Swetnick's lawyer sent her claims to the media, as he always does. Did he contact Maryland police first? They're the ones with jurisdiction here; are they investigating this? Is this the first time they have seen these allegations? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And if it is the first time, how can that be? Swetnick describes attending at least 10 parties at which public drugging and raping took place. Boys were lined up in a queue to commit rape, she claims, in full view of everyone. Did any of the many people at these rape scenes mention these crimes to anyone, to police, to their parents or their friends then or in the years since? Washington is a very small place, you may have noticed that, if you've been following the coverage of the Kavanaugh story. Among the permanent population here, everyone knows everyone or knows someone who does. So where are the witnesses to this, where are the people who would have spoken to witnesses about it over the past 35 years? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Did Swetnick herself tell anyone over that time?

That means she would have been in college at the time they took place and yet she went to parties with high school kids. At these parties, she saw horrific gang rapes, but she kept attending the parties, many of them until she herself was gang-raped, and yet she never reported any of that to police would be interesting to know why. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Maybe the most baffling of all though, how did the FBI miss the fact that Brett Kavanaugh was part of a prolific teenage rape ring?

One thing we learned today for certain though, Democrats badly want to control the Supreme Court. It's all that matters to them at the moment and they will do whatever it takes, and they are. The latest exhibit comes from the lawyer for pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, whom as you have heard by now, has a new client tonight. Her name is Julie Swetnick and she alleges that about 35 years ago, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was part of a group of teenage boys in the Washington DC area, who committed a series of gang rapes. Kavanaugh himself seemed bewildered today when he was asked about this claim. He described it as like being part of an episode of \"The Twilight Zone.\" Many observers felt the same about it. In the coming days, we'll have time to carefully assess all of these claims, of the many counterclaims in this story, and of course we'll bring all of that to you. But tonight, we're going to start with some questions and several come to mind. Here's the most obvious one. What exactly is the allegation here in this new claim?

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Seemingly raped says Senator Blumenthal. What does that mean? It's important to ask because everything turns on that question. Is Swetnick claiming that Brett Kavanaugh raped her? Is she saying someone else raped her? If so, who exactly is this person and where is this person today? Did Brett Kavanaugh commit rape? None of that is clear from Swetnick's account, which is far more suggesting than it does stating. Read it yourself and see. Now Swetnick does claim that she herself was raped by a number of boys. Was Brett Kavanaugh among them, we don't know, which itself raises more basic question, why doesn't Swetnick's sworn and written statements spell out clearly what she claims Brett Kavanaugh did? What is clear is that, according to Julie Swetnick, horrible things happened at a series of parties in suburban Maryland in the 1980s. We're not talking drunken high school naughtiness, these are war crimes level atrocities, the kinds of crimes the UN investigates in third world countries. Groups of young women drugged and gang-raped, it's horrifying. So why hasn't anyone taken all of this to law enforcement? Swetnick's lawyer sent her claims to the media, as he always does. Did he contact Maryland police first? They're the ones with jurisdiction here; are they investigating this? Is this the first time they have seen these allegations? And if it is the first time, how can that be? Swetnick describes attending at least 10 parties at which public drugging and raping took place. Boys were lined up in a queue to commit rape, she claims, in full view of everyone. Did any of the many people at these rape scenes mention these crimes to anyone, to police, to their parents or their friends then or in the years since? Washington is a very small place, you may have noticed that, if you've been following the coverage of the Kavanaugh story. Among the permanent population here, everyone knows everyone or knows someone who does. So where are the witnesses to this, where are the people who would have spoken to witnesses about it over the past 35 years? Did Swetnick herself tell anyone over that time? Kavanaugh's attorney Beth Wilkinson raised these questions today."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Fair questions. What's the answer? And by the way, what was Julie Swetnick doing at these parties? Swetnick apparently graduated from high school in 1980. That means she would have been in college at the time they took place and yet she went to parties with high school kids. At these parties, she saw horrific gang rapes, but she kept attending the parties, many of them until she herself was gang-raped, and yet she never reported any of that to police would be interesting to know why. Maybe the most baffling of all though, how did the FBI miss the fact that Brett Kavanaugh was part of a prolific teenage rape ring? Kavanaugh has been personally investigated by the FBI six separate times as part of federal background checks. As staff secretary in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh had the highest possible security clearance, one that allowed him access to this country's nuclear codes. FBI agents would have spoken to a huge variety of people who knew or knew of Kavanaugh during his high school years, and not one of them mentioned he was a serial rapist who committed his rapes in crowded rooms full of classmates. How did that happen? And if it did happen, we know that FBI investigators are criminally incompetent, so incompetent they missed a glaring fact like that, so why would we want them to reinvestigate Brett Kavanaugh a seventh time? Normal people might wonder about all of this, not the media. How dare you ask, they scold questions are forbidden here."

      "utterance": "They call this victim blaming. Of course that depends upon who you think the victim is. Dumb people on television have already made up their minds about that obviously and they'd like you to shut up. But there's no reason you should. You're an American citizen, this is your country, it is your Supreme Court, it is your justice system. This process does not belong to cable news anchors or creepy porn lawyers or even to U.S. senators who have decided to give up on due process and instead would like to rule by accusation and screaming. No, it belongs to you too and you have a right to ask whatever questions you want and to expect adult answers, and you should. Well tonight breaking as well, the Senate Judiciary Committee has released new transcripts of two interviews with Brett Kavanaugh about the allegations against him. Mollie Hemingway is the senior editor at The Federalist and she joins us to discuss all of this. So Mollie, first to the claims brought by Stormy Daniels' lawyer earlier today. How do you assess them, what questions come immediately to mind when you read them, and what effect do you think they will have on this process?"

    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "So this woman is alleging that, while she was an adult, she attended parties that were hosted by children, where other children were raped by the minors in attendance. She asserts by her own claim that she attended ten of these parties that she witnessed these gang rapes and that she continued to go to them, doing nothing while she was an adult, and these children were engaged in this behavior. I find it a little difficult to believe that story on its face. As you know, many people in the media are taking it very seriously. They think it's very real that Judge Kavanaugh was the leader of a child gang rape cartel that somehow managed to not be discovered until four days before he was about to be confirmed on the Supreme Court. That is something I think most journalists should be a little more skeptical of, they should have natural skepticism. They rightly pointed out that it was wrong to engage in a conspiracy theory, about Pizzagate and child rape then, they condemned people for believing that. And yet, here they are critically receiving and promulgating this information that I think most reasonable people would say is a little difficult to buy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Do you think, since you live in this area, do you think that it is plausible that if you had gang-rapes taking place in public in a crowded room, not just one but ten of them, serial gang rapes that nobody could be located to corroborate that this happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "If there were ten gang rape parties where gang rapes occurred, I would imagine there would be many witnesses and much evidence to support this claim. And in fact, it would be shocking that it hadn't come out already. Find it personally shocking that any woman would see a child being gang- raped and not do something about that, much less that she would continue to go to parties where this happened. It's a very difficult thing for me to believe, although maybe she has evidence to support this - those questions, so yes."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Totally apart from the politics of it, it's very important for the country that we not make this the standard by which we allow things to happen. It is very important that people not be able to be bullied out of a nomination by outlandish claims and that it is just so crucial that we believe that people are innocent until proven guilty. To say that these claims don't come close to meeting the standard of guilt is a huge understatement. And so, I think it's actually important for everybody to not let bullies control the process, to understand that people do have a right to have a fair and normal and sane nomination battle, and what we're seeing right now is none of those things."

      "utterance": "Well, if that hearing does go forward, my understanding is that she will assist the Judiciary Committee in trying to obtain information and get to the ground truth of whatever allegations have been made, and cover the scope of those during the hearing. Exactly how she's going to do that, I've left her alone, as I do with my prosecutors when they're about ready to go into trial, and she'll be developing that line of questioning based upon her training, background, and experience, and whatever specific guidance she might get from the Committee on areas of inquiry they really want her to cover."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So what's her posture, what are her assumptions going into this? When she speaks to someone who has alleged a crime, a felony against somebody else, who says she's a victim, is the assumption from the prosecutor that she's telling the truth, that she's not, or is it neutral?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MONTGOMERY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's neutral. What Rachel will do is go in and start by listening and listen to what the allegations are, listen to what people are saying. Now, she certainly has a victim-centered focus as a prosecutor, but that doesn't mean you can accept as ground truth everything that's said. It's really important for prosecutors, and something she's been doing for about 25 years, to listen to all the facts, assess what can be proven, what can be corroborated, what needs corroboration, and then conduct an overall review of the information that she's got in order to make a decision. Now, ordinarily for us as prosecutors, that decision is whether or not we should charge somebody with a crime, seek an indictment and prosecute. That's not the scenario we have here. But that basic approach to getting information and trying to assess credibility and what type of corroboration there might be, that skill set is equally applicable."
    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

Brett Kavanaugh's childhood friend Mark Judge, most people never heard of him, is now the center of very intense criticism from the Left just because he's been named; he hasn't said anything. Do you think she's ready for that? I mean she could see her own character assassinated if she asked questions that Democrats don't like."

Back here in her home jurisdiction, those who have litigated against Rachel, those who've worked with her, worked for her, or who've had the privilege of supervising her know what her reputation is, and it's based upon her performance, her actions and how she treats other people. And nothing that happens in the hearing tomorrow will be able to affect that. She'll be able to come back to her job - hope she comes back to her job. She'll be able to come back to her job and pick up where she left off, and she's very well grounded, professional, fair and objective. And once she's done with this, she'll be able to leave it behind. That was a task that she was called upon to do, she'll perform it, and then it'll be done. And just like prosecutors have to move from one case to the next, and particularly in this area where her background is in sex crimes--"

Your previous guest hit the nail right on the head. Prosecutors review cases and prepare for trial with an eye toward justice, not a conviction, but justice. And here you've got an account that has some credibility issues and so I expect this prosecutor, this seasoned prosecutor, to go over Dr. Ford's memory to talk to her about other events that were happening in her life at the time, to test her memory, to ask her about the circumstances of her first disclosure to the therapist, the circumstances of the letter that she's written, and the inaccuracies in some of her accounts, or at least they are internally inaccurate, right. At one point she says it's her and four boys. At one point she says two boys were in the room and another it's four boys and for two girls, then it's four boys and one girl. All of these inconsistencies will be challenged by the prosecutor."

Two hundred years or jurisprudence argue against believing a bare accusation. And people say, \"Oh it's not a criminal trial, it's a job interview.\" I don't care what it is, you're calling someone a sex offender and a rapist. He has absolutely every right to have those allegations challenged, tested, and even questioned, and that's not victim blaming, it's simply seeking justice."

Just go ahead and take - keep everyone in prison who's there and let everyone just start writing in letter accusations and make an allegation and someone goes to prison. That is not this country, it's not the country I grew up in, it's not the country I was a prosecutor in for many years, and it's not the country I want to be in."

The presumption of innocence isn't just a criminal court value; it's actually a human right. It's a civilizational value and it's what Viscount Sankey called the golden thread in English Law. And what these people like Kirsten Gillibrand, who's a lawyer, is actually doing is taking the scissors and cutting up the golden thread. Now, she says it's not a Criminal Court. No, it's beyond that. It's the Senate in its advice and consent - actually it's the it's the U.S. equivalent of the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor in England appoints judges; the Senate does it here. And so, what that does, when the state actually says there's no presumption of innocence. 100 Americans out of 300 million get to be U.S. senators and if they don't believe in the presumption of innocence, that's something that every American should be concerned about. When the most powerful figures in the land like Kirsten Gillibrand are willing to trash - you mentioned Mark Judge. For the next 30 years, when anybody Googles his name- -"

So, I don't think she's the right person to question Dr. Ford and there needs to be cross- examination not only of her, but of the new Avenatti allegation. That affidavit is so deeply flawed and so open-ended that any good lawyer, any good defense attorney would be able to tear that apart in 30 seconds. It's an embarrassment to the law that anybody would file an affidavit like that filled with hearsay, filled with 'well, I was raped but he didn't rape me. He was there. He saw it. Where was he? There are witnesses, people told me. It happened ten times. I went back. I knew there were rapes going on, but I went back to the party.' This is such a deeply flawed affidavit.
