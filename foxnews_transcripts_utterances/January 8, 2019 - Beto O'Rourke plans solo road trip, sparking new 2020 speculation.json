      "sentences": "Big important evening, Brett. Thank you very much. So, the question folks at home, will President Trump bargain amnesty for his wall or will he lay down the gauntlet tonight on the national emergency as he sees it. Senator Marco Rubio answers questions about that in moments. And as Brett just said, in under two hours, President Trump will do something that only a president of the United States can do. An address from The Oval Office to the American people. It is reserved for very important moments. An attempts at persuasion for the American people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For years, Democrats have said, yes we want a secure border. The president, of course, agrees with that. Tonight, he's going to say that the situation is a crisis. He's going to try to convince doubters that it is a danger to the country. Much is at stake. This is his biggest campaign promise was to build a wall. Where now, as it's called perhaps a fence with steel slats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The point is it's going to be one that you can't get over, you can't go under, and you can't ram through the soft spots. You would have to enter the United States through an actual port of entry. Which many believed would be safer for everyone concerned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president has asked for just $5.6 billion in this agreement right now. And, of course, sounds like a lot of money to you and me. But look at it compared to the money that is spent by the federal government. A tiny sliver of the pie that is so small, in fact, that you can barely see it. $5.6 billion at a $4.4 trillion in American taxpayer dollars that run the government and everything having to do with it, less than one percent. Also worth mentioning, Democrats right now are proposing $12 billion -- about twice that amount in foreign aid. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In moments, Geraldo Rivera and Juan Williams on the stakes for the president tonight in his very first Oval Office address, and the most important bully puppet probably in the world. But first, here is Senator Marco Rubio. Senator, good evening.

He's actually offered to not just take in the people that applied for DACA but the people who were eligible and didn't. So, frankly, he's got above and beyond what others have offered in the past.

We support legal immigration, you can have a debate and people can argue about what the right number should be. But right now, every year, 1 million people -- over a million people every year come to the United States legally, OK? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Number two, if you -- so you can support a system of legal immigration. But that means that you also have to have a system that identifies people before they come in, that allows you to vet who they are, that allows you to control the numbers, and allows people to enter in an orderly process. We do that with everything else in life. You can't just show up at a concert without a ticket. You can't just get on an airplane without going through TSA, and you can't just go into any country in the world because you decide just to walk in. There has to be a process. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, when we talk about a wall, a wall isn't just about keeping people out. A wall is to funnel traffic so that someone who's crossing the border has to cross an appointed entry where they can be monitored, or you can check who they are, and you can check what they're bringing. And I would have one more point in all this. This is not just about immigration. This is about the humanitarian crisis that a porous border presents for the country. When people believe that they're going to be able to get across that border, they go on that journey. It's a dangerous journey, they bring children with them. Young families, people are dying on the way here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The only people winning here are the traffickers. It's bad for Mexico, it's bad for America, it's bad for these migrants, and it's -- a wall is part of the solution. It's not the only thing we have to do, but it's a part of it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, one last point, I apologize, the $5 billion isn't just for a wall. It is to fund the top 10 priorities in the border security plan that does include a wall. It includes other things, as well. And many of the people opposed to that. Voted for $20 million -- $20 billion of funding for border security in 2013.",

That deal appears to be off the table, at least, at the moment. And what we're hearing now from the White House is that he's more dug in on this than ever. Take a look at one of the quotes from a couple of his supporters who want nothing to do with any kind of DREAMer exchange. This one from the ALIPAC president, \"Any support of DACA amnesty, before, or after construction of the border wall is a betrayal to his campaign promises.\" This from Kris Kobach, \"Any amnesty, whether it's DACA or some other amnesty, will have incredibly negative consequences for the country.\" Your thoughts, sir.",

How is that good for anyone? It certainly not good for us, and it's -- and it's blending itself to this trafficking network that's trafficking in human beings. But again, beyond immigration, drugs are crossing that border. Every day. And guns are going back the other way into Mexico. That's why there's got to be more control there.",

The problem with this -- Mayor de Blasio says that this is going to cost $100 million. If he believe that, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. It's not going to cost a $100 million because what's going to happen is this.

Undocumented immigrants are by definition undocumented, so therefore you cannot ask them for proof of residency. You can't ask them for proof of income. You -- they're undocumented immigrants. So if you offer free health care pay direct single-payer health care to undocumented immigrants by definition, you're offering it to everybody. So my -- and this is -- that's going to blow the costs through the roof way over $100 million. So my advice to New Yorkers is move over to Hoboken so you don't have to get -- so you don't have to pay the taxes that he's going to impose on you and then come across the river on the path train to get your free health care. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So, the question folks at home, will President Trump bargain amnesty for his wall or will he lay down the gauntlet tonight on the national emergency as he sees it. Senator Marco Rubio answers questions about that in moments. And as Brett just said, in under two hours, President Trump will do something that only a president of the United States can do. An address from The Oval Office to the American people. It is reserved for very important moments. An attempts at persuasion for the American people. For years, Democrats have said, yes we want a secure border. The president, of course, agrees with that. Tonight, he's going to say that the situation is a crisis. He's going to try to convince doubters that it is a danger to the country. Much is at stake. This is his biggest campaign promise was to build a wall. Where now, as it's called perhaps a fence with steel slats. The point is it's going to be one that you can't get over, you can't go under, and you can't ram through the soft spots. You would have to enter the United States through an actual port of entry. Which many believed would be safer for everyone concerned. The president has asked for just $5.6 billion in this agreement right now. And, of course, sounds like a lot of money to you and me. But look at it compared to the money that is spent by the federal government. A tiny sliver of the pie that is so small, in fact, that you can barely see it. $5.6 billion at a $4.4 trillion in American taxpayer dollars that run the government and everything having to do with it, less than one percent. Also worth mentioning, Democrats right now are proposing $12 billion -- about twice that amount in foreign aid. In moments, Geraldo Rivera and Juan Williams on the stakes for the president tonight in his very first Oval Office address, and the most important bully puppet probably in the world. But first, here is Senator Marco Rubio. Senator, good evening. Great to have you with us this evening."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but, well first, all of the presidents's already offered amnesty to DREAMers. He's actually offered to not just take in the people that applied for DACA but the people who were eligible and didn't. So, frankly, he's got above and beyond what others have offered in the past. And even that was not enough for the Democrats and that negotiation. Here is the bottom line. We support legal immigration, you can have a debate and people can argue about what the right number should be. But right now, every year, 1 million people -- over a million people every year come to the United States legally, OK? Number two, if you -- so you can support a system of legal immigration. But that means that you also have to have a system that identifies people before they come in, that allows you to vet who they are, that allows you to control the numbers, and allows people to enter in an orderly process. We do that with everything else in life. You can't just show up at a concert without a ticket. You can't just get on an airplane without going through TSA, and you can't just go into any country in the world because you decide just to walk in. There has to be a process. Now, when we talk about a wall, a wall isn't just about keeping people out. A wall is to funnel traffic so that someone who's crossing the border has to cross an appointed entry where they can be monitored, or you can check who they are, and you can check what they're bringing. And I would have one more point in all this. This is not just about immigration. This is about the humanitarian crisis that a porous border presents for the country. When people believe that they're going to be able to get across that border, they go on that journey. It's a dangerous journey, they bring children with them. Young families, people are dying on the way here. The only people winning here are the traffickers. It's bad for Mexico, it's bad for America, it's bad for these migrants, and it's -- a wall is part of the solution. It's not the only thing we have to do, but it's a part of it. By the way, one last point, I apologize, the $5 billion isn't just for a wall. It is to fund the top 10 priorities in the border security plan that does include a wall. It includes other things, as well. And many of the people opposed to that. Voted for $20 million -- $20 billion of funding for border security in 2013."

That deal appears to be off the table, at least, at the moment. And what we're hearing now from the White House is that he's more dug in on this than ever. Take a look at one of the quotes from a couple of his supporters who want nothing to do with any kind of DREAMer exchange. This one from the ALIPAC president, \"Any support of DACA amnesty, before, or after construction of the border wall is a betrayal to his campaign promises.\" This from Kris Kobach, \"Any amnesty, whether it's DACA or some other amnesty, will have incredibly negative consequences for the country.\" Your thoughts, sir."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't -- I don't believe that, that should be negotiated as part of this. This is -- look, no matter what someone believes about whether we should give amnesty to people that have been here a long time or not, whether you should deport everybody. The one thing we should all agree on is that every country in the world has a system by which they monitor, control, who comes in, when they come in, and how they come in, and the United States should be no different. Every other nation on earth does that. Mexico does it, Guatemala does it, Canada does it, and America should do it. And we have a problem on the southern border of not just people being trafficked but drugs, almost all this heroin that's finding itself in the street, the fentanyl that's being shipped in from China. A lot of that it's coming across that border. So, even if we didn't have an immigration problem, you have a rationale for limiting how people could come in, and what can come into our borders."

I'm here to make a difference into past laws and to do serious stuff. And the bottom line is that no matter who the president of the United States is, whether you like them or not, one of the fundamental obligations of the federal government is to enforce our immigration laws. In essence, what they are -- so people that opposes are basically saying, \"Yes, we want to have immigration laws. But we don't want you to enforce them.\" And I think that's the question is what are you in favor of? What enforcement measures are you in favor of? Because the biggest threat to legal immigration is illegal immigration. It has turned immigration, which is something that we are a nation of immigrants into a controversial topic because we still welcome 1-1/2 -- 1.2 million people every single year into this country legally. But they're saying, anyone, who comes you should be able to stay here or we should just look the other way. I know they give lip service to border security and enforce the law. But they know in practical terms, what they are advocating is that anyone who comes here gets to stay here. How is that good for anyone? It certainly not good for us, and it's -- and it's blending itself to this trafficking network that's trafficking in human beings. But again, beyond immigration, drugs are crossing that border. Every day. And guns are going back the other way into Mexico. That's why there's got to be more control there."

Obviously, that's not even what we're discussing tonight. And then the question about whether or not it's a national emergency. Is it Pearl Harbor? You know, is this 9/11? I don't think so. I mean, was it we've had today. I think back in 2000, five times more illegal crossings than we have today or tonight.

      "speaker": "OSEFO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I think what he's trying to do here, he's trying to put a bandaid on the leaking faucet. Because the truth of the matter is in New York City Health System has been in a deficit for years because they've been paying for E.R. visits for the uninsured. Now, what's happening here with this new initiative is they're trying to say we want to give people access to primary care providers as well as specialty providers. Instead of saying that the emergency rule will be your first entry way. So you know, my sister she's a surgeon, she agrees with this as well. And I think that what they are trying to do is they're saying, we're going to spend these millions of dollars but we spend them anyway when people go to the hospital and they don't have insurance. And quite frankly, as an American, as a taxpayer, I rather our government spend millions of dollars for health care for individuals than them spending on something frivolous like let's say a wall. But that's my opinion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, that's also what they said before they passed ObamaCare and guess what happened. The year after they passed ObamaCare, emergency room visits skyrocketed to record numbers because people felt now that they could show up and they didn't be have to be embarrassed because they had an insurance card so they could show up at the E.R. So actually, the record is the opposite of what Wendy said. They are -- the ER visits increase in the cost skyrocket. But here's the thing. The problem with this -- Mayor de Blasio says that this is going to cost $100 million. If he believe that, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. It's not going to cost a $100 million because what's going to happen is this. People from all over the country are going to flood into New York to get their free health care, and here's why, because they're offering it to illegal immigrants or as they like to call them undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants are by definition undocumented, so therefore you cannot ask them for proof of residency. You can't ask them for proof of income. You -- they're undocumented immigrants. So if you offer free health care pay direct single-payer health care to undocumented immigrants by definition, you're offering it to everybody. So my -- and this is -- that's going to blow the costs through the roof way over $100 million. So my advice to New Yorkers is move over to Hoboken so you don't have to get -- so you don't have to pay the taxes that he's going to impose on you and then come across the river on the path train to get your free health care."

Now, all of these laws are basically an effort to break through the firewall of Roe to get -- all of these states have been trying different combinations to see if they could get federal courts to acknowledge that states have a voice into the conditions surrounding abortion. Because the belief is that the Supreme Court will remain an incrementalist (ph) court. The people like Roberts are not going to want to just simply overturn Roe v. Wade or he says the assumption.

President Obama did that in the last administration, brought us together when we were deeply divided, and I think we've never been more divided than we are right now. So, we need somebody who can bring us above our partisanship and divisiveness and bring Americans together for something greater than ourselves. And that's what he did in the Senate race. He got really, really close. I think he can do it as president."

Bush, Fox News contributor and a Texas resident who was not so taken with this candidate in the Texas race and told us here on the Story many times that he could not win Texas. Listening to all of that what do you make of where he is so far as a potential candidate, Karl?"

The question is, are the weaknesses that he displayed in running against Ted Cruz going to hurt his campaign if he enters the race for the presidency? He was a loner. He thinks he is the smartest guy in the room and as a result he's very reckless. He goes out and says things that don't advance his cause. In Texas, a red state, he came out for impeachment of Donald Trump in June. He came out for free college, a guaranteed federal job, a guaranteed wage, Medicare for all. And as you just saw on that footage, he came out in September and said he couldn't think of anything more American than deciding to take a knee when the flag pass by."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. You're right. The message could help him in the Democratic primary. But the weakness is, is he going to be -- is he going to be thoughtful, is he going to be -- is he going to have a plan because - - look, he was basically running by himself. In 2017 up till by the Labor Day to 2018, he was just out there himself. Ted Cruz was not engaged with him. There was really no serious campaign. The people didn't pay attention to what he said or criticize what he said. But you run for president, particularly with 20 other people in the Democratic primary and everything you say and everything you do is going to be subjected to far more scrutiny than he had in Texas. So, yes -- no, he is charismatic. He knows social media. He is personable. But I think that sort of recklessness of I'm the smartest guy in the room and I don't need to listen to advice and I can just sort of wing it. Those may have worked in Texas under the circumstances that he had. I'm not certain they would work in the national race where you are going to be looked at each and every day not only by the press corps but by a lot of people who don't want you to advance your cause against theirs."

Minutes after deputies arrived at the West Hollywood home of a 64- year-old Edward Buck, an unidentified black adult male was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of death is now under investigation, but drug use appears to be a strong possibility. And Edward Buck's attorney was quick to point out that his client was sober and did not give the victim drugs. Watch."

His death was ruled accidental because there wasn't concrete evidence proving Edward Buck either possessed or provided drugs to Gemmel Moore. Though the case was briefly reopened after investigators found one of Gemmel Moore's journal entries that read, quoting here, \"I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was very painful, but after all the troubles I became addicted.\" And in Moore's final entry he wrote, quote, \"If it didn't hurt so bad, I'd kill myself, but I'll let Ed Buck do it for now.\" In recent years, Ed Buck has donated hundreds of thousands to Democratic causes and candidates including the campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He is also well known in LGBTQ political circles. But now protestors have been gathering in front of his home, calling Buck a danger to the community and calling for justice. Watch."

President Trump has been very clear in what he is trying to accomplish in keeping this country safe. And the vice president came tonight meet with our whole conference along with the secretary of homeland security Nielsen, to lay out just how bad the crisis is at the border and why the president is so committed to solve it. Now the president has laid out a number of 5.6 billion. And that's a number that came from our security experts, the people who put their lives on the line every day to keep our country safe said that's how much it's going to take to secure the border. Nancy Pelosi just last week kind of jokingly said her counter offer is a dollar."

He has laid out the fact that he is willing to declare a national emergency if he can find a way within his power to do that and to move money around to do that. If there is no indication that Democrats are coming to the table, do you believe that tonight he will say if you don't, I am willing to do this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure just how much of that the president is going to get into. But I spoke to the president earlier today. And he is very passionate about this. This is something he campaigned and was elected president on, and that's a commitment to secure our border. It involves building a wall, it involves other technology. Our border patrol agents who are under attack by a lot of these people that are criminals in the caravan. They need the protection and the proper backing too. So, the president is committed to securing the border. If the other side is just committed to playing politics, I don't think the American people are going to stand for that much longer. So, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get serious about a counter offer on the table. They've yet to do that, they've yet to try to negotiate in good faith. The president I think has been very clear on what he is trying to do. And he said he is willing to work on an agreement that brings the two sides together but that means the other side, Pelosi and Schumer, have to be willing to solve this too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, they have to think that it's politically advantageous for them to negotiate at all. Here's Steny Hoyer talking about the shutdown a little while ago. Watch this. It's a quote. \"This is the third shutdown implemented to take hostage of the people's government and people who work for the government. In another context we would be calling that an act of kidnapping or terrorism,\" he says. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Well, what he ought to pay attention to is the kidnapping, the sexual assault and the human trafficking that's actually going on, on the border today. We've got some alarming numbers and I'm sure the president will share of them, Martha. But last year alone more than 17,000 people were stopped coming into our country from the southern border who had past criminal convictions. Those are just the ones we caught, Martha. So, if you look at caravan, if you look at some of the women that are coming over. Doctors Without Borders estimates over 30 percent of the women that are coming over through the southern border are sexually assaulted. Is he concerned about those sexual assaults? What about the over 900 children that our ICE agents saved last year alone from human trafficking and sexual assault? It's really going on. When over 90 percent of the heroin in America comes from across the southern border illegally, there is a crisis. They've got to get serious about solving this crisis. And if they think joking about it are just trying to divert attention is going to solve it, they are not serious."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "The president has his work cut out for him tonight. Because all the polls that we see say that most people do not believe that we need to build a wall. And so, he is going to have to use this address the first one of its kind for him to look into that camera. There's not going to be a rally going on. It's just going to be him and the camera in the Oval Office to really lay out and articulate his argument in a way that's persuasive for people who don't agree with him right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, it says a lot about how serious President Trump is to securing the border that he chose this issue for his first national address to the country. And I think a lot of people will be watching who are undecided who just really don't know. You know, they are coming off the holidays, they've heard there is a government shutdown and they want to know what's happening. Here is the opportunity for the president to layout his case. Hopefully it spurs the other side to finally get serious."
