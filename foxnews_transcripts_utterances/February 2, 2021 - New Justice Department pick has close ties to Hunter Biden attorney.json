      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "And welcome to Hannity. Tonight, the ongoing five-year smear campaign against former president, or as Jimmy Acosta says, President Trump on exile, disguised as yet another Senate impeachment trial is set to proceed early next week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One big problem for the Democrats, the media mob, we already know the outcome. The former president will be acquitted. Forty-five senators already on record saying the whole thing is unconstitutional and it is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It doesn't seem to matter to this new radical extreme Democratic Party, and Mr. Unity is not weighing in. They will never miss an opportunity to try to politically bludgeon Donald Trump. They will do anything to prevent him from running again in 2024. That threat, that fear is palpable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, in the middle of a pandemic, lawmakers will be focused on yet another unfounded impeachment charade Schiff show, and ultimately, we know the outcome. President Trump will be acquitted for three main reasons. Let's start with reason one. The trial is -- they are right -- the 45 Republicans, it's totally unconstitutional. The U.S. Senate has no jurisdiction over a private citizen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That is clear-cut. That is simple. You don't need to be a Harvard law grad to figure it out. And there is a reason that John Roberts is not presiding. And now, with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, imagine this, presiding. Yeah, it's officially a kangaroo court because he's already said he wants a conviction. Wow, that's real equal justice and due process, isn't it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, number two, the reason this will fail -- the incitement claims are bogus. Look at this. You even have the fake news media, \"The Washington Post,\" CNN, we also have the FBI and court documents, and now even, Congresswoman Alexandria Cortez saying that the capitol breach was pre- planned well before January 6th, and we have details and even videos to prove that point. Oh, it wasn't spontaneous incitement based on words. It was planned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And three Democrats now are setting what is an insane standard for what will constitute -- their favorite new word -- insurrectionist rhetoric that they will be highlighting. Now, according to the article of impeachment, President Trump is accused of inciting an insurrection because of his remarks on January 6th, quote, he willfully made statements that in context encouraged -- and foreseeable resulted in -- lawless action at the capitol such as if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. Just think about how crazy that is. Democrats are officially trying to remove a former president from an office he no longer holds because he told his supporters to fight like hell. And, by the way, he also said at the rally, now, many of you will peacefully and patriotically march to the capitol to make your voices heard. Keyword: peacefully. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, of course, that part is always conveniently left out of the impeachment article and what the mob and media tells you. So, if this is the new standard for incitement to insurrection, then when will we begin the process of holding everyone in the Democratic Party and the left accountable for their words and actions? Because the list is long. And as you might imagine, they frequently encourage their supporters, believe it or not, they encourage this, to fight like hell. Well, we did a little background check and we found out, fairly common term. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He physically threatened two U.S. Supreme Court justices right on the steps of the United States Supreme Court building. Based on his standards, Chuck Schumer needs to be impeached. Republicans, you ought to put forward the article. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you're going to follow their standards, Maxine Waters encouraged her supporters to harass and attack White House employees, remember, and follow them into the grocery store and create a crowd and get in their faces. They aren't wanted anywhere anymore. And don't forget, she also said I'm going to take Trump out tonight. That sounds like a threat of murder. Joe Biden openly fantasizing about taking a sitting president, Donald Trump, behind the gym and beating the hell out of him. That sounds like a threat. Sounds insurrectionist. And almost every Democrat excused, ignored or condoned the violent riots from over the summer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So let's focus now on applying these same standards to all of these Democrats and we'll start tonight with one person in particular. Now, remember, days after a Minneapolis precinct was burned to the ground, and then the violent riots that ensued, and they were wreaking havoc on multiple cities, including Minneapolis, and then Senator Harris said, they are not going to stop, and you beware. They are not going to stop. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, Police precinct was just burned down. Remember, they were just in the middle of rioting. They are not going to stop before the election, Election Day in November. They are not going to stop after Election Day. And everyone, you need to take note of that on both levels. They're not going to let up. They should not, and we should not. Oh, my gosh. Wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } To that end, Kamala Harris even promoted a bail fund to get violence rioters involved in the insurrection out of jail. According to a brand-new FOXNews.com report tonight, one accused rioter was bailed out twice thanks to this fund, the one Kamala Harris supported. And wouldn't you believe it, he's just been arrested for yet a third time. Remember, according to Kamala, they aren't going to let up even after the election. They shouldn't let up. Vice President Harris was clearly calling for insurrection. Is Vice President Harris not guilty of incitement? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If we apply the Democratic Party standards and she's in office, you could have an impeachment, one that's constitutional, she can be removed from office and John Roberts will have to preside. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, will congressional Democrats, the media mob ever hold her accountable? Don't hold your breath. Or is the post-presidential impeachment show just one big political charade as I'm saying? Republican members now need to apply the same standards to all elected officials. That's one way to end this madness. Should they really? No, but if they are going to play that game and that's their standard, all the rules should apply equally. And now that we have the Honorable Patrick Leahy presiding, the guy that's already determined that Trump is guilty, maybe we should let Jim Jordan preside, and imagine having a trial where the judge and half the jury come out against you. It's beyond ludicrous. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And on Monday, Senator Lindsey Graham rightly issued a stern warning, not physical warning, but a warning, to his Democratic colleagues.

This is the same person that's been checked by \"PolitiFact\" 10 times. And eight of those 10 times, they determined that she was telling half truths, completely untruths or being pants on fire. So, hopefully, she's not the person that will be the truth czar in this situation. As far as the daily briefings, and questions being given in advance, it is interesting that \"The Daily Beast\" story. The literal headline story is, White House reporters, Biden team asks for questions in advance. So it's not like it's topics that were shared during a gaggle with the press secretary before a particular press briefing. We're talking about questions now. And Tara Palmeri, who's with \"Politico\", she's former ABC, she's regarded as a solid reporter in most circles. She says this. Quote: If Psaki knows you have a tough question, she doesn't call for you. So far, she hasn't had to deal with a real bomb. You wonder why that may be. So, look, we saw this going back to the campaign, in terms of Joe Biden, whenever he took questions, it was done, given a predetermined list of reporters, that a staff decided on beforehand. So, Joe Biden, you know, the future leader of the free world, now the leader of the free world, wouldn't call on reporters himself. He depended on his staffer to do it. Those reporters were mostly cordial. Instead of asking challenging questions, and the Peter Doocys of the world were boxed out, where he actually had to yell questions after the fact in order to even get anything in. So, in terms of being the most accessible president of all time or in terms of anything regarding transparency, this is the exact opposite that we saw under President Trump who took any questions at any time and didn't need a staffer to call on reporters. He called on them himself, and you could agree or disagree with the answer, but he was the most accessible president of all time to the point where in his four years, he probably took more questions than the previous three presidents did in their eight years combined.

      "utterance": "And welcome to Hannity. Tonight, the ongoing five-year smear campaign against former president, or as Jimmy Acosta says, President Trump on exile, disguised as yet another Senate impeachment trial is set to proceed early next week. One big problem for the Democrats, the media mob, we already know the outcome. The former president will be acquitted. Forty-five senators already on record saying the whole thing is unconstitutional and it is. It doesn't seem to matter to this new radical extreme Democratic Party, and Mr. Unity is not weighing in. They will never miss an opportunity to try to politically bludgeon Donald Trump. They will do anything to prevent him from running again in 2024. That threat, that fear is palpable. So, in the middle of a pandemic, lawmakers will be focused on yet another unfounded impeachment charade Schiff show, and ultimately, we know the outcome. President Trump will be acquitted for three main reasons. Let's start with reason one. The trial is -- they are right -- the 45 Republicans, it's totally unconstitutional. The U.S. Senate has no jurisdiction over a private citizen. That is clear-cut. That is simple. You don't need to be a Harvard law grad to figure it out. And there is a reason that John Roberts is not presiding. And now, with Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, imagine this, presiding. Yeah, it's officially a kangaroo court because he's already said he wants a conviction. Wow, that's real equal justice and due process, isn't it? So, number two, the reason this will fail -- the incitement claims are bogus. Look at this. You even have the fake news media, \"The Washington Post,\" CNN, we also have the FBI and court documents, and now even, Congresswoman Alexandria Cortez saying that the capitol breach was pre- planned well before January 6th, and we have details and even videos to prove that point. Oh, it wasn't spontaneous incitement based on words. It was planned. And three Democrats now are setting what is an insane standard for what will constitute -- their favorite new word -- insurrectionist rhetoric that they will be highlighting. Now, according to the article of impeachment, President Trump is accused of inciting an insurrection because of his remarks on January 6th, quote, he willfully made statements that in context encouraged -- and foreseeable resulted in -- lawless action at the capitol such as if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Just think about how crazy that is. Democrats are officially trying to remove a former president from an office he no longer holds because he told his supporters to fight like hell. And, by the way, he also said at the rally, now, many of you will peacefully and patriotically march to the capitol to make your voices heard. Keyword",
      "utterance": "peacefully. And, of course, that part is always conveniently left out of the impeachment article and what the mob and media tells you. So, if this is the new standard for incitement to insurrection, then when will we begin the process of holding everyone in the Democratic Party and the left accountable for their words and actions? Because the list is long. And as you might imagine, they frequently encourage their supporters, believe it or not, they encourage this, to fight like hell. Well, we did a little background check and we found out, fairly common term. Take a look."

      "utterance": "And Obama said, if they bring a knife, we bring a gun. Keep in mind, what you just this pales in comparison to the violent rhetoric from several top Democrats, although many Democrats have made similar comments. We start with Chuckie Schumer. He physically threatened two U.S. Supreme Court justices right on the steps of the United States Supreme Court building. Based on his standards, Chuck Schumer needs to be impeached. Republicans, you ought to put forward the article. If you're going to follow their standards, Maxine Waters encouraged her supporters to harass and attack White House employees, remember, and follow them into the grocery store and create a crowd and get in their faces. They aren't wanted anywhere anymore. And don't forget, she also said I'm going to take Trump out tonight. That sounds like a threat of murder. Joe Biden openly fantasizing about taking a sitting president, Donald Trump, behind the gym and beating the hell out of him. That sounds like a threat. Sounds insurrectionist. And almost every Democrat excused, ignored or condoned the violent riots from over the summer. So let's focus now on applying these same standards to all of these Democrats and we'll start tonight with one person in particular. Now, remember, days after a Minneapolis precinct was burned to the ground, and then the violent riots that ensued, and they were wreaking havoc on multiple cities, including Minneapolis, and then Senator Harris said, they are not going to stop, and you beware. They are not going to stop. Remember, Police precinct was just burned down. Remember, they were just in the middle of rioting. They are not going to stop before the election, Election Day in November. They are not going to stop after Election Day. And everyone, you need to take note of that on both levels. They're not going to let up. They should not, and we should not. Oh, my gosh. Wow. To that end, Kamala Harris even promoted a bail fund to get violence rioters involved in the insurrection out of jail. According to a brand-new FOXNews.com report tonight, one accused rioter was bailed out twice thanks to this fund, the one Kamala Harris supported. And wouldn't you believe it, he's just been arrested for yet a third time. Remember, according to Kamala, they aren't going to let up even after the election. They shouldn't let up. Vice President Harris was clearly calling for insurrection. Is Vice President Harris not guilty of incitement? If we apply the Democratic Party standards and she's in office, you could have an impeachment, one that's constitutional, she can be removed from office and John Roberts will have to preside. Now, will congressional Democrats, the media mob ever hold her accountable? Don't hold your breath. Or is the post-presidential impeachment show just one big political charade as I'm saying? Republican members now need to apply the same standards to all elected officials. That's one way to end this madness. Should they really? No, but if they are going to play that game and that's their standard, all the rules should apply equally. And now that we have the Honorable Patrick Leahy presiding, the guy that's already determined that Trump is guilty, maybe we should let Jim Jordan preside, and imagine having a trial where the judge and half the jury come out against you. It's beyond ludicrous. And on Monday, Senator Lindsey Graham rightly issued a stern warning, not physical warning, but a warning, to his Democratic colleagues. Take a look."

But if you open up a can of worms, we want the FBI to come in and tell us about how people actually pre- planned these attacks, and what happened with the security footprint at the Capitol. You open up a Pandora's Box if you call one witness. I hope we don't call any and we vote and we get this trial over next week when it starts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "We'll dig deeper with Senator Graham. He'll join us in a moment tonight. But he's right. If Senate Democrats want to start calling witnesses, and I imagine the president's defense team will do the same. And while they are at it, I would bring up all the tapes of every Democrat saying fight like hell. Fight, fight, fight, fight, and the threats against Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. And, of course, they are not going to stop. They shouldn't stop. We shouldn't stop. We can bring that up as well. And I'm going to take him behind the gym. Imagine any prominent conservative today saying, I would like to take Joe Biden behind the gym and talk real tough like Joe and beat the hell out of him. Then we can go, of course, to Maxine Waters. Imagine if any conservative talked like she did about taking Trump out tonight, maybe we can get to the bottom of why the National Guard also was not brought in to secure the building in spite of six requests from the capitol police chief. Keep in mind, that capitol police chief answers to Congress. And Nancy Pelosi is the speaker of the House. That would mean she's in complete control and in charge. Did she drop the ball? Did any other leaders drop the ball? Who is responsible for this breakdown in security? We need a 9/11-style commission to study this because according to multiple reports, court records, law enforcement, yep, they all had prior knowledge that certain individuals were plotting an attack on the capitol. It doesn't mean that some people, 1 percent as I said, not the 99 that were at the rally. Yeah, they stupidly got caught up in the nonsense and they will pay a price, as they should. But there should have been protection. There was a breach in 30 seconds to a minute. That can't happen in this country at a post 9/11 world. That is madness. Even Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she's now saying she was directly warned about the attack a full week before the capitol breach. I want to know, what did she know? When did she know it and what did she tell Pelosi? And what did she tell her? Take a look."

      "utterance": "A week before, one week before, week prior to the insurrection, I started to get text messages that I needed to be careful. And that in particular, I needed to be careful about the 6th, and those text messages came from other members of Congress. Not -- they were not threats. But they were other members saying that they knew."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let's be clear. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez said ever single representative, I don't care what your political party affiliation is, we must protect every elected official. Now, I'm assuming, I have no reason to doubt what she just said here. This is critical evidence and we need all of it passed on and we need to know why nobody took the proper precautions in light of knowing hundreds of thousands of people would be marching to the capitol. And by the way, the article of impeachment, when you get to the heart of it, is completely bogus. Now, did Congresswoman Cortez communicate these threats to Nancy Pelosi? What did Nancy know and when did she know it? Clearly, this has always been a political smear campaign. We get it. Democrats and friends and media mob don't like Donald Trump. They've been telling us, shouting at us, screaming at us, lying about him for five years. We're in the middle of a pandemic, in case you forgot, and just a few months removed from one of the most divisive elections in history. Next week's proceeding is unconstitutional. It is hypocritical. It is a complete show trial. And it is theater with no drama because everyone knows how it will end, acquittal. It doesn't improve the lives of any Americans, doesn't make the country a better place. Democrats are not looking out for you and your finances, and when you think about it, you might want to bring those thoughts with you in the polls. All right. Joining us now, a preview of next week's charade, our own Chad Pergram is with us. Chad, 45 senators say it's unconstitutional. Any chance that this could reverse itself and that there would be a conviction next week? I don't think so."

    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Probably not. And, you know, this question about calling witnesses and maybe dragging this out, that could backfire in a number of ways on Democrats. It would extend the trial, that's for sure. Keep in mind that Democrats want to hold former President Trump accountable, but they also want to pass a COVID relief bill. Extending this trial would tie up the floor that means no Senate confirmations for cabinet level officials. This is a problem for Chuck Schumer, the majority leader. He says there is no framework for the trial just yet. Listen."

      "speaker": "SCHUMER",
      "utterance": "The impeachment resolution on the trial, you know, has been set back because the president keeps switching lawyers. And so, you know, we have to negotiate if we want to get it bipartisan, his lawyers are part of the deal."

    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "For the impeachment trial last year, the Senate set up parameters once the impeachment managers and President Trump's defense team completed their arguments. Senators posed written questions and then the Senate conducted what we'll call a gateway vote. That vote was built into the organizational agreement for the trial. That gateway, the Senate could have voted to hear from witnesses. The Senate rejected that. Already, the attorney for the QAnon shaman has indicated he would be willing to serve as a witness. Now, witnesses, if you're going to have witnesses in an impeachment trial, they have to be deposed. You have to have depositions offstage. That would probably consume weeks. The trial on the floor shuts down. This is why President Trump supporters believe they could better defend the president perhaps through witnesses -- Sean."

      "utterance": "All right. Chad, thank you. Now, we'll have more on this charade in a moment. But, first, breaking tonight, according to another FOXNews.com story, the Biden administration just appointed an assistant attorney general with deep ties, we understand, to Hunter Biden. He's been seen a lot at the White House in recent days. In fact, the acting A.G. was once a colleague of Hunter Biden's defense attorney. Now, remember, the president's son is currently facing a federal criminal investigation for international money laundering and tax evasion. This after years, as we've chronicled since January 2018, of accepting millions and millions and millions of dollars -- let's see -- from Chinese nationals, shopping sprees, $3.5 million wire transfer, Russian oligarch, Ukrainian oligarch, money for cars, and other sketchy foreign nationals. On top of Burisma, and top of the Bank of China deal. Can you just imagine the hysteria from the mob and the media and the big tech companies allowing all the stories in the world to pass through, if this was one of President Trump's sons, Don Jr., Eric, or Barron or any of his daughters as well? Ivanka, tiffany, goes on from there. Anyway, joining us now from the Trump Organization, Eric Trump. Sir, how are you? The first interview, I think, since all of this has gone on. You're watching this madness. You're also watching Joe Biden. Get your initial thoughts."

      "utterance": "Yeah. Listen, initial thoughts are -- I mean, Sean, just looking at what he's accomplished in the last couple of days and how disastrous for our country has been. It's cost thousands and thousands of jobs. Look at XL pipeline, right? Something that would have been amazing for this country, for the energy independence of this country. The only person happy about the cancellation of the XL pipeline is Warren Buffett because now all the fuels (ph) can go on his big trains across the country where it could have gone through a beautiful pipeline and help this nation and kept gas prices down. Look at what they're doing with immigration, right? They canceled the wall. As Biden says, there's not going to be another inch of wall built in this country. Who does that benefit? It certainly doesn't benefit millions of Americans who are out of work, that doesn't benefit our population, that doesn't benefit a nation that's going through a pandemic, not knowing who's coming into the country. It doesn't benefit, you know, safety of our neighborhoods, with cartels and certainly, you know, bad people who smuggle drugs across the board. I mean, look at what this guy is doing. I mean, Paris climate agreement, another one, you know, Sean. So, we're going to start paying for all the environmental problems of China again? We're going to start paying for all the environmental problems of India again? And you go down the list, and, honestly, I think people are going to miss Donald Trump really quickly. I think they're going to miss him really, really quickly because some of these policies that they're acting, these executive orders, you know, 40, 40 in the first day, are madness, Sean. They're just madness."

He said 300 Americans, twice, are going to get the vaccine by summertime. I'm like, okay, catch up, Joe. But there's been nothing, from the day your father and Melania Trump came down the escalator Trump Tower, it's been never ending harassment for your dad, your -- you, your family, Don Jr., Ivanka, every -- Barron even, Melania, everybody, and it continues now.

I remember \"The Washington Post\" writing that story which is, this is -- you know, this is the minute that impeachment begins, and they tried and they tried to get him with the Russia hoax and they tried to get him with Ukraine, and they tried to take down Kavanaugh, and they tried to get him again. And they tried to manufacture everything, you know, under the sun against my father, against all of us. They do it every single day. They continue to do it. Even when he's a private citizen, they're still trying to impeach him. I mean, that's how kind of deep this whole thing goes. And it's -- they want to tar and feather the man. They know he did a great job for this nation. They know that there's never been a more beloved political figure in our country's history. There are 75 million Americans who would follow him to the end of earth. I mean, they love the man. They love what he stands for. They love that he was a fighter. That he carried that fight largely alone. Oftentimes, he had to fight for the entire Republican Party, right, because they weren't doing a whole lot. Now you have a lot of good fighters but you didn't back then, and people love that about him. People love that about him. And then you look at Biden by contrast. He doesn't have any of those traits. He's not doing great things for this nation. His heart is not in the right place. As you said, he's probably not 100 percent here. He's not. I don't think he is. His policies are disastrous. But they want to tar and feather the man. They want to do everything they can to not have him be a political force in the future. And honestly, they're only ingratiating my father's base even more because every single time they go off on one of these charades, you know, they expose the party, they -- you know, the radical left for exactly who they are, Sean.

Here now with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. I'm looking at three defenses here. It should be over in three hours, in my view, maybe four. I've known David Schoen a long time. He's a good attorney. One, the constitutional argument. Two, it ought to be okay, we have court documents, the FBI, we even have the fake news media, Ocasio-Cortez, congresswoman, now saying this was pre-planned. Well, that goes against the very article of impeachment and the wording of it. Third, and not less important, I think it's time for Republicans -- it's not my standard, but if they're going to make it the standard, then that means all these Democrats need to be held accountable for their words of insurrection."

Not to pursue justice, just for politics. We all know what happened that day. They've charged the president with inciting a riot. You haven't seen one piece of tape playing anywhere in the country where his words would amount to incitement under any statute. The president did not commit a crime through the speech he gave. The conversation with Raffensperger, the secretary of state in Georgia, the secretary of state said didn't feel coerced or threatened. So case is going to fall. The unconstitutional nature of impeachment will be addressed on day one. I predict there will be somewhere north of 45 votes on the very first day to say the entire trial is unconstitutional, because you're impeaching a guy in Florida who is out of office. So the question for the country and the Democratic Party is, how much pain are you going to put us through until we get to a verdict of acquittal? If you want to call one witness, my friend, to my Democratic colleagues, you're going to have a lot of witnesses. You're going to stop the trial for weeks and months, and for what purpose? I'm urging you to allow this trial to get over as quickly as possible when it's clear there is not enough votes to convict the president, and that will happen on day one."

So, I think the vote early on will be more than 45 that it's unconstitutional. What purpose is there to replay tapes over and over when we actually lived through the thing itself? They didn't call one witness in the House. They impeached the president of the United States in less than 50 hours without a lawyer present. So you're going to try to re-create the trial in the Senate? I think the Senate would be doing the country a great service by telling the House, you didn't call any witnesses in the House. You're not going to call any in the Senate. You're not going to drag this out for political purposes. We're going to get this trial over in three or four days. Not three or four weeks, and we're going to move on doing the business of the American people. That's what I hope Republicans will say to Democrats and I hope the American people will be behind us to end this because we know how it ends. What good comes from reopening this wound?"

That's when she jumped in telling LeBron, quote, don't blanking talk to my husband. She then claimed LeBron James responded saying sit the blank down blank, to which she responded, don't call me a blank. You sit the blank down. The woman, her husband and two others were promptly escorted out of the arena and as you might imagine along the way, she gave the camera, crowd and apparently King James a well-known hand signal. Today, Juliana Carlos apologized saying she takes full responsibility for crossing the line. LeBron says he's happy fans are back because he misses the interaction. And LeBron James also tweeted that Courtside Karen was mad mad. You see there with a bunch of laughing emojis. In case you're wondering, the Lakers beat the Hawks 115-108.

Now, in response, some so-called journalists are defending the Biden White House. Of course, they are. That's all they will ever do, claiming it's just business as usual. But don't you think they might be singing a slightly different tune in this was, oh, Donald Trump, Sarah Sanders, Kayleigh McEnany. But when it comes to Jen Psaki, she'll circle back to us. It's enduring. It's continuing to endure daily struggles with the White House briefing room. For example, today, she decided to mock the Space Force?

Anyway, early stumbles for the Biden team may be why they are desperate to censor conservatives and silence them. And, well, yes, cancel their viewpoints because look at this. A report in \"The New York Times\" explaining how Joe Biden has apparently being urged by some so-called experts to appoint, quote, a reality czar to tackle disinformation. That sounds like a ministry of truth. Welcome to statism, authoritarianism, and your socialist utopia, my fellow comrades. Isn't it interesting how the same people claim to be for the free flow of information, they're pro-First Amendment, they are also the first to call for censorship and silencing, and cancelling when it doesn't fit their far left worldview? Of course, here on this show, no, we don't boycott. Call for censors, try to silence, we make fun of you. We expose you, but we never try to silence you or cancel you. First Amendment, freedom of expression. It is something that makes this country unique, special, and great. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor, media reporter for \"The Hill\", Joe Concha.

      "utterance": "Let's go through some of these things here then, Sean, as far as a truth czar or whatever that may be, if you recall Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to form a truth committee to treat media literacy. This is the same person that's been checked by \"PolitiFact\" 10 times. And eight of those 10 times, they determined that she was telling half truths, completely untruths or being pants on fire. So, hopefully, she's not the person that will be the truth czar in this situation. As far as the daily briefings, and questions being given in advance, it is interesting that \"The Daily Beast\" story. The literal headline story is, White House reporters, Biden team asks for questions in advance. So it's not like it's topics that were shared during a gaggle with the press secretary before a particular press briefing. We're talking about questions now. And Tara Palmeri, who's with \"Politico\", she's former ABC, she's regarded as a solid reporter in most circles. She says this. Quote: If Psaki knows you have a tough question, she doesn't call for you. So far, she hasn't had to deal with a real bomb. You wonder why that may be. So, look, we saw this going back to the campaign, in terms of Joe Biden, whenever he took questions, it was done, given a predetermined list of reporters, that a staff decided on beforehand. So, Joe Biden, you know, the future leader of the free world, now the leader of the free world, wouldn't call on reporters himself. He depended on his staffer to do it. Those reporters were mostly cordial. Instead of asking challenging questions, and the Peter Doocys of the world were boxed out, where he actually had to yell questions after the fact in order to even get anything in. So, in terms of being the most accessible president of all time or in terms of anything regarding transparency, this is the exact opposite that we saw under President Trump who took any questions at any time and didn't need a staffer to call on reporters. He called on them himself, and you could agree or disagree with the answer, but he was the most accessible president of all time to the point where in his four years, he probably took more questions than the previous three presidents did in their eight years combined. So that's where we are at this point, Sean."

Some government officials across the country shut down churches during the pandemic. Even in Texas, some local officials tried closing churches. That is wrong.

We are dying to have somebody who listens to the science. I mean, we have a governor, Gavin Newsom, who shut down the beaches. Now, this is not part of science. We have a governor who plays politics, but we also have a state that's completely run by one party. If you want to have the insiders from one political party and the well-connected constantly get what they want, then you have to keep electing the same people over and over and that's what we have in California.
