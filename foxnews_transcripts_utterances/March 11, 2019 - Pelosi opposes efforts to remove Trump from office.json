      "utterance": "Yes. We have to see what happens. He was asked some questions that seemed to not comport with the record, like whether or not he wanted a job in the Trump White House. And then there is the whole question of who asked who for a pardon. Yes, and I'm sure we haven't heard the last of the Michael Cohen."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "The pardon was the big deal. The \"I didn't want a job\" was face- saving, but the pardon was the big deal. And he comes out and he says I never sought nor would I accept a pardon from the president. And as it turns out he authorized people to talk to the president's side about a pardon, and he contradicted himself in later conversations with people in the House. So --"

You have a guy who has pleaded guilty to lying and has pleaded guilty to these things in the past. He was never going to be your star witness and I don't know why they gave him as much oxygen as they did."

    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "I think it very clearly expresses the president's priorities and vision, which is exactly what budget proposals are supposed to be. He wants more money for defense, big cuts for domestic programs, including something like 31 percent for the EPA. He wants more money for the wall. He hasn't given up on that, nor will he. This is number one priority for him, the symbol of him keeping faith with his base. And he also wants to say that he tried to do something about the deficit even though it went way up on his watch, and he promised in the campaign to not only eliminate it but to eliminate the entire national debt. So that's what's in this budget proposal."

      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "It's really shameful. And it's a bipartisan condemnation that we have two parties. We have $22 trillion national debt right now, and we have a budget blueprint that comes out from a White House that says we're going to add another $10.5 trillion to that. And they are going to mortgage the futures of my children and my grandchildren and for three generations after this because nobody has the political will to say real things and say hard things. And it's really quite shameful. And it's on both parties 100 percent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "On the wall, the Democrats obviously said they were given nothing on it before they gave him $1.375 billion. So we are going to hear this whole argument over again. And the one thing that the White House is hoping against hope, I'm sure, is that they can convince the people that the situation has changed, because Democrats are saying, look, this is a manufactured crisis. There is no emergency at the border. And now we have seen a number of press reports, The New York Times did a press report saying that the border was at a breaking point with 76,000 migrants crossing in a month. They will try to make that case. We'll see if any Democrats listen. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
