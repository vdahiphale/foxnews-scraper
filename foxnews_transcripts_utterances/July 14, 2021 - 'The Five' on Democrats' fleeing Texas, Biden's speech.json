It's like all he does is foment racial conflict and he's making -- he claims that he's making a moral case for voting rights as if there are no voting rights. Every American has the right to vote, except the less favored voting blocs, which are violent felons, illegal immigrants, and the dead. My theory is there is only one possibility of a true zombie uprising, and it's as if corpses found out that they were voting for Joe Biden. The only Republicans Democrats know of are evil. It started with Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was supposed be the worst, right? He was Hitler. Then you got George Bush. He was, you know, a warmonger. Then you had the other George Bush, he was a warmonger. Then you had John McCain, warmonger. They you had Mitt Romney who was going to put everybody back in chains, right? Then we are supposed to get the biggest, greatest existential risk in history out of Donald Trump, and now we're sold -- that's a lie because he's gone, and now this is a bigger existential risk than Donald Trump.

I wish we could have come back and found more people to vote and make some of the claims that former President Trump is making, but I lost the election. I wanted more people to vote and they didn't. More people voted this time and it just turns out that the Democrats won this time. Now, if we have a set of systems in place to create that and to encourage that and to validated that going forward, I think we should. Now, politics is too much theater. Traveling to D.C., I get the politics, I get the theater of the politics. We all engage in a little of that to make our point. But I'll remind everybody, 60 federal and state courts denied these claims. There has been more scrutiny around this presidential race. Look, the guy that I wanted to win won and I'm thankful. Had he lost, I would have accepted it and moved on. I think at some point, the body politic needs to accept that there was an election, President Biden won, and if we are serious about more people voting, let's put efforts forward and changes to election laws that allow more people to vote and not make it harder for people to vote.

And they're going to basically use patronage to set up a permanent and never-ending authoritarian regime. Here's what Bernie, and this is to Greg's point here, here's what Bernie is saying. He never actually addresses the fact that people in these communist countries hated their suffering. He never talks about that. He always talks about theoretical communism and theoretical socialism.

He traveled on his motorbike over 300,000 miles in his quest to find him. And while searching for his own son, he helped other Chinese parents find their kidnapped children.

But those facts don't matter to liberals in Texas. A group of showboating Democrats just skipping town in order to block Republicans there from passing these new voting bills. They are fashioning themselves as political martyrs, who of course fled to Washington, D.C. on a pair of private jets without face masks and a case of beer.

He ran on being a unifier and all he does his bank on racial discontent, right? He is like comparing this bill to the KKK and to Jim Crow. It's like all he does is foment racial conflict and he's making -- he claims that he's making a moral case for voting rights as if there are no voting rights. Every American has the right to vote, except the less favored voting blocs, which are violent felons, illegal immigrants, and the dead. My theory is there is only one possibility of a true zombie uprising, and it's as if corpses found out that they were voting for Joe Biden. The only Republicans Democrats know of are evil. It started with Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was supposed be the worst, right? He was Hitler. Then you got George Bush. He was, you know, a warmonger. Then you had the other George Bush, he was a warmonger. Then you had John McCain, warmonger. They you had Mitt Romney who was going to put everybody back in chains, right? Then we are supposed to get the biggest, greatest existential risk in history out of Donald Trump, and now we're sold -- that's a lie because he's gone, and now this is a bigger existential risk than Donald Trump.

They want to keep the pandemic voting and they want to expand that. And you know what really makes me crazy? What makes me crazy is you have these Texas legislators who make a decision that they're going to go to Washington, D.C. I mean, it's such an embarrassment to Texans. I mean, I know a lot of people from Texas. I love a lot of people in Texas, okay? The one thing they don't do is cut and run.

Now, to your point, during the pandemic we made accommodations to make it easier for people to vote. I happen to think what you want in any election and I've ran in five elections -- six, I lost one. I wish we could have come back and found more people to vote and make some of the claims that former President Trump is making, but I lost the election. I wanted more people to vote and they didn't. More people voted this time and it just turns out that the Democrats won this time. Now, if we have a set of systems in place to create that and to encourage that and to validated that going forward, I think we should. Now, politics is too much theater. Traveling to D.C., I get the politics, I get the theater of the politics. We all engage in a little of that to make our point. But I'll remind everybody, 60 federal and state courts denied these claims. There has been more scrutiny around this presidential race. Look, the guy that I wanted to win won and I'm thankful. Had he lost, I would have accepted it and moved on. I think at some point, the body politic needs to accept that there was an election, President Biden won, and if we are serious about more people voting, let's put efforts forward and changes to election laws that allow more people to vote and not make it harder for people to vote. And when the Democrats are right or wrong is making it harder."

And frankly, every other neighborhood in the country. And I live in a neighborhood that I'm fortunate to live in. I don't know of any neighborhood in America that does not want police there. Two, defund, I mean, this bail reform, judge, you are right. Those were -- they were well-intentioned people wanting some form of bail reform, but it has gone awry and it's not -- whatever the good intentions were, they have completely missed the point here and you're putting criminals and violent people back out on the streets. We got to change that. Three, I'm still a believer in the ghost guns. Trey Gowdy and I, we were on last night, Jesse and I were on Brett's show last night talking a little bit about this. You've got to increase the prosecutions of people who have guns illegally. But at the same time you have to ask the question, and you got on me by talking about fresh apples last week, people, some of these kids can get fresh apples but they can get guns. How do they get the guns? If you can't -- if a criminal can't walk into a gun show or gun store and buy it, it seems strange to me these kids have been flood into their community. So, let's go after the bad guys who are flooding it to the communities, guns into these communities, and go after these kids, these thugs and these criminals.

Do you remember in 2020, the people that were pushing defund the police? Who was it? It was the professional black activist class, academic revolutionaries. It was the squad and it was local city council members. Who wasn't on that list? It wasn't your mom and your dad in the black community that struggles with violence. This was not a movement for the people because the people in these neighborhoods know you have to have fast 911 response times. So it took Al Sharpton, who is supposed to represent black America, until September to come out and say that defund the police is something that a latte liberal would support. It took CNN until August to come and say after the polling switch, \"Hey, maybe this isn't such a good idea.\" So, you said, public safety is so fragile.

They are tired of it and they want the help. And I don't think that -- well, the good news is for the Cubans, that Bernie is not Biden and Biden is the president of the United States. I don't think that Biden is exactly where Obama was on this. Remember, Obama went like full normalize relations and the embargo, do all these things. President Trump walks it back. I don't think Biden will actually go back to the Obama version because one, they saw what happened when they squashed or didn't help the revolution in Iran. And they don't want that to happen here in Cuba. Like you can't do that to people there. The discouraging thing is that the internet has been shut down and communication has kind of stopped there, so if there's anyone out there that has the technology that would allow these people to be able to communicate with each other, it's good.

So, I think this might be a time where you want to wait it out. But I want to talk about Bernie Sanders here. Just a little history lesson. The reason we have the embargo against Cuba is because the Soviets put missiles in Cuba, ballistic missiles pointed at the United States. They're 90 miles off the shore of Key West. He just think that's OK. Like, let's just drop the embargo, and all of the enemies of America just send missiles to Cuba and point it at Washington D.C. That's why Bernie Sanders is dangerously stupid. Does Bernie really believe that communism would work if we just dropped the embargo? No, the regime is just going to pilfer all the stuff. And they're going to basically use patronage to set up a permanent and never-ending authoritarian regime. Here's what Bernie, and this is to Greg's point here, here's what Bernie is saying. He never actually addresses the fact that people in these communist countries hated their suffering. He never talks about that. He always talks about theoretical communism and theoretical socialism. And that's because he's arrogant. And he believes that communism or socialism would work in this country. And people would like it if just Bernie Sanders could administer it. And that's the fallacy."

But anybody in their right mind can't support what's happening there and has to be supportive to these protesters. To Jesse's point, it may take -- this could be one of those tipping point moments where the people decide they want this. And I think we'd have to decide how we want to be helpful if we could, and if we could be constructive in helping. Finally, if you look at the entire region, right, you look at our entire hemisphere, one of the reasons I believe as much as we spend money in other hemispheres around the globe to try to stabilize things than we should, we spend very little here."

One, it's not just conservatives. There are people that are certainly low income, and sometimes like in black communities, in particular, for example. In those states where there's lower vaccinations, you could find both, right? And also younger people, the age group 18 to 29, they're very much the ones that are just like, well, hold on.

He traveled on his motorbike over 300,000 miles in his quest to find him. And while searching for his own son, he helped other Chinese parents find their kidnapped children. They were reunited after the DNA samples were matched in a police operation to locate missing children. And he said that despite everything, he plans on treating the couple who raised his boy all these years as relatives. It's a pretty amazing story of humanity there. And shout out to Peter who found this story for us today."
