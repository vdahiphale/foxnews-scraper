MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: Joe Biden sounds like such a great candidate, doesn't he? I think I'll support him for president, but not of this country. Maybe Venezuela. You have the Bernie Bolsheviks now who are backing Biden. Bernie Sanders is basically running the Democrat Party. This is the Bernie Sanders agenda. Joe Biden is an empty suit.

He's been in Washington, D.C., for half a century. So for him to talk about, we're going to make fundamental economic changes, were going to make changes and make America more equal, he spent a good portion of his career in the Senate as a bigot and I mean this in all seriousness, if you look at his background and the things that he used to say. Joe Biden was a nasty, mean man. He destroyed Bob Bork, or tried to, talk to his family. He tried to extort Clarence Thomas, talk to his family. This isn't some lunch bucket Joe, this guy is a fraud. Meanwhile, he's got a Senate records. They're all hiding in the University of Delaware. They want to talk about Trump taxes. If you don't mind, I want to hit the United States Supreme Court briefly here. It's a very, very important. We have two justices on the Supreme Court and seven politicians, that's what we have. The Roberts court is a disaster, it's rudderless.

It belongs to an Indian tribe. You have a couple more million American citizens now apart from Native Americans who lived in that part of the state and they have no idea what their fate is. This is a court that is tyrannical. This is a court that has done more damage to the rule of law and the Constitution than to the Bernie Sanders- Biden rioters over the last two months on a number of cases. And let's talk about the president's tax returns. What the hell is it about his tax returns that they're obsessed with? Is there something wrong with his tax returns? No. What's going on? His tax returns are probably like this and then you take the attachments that are probably like this, and we know what the media and the Democrats will do, oh, he took a deduction for this, he shouldn't have taken a deduction for this. These are evil people. That's why I think the president doesn't want to give us tax returns. And the Supreme Court just issued a decision that allows every Podunk prosecutor to come up with a pretext and to get a president's tax returns or financial information, what the hell is that all about? They're destroying the executive branch. Then, we have Congress. They have subpoenas. We need to know about the finances of the president. They didn't want to know about the finances about Obama or Clinton or Biden when he was vice president. No, this president. You want to know why? Because this is one of the first presidents we've ever had who actually earned money before he became president of the United States. All the rest of them, the Obamas, Biden, Gore, they become multimillionaires selling their prior offices.

They don't invest a president's finances. They don't issue tons of subpoenas. The Supreme Court did grave damage to the Constitution today and they're supposed to uphold the Constitution. The tax issue, the supremacy clause. Sam Alito is 100 percent right. That is -- a prosecutor for a county doesn't have the power to get the president's tax returns. He can't indict a president. So, what the hell does he want him for? Do you what the pretext he used this, Sean?",

I did it anyway, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. I banned Europe from coming in, when Italy and when France and Spain were having all the problems, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. A lot of people said, don't do it. They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks. Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don't wear a mask, don't wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask. So, a lot of mistakes were made, a lot of mistakes. Let me just make one statement, though. We do testing like nobody's ever done testing. And when we test, the more you test, the more cases you find. Other countries, you know when they test? And I ask them all. They test when somebody's not feeling well or when somebody walks into a hospital. So they don't have tests. They have tests that are very, very limited. We have these massive -- 40, 45 million people have been tested. It's a record. And our tests are the best. So, we have cases all over the place. Most of those cases immediately get better. They get -- people -- they're young people. They have sniffles, and two days later, they are fine. And they are not sick to start off with. They are asymptomatic. A lot of things happen. And what we are doing is, with all of these tests that we are doing all over the country, test everybody, test, pull-up parking lots, everything else, what we have done is, we have created a tremendous number of cases. Everybody else -- can you imagine if China tested like we test? They don't. Can you imagine if other big countries, the bigger countries, tested like we -- or Germany. We have tested many, many, many times, even proportionately, the number of people that other countries have tested. But I was with, as an example, a great gentleman yesterday, the president of Mexico. And they are having a hard time, especially in Mexico City. They test when somebody is sick or when somebody goes into the hospital. And that is a different way of doing it, and it's just fine. And we are testing and creating -- it's the greatest thing that ever happen for the opposite party, but we are doing something that nobody has ever done to the extent, and we are doing a great job. But we have a mortality rate, think of this, that's tenfold better than any other. We -- what we are doing is incredible, if you look. You have heard the numbers, tenfold. We have fewer people dying. And our people have done an incredible job. And one other thing. We are very well on the way to a vaccine, very well on the way therapeutically, therapeutics. We're very well on the way. We have a lot of great things happening. We already do. We do have some that are very effective, or at least effective. And a lot of very good things have happened, a lot of really good things. They're doing a great job. But the testing is just showing up all these cases. And if you turn the news on, you will see it's always the word cases. They don't talk about death, because deaths are way down. They talk about cases, all the time, cases. And those cases get better. They -- in most -- most cases, in almost -- I mean, literally, in most cases, they automatically cure. They automatically get better.",

And the circles are very far away from each other to start off with. And then they have just a few people in the audience. And he makes a speech.

And, still, I mean, the judges -- even the Department of Justice said, it's time to let that case go. Both parties, when they say that, usually, it ends it. But the judge has a vendetta, clearly, against General Flynn. Then we have -- I thought we were guaranteed the right to a fair and impartial jury. And we discovered that the jury foreperson in the Roger Stone case literally was speaking out publicly in the most negative terms against Roger personally and any Trump supporter. The judge refused to grant him a new trial, which, to me, is unfathomable. I would give that right to every American. If somebody is biased on the jury, that case is out.

And, of course, the president is also -- well, his opponent actually steps foot outside of the house today, the basement. And that's the second time in two weeks. That's a record. Way to go, Joe. And the corrupt, ever confused, ever frail Joe Biden actually left his home. He traveled all the way from Delaware to Pennsylvania where his trusty teleprompter where he delivered -- well, a painfully awkward speech in a large, mostly empty room filled with lots and lots of birds.

Now, that includes the New York toilet paper \"Times\", even encouraging Joe not to show up for the debates unless these rigid conditions are met. So if you really want to know how -- well, Biden will govern if elected, look no further than the policy recommendations he just released. Now, we have them all. Numerous sections of the 110 page document, there actually plagiarized word for word from Bernie Sanders campaign. By the way, plagiarism, nothing new for Joe Biden. In the 1980s, he was forced to end his presidential campaign. He was caught red-handed plagiarizing a British politician by the name of Neil Kinnock word for word on multiple occasions.

In fact, Biden working hand-in-hand with the Sanders campaign on his brand-new policy recommendations. Among these insane new proposals -- let's see -- confiscation of wealth, redistribution of your money for something called environmental justice. In other words, what, the $94 trillion new Green Deal? Even appointing Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to lead the effort. Biden also pushing for free paid family leave, free paid medical leave, free housing, broad student loan forgiveness, universal health care? Joe also wants to halt all deportations, grant amnesty to 11,000-plus million illegal immigrants, that didn't respect the law and sovereignty of orders? That's right, he would turn the entire country of the united sanctuary states of America, and he even prevent ICE from, well, following the law and deporting criminals they get out of jail. And that's not all. Biden wants to outlaw the right to work, which would force millions of workers to join unions whether they want to or not. And what about pro-choice? Let's not forget, by the way, Biden also wants to eliminate cash bail, which has been nothing but an unmitigated disaster New York. Bernie Sanders is so pleased with this radical socialist lawless agenda he went on -- well, MSDNC, the conspiracy channel, Roswell Rachel Maddow's channel, last night to congratulate Biden on becoming the most progressive candidate in modern history.

We'd lose freedom and we would lose wealth creation and America's stature in the world, it would be the most precipitous decline in the history of mankind. Now we know what Biden meant when he wanted to transform America into Bernie's America. During the primary, most Democrats try to appease their radical base but then they moved towards the center in what's called the general election. Biden is different, he went hard left, stayed there, and is doubling down on even harder left and even more extreme policy. This isn't about bringing manufacturing jobs back or increasing wages. This is about full-blown extremism, socialism, redistribution and the end of capitalism. And keep in mind, the 78-year-old Biden has been in elected office since the '70s. He served eight years as vice president. He gets zero tough questions from the mob and the media, why didn't he have any success in those eight years? Under President Trump, what have we witnessed? A boom in American manufacturing, the jobs they said weren't coming back. Now, it was Trump. It wasn't Barack. It wasn't Joe who brought those jobs back. Just like it was Trump who ushered in record after record after record after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and every demographic group we can think of. It was Trump who passed criminal justice reform and police reform. It wasn't Joe and it wasn't Barack. It was President Trump that created opportunities zones, that wasn't Joe, and that wasn't Barack. In five decades in the swamp, what the hell did Joe Biden do? Well, we know that for years, Biden palled around with segregationists. He spent a lot of time with one of his favorite colleagues, his mentor, Robert, the former Klansman, Byrd. And, by the way, he coauthored that crime bill that led to mass incarceration of inner-city youth. He's the one that said there would be predators on our streets. He worried that his kids would grow up in, quote, a racial jungle. But now, in order to please his far-left handlers, Biden is now trashing law enforcement. Just this week, what did he do? Referencing, now the police are viewed as the enemy and said he was totally on board with stripping their federal funding, his own words. Take a listen."

And today, Comrade de Blasio announced that he's banning all large gatherings unless it's an antipolice protest.

You want higher taxes are lower taxes? Do you want more regulations or less regulations? You want activist justices or constitutional originalists on the court? Do you want to line the pockets of Hunter Biden or keep making tough and fair trade deals around the world? Let's see, do you want another nuclear Iran peace deal with $150 billion in cash and currency, or peace through strength? Do you want to be forced into government run health care, or you want to keep your private health insurance? Come November, all of it is on the line. No pressure. And so much more. Capitalism, liberty, security, safety, security, Constitution, our very way of life hangs in the balance. The president will join us in just moments. First, joining us, I call him the great one, Mark Levin. Great one, a lot is going to happen in 117 days, Mark, and if the policies that he's plagiarizing now from Joe and Ocasio-Cortez, if they're implemented, I say that the America we know, free-market capitalism, the greatest wealth producer in the history of mankind, that will go away, and the country will be in poverty and unrecognizable. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: Joe Biden sounds like such a great candidate, doesn't he? I think I'll support him for president, but not of this country. Maybe Venezuela. You have the Bernie Bolsheviks now who are backing Biden. Bernie Sanders is basically running the Democrat Party. This is the Bernie Sanders agenda. Joe Biden is an empty suit. He surrounded himself with every radical kook you can imagine like AOC and others. This is a Democrat Party that is as evil as it's ever been. It's a growing anti-Semitic movement within the Democrat Party. It's a growing anti- American movement at its core. Joe Biden has been around for half a century. He's been in Washington, D.C., for half a century. So for him to talk about, we're going to make fundamental economic changes, were going to make changes and make America more equal, he spent a good portion of his career in the Senate as a bigot and I mean this in all seriousness, if you look at his background and the things that he used to say. Joe Biden was a nasty, mean man. He destroyed Bob Bork, or tried to, talk to his family. He tried to extort Clarence Thomas, talk to his family. This isn't some lunch bucket Joe, this guy is a fraud. Meanwhile, he's got a Senate records. They're all hiding in the University of Delaware. They want to talk about Trump taxes. If you don't mind, I want to hit the United States Supreme Court briefly here. It's a very, very important. We have two justices on the Supreme Court and seven politicians, that's what we have. The Roberts court is a disaster, it's rudderless. You've got the four horses of liberalism there who vote together on the big issues every time and they hope to flip Roberts or Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, and they've been doing a hell of a good job of it. I want the American people to know today that five lawyers in robes picked up from obscurity today ruled that half of Oklahoma doesn't belong to Oklahoma anymore. It belongs to an Indian tribe. You have a couple more million American citizens now apart from Native Americans who lived in that part of the state and they have no idea what their fate is. This is a court that is tyrannical. This is a court that has done more damage to the rule of law and the Constitution than to the Bernie Sanders- Biden rioters over the last two months on a number of cases. And let's talk about the president's tax returns. What the hell is it about his tax returns that they're obsessed with? Is there something wrong with his tax returns? No. What's going on? His tax returns are probably like this and then you take the attachments that are probably like this, and we know what the media and the Democrats will do, oh, he took a deduction for this, he shouldn't have taken a deduction for this. These are evil people. That's why I think the president doesn't want to give us tax returns. And the Supreme Court just issued a decision that allows every Podunk prosecutor to come up with a pretext and to get a president's tax returns or financial information, what the hell is that all about? They're destroying the executive branch. Then, we have Congress. They have subpoenas. We need to know about the finances of the president. They didn't want to know about the finances about Obama or Clinton or Biden when he was vice president. No, this president. You want to know why? Because this is one of the first presidents we've ever had who actually earned money before he became president of the United States. All the rest of them, the Obamas, Biden, Gore, they become multimillionaires selling their prior offices. This man gives up his salary to charity and so forth. Legislative oversight, Congress has legislative oversight. They don't invest a president's finances. They don't issue tons of subpoenas. The Supreme Court did grave damage to the Constitution today and they're supposed to uphold the Constitution. The tax issue, the supremacy clause. Sam Alito is 100 percent right. That is -- a prosecutor for a county doesn't have the power to get the president's tax returns. He can't indict a president. So, what the hell does he want him for? Do you what the pretext he used this, Sean?"

That's not a campaign violation. The Southern District of New York dropped out a long time ago. So the Supreme Court goes along with this? And these endless subpoenas from Congress, the Democrats, they've impeached the president once, an unconstitutional impeachment. They're threatening to impeach the attorney general of the United States. They have cavorted (ph) with lawlessness in the Obama administration that attempted a coup. You know, the president of the United States, you know, he must wonder if they're all out to get him. They are all out to get him. And let me tell you one other thing, you talk about how important this election is and Joe Biden and what he stands for, I don't give a damn about Joe Biden what he stands for. He sucked this country dry, he's made himself rich. He's been in public office for his entire life. I care about the American people. This election is between the American people who love this country, who believe in 1776, who believe that the Founders, who believe in Jefferson, Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and all the rest, and those who do not. Joe Biden hasn't defended the cops in this country once. He hasn't denounced the rioters other than one barely coherent sentence other than once. Nancy Pelosi has never condemned the rioters! Chuck Schumer has never condemned the rioters! You want to know why? They're Democrats! They're Bernie Sanders supporters. So, the people who love this country, I don't give a damn what party you are, or if you have no party, if you're working hard, if you're trying to work hard, if you want the government -- the economy open, if you want your kids to go back to school, if you want to have some normalcy back, you've got to vote for Trump! I know what the narrative is, Trump won't unite us. How was he supposed to unite us with rioters? How has he supposed to unite us with Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and that party? The Democrat Party has a history of anti-Americanism, whether it's slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, it has a history of anti-Americanism, and that includes today. It's just a differentism. It was a Confederacy then. Now they are dancing with the Marxists, whether it's Black Lives Matter or Antifa, whether it's -- whether it's the mayor of New York, de cameo, and now, they've embraced Bernie Sanders, the most radical man -- or woman -- but the most radical person in Congress today.

We are now seeing such things happen, this time in the Sunbelt. Florida Governor DeSantis was on. One of the things that he did differently is, he went in and protected the nursing homes and the elderly care facilities. He's doing the same. And I was a little bit surprised at the numbers in Florida in terms of the ages of people now that are contracting the virus, much, much younger. On the one hand, you don't want anyone to contract it. But, on the other hand, we know that the people that are most vulnerable to this virus for severe illness or death are those that are elderly, those with underlying conditions, or those with compromised immune systems. And it does not impact young people anywhere near the way it does older people. What do you make of these hot spots, as we call them, in Florida and Texas and other states, and Dr. Fauci's comments?"

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the mortality rate -- and Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes, like, you don't have to ban them coming in from very infected China. I did it anyway, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. I banned Europe from coming in, when Italy and when France and Spain were having all the problems, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. A lot of people said, don't do it. They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks. Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don't wear a mask, don't wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask. So, a lot of mistakes were made, a lot of mistakes. Let me just make one statement, though. We do testing like nobody's ever done testing. And when we test, the more you test, the more cases you find. Other countries, you know when they test? And I ask them all. They test when somebody's not feeling well or when somebody walks into a hospital. So they don't have tests. They have tests that are very, very limited. We have these massive -- 40, 45 million people have been tested. It's a record. And our tests are the best. So, we have cases all over the place. Most of those cases immediately get better. They get -- people -- they're young people. They have sniffles, and two days later, they are fine. And they are not sick to start off with. They are asymptomatic. A lot of things happen. And what we are doing is, with all of these tests that we are doing all over the country, test everybody, test, pull-up parking lots, everything else, what we have done is, we have created a tremendous number of cases. Everybody else -- can you imagine if China tested like we test? They don't. Can you imagine if other big countries, the bigger countries, tested like we -- or Germany. We have tested many, many, many times, even proportionately, the number of people that other countries have tested. But I was with, as an example, a great gentleman yesterday, the president of Mexico. And they are having a hard time, especially in Mexico City. They test when somebody is sick or when somebody goes into the hospital. And that is a different way of doing it, and it's just fine. And we are testing and creating -- it's the greatest thing that ever happen for the opposite party, but we are doing something that nobody has ever done to the extent, and we are doing a great job. But we have a mortality rate, think of this, that's tenfold better than any other. We -- what we are doing is incredible, if you look. You have heard the numbers, tenfold. We have fewer people dying. And our people have done an incredible job. And one other thing. We are very well on the way to a vaccine, very well on the way therapeutically, therapeutics. We're very well on the way. We have a lot of great things happening. We already do. We do have some that are very effective, or at least effective. And a lot of very good things have happened, a lot of really good things. They're doing a great job. But the testing is just showing up all these cases. And if you turn the news on, you will see it's always the word cases. They don't talk about death, because deaths are way down. They talk about cases, all the time, cases. And those cases get better. They -- in most -- most cases, in almost -- I mean, literally, in most cases, they automatically cure. They automatically get better."

I think, under certain conditions, like when you are going into a hospital -- I will be going to Walter Reed to see some of our great soldiers that have been injured, badly injured, and also see some of our COVID workers, the people that have done such a great job. And I expect to be wearing a mask when I go into Walter Reed. You're in a hospital setting. I think it's a very appropriate thing. I have no problem with a mask. I don't think you need one you're tested all the time, everybody around you is tested, you're quite a distance. You talk about social distancing. You're away. Like, I watched Biden walk onto a stage with his -- practically -- like, today, there was almost nobody in the room. He's making a speech. And they have these massive circles. And the circles are very far away from each other to start off with. And then they have just a few people in the audience. And he makes a speech. And he walks onto the stage wearing this massive mask. There's nobody on the stage. And then he takes it off. He likes to have it hang off usually the left ear. I think it makes him feel good, frankly, if you want to know the truth. And I guess that's OK. But when there's nobody around, you don't really have to do that. But he feels it's good.

But it wasn't getting used, and so the governor asked if we could convert it for COVID. And we did. And they didn't use it. And we took -- the Javits Center did a phenomenal job in record-setting time. A matter of days, we converted into a massive, like, 2,600 units, and they didn't use it, or very little did they use it. And I said, what are you doing with all of these requests, and then you're not using it? What's going on?

We had a Clinton- bought-and-paid-for lying dossier. We know obstruction happened with her with the deleted e-mails and BleachBit and hammers. And we know that there was a quid and a pro and a quo with Joe and zero experience Hunter. There is no doubt that there's, in my mind, a double standard. To me, one of the biggest opponents you have in 117 days is, well, I call them the media mob.

And we are awaiting the work of prosecutor John Durham. We will see where that goes. Attorney General Barr said that this is not about a report. It's a criminal investigation. But, again, that is beyond, I guess, my pay grade. I asked you a question in Wisconsin, and you got criticized for the answer. I want to ask you again.

And that's -- and we are well on our way, and, again, as I told you, the mortality rate is tenfold down. We are going to rebuild the economy. We're going to bring back jobs from all of these foreign lands that have stolen our jobs on horrible trade deals. We are going to continue to make great trade deals. We're going to finish rebuilding our wall. We're going to finish. We're going to have that. It's going to be almost complete by the end of this year. Shortly thereafter, it's finished. It's made a tremendous difference. You see, we're doing record numbers on the border. Very few people are able to get through. We are rebuilding with our military. We have rebuilt the military, $2.5 trillion. We are fixing up the VA for our vets. What -- the job we have done there, between Choice and Accountability. We have Choice, where they have -- they can go out and get a doctor if they are sick. They don't have to wait for five weeks, six weeks, two weeks. So we are doing great with the vets. And the vets are loving Trump. We are protecting our Second Amendment, so important. We need more judges and more justices. You see that now with the Supreme Court more than ever. And the next president -- I have had two -- and the next president is going to be able to pick two or three or one or whatever, but a lot of justices. And that means everything, whether it's for life or other things. I mean, it means so much. But protecting the Second Amendment, getting more judges, all of the things that we have done, nobody's done what this administration has done in the first three-and-a-half years. Nobody's even come close, when you look at everything that we are doing. Now what we're doing is working on lowering drug prices and knocking out special interests, because it's not easy. We're fighting for choice. We did it for the veterans. Now we are doing it for school too. We want choice in school, so a parent can take their child to a school of their choice. And that's happening, very good -- very, very well. And we have many things we are doing and many things that we have already completed. And you can't do more than what we have done. I think we have set records on every -- we actually set a record on judges. We are going to be -- by the time of the end of this year, we will be up to almost 300 federal judges. And that's a record. That's incredible, including D.C."

And it will be -- it's had a huge impact already, because we're about halfway finished. The economy, it's one of the -- it's the thing. The economy is starting to really do great.

China had the worst year they had. The tariffs have hurt them. They had the worst year they have had. And we have taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. They had the worst year in 67 years, whereas we had the best year we have ever had. And then we got hit with the plague. But now we are rebuilding it.
