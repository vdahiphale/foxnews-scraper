And then, on the Republican side, you got DeWine versus Mary Taylor for the GOP as John Kasich exits. And the battle to unseat Senator Sherrod Brown, the Democrat in Ohio, being waged by five Republicans, so we'll be watching that closely. Also, this maybe the most vulnerable seat that we will watch tomorrow night. This is Indiana. Senator Joe Donnelly and those are the gentlemen who are trying to run against him in November. And as we said, of course, West Virginia, Congressman Evan Jenkins, and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey hope to beat the ex-con Coal Baron Don Blankenship, who's gotten quite a bit of attention in this race.

And everyone knows about his criminal conviction relating to the conspiracy to violate mining standards. But when you file as a U.S. senate candidate, you're supposed to actually submit your personal financial disclosures -- your wealth, your income, your assets and liabilities, and Don Blankenship ignoring that. And that comes with potential civil and criminal penalties. And he is just brushing it off like it's no one's business. But this is important information for voters, so they can actually know a little bit more about you. Your finances and your conflict of interest. So, we wanted to make sure the people will know about it."

But as the election draws close, I think people are beginning to know, and especially President Trump, that nominating Don Blankenship would be an electoral disaster for West Virginia, because I think he'll be defeated by Joe Manchin.

And so, right now, Blankenship and I are in a close race. And I think it's important to educate people. But the most critical thing I think with 24 hours to go, people should know, I have the strong conservative record endorsed by conservatives, West Virginians for life, second amendment groups. And I think people are very motivated to get out to the poll and ensure that a proven conservative win against a liberal and convicted criminal."

Now, from what I'm reading, is their internal numbers, especially from the RNC and D.C., hey, wait a second, Blankenship is in this thing, and close to the top. And I thought it came as a surprise to me especially after the ad in which you saw Blankenship going after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, \"Cocaine Mitch, China family\", and all this. I found it unattractive. But again, I'm not a voter in West Virginia. Nonetheless somehow, it seems to me Blankenship has out-Trumped, Trump. Because he is the Trump guy here -- the populist energized candidate. And that's what Trump brought to the political scene in America and to West Virginia, which he won handily."

So, we don't know what's happening here in the last week. Sure, some of them can attracted by the annex of Mr. Blankenship. But I give the people of West Virginia a little bit more credit. I don't think a bigoted approach to politics, something that's tearing down somebody, who's not even in the race coming from mouth of man who is convicted and jail who can't even vote for himself because he's register. And whose company had the worst record of mines safety of any company, coal company in West Virginia for decades, and who oversaw mine-safety violations and resulting to the death of 29 miners. I'm not certain that's a winning record -- even in a Republican primary in West Virginia."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know what, you're right; it's going to be fascinating to see which way those undecided voters go. As we know, from looking at this race, it might be only 120, maybe a little bit north of that thousand people who actually turn out to vote. So, a very small percentage of West Virginians will decide who's going to run against Joe Manchin. And that's going to be race to watch, for sure. Juan turn your attention to Ohio for me, for a second. Kucinich versus Cordray, in the primary for -- to run for governor in Ohio."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Again, you know, so much about what we're discussing tonight, Martha is about populist politics. And so, you have Cordray who's being endorsed by Elizabeth Warren. And on the other-hand, you have Dennis Kucinich who's being backed by all the populists on his of the fence, it's like a divide among Democratic populists here. We just talked about West Virginia. At the moment, I'd say that the energy is with Kucinich who was mayor of Cleveland, had terms -- several terms in the house, and has political contacts and networks that are working for him."

If Cordray does win, that's going to be interesting, because the last time that Cordray was on the ballot in Ohio, he was running for attorney general against Mike DeWine. So, we'd see rematch if that happens. But it should, Cordray should win, but I think Juan is right. There's a populist energy behind Kucinich. He has lot of very strange allies, including money from group that have associations with Assad in Syria of all things. But nonetheless, I think it's going to be a very interesting race to watch because the Democratic Party is disrupted just like the Republican Party is in some parts of the country."

A new book is asking some really interesting questions about the 2016 win: was it just a fluke as some pundits have indicated or does it represent a fundamental electoral shift in our nation's politics that could impact tomorrow night's elections, and perhaps all of American politics for many years to come. The book is called \"The Great Revolt: Inside the Populist Coalition Reshaping American Politics\" and its authors Salena Zito and Brad Todd, joining me now. Great to have both of you with us. You documented 2016 in-depth; picking up on some of these trends before they really surfaced on election night. You surprised who lot of people. So, let me ask you first just, you know, as you listen to that discussion about these primaries tonight, this is what's brewing out in the country, what is your handle on what might happen based on what you've been seeing, Salena?"

They're trying to pick up portions that they think that they reflect the most about his candidacy. And I think that tells you a lot about the electorate, that it's still sort of unsettled, and that it is still against the status quo, and it is interested in disrupting what's going on in elections. And that it's not willing to listen to what Washington is telling them."

You know, so, I think the Democrats have been radicalized in this process. But if the reason our book, I think if you didn't see the Trump wave coming, if you didn't see this coalition, this fusion of populist and conservatives, which changed the Republican Party and change the kind of coalitions that Republicans put together. If you didn't see that coming, this book is for you. And it's continued on in commercial -- the NFL, dick's sporting goods.

I would say, look, maybe in August and September, and see what kind of campaigns that they're running and what they are saying that is appealing to voters. They want to talk about the economy. They still always want to talk about the economy and how they're treated with respect. A big part of this is that they -- this is a culture that feels as though it is not been respected. And not just by politics, but by big business and by sport, and by sort of everything that we do in the world. And their impact is well beyond the ballot box, and that's why I think it's so important that people read the book, because I think they need to understand there's a movement going on. And we're still not listening to what it is telling us."

Then you've got a lot of people in the middle who sort of want to go back to where things were. I think most of more Republican candidates who maybe like that middle zone. How do you see that?

And so, there is a populous fusion that says big government, big business, it's both bad, and we're waiting to see. And a huge number of Trump voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and Iowa, and Wisconsin, and Michigan where we worked, those voters had voted for Obama twice and they didn't get what they wanted from President Obama, and they were willing to break decades of family party traditions to switch. We have those stories in the book.

I mean, if you recall in 2015 when John Kerry was negotiating this horrible Iran deal, Tom Cotton and 46 Republican senators wrote a letter to Iran's leaders in which they simply explained the senate's role in the advised and consent in the approval of international agreement. And John Kerry was outraged. He expressed his utter disbelief at their irresponsible actions. He said, this is a quote, to write the leaders in the middle of a negotiation is quite stunning and ignores more than two centuries of precedent in the conduct of American foreign policy. Now, Tom Cotton was, and is, a sitting United States senator. The senate has a constitutional role in American foreign policy. John Kerry has a constitutional role in nothing. He's a former official.

Schneiderman has been an outspoken advocate for the Me Too Movement and a longtime critic of President Trump. The new accusations outlined in the New Yorker involve heavy use of alcohol, unwanted advances, hitting, slapping, even death threats. One of the women even claimed that Schneiderman threatened to tap her phone so that he could track her down and kill her if she broke up with him. Moments ago, the attorney general released a statement that said this, in the privacy of intimate relationships I have engaged in role-play and other consensual sexual activities. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross. More on that as it develops. Also developing tonight, in 1975, in the wealthy enclave of Belhaven in Greenwich, Connecticut, a 15-year-old girl's body was found under a pine tree. She had been hit so hard with a golf club that it broke the club in half. The blunt end was used to stab her in the neck. Earlier that night, she had been at the Skakel house. The Kennedy cousins were known for running wild and having little adult supervision after the passing of their young mother. Martha had been in the garage according to this story with some kids listening to music like typical teenagers, and what happened next, only those who were there really know. Was she killed by the tutor, Ken Littleton, or one of the Skakel boys, Michael or Tommy?

They were in Belhaven. They thought they lived a privileged life. Dominic Dunne wrote a fictional story, a book about it. Mark Furhman wrote 'Murder in Greenwich' about it.

I mean, he was a sicko. You know, his mother had died two years before he's 15-years-old. He was already an alcoholic. He had a troubled person who was easily convicted. He did ten years in prison, remember."

And as you say, you look at the pictures of that young -- I remember when it all happened and she had her life snuffed out, and we still -- still so much mystery surrounding it. Good to see you, Geraldo, thanks for joining us. So, a conservative commentator, Dinesh D'Souza, had to serve time for donating too much money to a Republican candidate, will Rosie O'Donnell face the same punishment for doing the same thing?"

She apparently is unfazed by the repercussions boasting in a tweet today, quote, all my donations, my goal is to support all those opposed to Trump, Rosie.com. Have at it, she goes on with her hash tags. Here now Dr. Gina Laudon, psychology expert and creator of the nonprofit, They All Have Names, and Jessica Tarlov, Democratic pollster and Fox News contributor. I love how Rosie says, I make most of them late at night when I'm depressed, and I just go on and keep hitting the donate, donate, donate button. But, you know, Dinesh D'Souza did basically the same thing, over donating. He spent eight months in a halfway house. So, Jessica, does Rosie deserve the same sentence?"

It sounds like she was using multiple aliases to be able to do this to donate to Adam Schiff and Connor Lamb, and a number of others. What Dinesh D'Souza did was to go over the limit himself and also recruit other people to be donating. And then."

I can understand though, the campaign finance laws are very confusing, and if I'm really honest I think it is confusing enough that perhaps the candidates should be, you know, in charge of -- for funding whatever is not used. On the other hand, for the sake of consistency, you just know that if this were Roseanne donating to Trump instead of Rosie donating to Democrats, you know, she'd be making a lot of noise about it and saying maybe we should throw the book at them."

Let's say you contrast this with our beautiful first lady now and there's just no comparison. This is all about divisiveness. And to say the words she said that for some reason we should vote for woman simply because she's a woman, and to condescend the American women who voted for Trump is on its face sexist, Martha."
