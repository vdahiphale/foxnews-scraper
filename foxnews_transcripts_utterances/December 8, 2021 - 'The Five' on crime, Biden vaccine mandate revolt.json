The tree is basically represent the kind of random violence that is fueled by mental illness that has become pretty much part of everyday city life. We have abandoned the deranged and I use the deranged as a scientific term. There are criminally deranged people living on our streets and we're merely -- we're part of some weird experiment where progressives had never really thought about what happens when you allow unstable and dangerous people into the general public. Well, they assault women. We've seen that. They assault elderly women. We've seen that. We've seen them assault elderly Asian women. Remember? That was -- that used to be a hate crime, right? Is it still a hate crime because we don't hear about it? There's lots of property damage and now you see a tree getting burned down. A lot of this crime, we know what's causing it. We don't know how to deal with this problem anymore. And it has to do with a change in language using the umbrella term of homeless which consists of a lot of factions, but we immediately are told to assume its people down on their luck, but it is not just that. You have grifters. You have junkies. You have the mentally ill. You have the criminally deranged. We were sold the idea that the homeless were benign families who miss one month of rent. No. You walk up and down the streets of New York, you see the consequences of Mayor de Blasio's utter failure in dealing with the mentally ill. We gave his wife a billion bucks to deal with this. We have no idea where the money went. Meanwhile, innocent civilians, tourists, people in Times Square in broad daylight are getting there asses kicked. They're getting bludgeoned. They're getting murdered by people who do not belong on the street. And we want to get them off of the streets because they are a danger to themselves as well. But we have a grotesque, the ghoulish mayor who doesn't give a flying F. So there is only one solution for this and that is people have to start suing the cities that release thugs and the mentally ill onto the street who brutalize people. You know, there is a guy that just beat two women in New York and he was released. Then he went and beat another woman savagely at -- like 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday. And then he was let out again. And these are the courts. We don't have guns in New York. We can't protect ourselves. The cops only arrive after the crime. The only thing that's left is to go after the courts to sue the cities. And whether it's a class action suit, but this stuff has to stop.",

And what -- we don't know that this guy was mentally ill. Everybody wants to say, oh, they're mentally ill, they're crazy. I think they're evil, okay. There's a big difference.

When you had one of the police officers today, when the stats came out about the 12 cities, he said that it was up in Rochester. That this is like a war zone. People are actually seeing this with their own eyes and I think we need a surge to deal with it. I think that a lot of this money that they want to spend in Build Back Better should be put into our prison system, into the court system. If the courts are backed up or the prisons are backed up where you don't have enough prison guards, you don't have enough police, that' where I would put all of that money, maybe not all, okay. But I would put a great majority of it there because if people do not feel safe, they're -- people are not going to vote for you if you tell them, you're fine, you're fine. No, don't worry.

And there are some mayors across the country and specifically the police chief, so I think, are leading this surge of making it clear to people and even higher positions of power that what's going on on the ground is not adequate. They don't have the support that they need. They don't have enough police officers who have stayed in their jobs or who want to answer these calls because they know that things are not going to turn out as well for them as they did before and we can debate how we got to this place. But I think it relates to the conversation from last week about when we're going to see the fissures between the D.A.' and the council members and the police officer, the police chief and now the administration. And I do believe that Joe Biden gets this. This is how he talked on the campaign trail. He was the first one to come out about the looting and to say this is different than the George Floyd protest. This is ransacking stores and just taking what you want. So, I'm hopeful that we will shift more on that direction. And as always, because this is on film, that is why this is happening. Like this is why people are going to jail who would might normally be able to get away with it and it's what's going on with these stores because you can't say they're not being looted because it's all on film.",

As a sign of resilience and hope we will be lighting the new light -- tree live here tomorrow night during THE FIVE and we will be joined by our colleagues Lawrence Jones and Abby Hornacek. They led the original tree lighting last weekend with Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhart, Mike Rowe, Pete Hegseth, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Todd Piro, and Carly Shimkus Carley Shimkus. We also have some incredible guests including members of the FDNY and NYPD and remarks by Cardinal Dolan, our contributor Reverend Jacques DeGraff, and Rabbi Joseph Potosnick. The festivities start at 4 30 and we encourage all of you to come and enjoy some holiday cheer. And as a silver lining and an act of kindness during the holiday season, both Fox News Media and Fox Corporation have made a $100,000 donation to answer the call which provides financial assistance to the families of fallen service members of the FDNY and NYPD, the two agencies who responded immediately to our very own emergency. We are so grateful for all of them. And we would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for the outpouring of support from our neighbors around midtown Manhattan as well as our colleagues throughout Fox Corp and news corp and loyal viewers.",

The Biden White House coming to the sudden realization that crime is bad after blaming the wave of violence on the pandemic. The administration now trying to distance itself from outrageous comments from far left Democrats like AOC and Chicago's mayor Lori Lightfoot. They were downplaying the smash and grab rampages."

All right, Greg, no one likes the tree more than you did. How do you feel?"

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I know. It's a terrific loss in my life. Actually, it is -- it's pretty horrible. The tree is basically represent the kind of random violence that is fueled by mental illness that has become pretty much part of everyday city life. We have abandoned the deranged and I use the deranged as a scientific term. There are criminally deranged people living on our streets and we're merely -- we're part of some weird experiment where progressives had never really thought about what happens when you allow unstable and dangerous people into the general public. Well, they assault women. We've seen that. They assault elderly women. We've seen that. We've seen them assault elderly Asian women. Remember? That was -- that used to be a hate crime, right? Is it still a hate crime because we don't hear about it? There's lots of property damage and now you see a tree getting burned down. A lot of this crime, we know what's causing it. We don't know how to deal with this problem anymore. And it has to do with a change in language using the umbrella term of homeless which consists of a lot of factions, but we immediately are told to assume its people down on their luck, but it is not just that. You have grifters. You have junkies. You have the mentally ill. You have the criminally deranged. We were sold the idea that the homeless were benign families who miss one month of rent. No. You walk up and down the streets of New York, you see the consequences of Mayor de Blasio's utter failure in dealing with the mentally ill. We gave his wife a billion bucks to deal with this. We have no idea where the money went. Meanwhile, innocent civilians, tourists, people in Times Square in broad daylight are getting there asses kicked. They're getting bludgeoned. They're getting murdered by people who do not belong on the street. And we want to get them off of the streets because they are a danger to themselves as well. But we have a grotesque, the ghoulish mayor who doesn't give a flying F. So there is only one solution for this and that is people have to start suing the cities that release thugs and the mentally ill onto the street who brutalize people. You know, there is a guy that just beat two women in New York and he was released. Then he went and beat another woman savagely at -- like 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday. And then he was let out again. And these are the courts. We don't have guns in New York. We can't protect ourselves. The cops only arrive after the crime. The only thing that's left is to go after the courts to sue the cities. And whether it's a class action suit, but this stuff has to stop."

This whole issue has to do with the revolving door of justice. Whether it be the revolving door of justice as it relates to criminals or the revolving doors that relates to mental illness. And what -- we don't know that this guy was mentally ill. Everybody wants to say, oh, they're mentally ill, they're crazy. I think they're evil, okay. There's a big difference. But, he's got two prior public intoxication -- two prior drug arrest and one public intoxication. There is nothing that indicates he's necessarily mentally ill. Maybe he's off his rocker. I wouldn't climb up that tree, but you know, that's just me."

Then you can send in the Bellevue and then they can sit there for a while and be analyzed. But the bottom line here is the left is lying to us that's why this is happening. When Lori Lightfoot comes out and she says there is no crime here and it's up to the people who own the stores. You're full of crap. The people who own the stores pay taxes and you're defunding the police. You're telling the police to stand down. It's you, Lori Lightfoot. And I'm sick and tired of people talking about the fact that you know what, we've got to worry about these people. No, I want to worry about the innocent victims. And Larry Krasner ought to be beaten out of Philadelphia, booted out of Philadelphia I should say and recall along with Gascon. They are literally killing us and injuring us."

      "utterance": "I mean, I will concur with everything. I am baffled by the effort to downplay the rising rate of crime and murder across the country by the federal government, by the administration. I understand that the press secretary today said, well, actually, the DOJ is helping a little bit. Like I just think that's pretty weak sauce compare to what people are seeing. When you had one of the police officers today, when the stats came out about the 12 cities, he said that it was up in Rochester. That this is like a war zone. People are actually seeing this with their own eyes and I think we need a surge to deal with it. I think that a lot of this money that they want to spend in Build Back Better should be put into our prison system, into the court system. If the courts are backed up or the prisons are backed up where you don't have enough prison guards, you don't have enough police, that' where I would put all of that money, maybe not all, okay. But I would put a great majority of it there because if people do not feel safe, they're -- people are not going to vote for you if you tell them, you're fine, you're fine. No, don't worry. This is -- murder capital, don't worry about it. War zone, it's not real. That's what Larry Krasner did in Philadelphia."

      "utterance": "I just read a lot and it was in \"The New York Times\" so, as it was in my bible. So, Eric Adams is saying I'm going to keep safe. And there are some mayors across the country and specifically the police chief, so I think, are leading this surge of making it clear to people and even higher positions of power that what's going on on the ground is not adequate. They don't have the support that they need. They don't have enough police officers who have stayed in their jobs or who want to answer these calls because they know that things are not going to turn out as well for them as they did before and we can debate how we got to this place. But I think it relates to the conversation from last week about when we're going to see the fissures between the D.A.' and the council members and the police officer, the police chief and now the administration. And I do believe that Joe Biden gets this. This is how he talked on the campaign trail. He was the first one to come out about the looting and to say this is different than the George Floyd protest. This is ransacking stores and just taking what you want. So, I'm hopeful that we will shift more on that direction. And as always, because this is on film, that is why this is happening. Like this is why people are going to jail who would might normally be able to get away with it and it's what's going on with these stores because you can't say they're not being looted because it's all on film."

And having a ports envoy have this conversation or people who aren't Joe Biden who I think does actually pretty well in these interviews, is not going to hack it for the American public.

And I believe it was middle of the month now, Afghanistan has been going downhill for two weeks and we're watching all of this happen. And all of a sudden, there's a press conference as announced by President Biden. Oh, what's it -- talk about Afghanistan? All right, pay attention. No. That's when he announced all these vaccine mandates to try to change the subject. And I think that he completely miscalculated. I understand wanting to get people vaccinated, absolutely. And I support vaccines for the people that it make sense for health-wise. But Rand Paul did something pretty interesting through the Small Business Committee showing like -- showing how the job impact in different states is the result of these vaccine mandates. So, if when you look at it that way, you have the president saying \"well, we're going to do these mandates.\" Well, the Republicans are going to say something and it was going to be job impact. So, in some ways, this decision in the middle of Afghanistan to just throw out there the vaccine mandate without good legal backing was the most costly P.R. stunt in history because now it's going to be pulled back."

Then I think -- and I'm going to read this. Even in times of crisis, courts must preserve the rule of law and ensure that all branches of government act within the bounds of their constitutionally grounded authority. Biden didn't do it that's why he keeps getting slapped down. And I -- one more thing, why is the left so focused on totalitarianism?

As a sign of resilience and hope we will be lighting the new light -- tree live here tomorrow night during THE FIVE and we will be joined by our colleagues Lawrence Jones and Abby Hornacek. They led the original tree lighting last weekend with Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhart, Mike Rowe, Pete Hegseth, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Todd Piro, and Carly Shimkus Carley Shimkus. We also have some incredible guests including members of the FDNY and NYPD and remarks by Cardinal Dolan, our contributor Reverend Jacques DeGraff, and Rabbi Joseph Potosnick. The festivities start at 4 30 and we encourage all of you to come and enjoy some holiday cheer. And as a silver lining and an act of kindness during the holiday season, both Fox News Media and Fox Corporation have made a $100,000 donation to answer the call which provides financial assistance to the families of fallen service members of the FDNY and NYPD, the two agencies who responded immediately to our very own emergency. We are so grateful for all of them. And we would also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for the outpouring of support from our neighbors around midtown Manhattan as well as our colleagues throughout Fox Corp and news corp and loyal viewers."

But he didn't stop there. Since no one came to the door, the elk decided to treat himself to a quick snack. He spent several minutes munching on the flowers near the door. After having his fill of flowers, he moved on to nibbling around the Christmas tree reef."
