If they apply for asylum or they just want to come here for work, the judge says, yes, you can stay or no, and issues a deportation hearing -- proceeding.

That was -- these were citizens of Germany, they were paying taxes -- comparing -- again, comparing Nazi Germany to this is really bad. President Trump also said today, we are going -- we're focused on criminals as much as we can and I believe that, because the Department of Homeland Security is under such extreme scrutiny and they've telegraphed for six weeks that these raids are coming, that imagine how everyone is going to be out and about in these cities ready to film anything to try to catch anything that would make it look like they're being insensitive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it is going to be heart-wrenching, people are here for a long time, they have ties, but if they've committed a crime in the United States, and they have a deportation order, and the President of the United States decides to execute on those orders, then I think they have to follow the law.

He's not President Trump, he's President MacGyver. He figured out a way to solve the problem with the tools that he had. And only somebody who's been in business understands this. Politicians stop there and focus on this problem for so long, and he says I'll just go around back and fix this myself. He is solving these problems using two key movers in human nature. One of them is fairness and the other is incentive. Fairness, people who did it the right way, people who waited in line, it is not fair to cut in line, that is -- everybody understands that, especially minorities who come from other countries who waited in line. The process matters, because then everybody is treated fairly. That's human nature, incentive. What he's doing right now is predicated on the Republican disincentive.

Create like -- I'm serious, create like a team that has a Doctor Marc Seagull, Bill Pulte. Have these people that are interested in solving problems. Bill Pulte is tackling the blithe in Detroit. People that aren't political. These are not political people. Get an engineer involved that can figure out how to build these shelters to get these people in, because they're not using the shelters in L.A. the way they use them in New York. Something like 5 percent I got from Dr. Siegel. So, I don't know. I think there's a way to do this. I think Trump should attack it.",

They tried to quarantine them into these zombie zones. Then now there is spillover from the zones and it's affecting police and families and small businesses. The point is the czar thing could work, but you have to have Democrat buy in. You have to have some Democrat buy in, in California or they're not going to allow these experts from the Trump team to parachute in and try to fix the problem that they helped create. I haven't heard a thing from Democrats running for president about this issue, this very issue. I've heard a lot about compassion for illegal immigrants, not a lot of compassion for American citizens that are living right under their noses. And that's why a lot of Americans are upset with the Democratic Party because they feel like they care more about other people than they care about the people living under their own border. They haven't heard anything in the media about this. Where is CNN? Where is MSNBC?

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, HOST",
      "utterance": "So you have congresswoman saying don't follow and comply with the law that Congress pass. Everything that's happening here is completely legal. If you have an illegal immigrant crossing the border that gets caught by border patrol you detained them, you process them, they get a hearing in front of an immigration judge. If they apply for asylum or they just want to come here for work, the judge says, yes, you can stay or no, and issues a deportation hearing -- proceeding. Then, ICE will come, because they do interior enforcement to a house, apprehend and deport. That's the law that Congress passed years ago. The executive branch is enforcing that law. And the judge is signing off on everything. So you have the executive, judicial and legislative branches all working together harmoniously, but you have Democrats saying, don't follow the laws of our country. They want American citizens to follow the laws, but they don't want illegal aliens. This one you have to think, do they want any enforcement? They don't want it in the interior. They don't want it at the border. They don't want you to have to stay in a country that you are and apply. When you get there, they don't want you detained. If you commit a crime in a sanctuary city, they don't want to let ICE know about it. They don't even want the federal government to ask you a question, are you a U.S. citizen? But want they do want, they want to give you an American job, they want to give you a driver's license, in-state college tuition, and they want to give you free health insurance. So at this point, the Democrats are the party of open borders and that's just a fact."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Oh, is that -- that's really -- oh, OK. All right, got it. So neglecting to enforce the law for a couple of decades on these enforcement orders means that this problem just gets harder. And unless America is going to say, OK, then everybody is here illegally, you can stay. If we're going to say that, then we should have that debate. And then the laws would have to change. I don't think anybody is actually saying that. The fact that we have so many illegal immigrants here, that is hurting people who want immigrate here legally. The number of stories of people who are stuck in the process, who are stuck in the paperwork because there's not enough resources to figure out how to get them here legally. We need people to come here. We need people to come and work and to -- want to raise their families here. I would also say that like with what Joy Behar said, it's so atrocious because Jews were targeted because of who they were, not because of what they had done. That was -- these were citizens of Germany, they were paying taxes -- comparing -- again, comparing Nazi Germany to this is really bad. President Trump also said today, we are going -- we're focused on criminals as much as we can and I believe that, because the Department of Homeland Security is under such extreme scrutiny and they've telegraphed for six weeks that these raids are coming, that imagine how everyone is going to be out and about in these cities ready to film anything to try to catch anything that would make it look like they're being insensitive. And it is going to be heart-wrenching, people are here for a long time, they have ties, but if they've committed a crime in the United States, and they have a deportation order, and the President of the United States decides to execute on those orders, then I think they have to follow the law. For as hard as it might be to watch, it is actually what needs to be done. And the fact that we have not done it for decades means it just gets worse the longer we don't do it."

It totally destroys all of the objections about it, violating this or violating that, and it maybe more accurate to answering the census question. That's pretty bad ass, I have to say. He's not President Trump, he's President MacGyver. He figured out a way to solve the problem with the tools that he had. And only somebody who's been in business understands this. Politicians stop there and focus on this problem for so long, and he says I'll just go around back and fix this myself. He is solving these problems using two key movers in human nature. One of them is fairness and the other is incentive. Fairness, people who did it the right way, people who waited in line, it is not fair to cut in line, that is -- everybody understands that, especially minorities who come from other countries who waited in line. The process matters, because then everybody is treated fairly. That's human nature, incentive. What he's doing right now is predicated on the Republican disincentive. Word gets out that we're going to deport people who are there illegally disincentives people from coming here. It's the opposite of waiving caravans through. So these are two things that human beings understand, fairness and incentive. These are two things that the Democrats can't get into their thick skulls, and that's why they're losing the American public and they're devouring themselves. And now I would like to be sworn in."

      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST",

And to respond to what both of you guys were saying, I think that the outcry over the enforcement of the existing laws ignores the fact that there are built in safety features within the process itself, the final deportation order means that all appeals have been exhausted. Even if the immigrants just reserved or waves -- or reserves the right to appeal, that automatically stays the entire proceeding. There are more safety features built in. So are we calling into question the judges' order, the judges' judgment? Are we calling into question the policies, the 90 days that ICE has to then deport? Like, if so, then let's change it, congress-people or voters, or what else do our tax dollars pay for? There are estimates of hundreds of thousands, if not one million, that are here with final deportation orders --"

Everybody is a target. What kills me about this is how the media is framing this. So what interests them is how did Acosta go out? Was he pushed out or did he leave on his own? No, it was the media and their nonstop focus on Acosta, not Epstein that forced his hand. Again, only the media could make a Democratic pedophile a Republican problem."

It's totally shifting the spotlight away from the pedophile, away from that plea agreement, that if it does raise your eyebrows, and if you do have issues with it, then you should participate in the criminal justice system to know why it should be changed, and proceed further into all of the participants with that agreement, and for so many years, including in this state federally and locally. So they're just so many moving parts that as always get ignored because of the clamoring of the media that's trying to drag on Trump's heels, and also because of the left that's trying to put this on the person that doesn't deserve the spotlight like a tenth of as much as Epstein does."

But when he said things are different now -- well, no, human trafficking and pedophilia that's not different. Maybe he didn't mean that. But I think that he was definitely going to continue to have to answer these questions every day, and sometimes the best thing that you can do is walk away from even from a job that you really like. I thought that was pretty nice of President Trump to do that, and to give him a pretty nice send-off. He didn't get the oval office treatment like Nikki Haley, but he certainly wasn't just kicked out without any, sort of, like handshake, goodbye. I think Scott Pruitt when he left, he didn't get anything like that. So Alex Acosta leaves under a little bit of a cloud, but I don't think because of how he did as labor secretary, those are new complaints from the people in the administration saying he wasn't going far enough, fast enough. The economy is obviously doing very well. And I don't know what would be next for him, thought. I think it will be hard to land somewhere right away."

In countries like Haiti, for example, when they have terrible infrastructure, you have bodies that rot, you have -- and then you have rats, and then you have disease. That's what you're having in L.A. And that's not a natural disaster. You want a man-made disaster, this is man-made. It's three issues and he's nailed it, mental health issues, drug issues, and an incentive to stay. The incentive to stay is we're not gonna bug you, we're gonna let you go. Dr. Drew sent that email out to us about how the fire department comes in and tries to clean it up, but what they end up doing as they hose the human fesses and the drugs into the water. Sixty thousand people, their stuff goes into the water. My suggestion and what Trump should do is he should declare an emergency and appoint Drew as like a homeless czar, right? Create like -- I'm serious, create like a team that has a Doctor Marc Seagull, Bill Pulte. Have these people that are interested in solving problems. Bill Pulte is tackling the blithe in Detroit. People that aren't political. These are not political people. Get an engineer involved that can figure out how to build these shelters to get these people in, because they're not using the shelters in L.A. the way they use them in New York. Something like 5 percent I got from Dr. Siegel. So, I don't know. I think there's a way to do this. I think Trump should attack it."

They tried to quarantine them into these zombie zones. Then now there is spillover from the zones and it's affecting police and families and small businesses. The point is the czar thing could work, but you have to have Democrat buy in. You have to have some Democrat buy in, in California or they're not going to allow these experts from the Trump team to parachute in and try to fix the problem that they helped create. I haven't heard a thing from Democrats running for president about this issue, this very issue. I've heard a lot about compassion for illegal immigrants, not a lot of compassion for American citizens that are living right under their noses. And that's why a lot of Americans are upset with the Democratic Party because they feel like they care more about other people than they care about the people living under their own border. They haven't heard anything in the media about this. Where is CNN? Where is MSNBC? It seems like the national media also doesn't care about it, just like they don't care about black on black crime in the south of Chicago, just don't like they care about other issues that make them look bad politically."
