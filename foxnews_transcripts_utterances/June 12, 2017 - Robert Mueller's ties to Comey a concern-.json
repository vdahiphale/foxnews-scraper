Now a production of a Shakespearean play, Julius Caesar, went lower with a horrifying and tasteless scene. In the Shakespearean play, Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar is assassinated. In the Shakespeare in the park adaptation, President Trump is assassinated. The Trump character stabbed repeatedly over and over, hundreds of times, blood flying everywhere. Cast members trying to rip the president apart. Multiple assassins take turns stabbing a dying president. Now we highlighted this disgusting scene, and the sponsors reacted swiftly. Delta Air Lines is Julius Caesar largest sponsor, they pulled out of funding for the production. Bank of America followed as well. Because this isn't art, this is just disgusting. Now that's my opinion, but apparently not the opinion of the New York Times who vowed to remain its sponsors of the play, as well as Time Warner will also remain as sponsors. Unbelievably, CNN host Fareed Zakaria just called the Trump assassination play a, quote, masterpiece. No, New York Times, Time Warner, or CNN, it's not art, it's not free speech, and certainly not a masterpiece, it's just plain hate. But I do remember something far-less hate filled happening in 2013, there's a rodeo clown who wore an Obama mask in the ring. He tried to have fun at the then president expense, but the left-wing media hypocrites went apoplectic. That rodeo clown was fired over your outrage at such a display of disrespect for a seated president. Well, lefties, apply that same outrage to the folks at Julius Caesar. I dare you. You'd be demanding that play be shut down. Or more predictably, you'll defend the play as artistic expression and expose the ominous undercarriage of the liberal media which is loaded with hypocrisy and devoid of American values. All right.

You have the director of the FBI deliberately leaking in order to create a special counsel who we're now supposed to believe is going to be this neutral figure. I think that's just nonsense. I distrust independent counsels. I think that the people Mueller is bringing in are dangerous people, and any Republican who thinks this council is going to be neutral is crazy. It'll be like expecting The Post or the New York Times to be accurate."

I think it's very important for all sorts of armchair speculators in the law to be clear that no one knows right now whether there's a provable case of obstruction. It's also true, I think, from based on what I see is a third party and out of government, that there's no basis to say there's no obstruction."

But Newt Gingrich makes a very good point. We've kind of talked about it last week. But think about this for a second, I was thinking over the weekend. All right, so, James Comey in the middle of the night, after he was fired, realizes that he is going to somehow form the dialogue that's going to require a special counsel. So in the middle of the night he gets up and leaked his memo, tells his friend to leak the memo to the New York Times. At that point he's a private citizen. He shouldn't be doing that. It's not his job to get an independent counsel appointed for the Trump case. So it's going to be a witch hunt, I agree with Newt."

And also we're talking about Newt, what he said about this special counsel when it was announced, that this guy was great, honest, integrity, the media better calm down, so it's just this case of deciding how you feel about somebody based on what's politically convenient. It's not a fan."

She's an entrepreneur, a family law attorney, and a regular on the Fox News Channel, but she specializes is being the best mom ever, Kisha Hebbon is here. And he's a radio talk show host and listed in Talkers Magazine as a heavy hundred for three consecutive years, he's also the author of the book, Liars and Whores, breaking down big government and big business, and he's the current host of his daily talk radio show on KGO 810 San Francisco, but his specialty is everything tech, Ethan Bearman is here. Thank you both for being with us. So, I'll start with you, Ethan. To this point, Kat is referring to a tweet from Newt Gingrich, May 17, 2017, pretty much a month ago. Robert Mueller is a superb choice to be special counsel. He's reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should calm down now. So which is it for Mr. Gingrich?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ETHAN BEARMAN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, of all things Newt Gingrich should know something about special investigators. Remember the 1990's, we spent a lot of time with Kenneth Starr because of special investigators. Who was it? Oh, Newt Gingrich was speaker of the house when all that went down. This is political expediency on the part of Mr. Gingrich, and I leave it at that."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Yeah. But also the -- Newt Gingrich is also -- things have changed since Robert Mueller was originally announced as a special investigator, that he's decided to bring in a lot of extra firepower, so may be -- Newt is entitled to change his opinion about Robert Mueller, is he not? Of course, he is."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "OK. So to that, Kisha -- so as we say, and I do think Eric is right, he's brought on some team, many of them reported donors to Democratic presidential candidates in the past, but when you talk about integrity, and as attorneys we can speak about this, it's your reputation over a long period of time that one would think would create a notion of integrity and your reputation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISHA HEBBON, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Right, I agree. And I think with this situation, Mueller has a reputation of doing the right thing, and I'm sure he's not going to place himself in a position where he's looked at as having a conflict of interest and not doing anything about it. And one of the things I thought about thinking about this case is that he also has the option to use someone else on his team to deal with the victim part of -- with Comey. He doesn't have to do everything. There's a team of people working with the appointed counsel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, yeah. But we do know Comey have enjoyed -- well, actually both of them. I think, Eric, and correct me if I'm wrong, Ethan, or Kisha, or Kat, they both enjoyed bipartisan leadership. They both worked under both Bush and Obama. So I do think that has to speak for something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "President Obama appointed James Comey as FBI director, but they do worked under bipartisan leadership, yeah, but not necessarily in this capacity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "OK, fair enough. Fair enough. So let me ask you this, Ethan, if we're looking at this -- OK, let me get you in here, sorry. Looking at this and you want to think that a special prosecutor is the answer because many people thought that was the only way this thing is going to get to the nitty-gritty. If it's not Robert Mueller, who in the world is it at this point that will satisfy both sides of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Nobody is going to be satisfied because people on one side want one thing, people on the other side want the other thing. And whoever that special prosecutor is, everyone should only want the truth. That's what everybody should want to come out of it. And if there's something that goes against what that -- that outcome to be, they're going to blame it on the person. That's what politics has been since the beginning of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "speaker": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.",
      "utterance": "Here's what's so frustrating for Republicans like me. You may be the first president in history to go down because you can't stop inappropriate talking about an investigation that if you were just quiet would clear you. It's frustrating for me to want to help a man who I think will do big things. No other Republican would do."

      "utterance": "It hurts you. But, you know, Eric, you've been consistent and saying that the president should keep tweeting, and certainly that his base and many people do want to hear from him, but is there any validity as to what Senator Graham is talking about?"
    },

      "speaker": "BOLLING",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "He and McCain are two anti-Trump. They'll do anything in their way to undermine the Trump presidency. John McCain, over the weekend, said that under President Obama our foreign policy or something to that effect, was better under President Obama than President Trump. I just wish on McCain and Lindsey Graham would just go off into the sunset and enjoy their retirement, 174,000 a grand a year they make, just enjoy their retirement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, on that note, I do think that Lindsey Graham - - let's say you taken that a little bit of face value, and you think that maybe he's not a friend of Trump for sure, but he does want to see some of this implementation because he's a Republican. But he feels that Trump is making a difficult for that to be the case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right, absolutely. The original issue was the idea of Trump and Russia and collusion, and that's what people were looking into at first. And now it's Trump obstruction. There would be no Trump obstruction if it weren't for Trump saying things. That's just the fact of the matter, Eric. I'm not saying it's fair or not fair."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEBBON",
      "utterance": "I have to say that there's no clear-cut evidence of obstruction of justice, but it does smell of a fishy situation. Why would a president meet along with the head of the FBI and say I hope you can let this go, or we can drop this? It doesn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "The counterargument though would say, well, he wanted privacy, he wanted to be able to develop a relationship with his sitting -- you know, the point that we're demonstrating, all of us here in this panel, especially Kisha on this moment, you can argue it either way. That's the point. The point is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

My father and this administration intend to be transformative. So I didn't expect it to be easy. I think some of these distractions and some of the ferocity was -- I was a little blindsided by it on a personal level."

I will tell you watching that interview with Ivanka, rare interview with Ivanka, she's someone to keep your on because I think that if Donald Trump for some reason decides not to run in 2020, I think he will, but if doesn't, keep your eye on Ivanka Trump. I think she's one who could be a major political player going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

That's why I ask that point, not to be sarcastic, on favorability and un-likability of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were at a world-class low, the reason I'm seeing in this country, so that's why I'm a little surprised at her being surprised by this treatment."

I believe that politics has moved beyond being just a blood sport. This is a full on roman colosseum is what's happening here. We're wanting heads and everything else, as horribly evidenced by Kathy Griffin. But let's be honest about this, you have to know what you're getting into at this point because we are seeing these things going on. And I hope we can find our way forward out of this and be a better country where we're not just viciously attacking over every little thing. I think Ivanka's got more than her fair share of getting attacked for what her father has done. She's not her father."

Remember that when it was like the peak outrage, horribly sexist thing to say, people went nuts over that. So then when you have Trump who's been caught saying things that are unquestionably, objectively, very offensive, you can't be surprised that you're going to have this kind of backlash. I don't know why in the world you'll be surprise."

Be sure to catch the Fox special coverage of the Jeff Sessions' hearing tomorrow, beginning at 2:00 PM eastern, right here on Fox News Channel. And when we come back, it is time to wake up, America. A Trump-inspired production of Julius Caesar sparked an uproar after depicting the assassination of our president, and it got Eric Bolling all fired up. Stay tuned."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. It's time now for wake up, America. Just when you thought it was impossible, liberal left wing nut jobs in Hollywood and Broadway have reached a new low. Lower even than the low that was reached last week when Kathy Griffin simulated the beheading of President Trump with a bloody head dangling over her non-talented hands in an obvious -- to ISIS terrorists. Now a production of a Shakespearean play, Julius Caesar, went lower with a horrifying and tasteless scene. In the Shakespearean play, Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar is assassinated. In the Shakespeare in the park adaptation, President Trump is assassinated. The Trump character stabbed repeatedly over and over, hundreds of times, blood flying everywhere. Cast members trying to rip the president apart. Multiple assassins take turns stabbing a dying president. Now we highlighted this disgusting scene, and the sponsors reacted swiftly. Delta Air Lines is Julius Caesar largest sponsor, they pulled out of funding for the production. Bank of America followed as well. Because this isn't art, this is just disgusting. Now that's my opinion, but apparently not the opinion of the New York Times who vowed to remain its sponsors of the play, as well as Time Warner will also remain as sponsors. Unbelievably, CNN host Fareed Zakaria just called the Trump assassination play a, quote, masterpiece. No, New York Times, Time Warner, or CNN, it's not art, it's not free speech, and certainly not a masterpiece, it's just plain hate. But I do remember something far-less hate filled happening in 2013, there's a rodeo clown who wore an Obama mask in the ring. He tried to have fun at the then president expense, but the left-wing media hypocrites went apoplectic. That rodeo clown was fired over your outrage at such a display of disrespect for a seated president. Well, lefties, apply that same outrage to the folks at Julius Caesar. I dare you. You'd be demanding that play be shut down. Or more predictably, you'll defend the play as artistic expression and expose the ominous undercarriage of the liberal media which is loaded with hypocrisy and devoid of American values. All right. Now, I'm going to give my free-speech advocate on my left, screen right, a shot at this. Am I too harsh on the liberal media for not speaking up about this play?"

A lot of time that's going to be unpopular and you will face consequences. The consequences have to come from outside of the law. In a free society, this is free-speech. In order for not to be free speech it had to be a direct threat. It's obviously a fictional play. It's obviously not a direct threat. Hate speech is free-speech."

So I do think people are starting to see -- free-speech, absolutely, we all agree with that. But free-speech isn't necessarily free.

I am a fan of the individual to use their wallet as the number one way to vote in this country beyond the voting booth. It's even more powerful. I want the violence. I want that stuff to end and dial it back. This is back to what we were talking a little bit ago.

They're going to mark 49 people dead one year ago at the hand of a radical Islamic extremist.\" But guess what happened? I went through this thing and I'm looking for one link to anything regarding Pulse nightclub in Orlando, nothing. They're talking about civil rights. They're talking about these anti-Sharia protests.

Those are things that we need to look at. We can't be afraid to talk about those things for the sake of political correctness or not being sensitive, because that's a sick, evil thing that is happening in this country that we should be against.

They look to the Middle East, for example. They see some of the barbaric processes of female genital mutilation. That happens in Africa, as well.

      "utterance": "Emoluments Clause."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, the Emoluments Clause. And you know, we know that's Article I of the Constitution: to prevent our government and leadership from being influenced by foreign governments. But here's the issue, and I want to turn to Eric on this, as well. We don't want to penalize business people from going into political leadership. Because a lot of people in this country voted for exactly that. They are tired of, you know, status quo politicians. They want someone with business acumen in the White House. So for me, this looks like a premature lawsuit, Kisha, because I'm not really sure exactly what they're alleging the pay-for-play was here. They say something about Trump Tower getting a bunch of money but, essentially, where is the bought and paid for influence?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEBBON",
      "utterance": "Right. I think one of the biggest issues here and what differentiates President Trump from former presidents is that he didn't put it in a trust that's neutral. He's allowing his sons to control these businesses. So in essence, the public is going to feel he's still controlling it. He still has every say of what goes on with this business entity, and he can use his position as president to influence these foreign countries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's a lot of \"coulds,\" right? But we don't know that that's happened. I'm just playing devil's advocate here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEBBON",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "WE don't know that that's happened, so therefore, this suit, that's why I call it premature."

      "utterance": "Right."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Please."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "If you work in the White House, if you work for the administration, you have to divest. Like Rex Tillerson did, like all the others did. Rex Tillerson had something like $400 million in Exxon stock. He had to divest it. He had to put it into a blind trust that he can't touch it. The vice president and the president are excused from that ruling. The Emoluments Clause does not apply to those two. Now, would people like him, President Trump to say, \"You know what? I'm going to put this into a blind trust and not touch it?\" They would like it. Some would. I personally don't have a problem with it, but here's the point. You make a very good point. The reason why they're excluded as president and vice president, because you want the best people to be your president. And if the best person happens to be a businessman who can't divest, then he should be. And therefore, they are exempt from the Emoluments Clause."

      "speaker": "BEARMAN",
      "utterance": "This is the great thing about -- what I said the minute that President Trump was elected, on the election day, I said, \"Well, great. We will finally get an answer to the question of what it means to have a business person become president.\" That's what he has done. He doesn't have a background in politics. He wasn't part of any of this stuff that was going on. He wasn't part of the party system, other than, you know, the contributions that happened. So money is involved. So now we will get absolute answers to these questions."

Not here with us today. And then the really cool part, though, two news specialists each and every day. So 40 percent of the dialogue are brand-new voices for our viewers every single day."
