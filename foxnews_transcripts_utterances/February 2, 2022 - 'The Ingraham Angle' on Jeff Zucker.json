His relationship with fake news on Russiagate; the casual smearing of figures like DeSantis; and all the COVID fearmongering.

They trashed scientists and doctors, who simply wanted Americans to hear the other side of the story. They launched ugly attacks against President Trump and his team who eventually helped obtain the very vaccines that CNN now celebrates. So from beginning to end, the Zucker Covidians saw the pandemic not as a tragedy to be managed, but as an opportunity to be exploited. It is one of the most shameful periods in the history of American journalism. Maybe, just maybe post Zucker, CNN will begin to escape the cult it built. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford Medical School and one of the authors of the aforementioned Great Barrington declaration. Dr. B, first of all, I can't believe you've been coming on the show for this long. I keep looking at those clips. I was like, was that really October 2020? And indeed, of course, it was.

And CNN, I think, has played a really malign role in this. It's created a very hostile environment for people like me to try to advocate for same policies. And what's happened is that so many scientists stayed silent as a result of it, even though they had the same reservations that the - we are - the authors of the Great Barrington declaration had. It's been a devastating time to be a scientist. It has been a devastating time just to be here, because the lockdowns have created so much damage. I believe that there are many, many people who are now passed away that should have survived this, because of the harms in the lockdown. There should - the evidence on the international data alone. In March of 2021, 228,000 children, that's what the UN estimated would die from starvation caused by the lockdowns in South Asia.

What should have happened was a good, deep conversation between scientists who agreed and disagreed. We would have come to some conclusion that would have been far better than what we had.

And now even liberal websites like Slate thinks he has himself in a bind, claiming that Biden's pledge has backfired and needlessly tokenized future nominees. Likewise, Politico is fretting about the fact that so many Democrat consultants and insiders can't stop talking about the nomination as an off ramp to relocate Kamala Harris. \"Intense skepticism within some parts of the party about Harris' ability to win a presidential race if Biden does not run for reelection and a desire to open the field to other possible successors.\" Ouch. And given the radical views of some of the potential nominees, huge pressure will be put on so-called moderate Democrats, who are up for reelection this year. So they vote against Biden's pick.

We wish the senator a speedy and complete recovery. And we offer prayers to his family in very challenging, difficult time. But there's still the question of how this might affect a confirmation vote in a 50-50 Senate. Joining me now is Jonathan Turley, George Washington University law professor. Professor Turley, this was supposed to be kind of a slam dunk. But how is the situation evolving? Tell us one of the words that they like to apply to the Constitution as far as this nomination process goes.",

He would only consider black females. Diversity issues have been raised by presidents in the past, but they have been raised as sort of preferences, not exclusionary rules. Indeed, the Supreme Court has declared exclusionary rules like this one to be unconstitutional or unlawful, when applied to schools, or businesses. And so, you have this inherent conflict that he's created, where this nominee will sit and hear arguments in two cases on the constitutionality of this type of exclusionary rule. Now, that doesn't mean that this could be reviewed or that his choice will be reversed. But what's odd is that many of the media outlets are saying, well, other presidents have done this. And that's just not true. They say that Reagan did this. That when he appointed O'Connor, Reagan said, he would give one of his first positions, one of the vacancies to a woman. But the White House stressed that was not a guarantee. And when O'Connor was selected, Reagan had a shortlist with the majority of men on it. Trump, when he said that he would be putting a woman on Supreme Court, had already spent months and months with a public shortlist that they've been vetting. Barrett had been a front runner in the previous nomination. And when he said he was going to put a woman on the court, it was days before he was going to announce her name. What these presidents didn't do is, they didn't say that they would not consider anyone else beyond people with this race, this gender as specified in an exclusionary threshold rule. It's just--",

You could disagree with whether they have the right jurisprudential views, but it's unfair to them for the President to say, Yes, you were selected on this threshold exclusionary basis.

They trashed scientists and doctors, who simply wanted Americans to hear the other side of the story. They launched ugly attacks against President Trump and his team who eventually helped obtain the very vaccines that CNN now celebrates. So from beginning to end, the Zucker Covidians saw the pandemic not as a tragedy to be managed, but as an opportunity to be exploited. It is one of the most shameful periods in the history of American journalism. Maybe, just maybe post Zucker, CNN will begin to escape the cult it built. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford Medical School and one of the authors of the aforementioned Great Barrington declaration. Dr. B, first of all, I can't believe you've been coming on the show for this long. I keep looking at those clips. I was like, was that really October 2020? And indeed, of course, it was.

And the press started attacking us, smearing us, arguing that we wanted to let the virus rip when what we wanted to do is protect the vulnerable. And CNN, I think, has played a really malign role in this. It's created a very hostile environment for people like me to try to advocate for same policies. And what's happened is that so many scientists stayed silent as a result of it, even though they had the same reservations that the - we are - the authors of the Great Barrington declaration had. It's been a devastating time to be a scientist. It has been a devastating time just to be here, because the lockdowns have created so much damage. I believe that there are many, many people who are now passed away that should have survived this, because of the harms in the lockdown. There should - the evidence on the international data alone. In March of 2021, 228,000 children, that's what the UN estimated would die from starvation caused by the lockdowns in South Asia. In the U.S., we just had a report that we've topped over 100,000 people dead from type 2 diabetes. That should be managed.

And yet at every turn, when we asked, when you asked for the data, the transparency, the justification, you're dismissed as anti-science, or you just - you're going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people, thousands of people.

What should have happened was a good, deep conversation between scientists who agreed and disagreed. We would have come to some conclusion that would have been far better than what we had. Instead, we had media outlets like CNN, essentially demonizing anyone who disagreed with Fauci, serving as the propaganda arm of Dr. Fauci.

But of course, he was also effectively discriminating against the vast majority of the adult population. And now even liberal websites like Slate thinks he has himself in a bind, claiming that Biden's pledge has backfired and needlessly tokenized future nominees. Likewise, Politico is fretting about the fact that so many Democrat consultants and insiders can't stop talking about the nomination as an off ramp to relocate Kamala Harris. \"Intense skepticism within some parts of the party about Harris' ability to win a presidential race if Biden does not run for reelection and a desire to open the field to other possible successors.\" Ouch. And given the radical views of some of the potential nominees, huge pressure will be put on so-called moderate Democrats, who are up for reelection this year. So they vote against Biden's pick. Think about it this way. If Montanans want to protect their Second Amendment rights, they better demand that Senator Jon Tester block Biden's pick. The same goes for Mark Kelly in Arizona.

He would only consider black females. Diversity issues have been raised by presidents in the past, but they have been raised as sort of preferences, not exclusionary rules. Indeed, the Supreme Court has declared exclusionary rules like this one to be unconstitutional or unlawful, when applied to schools, or businesses. And so, you have this inherent conflict that he's created, where this nominee will sit and hear arguments in two cases on the constitutionality of this type of exclusionary rule. Now, that doesn't mean that this could be reviewed or that his choice will be reversed. But what's odd is that many of the media outlets are saying, well, other presidents have done this. And that's just not true. They say that Reagan did this. That when he appointed O'Connor, Reagan said, he would give one of his first positions, one of the vacancies to a woman. But the White House stressed that was not a guarantee. And when O'Connor was selected, Reagan had a shortlist with the majority of men on it. Trump, when he said that he would be putting a woman on Supreme Court, had already spent months and months with a public shortlist that they've been vetting. Barrett had been a front runner in the previous nomination. And when he said he was going to put a woman on the court, it was days before he was going to announce her name. What these presidents didn't do is, they didn't say that they would not consider anyone else beyond people with this race, this gender as specified in an exclusionary threshold rule. It's just--"

Recent ABC News poll found that 76 percent of Americans want him to consider all nominees regardless of race or gender, only 23 percent supported Biden's pledge. So they don't want diversity to be the driving factor in a court pick. People are fine with nominee of any color, but that that's the driving factor above all else?

And he turned around and said it exactly like that. And I think a lot of people, I wrote a column the next day, sort of, what, whoa - that you're not stating a preference, you're actually stating an exclusionary rule. And he is stuck with it. But it's unfair to the nominees. There are people on the shortlist. African-American women on that shortlist that have stellar backgrounds. You could disagree with whether they have the right jurisprudential views, but it's unfair to them for the President to say, Yes, you were selected on this threshold exclusionary basis.

As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I've seen now dozens of his nominees to lower courts, and almost to a person, these are leftwing ideologues who believe that the Constitution is always evolving. Strangely, it is always evolving to left and to cater to the whims and the wishes of liberals at law schools and in big cities in the Democratic Party.

You have to believe that the Constitution is malleable. It's silly putty that can be stretched or moved, and words don't really matter. Heller, the Second Amendment, individual rights case authored by Justice Scalia, there's no way they would greet with that.

The left, especially the legal left in America does not view the Constitution as a law that has a settled meaning at the time it was adopted, at the time the amendments were added, and that it is our fundamentally law. They view it as something that is always subject to change, usually change in the liberal direction. And that means that Democrats who are up for reelection this year, like Raphael Warnock in Georgia, or Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, are going to have to answer for the views of this nominee if, as you say and I suspect, this nominee is hostile to free speech rights of every American, to the rights of gun owners or any of the other cherished rights we have in this country under our Constitution."

But if Biden is really interested in cutting the cancer death rate, he should have been more proactive getting those hospitals to treat and cure for cancer patients. There's a study out of the University of Birmingham that found that one in seven cancer patients missed their surgeries due to the COVID lockdowns, and the last cancer moonshot we spent $1.8 billion on, Laura, it didn't move that death rate at all."

      "utterance": "Awkward. Not only were the details of Zuck's office romance known for years, apparently it was reportedly common knowledge just among most staffers at CNN at any senior level. So the Zucker lieutenant involved is a woman named Allison Gollust. The details of their dalliance aren't really all that important at this point. But what is significant is that before coming to CNN she served as the comms director for former governor Andrew Cuomo. And according to \"The Washington Post\", Gollust and Zucker were instrumental in securing the Cuomo on Cuomo interviews, those double boxes with the Cuo-bros during COVID. So in other words, CNN was and is full of unethical, politically corrupt monsters. Joining me now are two former CNN political commentators, Jeff Lord and Andre Bauer. Jeffrey, they spent years peddling lies to defame President Trump and his supporters over at CNN. So the fact that they were passing judgment on him on the fraudulent Russia-gate scam while the conflicts of interests teaming at that network, your thoughts tonight?"

      "speaker": "JEFF LORD, FORMER CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Laura, first of all, in the contest between Donald Trump and Jeff Zucker and CNN, Donald Trump won without any question here as of this day. I once asked him in 2014 when he was a private citizen, if he ran for president, would he take on the media which had been historically anti-Republican. And oh, my, on he went. Yes, he would take them on. He wasn't going to put up with this. This in our time resulted in the whole fake news situation. Secondly, Jeff, I went back and dipped into Ted Turner's memoirs. He is the founder of CNN, and he quite specifically says in his memoirs that he thought that media of the day, and this is circa late 1970s, was biased. He mentions Walter Cronkite specifically. And he said he wanted a just the facts, ma'am, kind of journalism. Jeff moved CNN in the exact opposite direction. And full disclosure, I obviously benefited from that. I was a commentator. I was a Trump guy on CNN, which, of course, led eventually to my dismissal. And thirdly, by the admissions of CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" and Brian Stelter, I find this very fascinating, no less than former anchor and fired anchor Chris Cuomo is out to burn seen and down to the ground. Wow. That is pretty incredible here. They've got a whole lot of problems over there, not the least of which is sort of sabotaging the image of the mainstream media as impartial."

    {
      "speaker": "ANDRE BAUER, FORMER CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. But if you go back, Zucker and the former, prior president Trump, they were friends. They had worked together on the president's TV show previously. And then when the president, then candidate, got into this race, one of the reasons I was hired early on is I was one of the first statewide officeholders as former lieutenant governor to endorse the president. And they didn't just hire myself and Jeffrey Lord. There was Corey Lewandowski, Kayleigh McEnany, Paris Dennard, Rick Santorum, they went out and found people that supported the president and conservative issues, and their ratings went up. They had a lovefest. If you look back in 16 when the president didn't even attend the debate in Iowa, he went to a college. I went to it and held a rally, and CNN followed him. And they made a large profit and a large following over following the president. As the years progressed, they have become a bigger and bigger detractor of his message and distorting his message. And I think it came to their demise. But this has been an ongoing love-hate fest for some time that started back in 16, and when they quit having the president to beat on last year, you saw their numbers plummet because they really don't have anything. They surely don't have a cause with the current administration to get excited about. So the one thing that really kept their ratings was President Trump."
