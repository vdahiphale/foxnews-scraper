We're getting new details of that leaked transcript where the president pressured the Afghan leader to say the Taliban wasn't winning. Ghani reportedly telling Biden, Mr. President, we are facing a full scale invasion. Republicans now want the full transcript released and are slamming President Biden over the phone call.",

But to the point about this phone call and the cover-up of it. President Trump asked for a personal favor from the leader of another country. He didn't say something to Zelensky about having anything to do with diplomatic relations. He asked the Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on his political opponent so that he could win a presidential election. That is why that is impeachable. If Biden had said, hey, President Ghani, say that everything is going well and also, if you could dig up dirt on Tom Cotton, he's getting a little hot. You know, I think maybe he might be running in 2024, then we would be talking about impeachment. And I believe that every single liberal who advocated for with President Trump would do that with President Biden. But that's not what had happened here.

But I think the reaction would be obviously different from the mainstream media and how it was handled. But the American people don't like to be played for suckers. I think that's reflected in the poll numbers. They don't want to think that you're telling them one thing when you might believe something else, whether it's about COVID and mask and French laundry and whatever is going on. And people are going to have more questions about, okay, the vetting is an example. Do we know that people are being fully and thoroughly vetted as they should? I got a message from a former military pilot who now flies commercial, flew one of these big jets out of there. He said we thought we were on this great humanitarian mission. Then when we got to the states, we were stuck for hours on the tarmac at Dulles Airport outside of D.C. because these people hadn't been vetted. We had to seat there for hours with crying babies and barefoot people and people who hadn't eaten, you know, or had something to drink. And he said they weren't tested for COVID either.

The secret to a long war is settling in and making it mildly okay through fibbing. Everything is going well. Oh, the war is great. Everything is fine. It's the lie that kept this thing going. So, even -- and he did. I mean, he did -- what he did was unethical. Is it impeachment level? I don't think so, but then again, I'm not a liberal. I'm not a Democrat. I don't work at CNN where everything was impeachable. And I mean, I suppose -- you know, what is it? Turnabout is fair play? You know, people should be shouting for impeachment.

What this reveals is President Biden knew the nature of what was going down in Afghanistan. He knew how bad it was so he made decisions knowing the potential consequences. We can play the degree game. Was he sure exactly how bad it would be? But he made a calculation to accept that chaos and I think that he made that calculation because he thought he could play the blame game and lay it off on President Trump. That has failed.

And President Obama actually never hit this point until the third year of his presidency. So both Trump and Biden are struggling more than Obama was necessarily. But to the point about this phone call and the cover-up of it. President Trump asked for a personal favor from the leader of another country. He didn't say something to Zelensky about having anything to do with diplomatic relations. He asked the Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on his political opponent so that he could win a presidential election. That is why that is impeachable. If Biden had said, hey, President Ghani, say that everything is going well and also, if you could dig up dirt on Tom Cotton, he's getting a little hot. You know, I think maybe he might be running in 2024, then we would be talking about impeachment. And I believe that every single liberal who advocated for with President Trump would do that with President Biden. But that's not what had happened here. And I was listening to Andy McCarthy talk to you this morning on \"Mornings with Maria\" and he said I don't see anything wrong with this call between Biden and Ghani here."

I think everybody should be outraged and rightly are right now that we've lost 13 people who are brave in service to this country. But I think the reaction would be obviously different from the mainstream media and how it was handled. But the American people don't like to be played for suckers. I think that's reflected in the poll numbers. They don't want to think that you're telling them one thing when you might believe something else, whether it's about COVID and mask and French laundry and whatever is going on. And people are going to have more questions about, okay, the vetting is an example. Do we know that people are being fully and thoroughly vetted as they should? I got a message from a former military pilot who now flies commercial, flew one of these big jets out of there. He said we thought we were on this great humanitarian mission. Then when we got to the states, we were stuck for hours on the tarmac at Dulles Airport outside of D.C. because these people hadn't been vetted. We had to seat there for hours with crying babies and barefoot people and people who hadn't eaten, you know, or had something to drink. And he said they weren't tested for COVID either. So, when you don't tell people the full truth and we're saying now things like these people are fully vetted, everything is good to go, they're going to have questions about everything you say."

We just saw -- I digress. But I -- they're trying to prop up somebody who has had the worst record of any politician on foreign policy ever.

So the point about the coverage, it's interesting because there is something going on the far left media, so I know to a lot of conservatives, they just think like anything left is far left. It's not true, right. So there's like progressive then there's establishment and then there's, you know, people drifting towards the right. And the far left has been screaming at the medium left from the beginning that they are being too harsh about -- on President Biden like how, you know, he's making good on all these promises. This is all Trump's deal. Trump is the one that released 5,000 Taliban fighters, et cetera. And when you look at the fact that the investigation into the withdrawal is being led by Bob Menendez who is a huge ally of President Biden. When you look at how much airtime someone like Congressman Seth Moulton is getting, right?

That was close to truth. You know what, we kind of got them all out, like a game of horseshoe's, you know. We're kind of close to the pin. We might have left a couple thousand. Close enough. That's what Lemon seems to be advocating for. Close enough is good enough, just like his adherence to the truth. I think really quickly, Shannon, the more offensive tweet you could have showed from Chris Hayes is the one where on the day 13 service men died, he said, well, for context, 13 Americans died from COVID today. He compared an act of terrorism and violence to a pandemic. And the reason he did that is because while there's a clear bad guy when it comes to terrorism, the left increasingly wants to paint their fellow American as our true enemy, as the bad guy. And the true American there would be masking or vaccination. The bad guys in their mind are their fellow Americans and that's why on that day he wanted to point it to COVID."

And then that was all we talked about. That the illegal population in the country are a bunch of killers. This is a climate problem and what Joe Biden has been able to do is to show the country that actually you can have robust climate agenda and infrastructure agenda without supporting the Green New Deal, which cost way too much money. It was completely impractical and was only supported by, like I was saying in the last walk, the far left of the Democratic population. So when you look at those pictures of what happened in the subway -- New York City subways last night where Philadelphia is right now, obviously what happened in the south and you think that a hurricane that was supposed to hit Louisiana and Mississippi is now a problem in New Jersey.

It makes it easy because mother nature provides all of that. It's a political season, you know, four times -- you know, all year round. I want to add, though -- I think that what you're saying down south and even here is a reason to not give government and bureaucrats and politicians another set because, again, why does it take so long for them to get people help? There should be fuel trucks and aid at the ready. I was talking to a congressman this morning. He said always take several days after a storm hits to kind of get the ball rolling, that it's the private sector, it's the large retailers that jump right into the fray, opening their doors to get -- to provide food that's going to go bad to people. And quite frankly, the fuel lines, that's exactly what AOC and her ilk want. They don't want the use of fossil fuels. They want supply shortages. Why would you get rid of the Keystone pipeline? Why would you get rid of new oil and gas leases on federal land which was shut down by a judge?

I mean, if you like the government telling you what to do with your personal life, then -- the way they did it with COVID, you'll love it when it comes to climate change. I mean, I grew up in Florida. We had hurricanes on a regular basis. You go through the cycle. You know what happens. I just thought -- it struck me last night when I saw this tweet from the Congresswoman that when it shows up in your neighborhood, then it's like all hands on deck, we got to get back at this. Meanwhile, there are people in Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, all those Mississippi down there that had this kind of regular problem all the time. You know, they're used to dealing with it if infrastructure can be worked on that, something that seems to have some bipartisan agreement. But the green new deal has things like, you know, Citizen Climate Corps to go out and enforce things and all kinds of other things that I think average Americans probably wouldn't be down with."

He probably doesn't know I'm saying this because he doesn't have any power. And he has no access to fuel and everything. So, it's been very tough for everybody. But you know, going back to what Biden said, he's lying. And it and whenever you actually kind of push at the climate change, the claims they make, and ask for data, it's never there. So, they always say it's an increase in weather events, without ever saying the severity of it, which goes to your point about deaths, right? So, the severity has been on the decline. And we've been starting to keep - - keeping track of this, maybe it's been over a half a century, not quite, but the amount of death has been in decline. So, I would say, after these extreme weather events, and you start hearing the climate cluckers spring out of the trees, go and read Bjorn Lomborg. He's not an Abba, Jessica. Bjorn Lomberg is what you call -- he's an expert on data having to do with climate, not opinion, data. He's a lukewarmer. He does believe in climate change, but he doesn't -- he rejects the hysteria that's often undermining the science. When you go to him, read him, you will actually -- he has incredible detailed charts and data on the real facts about the about the incidence of -- and I would -- I guess you'd call it increased climate disasters or extreme weather and why it's on the decline.
