Dangerous times. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And coming up, we're going to show you the latest shameful tactics from the left, including yet another example of a conservative getting chased out of a restaurant, this time with his wife, by a left-wing mob. Senator Ted Cruz. We've got the tape. Plus, we'll have more on the Democrats' blatant double standard surrounding sexual misconduct allegations. For them, too many of them, it's politics.

Now, from day one, Republicans have treated the confirmation process of Judge Kavanaugh with the seriousness it deserves. Democrats, they have not. They've created chaos at Judge Kavanaugh's hearings, interrupting as you saw dozens of times. There were constant outbursts from left-wing protesters, disrupting the proceedings and much more. Now, just days away from a formal vote after all of the hearings were over and Senator Dianne Feinstein, she drops a bombshell, an allegation from a woman accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, going back 36 years when they were both in high school. Now Feinstein knew about these allegations since July. She kept them secret. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, she kept them secret when she met privately with Judge Kavanaugh. She kept them secret when she questioned Kavanaugh publicly and Feinstein used an allegation of sexual misconduct as a political ploy to delay and disrupt Kavanaugh's confirmation. Now, despite all of this, to their credit, Republicans have rightly taken these accusations against Judge Kavanaugh seriously, as they should. A public hearing featuring both Kavanaugh and his accuser, Professor Christine Blasey Ford has been set for Thursday. We have news, Ford may not appear. Senator Dianne Feinstein has said she cannot guarantee that she will show up. Now, apparently, Ford has concerns about the independent female attorney hired to question both Ford and Kavanaugh. Republicans, clearly, are trying to do everything in their power as they have been doing to accommodate Professor Ford. Now, either way, a committee vote on Kavanaugh has been scheduled for this Friday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, of course, Judge Kavanaugh has been begging for a chance to clear his name under oath since these charges first became public. He has categorically denied these allegations over and over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And meanwhile, virtually no evidence is backing up Professor Ford's 36- year-old claim. Now, Ford cannot remember the date or the location of the alleged incident, even the year. The four witnesses Professor Ford listed to corroborate her story, all four of them, denied what she is alleging, all four. And now, many on the left are demanding that the FBI investigate Ford's allegations that no confirmation vote should take place until the FBI weighs in. Remember, they knew this back in July. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, tonight, they should take advice, I can't believe I'm saying this, of crazy uncle Joe Biden.

I never heard of it happening. Now, The New York Times, they couldn't corroborate the story in any way.

And Senator Ted Cruz's opponent, by the way, as a sidebar, he was just given, oh, four big Pinocchios by \"The Washington Post\" over statements surrounding his 1998 DUI where he literally left the scene of a DUI accident. It was two times the legal limit, but he denied that ever happened. Now, if the left truly believe survivors, they might want to focus on the deputy chair of their own party, the Democratic Party, Keith Ellison. His ex-girlfriend has accused him of repeated physical and psychological and emotional abuse, dating back to just a short time ago. Not 36 years ago.

Let's say the junior senator from Alabama, do you really want to line up with Chuck Schumer and the left, with Booker and his pathetic portrait of Spartacus? Which has a story and I found particular offensive because he had no idea who Spartacus was. I think these senators who are from states where there's a lot of common sense and a lot of conservatism, a desire for more conservative judges, we have not heard a single one of them yet and I will be very surprised if we don't have a number of them vote yes.

And in 42 days, you, we, the people decide what path this country is going to take. Now, the Supreme Court showdown surrounding Judge Kavanaugh perfectly encapsulates the stark divide between our two political parties. You have on a hand one, Republicans. They've been advocating for a fair, serious confirmation proceeding with due process and something called up a presumption of innocence. And on the other hand, you have Democrats, who are leading by mob rule, demanding that Judge Kavanaugh prove his innocence, attempting, of course, to tar and feather the judge in the court of public opinion and using cheap identity politics to shoot down anybody that disagrees with them. Dangerous times. And coming up, we're going to show you the latest shameful tactics from the left, including yet another example of a conservative getting chased out of a restaurant, this time with his wife, by a left-wing mob. Senator Ted Cruz. We've got the tape. Plus, we'll have more on the Democrats' blatant double standard surrounding sexual misconduct allegations. For them, too many of them, it's politics. And we'll have all the best moments from the president's speech, a very powerful moment for the United States and the United Nations where he put America first on the world stage. And finally, the years of apologizing for America, they are done. They are over. All right. Buckle up, time for our breaking news D.C. swamp opening monologue."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "It's simple. It's a battle between those who value the core principles of this country and those who only value cheap to political victories. Now, from day one, Republicans have treated the confirmation process of Judge Kavanaugh with the seriousness it deserves. Democrats, they have not. They've created chaos at Judge Kavanaugh's hearings, interrupting as you saw dozens of times. There were constant outbursts from left-wing protesters, disrupting the proceedings and much more. Now, just days away from a formal vote after all of the hearings were over and Senator Dianne Feinstein, she drops a bombshell, an allegation from a woman accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, going back 36 years when they were both in high school. Now Feinstein knew about these allegations since July. She kept them secret. Now, she kept them secret when she met privately with Judge Kavanaugh. She kept them secret when she questioned Kavanaugh publicly and Feinstein used an allegation of sexual misconduct as a political ploy to delay and disrupt Kavanaugh's confirmation. Now, despite all of this, to their credit, Republicans have rightly taken these accusations against Judge Kavanaugh seriously, as they should. A public hearing featuring both Kavanaugh and his accuser, Professor Christine Blasey Ford has been set for Thursday. We have news, Ford may not appear. Senator Dianne Feinstein has said she cannot guarantee that she will show up. Now, apparently, Ford has concerns about the independent female attorney hired to question both Ford and Kavanaugh. Republicans, clearly, are trying to do everything in their power as they have been doing to accommodate Professor Ford. Now, either way, a committee vote on Kavanaugh has been scheduled for this Friday. And, of course, Judge Kavanaugh has been begging for a chance to clear his name under oath since these charges first became public. He has categorically denied these allegations over and over. And meanwhile, virtually no evidence is backing up Professor Ford's 36- year-old claim. Now, Ford cannot remember the date or the location of the alleged incident, even the year. The four witnesses Professor Ford listed to corroborate her story, all four of them, denied what she is alleging, all four. And now, many on the left are demanding that the FBI investigate Ford's allegations that no confirmation vote should take place until the FBI weighs in. Remember, they knew this back in July. Now, tonight, they should take advice, I can't believe I'm saying this, of crazy uncle Joe Biden. Listen to what he said way back in 1991."

Judge Kavanaugh is also facing an additional obligation, a totally uncorroborated claim from a woman, her named is Ms. Deborah Ramirez. And she told the \"New Yorker\" that in the 1980s, again, 34 years ago, Kavanaugh exposed himself when he was a freshman, at a drunken college party at a dorm room at Yale. And get this, Ramirez herself isn't even totally sure that Kavanaugh was a perpetrator. If you read the New Yorker column, she became, quote, quickly inebriated at the party. She told the \"New Yorker\", she was, quote, foggy and slurring her words. She even acknowledged that she has significant memory gaps from that evening. And The New York Times was not able to corroborate her story with anybody, and even said she called people and went to Yale, asking them if they remembered the incident if -- because she did not remember if it was Kavanaugh. And those who Ramirez listed as witnesses in that case to the incident are all flatly denying here charges. Quote, we can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it, and we did not. The behavior that she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale. She never described this incident until Brett's Supreme Court nomination was pending."

I never heard of it happening. Now, The New York Times, they couldn't corroborate the story in any way. They refused to publish the claims as part of their official reporting and they said they spent all last week interviewing dozens of people. They couldn't find one person that could corroborate it. Now, needless to say, Chairman Grassley will not be calling Ms. Ramirez to testify. Still, despite the lack of evidence, the left, of course, rushing to judgment as they have in so many prior occasions, smearing Judge Kavanaugh, not even wanting to hear his side of it, and rushing to judgment and saying, I believe one person. This is dangerous for anybody in society, we should all believe, it should not be political. It's not Republican, it's not Democrat, not conservative, not liberal.

We've heard from many in the mainstream media rushing to judgment. We've even heard from future dinner Democratic presidential candidate Michael Avenatti, yes, again, the now face of the Democratic Party, along with others. And now like sheep following the herd, the left's angry mob is joining the stop Kavanaugh movement.

Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Sarah Sanders, Pam Bondi, this mob mentality, these tactics of the left are now in full gear 42 days out of an election. And Senator Ted Cruz's opponent, by the way, as a sidebar, he was just given, oh, four big Pinocchios by \"The Washington Post\" over statements surrounding his 1998 DUI where he literally left the scene of a DUI accident. It was two times the legal limit, but he denied that ever happened. Now, if the left truly believe survivors, they might want to focus on the deputy chair of their own party, the Democratic Party, Keith Ellison. His ex-girlfriend has accused him of repeated physical and psychological and emotional abuse, dating back to just a short time ago. Not 36 years ago. He's now running to be the attorney general of the state of Minnesota. He's still the number two guy at the DNC. And at a debate last week, here's what he had to say about these recent claims.

In an op-ed on foxnews.com, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, he wrote, quote, if not Judge Kavanaugh, then who? This is the question Republicans need to ask themselves as they prepare for Thursday's Senate judiciary committee hearing. Joining us now is Newt Gingrich. Don't forget, by the way, his new book, \"Trump's America\". It's available now, part two of which talks about all the challenges the president will face. Mr. President -- you look at the fact, Dianne Feinstein had this -- literally have this in July. She didn't bring it up until now. Then the people that Professor Ford mentioned, all of them deny it. And then you've got the \"New Yorker\" article where Ms. Ramirez admits that she was inebriated very early, slurring her words, gaps in her memory, et cetera. And then you have the new face of the Democratic Party that says, oh, I'm going to reveal gang rape by -- in the next 48 hours. I don't know what -- what are the American people to think, and so many Democrats rushing to judgment, no presumption of innocence."

What you are watching is a party totally desperate, and you've got to put this week in context. I was struck earlier today that Arthur Miller's great play, \"The Crucible,\" which is about the Salem witchcraft trials, actually relates to what's happening to Judge Kavanaugh. What he is being put through is almost like medieval torture. Somebody shows up 35 years later -- everyone in the audience ought to think about this. Close your eyes for a second and ask what were you doing on June 12th, 35 years ago? The truth is you almost certainly don't know. The fact is this hearing is a farce. There is nothing that Kavanaugh can say which will convince Chuck Schumer to vote for him. And I think that Dr. Ford has no evidence other than her own word, which is going to count -- they can't provide any witnesses. She can't even tell us, to the best of my knowledge, what was the date, where was the house, who all were there, the people she names all say they weren't there. At what point is the burden of common sense on the accuser? If it is a burden of common sense, this hearing wouldn't even be held. It's only in the current hyper environment in which Senator Hirono can say, men ought to just shut up. I mean, think about them level of venom in that sentence. You have an entire effort by the totalitarian left to bludgeon -- you saw it last night, as you reported -- with Senator Cruz and his wife. I mean, what has happened to America when random left wing totalitarians think they can violate private property, trespass in a restaurant, go in and intimidate a citizen who is simply trying to have dinner? And they think they are heroes. And apparently, the police aren't called, nobody is arrested for trespass, nobody is arrested for intimidation. We are watching a period where what we ought to understand is this is about raw power. And if the left can stop Kavanaugh, we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court."

And I've got to be honest, how does a lawmaker say he has to prove his innocence? We have had lawmaker say that. Senator Coons said he has to prove his innocence from 40 years ago, 36 years ago."

They have no interest in the truth. They are involved in a struggle over power. And they've got to pay off their activist base. There is no possibility that they are going to vote for Judge Kavanaugh. But what I'm fascinated with his, let's say, you are the senator from West Virginia or Missouri or Indiana or North Dakota, or Montana, now, you are from an area where there are lots of common sense everyday folks who like Donald Trump, who believe Donald Trump is doing the right thing, who want to have a more conservative court. Let's say the junior senator from Alabama, do you really want to line up with Chuck Schumer and the left, with Booker and his pathetic portrait of Spartacus? Which has a story and I found particular offensive because he had no idea who Spartacus was. I think these senators who are from states where there's a lot of common sense and a lot of conservatism, a desire for more conservative judges, we have not heard a single one of them yet and I will be very surprised if we don't have a number of them vote yes. Remember, when the Clarence Thomas character assassination was underway, 11 Democrats ended up voting yes for Clarence Thomas. And I think we may find all of a sudden, Wednesday or through Thursday that several of these Democrats from Trump states decided in the end. You know, she didn't prove her case, I'm going to vote yes. He deserves to be on the court."

Because instinctively, Americans believe in due process, they believe in fundamental fairness, they don't believe in a rush to judgment. We have seen in high-profile cases, Duke Lacrosse, Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Cambridge police. We've seen a lot of rushing to judgment where a lot of the same people have been wrong again and again. But as far as the Republicans go, it seems like it's coming down to four people for that and they have control of this. That would be Bob Corker, that would be Jeff Flake. I think Susan Collins probably had the best comment of anybody saying, what Dianne Feinstein did was unfair to everybody in this case, and, Lisa Murkowski, I don't know what to expect from any of them tonight."

I mean, I think Thursday is important only in the sense that unless Dr. Ford is overwhelmingly convincing and unless Judge Kavanaugh is overwhelmingly disappointing I suspect all four of the Republicans will end up deciding that there is no case adequate to say no. At the same time, I believe as I just said, that there are five or six Democrats who were on the bubble who have to go home and explain why they voted with Schumer and why they voted with Warren and why they voted with Booker. And I think that this could be a very expensive vote in terms of defeating five, or six or seven Democrats because I think the states are going to say to them, you know, there is no proof here that justifies voting no on Judge Kavanaugh."

But at the end he says, by the way, George Soros funded the democracy and integrity project. Bow that's a project that showed up in Bruce Ohr's note as the successor to Fusion GPS. But the Soros spokesman goes further and says, when we hired the Democracy integrity project we were paying for Fusion GPS to do work. So we now know there's a new funding arc -- a stark money group funding--"

When we come back, Jimmy Kimmel, you are not going to believe the so-called disturbing creepy joke that he made about Judge Kavanaugh. He's lost his mind.

So this is before we had Supreme Court justices running around with their (muted) out. I think there is a compromise here. Hear me out of this. So Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court. OK. But in return, we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone."

When I have time, I'll be airing that tape. All right. That's all the time we have left this evening. We will be back both tomorrow night and on Thursday night where all this action is going on. Remember, this show is always fair and balanced; we are not the destroy-Trump media. This is an important week for the country. Hope you'll stay with us. Let not your heart be troubled.
