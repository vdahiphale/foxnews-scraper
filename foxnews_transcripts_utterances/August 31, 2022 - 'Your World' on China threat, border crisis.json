Now, while Russia is claiming that the move is temporary to make repairs, it's raising fears Europe's fuel supply could be cut off entirely and permanently. And while NATO allies are scrambling, should we be worrying? We will ask National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby. He is here. Also, Edward Lawrence on why, six months after all these sanctions, Russia appears to be in the driver's seat. How is that? And Alex Hogan and Ukraine on the growing threat from that nuclear power plant that has U.N. inspectors rushing to the scene. What have they discovered? Further, what have they done? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. So glad to have you. A lot to get to. Let's first go to Edward Lawrence at the White House with how they're responding to all these developments -- Edward.",

But, right now, we want to talk about this 36-page court filing late last night, actually just before midnight, by the Department of Justice alleging that the former president likely obstructed justice by moving some of these documents and keeping some documents, classified documents, in his desk drawer. Let me read some of the filing: \"Of most significant concern was that highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records.\" Neil, you mentioned that photograph. It's the first photograph we have seen of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago. They're labeled secret, top secret in SCI, which means sensitive compartmented information, among the highest levels of classification. They're shown mixed in with a box that shows a framed magazine cover of the former president. And, to be clear, these items were in a box in a carton inside Trump's office at Mar-a-Lago taken out by the FBI and then photographed. The document goes on to say: \"As an initial matter, the former president lacks standing to seek judicial relief,\" meaning a special master or oversight,\" as to presidential records. Those records do not belong to him. The Presidential Records Act makes clear the United States has complete ownership, possession and control of them.\" His team wants that neutral third-party arbiter, but DOJ says it's not needed. In early June, DOJ officials came down here to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump representatives. In fact, the former president himself came by. He says he's been cooperative all along. DOJ says that's not the case. Meanwhile, it's up to Judge Aileen Cannon tomorrow. She's going to be hearing arguments in person at federal court, West Palm Beach -- I will be there -- from the Trump team, from DOJ over this idea of a special master - - Neil.",

We're told that, right now, FEMA is not reimbursing the busing costs because the Biden administration previously denied Texas' request for disaster funding. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has requested an appeal for that denial. And Texas Republican Governor Abbott and Arizona Republican Governor Ducey have shipped migrants to sanctuary cities, saying those cities should be welcoming migrants. And Just some surface-level details about what we do know sanctuary cities can offer migrants. In New York City, in general, the city provides housing, food, health and legal services. The city has also made deals with at least 14 hotels to ease the burden of migrants staying there. And in both New York and Washington, D.C., nonprofits have assisted migrants that are arriving. In general, there is no universal description of what it means to be a sanctuary city, but we have learned over the years sanctuary cities often will not comply with ICE and restrict state and local police from arresting or detaining migrants with warrants. And the DEA is also now giving us this urgent warning, saying it has seized rainbow-colored fentanyl pills designed to look like candy in 18 different states.

What about funding the crime analysts and the badly needed technology that we need in order to combat these drug traffickers?

And, listen, the government ought to be helping sheriffs across this entire country, because we all have in common long distances of open road. And when they move dope into this country, they have to move it across the open road.

Now, while Russia is claiming that the move is temporary to make repairs, it's raising fears Europe's fuel supply could be cut off entirely and permanently. And while NATO allies are scrambling, should we be worrying? We will ask National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby. He is here. Also, Edward Lawrence on why, six months after all these sanctions, Russia appears to be in the driver's seat. How is that? And Alex Hogan and Ukraine on the growing threat from that nuclear power plant that has U.N. inspectors rushing to the scene. What have they discovered? Further, what have they done? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. So glad to have you. A lot to get to. Let's first go to Edward Lawrence at the White House with how they're responding to all these developments -- Edward."

And on a day that Russian President Vladimir Putin now has $700 million more in his pocket because of the sale of oil to other countries around the world, now a new report by the International Energy Agency says that Russia is making 40 percent more revenue from oil than a year ago. Russia raked in $20.4 billion, largely because of a 55 percent increase in exports of oil to China, but also India."

And in the course of the last four or five months, we have seen that increase from basically zero to 800,000 or 900,000 barrels of oil per day. And it's again that interest of these countries to find affordable energy. And Russia is a willing supplier in this case."

Now, that's oil. Russia -- the White House told me that Russia is weaponizing natural gas again by cutting the flow through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Now, Russia, the gas company claims it's only for three days. We will have to see. The U.S. has not done anything differently, but now redirected shipments meant for other areas of natural gas to Europe, then got Qatar to increase its output of natural gas to fill in the gaps there. Now, the White House trying to rely on Middle Eastern countries to help with more natural gas and oil. Listen to my exchange about 30 minutes ago. Listen to this."

This is the first time that these nuclear watchdogs are going into an active combat zone and going essentially into a war zone and underscoring again how dangerous this trip is, given the fighting that we have seen there in recent weeks, even continued fighting that we have seen even taking place today.

    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so we don't -- as of this morning, Neil, our assessment was that the plant was operational, not all the reactors, but at least some of them, that it's Ukrainian technical workers that are actually on the controls. But, clearly, the plant has been for many months now in Russian military control. And, as we have said very clearly, we don't think that a nuclear power plant should be militarized in any way whatsoever. And we don't want military operations conducted from or near that nuclear power plant, which is why, again, it's so important to get these inspectors from the IAEA in there, so that we can get a little bit better readout on how that plant is being operated and what the safety protocols are in place."

      "speaker": "KIRBY",

      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, we are making sure that our European allies and partners know how committed President Biden and this White House is to making sure that we can continue to provide additional supplies of LNG, of natural gas, to them as much as possible. We have, in fact, exceeded the president's pledge of last March, in terms of our contributions to natural gas. And we're working with allies and partners across the world to try to bolster that. Germany, as I think you have seen, come out in recent days and said that they have they have met their stockpile requirements for the coming winter. And not all nations are that far along. We're mindful of that. And we're going to continue to work to see what we can do to supplement their supply. The bottom line here, though, Neil -- and you said this at the outset -- I mean, Putin is weaponizing energy here. And so now they're claiming they have got some maintenance issues that they have to do for the next few days. We will see how this pans out. But it's perfectly in keeping with Mr. Putin's design to weaponize energy and to punish people outside Ukraine while he can."

      "speaker": "KIRBY",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely no doubt that he's making revenue off of oil purchases. And we acknowledge that, which is why the president at the G7 a couple of months ago really led the world in trying to achieve this price cap that we're still working on. Now, the finance ministers in the G7 are meeting Friday. We think they're positively disposed to discuss this idea of a price cap and moving it forward. We will see where they end up. But there was a lot of energy behind it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "This is about limiting -- having countries voluntarily limit what they're willing to pay Russia for their fuel and their oil. And so that will have an effect on his ability to get revenue, him Putin being, I mean."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "He's got real manpower challenges, Neil. I mean, even with these counteroffensive operations by the Ukrainians in the south, it's forcing the Russians to move manpower from the east in the Donbas down to the south to defend against what the Ukrainians are trying to do. He's got a huge morale problem, huge command-and-control problem. And he is making drastic measures now to try to recruit and retain more soldiers for this fight. So, it is not without cost with him on the battlefield. And, again, we're going to try to make sure that the Ukrainians continue to have the systems, the weapons, the capabilities they need to take the fight to the Russians inside their country."

The United States Navy is going to sail wherever international law permits them to sail. And we have done Taiwan Strait's transits in the past, and we're going to do them in the future. In this case, it was two cruisers, the Antietam and the Chancellorsville."

In case you're counting,I believe that's about 1,800 Dow points over the last four trading days, good enough or, shall I say, bad enough to have a pretty problematic month, with the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 all down at least 4 percent. All right, meanwhile, on to the back-and-forth over the Trump legal team now pushing to have an assigned master, sort of arbiter to go through everything that the Justice Department went through when FBI agents raided Donald Trump's Florida home.

It's the first photograph we have seen of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago. They're labeled secret, top secret in SCI, which means sensitive compartmented information, among the highest levels of classification. They're shown mixed in with a box that shows a framed magazine cover of the former president."

Those records do not belong to him. The Presidential Records Act makes clear the United States has complete ownership, possession and control of them.\" His team wants that neutral third-party arbiter, but DOJ says it's not needed. In early June, DOJ officials came down here to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump representatives. In fact, the former president himself came by. He says he's been cooperative all along. DOJ says that's not the case. Meanwhile, it's up to Judge Aileen Cannon tomorrow.

Typically, you grant special master request if, for instance, the FBI raids, a law firm or a lawyer's office, and you know you're going to have thousands of privileged documents. However, in this case, it is far from an ordinary case. This is a unique, extraordinary case. And I could see this judge, who, by the way, has already signaled she might be receptive to appointing a special master, saying, look, I need to go the extra mile here to ensure the president's rights are protected. So I'm thinking she may grant it tomorrow, Neil, but we will see."

I'm paraphrasing here. But for an organization that seemed very sensitive to releasing anything, isn't that a bit risky?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "It is a bit risky. It's super unusual. And I think the DOJ just figured that a picture's worth 1,000 words, and that including that photograph in their brief could tell the story of what happened and their perspective on it in a far more compelling way than simply words could. I mean, the image is striking. And, look, I take the former president's point that this wasn't the way they were scored, and maybe the FBI moved things around to kind of stage this picture. But I think, as just far as kind of a legal technique, it's pretty -- pretty -- pretty effective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm wondering too. Now, of course, it's unprecedented, as you have often reminded me, to raid a former president's home, especially, in this case, if he has documents he could have had when he was president, declassified them. We had Karl Rove on a little bit earlier, Tom, saying, no, no, no, he can't take those documents home and treat them like they're his. They're the U.S. government's. I'm just wondering if that alone is supposedly the justification for this. And, if it is, is that enough to pursue criminal charges, even if you have misrepresented, A, whether you had them, or whether they were all sensitive or, for that matter, they were the kind of stuff that he shouldn't have done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "I think the question of whether or not he declassified them, I think, would be relevant to figuring out if there was kind of a national security impact here. I think, just from a strictly legal perspective, and from the perspective of the Justice Department, I don't think it matters at all whether the documents were classified or not. The federal criminal statutes the Justice Department seems to be investigating the former president for don't require that the documents be classified. They basically, say, if you're in possession of government documents, and we ask you to give them back, you have got to give them back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, what if you misrepresent whether you had them or not, and then said, all right, everything I gave you, I gave you? It seems to me one area -- I was talking to a legal eagle on this in -- on FBN, which, if you don't get, you should demand, but I digress. One of the things he was telling me was, look, that is technically lying, and that is a no-no, but that was the extent of it, and he didn't seem to think that, with a former president in this situation, it would go much further than that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "Well, if what you're talking about is saying, well, we gave you back documents and we still have documents, they weren't classified, it's possible the Justice Department would be willing to kind of forgive a misrepresentation. In this context. I don't think they're going to be that forgiving, Neil. You saw their brief last night. They actually reproduced the e-mail communication that they got from the president's legal team, where they say, we did our search, we don't have any more classified documents. And I think that they included that..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "And make no mistake, Neil, that was a deliberate decision by the Justice Department to include all of that in their brief. I think the Justice Department was trying to send the president a very strong signal that we're watching what your lawyers say to us and we're going to hold them to account if we think that they're trying to obstruct our investigation or if they're trying to lie to us."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm just wondering, with all that was redacted when this first came out, it has to be more than just the number of documents or what was sensitive, what wasn't, that there -- maybe included in this material with something potentially explosive. Now, we don't know. And I could be just guessing. Other legal experts far smarter than I have done the same. I'm just wondering, does just a portion that you mentioned, having documents when you said you didn't, having them when you said you turned everything over, and you didn't, misrepresenting what you said you had, is that it? Because that alone seems to be kind of sketchy to raid a former president's home, unprecedented. You have never seen anything like it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "I -- Neil, I tend to agree with that. In other words, if you're talking about a situation where kind of an ordinary civilian lies to the Justice Department and misrepresents and obstructs, the Justice Department might say, look, you broke the law, we're going to prosecute you. But I think the analysis has to change when you're talking about a former president, not to say that you would say someone's above the law or anything like that, just that you have to take into account just the consequences for the nation if you were to indict a former president over making statements, even if those statements turned out to be false, about these documents."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "I think it's a bit of both, Neil. I think one thing is, you could see from a lot of the documents they have got top secret headers, they have got things redacted, showing the extent of the classification. So that's part of it. I think the other part of it is the point you mentioned, that the Justice Department is at least trying to create the appearance that this is the way they were kept in the normal course, that they're strewn around."

That boils down to about $1,300 per migrant. But Texas says it cannot confirm the actual cost for each passenger because the price varies and the operation is ongoing. We're told that, right now, FEMA is not reimbursing the busing costs because the Biden administration previously denied Texas' request for disaster funding. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has requested an appeal for that denial. And Texas Republican Governor Abbott and Arizona Republican Governor Ducey have shipped migrants to sanctuary cities, saying those cities should be welcoming migrants. And Just some surface-level details about what we do know sanctuary cities can offer migrants. In New York City, in general, the city provides housing, food, health and legal services. The city has also made deals with at least 14 hotels to ease the burden of migrants staying there. And in both New York and Washington, D.C., nonprofits have assisted migrants that are arriving. In general, there is no universal description of what it means to be a sanctuary city, but we have learned over the years sanctuary cities often will not comply with ICE and restrict state and local police from arresting or detaining migrants with warrants. And the DEA is also now giving us this urgent warning, saying it has seized rainbow-colored fentanyl pills designed to look like candy in 18 different states. And a short while ago, our Peter Doocy pressed the White House press secretary about President Biden's border policies and what he's doing to restrict fentanyl from getting into this country.

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, you can't even get a meeting with these guys. Sheriffs in this country have been trying to meet with the president for a year-and-a-half, and all we have heard is crickets. Any sheriff will tell you that the situation the Southern border is an absolute, unmitigated disaster. The drugs trafficked by the cartels are a tsunami of death crashing in the United States across the Southern border. It's just simply an epic slaughter of Americans taking place. And the murder weapon is fentanyl. But the drug cartels are pushing into absolutely every community in this country. I'm located in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex in the northeast quadrant. We're the second fastest growing county in the United States behind Maricopa County in Arizona. And we have had a 571 percent increase in the number of fentanyl-related deaths since 2019. So, wherever you are watching this program, if you will get your numbers there, you will find a similar trend, or worse. So, from our perspective, this is just an absolute, utter, colossal failure of leadership in Washington."

And we can't thank them enough for helping us take some of the pressure off of these cities along the border that are completely inundated right now. But the reality is that when you have the mayor of New York City and Washington, D.C., complaining about this issue, instead of talking about the real problem. The real problem is these drug cartels that are pushing this fentanyl across there are murdering Americans. Well, how many of their folks in New York City of Washington have perished by fentanyl? Why aren't they asking, what is the administration doing, right? What is the trip wire? What is it going to take for this administration to get with the program and start putting it together? Well, we have got suggestions, if you guys will bother to meet with us."

The president yesterday talked about tougher sentences for people that were dealing fentanyl. Well, you know what? That's a great start. But you got to do a lot better than that. Where are the commercials on television every night and the social media campaigns warning parents and young people about the dangers of these knockoff prescription pills that are embedded, that are impregnated with fentanyl? What about funding the crime analysts and the badly needed technology that we need in order to combat these drug traffickers? Here in North Texas, I have teamed up with seven other sheriffs, and we have seized tons of narcotics over the last couple of years and millions of dollars of cartel bulk cash money. And, listen, the government ought to be helping sheriffs across this entire country, because we all have in common long distances of open road. And when they move dope into this country, they have to move it across the open road. So why isn't this administration helping sheriffs come up with criminal interdiction units to combat these traffickers?"

And while certainly a number of his customers are no longer going to buy from him because of his behavior dealing with Ukraine, particularly when it comes to oil, he doesn't have any trouble finding other customers, because he's discounting the price. And it's very frustrating to see India, a country that is neutral here, and is actually buying more oil now from Russia than they ever have. And so they sustain that. And as we began to show with, I mean, Putin is -- he's increased his sale of oil 40 percent over the last year, based on the oil prices, and the fact that he's got customers out there. When we had the maximum sanctions against the Iranians, we were pretty much able to shut down all the customer base that the Iranians had, except for two or three. And, really, it got down to a dribble. That's not the case with Putin. He really does have customers out there that we have been unable to dissuade from purchasing that.

Well, we have hacked the deficit to the degree we have, that they will pay for it, which kind of reminds me of the twisted math that you're exactly tapping a credit line that you have somehow freed up a little bit, but it is still a credit line.

And it also means the government is going to collect less in terms of those loans. So the costs are going to be much higher, in the hundreds of billions of dollars in coming years. So you have more costs. And what the Biden administration has done with so-called deficit reduction, raising taxes, siccing 80,000 IRS agents on small businesses in the middle class, you're going to have a sluggish economy. Sluggish economy means less revenue for the government."

But I do get your bigger point here about how you pay for this, because, if you think about it, they're heralding paring the deficit down by more than a trillion dollars, what have you, off of very high COVID levels in the first place, and then tapping that so-called savings and using that to pay for this. Debt is debt. A credit line is a credit line. What you -- what you reduce - - and, by the way, we're hardly in a position to brag about still trillion- dollar plus deficits.

One of the reasons we got out of the crisis, the great inflation in the 1970s, was the pro-growth policies of Ronald Reagan, tax cuts, deregulation, stable dollar and the like. So, the economy boomed, so the burden of the debt went down. And by the late 1990s, the deficit was gone. And we can do the same thing again. But the Biden administration is doing the exact opposite, piling on new regulations, hurting small businesses, which means less revenue in the future.

They took that attitude to work. During the bull market, it sold. They were able to get away with demanding that sort of coddled treatment. Now..."
