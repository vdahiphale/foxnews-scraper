Every single one of them was designed to reverse a Trump policy. All those executive orders that are basically for the first time in American history we have a president who will not detain the people who enter this country illegally. Look, the immigration system in America is complicated but our laws are pretty straightforward. It defines who's allowed to be in the country and it says if you're here illegally, you should be detained through removal. And we used to have exceptions to that, but narrow exceptions. But the majority of people were detained. Now the reverse is happening. Now, the exceptions have become the rule. Today, if you enter the United States illegally, you are going to be released. Your chances of being released into the country very quickly are between 85 and 90 percent, okay? People know this. The word spreads. They come from all over the world now. There are 7.2 million people in this country that have entered over the last three years, that are here illegally at this moment, entering through different methods and various ways that they've gotten here. That's an unsustainable thing. And all of that was driven by these changes. You can see it in the numbers beginning in January of 2021 when Joe Biden entered the White House. He needs to reverse and go back to the policies that were in place before then, when we didn't have these numbers.",

Look, remember, we spent two and a half years arguing with the Biden administration over whether it was a crisis at all. We -- we can't forget that. For two and a half years, Biden and all of the surrogates and deputies all said there is no crisis, there is no border crisis, there is nothing going on down there that's wrong. They spent a long time denying it until they couldn't it anymore. So, of course, I would support it. In fact, that's what I specifically have called for. Had he done so, I would have voted for the funding for Ukraine and all the other things, because I've supported Ukraine funding. But we have to prioritize this American crisis that we have in our hands, which I think is now posing a real danger. Six-point-two, 7.2 million people, let's be conservative about that, let's say it's 6.2 million that are in this country illegally right now that have been here over the last three years, if only 1 percent of them are dangerous criminals, that's 62,000 criminals in our streets today, people that were criminals overseas in their own countries before they even came here, and we're seeing that play out now every day tragically in the -- in the headlines on the news.",

You take 6.2 million people from anywhere, some percentage of them are going to be criminals. Some of them were already criminals. They're not criminals because they're migrants. They're criminals because they're criminals. For example, there is a gang in Venezuela, Tren de Aragua, well-known gang, well-known gang in Venezuela that left Venezuela, has terrorized Colombia, has terrorized Peru, has terrorized other countries. Some of those people have now made their way into the United States. What do we think they do once they get here? Do we think they become stockbrokers? Do we think they now become -- you know, they go and run some charity organization? No, they do here what they did in Peru, what they did in Colombia, what they did in Venezuela before that. They are criminals. Every single day, they're playing out -- again, not because they're migrants but because they are criminals. But this is what happens when you allow 7.2 million people to march into the country and invade it the way they have. Some percentage of them are going to be criminals. And guess what criminals do? They commit crimes. And that's what's happening in America now with many of these people.",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm not going to set parameters on what that looks like. It's not our place to do that. It's premature to do that. Here's what I do know: There is no way that the Russian Federation takes Ukraine, all of Ukraine, half of Ukraine. And that was -- that was Putin's goal from the beginning, was to carve it up into half -- at least half the country including Kyiv. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. On the other side of it, we have the reality of it is that Ukraine is small compared to Russia in terms of size and its ability to bring scale, its ability to force conscript people. So neither -- neither can -- this is, I'm just being honest and I -- and you know, in the past, I have tried not to talk about this publicly because I thought it undermined the leverage that Ukraine had. But now, it's the reality. Neither side is going to be able to achieve victory as defined in the most idealistic terms. So then the question becomes, if, in fact, there's going to be a negotiated settlement, who's going to have the leverage here? Is it going to be Putin or is it going to be Ukraine? And I want Ukraine to have the most amount of leverage possible when the time comes for those conversations to happen. They're not going to have leverage if Putin feels like he has the upper hand, that he's -- he has ways to gain and can force Ukraine into a situation where they become basically a satellite state, which is what he wants. He wants them to be like Belarus. He wants to keep territory and then whatever's left over of Ukraine. He wants it to be a country that is forced to remain neutral and that in his orbit and sphere of influence. So I want Ukraine to have the most amount of leverage. And to do that, we have to help him. And I'm in favor of doing that, but we have to first take care of our country. So I -- yes, I believe that we should help Ukraine but only after we help America through our border, in the same way as Democrats are saying, we won't help Israel unless you help Ukraine, and because they're holding Israel as leverage and hostage over Ukraine. So, at the end of the day, that's what I hope we can achieve here and I think it begins by the president doing what he should do anyways, which is to reverse the executive orders that have caused this migrant crisis at our border.",

Obviously, Israeli leaders are rejecting it. Here's what foreign policy said. The two-state solution is a recipe for carnage. That follows up with a \"Washington Post\" opinion piece saying, \"There's every reason to fear that Hamas or similar entities would control a nascent democratic Palestinian state in the near-term aftermath of this brutal war.\" So do we as outsiders have any way to actually assure Israel that some kind of governing body can be set up in that territory that won't be an existential threat to them?",

They want to see a future for the Palestinians, both the West Bank and Gaza, but it starts with security in the region and a governance that recognizes Israel's rights and will live in peace with Israel. That's absolutely essential. Is that possible? Yes, it is possible, but it's going to take a lot of hard work. We've been going through this for many, many years. The challenge right now is to find a pathway forward so that we can get to that point. And that means listening to the responsible leaders, the Palestinian Authority needs to be revamped.

So it's gaining steam. And that's why you saw these dueling visits. I was with President Biden at the border on Thursday. It's a pretty sanitized view of the situation there. Brownsville is not a hotspot right now. And he visited an area like a boat launch where we didn't see or at least I didn't see one migrant for example. So he is trying to say, look, it can be orderly. We need Congress to pass these bills. President -- former president Trump of course is saying, look, this is chaos. We need to do something. The question is really, what can a president do. A lot of things President Trump did were subject to litigation. They were struck down in court. Title 42 was a lot of it. It's gone.

I heard from multiple people who felt that it was important for the President to at least show that he was there, that it was an issue he was paying attention to.

Taking on the far left part of the party, Joe Biden is not on the far left on any issue and certainly not on immigration. And the reason Congress won't pass it is Donald Trump. He has said it publicly, Republicans have said it, and they're going to hammer that home. Shannon, every chance they get, you heard President Biden talking about that this week. But, you know, this polling, I think in many ways, should be a wakeup call for the Biden team. They need to sharpen their message. They need to get a more aggressive campaign going. But there are some bright spots, right? Independents still overwhelmingly going for Joe Biden, where Joe Biden's support is a little weaker. It's not translating into support for Donald Trump. He really still has a hard ceiling on his support, even on issues like immigration, even on issues like crime. And the proof is in the pudding. The best indicator of how voters will vote is how they're voting. And in every election, since 2018, Democrats have been overperforming.

I think when the American people see such a sharp contrast on an issue that matters to all of us, where President Biden is showing bipartisan leadership willing to take the tough stances and invest in making us safer and stronger, and they see former President Trump simply trying to have an issue for election, on an issue, frankly, a bill that was endorsed by the Border Patrol, by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" by the Chamber of Commerce, I think the American people see who's interested in and capable of leading, and that's President Biden.",

And when the elements of this deal started being leaked out early, the 5,000 entrants per day, the fact that Joe Biden will be able to have waiver authority over all the provisions, House Republicans started signaling very early, led by Speaker Johnson, that we did not support that deal. When it finally came out and everybody could read it, then everybody rejected it. Even Mitch McConnell voted against it. So it was a bad deal from the start.

Of course that went nowhere because I know there were other problems people have with the bill. I want to read you something at \"The Daily Beast\" this weekend talking about a book that is not kind to Trump reporters -- Trump supporters. They call them a threat to democracy and say this. \"In the popular imagination of many Americans, the typical MAGA supporter is a rural resident who hates black and brown people, loathes liberals, loves God and guns, believe in myriad conspiracy theories, has little faith in democracy, and is willing to use violence to achieve their goals. According to this new book, \"White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy,\" these aren't hurtful elitist stereotypes, they're facts.\" What do you make of that assessment of Trump supporters?",

Michael Cohen, obviously, has never been to a Trump rally and actually talk to Trump voters. That is a lie. It is disgusting. Are we even just having this conversation? Let me tell you the truth. People who are MAGA Republicans, they just want the country to follow the law. They want the country to follow the Constitution. They want our leaders to put America first, not last. They actually want sound money. They want low inflation. They want a secure border. And yet, they want to be respected across the globe. They don't want to have to live under a president like Joe Biden who has a terrible foreign policy that has put our men and women overseas at risk, that is putting our allies at risk. MAGA Republicans want a great America. They don't want a fleeting America. They don't want America in decline. That is what the Democrat Party has brought us. That's the crazy progressive agenda from the radical left. The same radical agenda that would have us choose Hamas over Israel. So whatever Michael Cohen wrote in his book, I really don't care, because it makes no sense at all, because those aren't the facts. I would invite him to come to any Trump rally he chooses.

You're talking about trying to maybe put a president in jail before the election.

Judges and members of Congress have immunity when acting in their official capacity. You can disagree with President Trump on whether or not there was voter fraud, but he was clearly acting in his official capacity. Here's why it opens up a Pandora's box.

Eighty-one percent say it's Congress's lack of action. You voted against the Senate deal. I know a lot of people had problems with it, structurally, and policy-wise. But what do you tell Americans about what the realistic path forward is on the border?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, the realistic path forward if we want to end this crisis begins by Joe Biden reversing the executive orders that he made. Every single one of them was designed to reverse a Trump policy. All those executive orders that are basically for the first time in American history we have a president who will not detain the people who enter this country illegally. Look, the immigration system in America is complicated but our laws are pretty straightforward. It defines who's allowed to be in the country and it says if you're here illegally, you should be detained through removal. And we used to have exceptions to that, but narrow exceptions. But the majority of people were detained. Now the reverse is happening. Now, the exceptions have become the rule. Today, if you enter the United States illegally, you are going to be released. Your chances of being released into the country very quickly are between 85 and 90 percent, okay? People know this. The word spreads. They come from all over the world now. There are 7.2 million people in this country that have entered over the last three years, that are here illegally at this moment, entering through different methods and various ways that they've gotten here. That's an unsustainable thing. And all of that was driven by these changes. You can see it in the numbers beginning in January of 2021 when Joe Biden entered the White House. He needs to reverse and go back to the policies that were in place before then, when we didn't have these numbers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Okay. If he does that, would you support him? Because he's got a lot of pressure on the left saying do not go -- and do things that you blasted President Trump for doing, and it may also actually change what's happening at the border depending on what he decides to do, giving him potentially at least an optical win in election year. Would you support him in executive action?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Of course, of course. And not only would we support him, we've called for it. He should have done that before. Look, remember, we spent two and a half years arguing with the Biden administration over whether it was a crisis at all. We -- we can't forget that. For two and a half years, Biden and all of the surrogates and deputies all said there is no crisis, there is no border crisis, there is nothing going on down there that's wrong. They spent a long time denying it until they couldn't it anymore. So, of course, I would support it. In fact, that's what I specifically have called for. Had he done so, I would have voted for the funding for Ukraine and all the other things, because I've supported Ukraine funding. But we have to prioritize this American crisis that we have in our hands, which I think is now posing a real danger. Six-point-two, 7.2 million people, let's be conservative about that, let's say it's 6.2 million that are in this country illegally right now that have been here over the last three years, if only 1 percent of them are dangerous criminals, that's 62,000 criminals in our streets today, people that were criminals overseas in their own countries before they even came here, and we're seeing that play out now every day tragically in the -- in the headlines on the news."

You take 6.2 million people from anywhere, some percentage of them are going to be criminals. Some of them were already criminals. They're not criminals because they're migrants. They're criminals because they're criminals. For example, there is a gang in Venezuela, Tren de Aragua, well-known gang, well-known gang in Venezuela that left Venezuela, has terrorized Colombia, has terrorized Peru, has terrorized other countries. Some of those people have now made their way into the United States. What do we think they do once they get here? Do we think they become stockbrokers? Do we think they now become -- you know, they go and run some charity organization? No, they do here what they did in Peru, what they did in Colombia, what they did in Venezuela before that. They are criminals. Every single day, they're playing out -- again, not because they're migrants but because they are criminals. But this is what happens when you allow 7.2 million people to march into the country and invade it the way they have. Some percentage of them are going to be criminals. And guess what criminals do? They commit crimes. And that's what's happening in America now with many of these people."

      "utterance": "There is no way that the Russian Federation takes Ukraine, all of Ukraine, half of Ukraine. And that was -- that was Putin's goal from the beginning, was to carve it up into half -- at least half the country including Kyiv. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. On the other side of it, we have the reality of it is that Ukraine is small compared to Russia in terms of size and its ability to bring scale, its ability to force conscript people. So neither -- neither can -- this is, I'm just being honest and I -- and you know, in the past, I have tried not to talk about this publicly because I thought it undermined the leverage that Ukraine had. But now, it's the reality. Neither side is going to be able to achieve victory as defined in the most idealistic terms. So then the question becomes, if, in fact, there's going to be a negotiated settlement, who's going to have the leverage here? Is it going to be Putin or is it going to be Ukraine? And I want Ukraine to have the most amount of leverage possible when the time comes for those conversations to happen. They're not going to have leverage if Putin feels like he has the upper hand, that he's -- he has ways to gain and can force Ukraine into a situation where they become basically a satellite state, which is what he wants. He wants them to be like Belarus. He wants to keep territory and then whatever's left over of Ukraine. He wants it to be a country that is forced to remain neutral and that in his orbit and sphere of influence. So I want Ukraine to have the most amount of leverage. And to do that, we have to help him. And I'm in favor of doing that, but we have to first take care of our country. So I -- yes, I believe that we should help Ukraine but only after we help America through our border, in the same way as Democrats are saying, we won't help Israel unless you help Ukraine, and because they're holding Israel as leverage and hostage over Ukraine. So, at the end of the day, that's what I hope we can achieve here and I think it begins by the president doing what he should do anyways, which is to reverse the executive orders that have caused this migrant crisis at our border."

But it's unlikely that many of -- most of the Americans we believe were male soldiers and we're not sure that they will be in the first category. We're trying to get all the hostages released. It gives us an opportunity not only for the release of hostages but to get humanitarian assistance into the innocent people that have been caught in this war, and gives us a chance to move forward with an avenue towards peace in the region. This is something we all need to work on. So the area is, first, we've got to get rid of Hamas and the terrorists, but then we have to have a game plan for peace in the region.

You talk about a plan moving forward. There's been a big push by the U.S. publicly and privately about a two- state solution, but there are a lot of folks who worry about that. Obviously, Israeli leaders are rejecting it. Here's what foreign policy said. The two-state solution is a recipe for carnage. That follows up with a \"Washington Post\" opinion piece saying, \"There's every reason to fear that Hamas or similar entities would control a nascent democratic Palestinian state in the near-term aftermath of this brutal war.\" So do we as outsiders have any way to actually assure Israel that some kind of governing body can be set up in that territory that won't be an existential threat to them?"

That is very clear for a pathway forward for the people of Gaza, as well as security for Israel. We have many of the leaders in the region who want to participate in a rebuilding of Gaza. They want to see a future for the Palestinians, both the West Bank and Gaza, but it starts with security in the region and a governance that recognizes Israel's rights and will live in peace with Israel. That's absolutely essential. Is that possible? Yes, it is possible, but it's going to take a lot of hard work. We've been going through this for many, many years. The challenge right now is to find a pathway forward so that we can get to that point. And that means listening to the responsible leaders, the Palestinian Authority needs to be revamped. You need to -- by actions and deeds -- recognize Israel. And then if there's peace, if there's security in the region, there will be a pathway forward for two states living side by side in peace."

Israel has a very challenging battle to get Hamas out of Gaza. They have a tunneling system. There are extreme challenges. We want to make sure that Israel does this in a way that minimizes civilian loss. We've got to get humanitarian assistance in. And we need to reach a level.

We had that opportunity. We had a bipartisan bill to fix the border, a very strong bill.

We found similar numbers just this past week in the \"Bloomberg News\" Morning Consult poll which showed that immigration is rising still and is now the second most important issue after the economy. So it's gaining steam. And that's why you saw these dueling visits. I was with President Biden at the border on Thursday. It's a pretty sanitized view of the situation there. Brownsville is not a hotspot right now. And he visited an area like a boat launch where we didn't see or at least I didn't see one migrant for example. So he is trying to say, look, it can be orderly. We need Congress to pass these bills. President -- former president Trump of course is saying, look, this is chaos. We need to do something. The question is really, what can a president do. A lot of things President Trump did were subject to litigation. They were struck down in court. Title 42 was a lot of it. It's gone. So the ability to do stuff is disputed at best. And the personnel to do it, they don't have it if they don't have a bill.

Of course, you know, former President Trump chose to go to a section of the border that has really been ground zero for Texas Governor Abbott's battle against the administration, going where that park is, where Texas has taken control and is blocking Border Patrol's access there. Meanwhile, of course, Biden went to Brownsville, which used to be an area where we saw lots of migration, but that has certainly declined in recent - - in recent years and has not been a hotspot for a long time now. And we really are -- and what was notable was that Biden went. I heard from multiple people who felt that it was important for the President to at least show that he was there, that it was an issue he was paying attention to. Because this has been an issue he has not wanted to pay attention to, for years. We look at these polling. We see that immigration is the number two issue for a lot of voters. We see the, you know, terrible ratings for the current President when it comes to immigration. And only recently has he and his administration decided that they're going to take this on head on. Only recently have they gone on offense. But it's still a question whether they can actually make any improvement on this issue."

If you take a step back here, you're talking about President Trump has a massive lead over Joe Biden on immigration, continues to be a number one, number two issue for voters here. And the reason why is, voters can see what's happened over the last four years. President Biden, his first 100 days issued almost 100 executive orders, undoing a lot of President Trump's border policies. He's talking about got rid of Remain in Mexico, halted construction on the border wall. Let Title 42 expire, did nothing then to try and find a solution there. And we're back at catch and release. So it's no -- it's no reason that voters, this is the big reason why voters are blaming Biden for this. He's underwater by 30 points in this. Sure, they don't like the Congress didn't take action, but Joe Biden's not running against Congress. He's running against President Trump here.

And that's part of the message the campaign wants to make. Joe Biden has supported the toughest immigration bill any Democrat in history has ever supported. Taking on the far left part of the party, Joe Biden is not on the far left on any issue and certainly not on immigration. And the reason Congress won't pass it is Donald Trump. He has said it publicly, Republicans have said it, and they're going to hammer that home. Shannon, every chance they get, you heard President Biden talking about that this week. But, you know, this polling, I think in many ways, should be a wakeup call for the Biden team. They need to sharpen their message. They need to get a more aggressive campaign going. But there are some bright spots, right? Independents still overwhelmingly going for Joe Biden, where Joe Biden's support is a little weaker. It's not translating into support for Donald Trump. He really still has a hard ceiling on his support, even on issues like immigration, even on issues like crime. And the proof is in the pudding. The best indicator of how voters will vote is how they're voting. And in every election, since 2018, Democrats have been overperforming. So I think these polls and issues like immigration are wake up calls and should get the Biden team really aggressively out there sharpening their message.

I was up in Bay City, near Saginaw, where there have been real and concrete announcements of high wage, high quality new jobs and manufacturing in semiconductors, investments and infrastructure, a double-digit raise for the members of the UAW. And so on the follow-up to last Tuesday's primary, what I saw in the Detroit area and in the center of Michigan was positivity because of the leadership President Biden has shown in reducing prescription drug prices, and standing up for our veterans, in investing in infrastructure, and in helping create nearly 15 million new jobs through the private sector while he's been president. Only one president in modern times has had as bad a job record as Herbert Hoover, and that's Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "It's fair to point out there was a pandemic during the Trump administration. And there are a number of fact-checking organizations, not us, but all over the place that have said, this president did not create 15 million jobs. Those were people coming back to work at the end of the pandemic. So we can continue to debate that. But you had more than 100,000 people take their time to show up in Michigan and vote uncommitted. They clearly have different policy differences with the president. But when we look down the number of issues in our new Fox News polling, he's underwater by 20, 30 plus points in any number of things, the economy, China, inflation, Israel and Hamas, immigration. There is a solid majority of Americans out there who feel like he is not getting the job done on issues they say they care most about."

      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "So, Shannon, two things about that. First, what matters is how people vote. And we have consistently, as Democrats, overperformed polls, not just in the special election that just happened in Long Island, in the midterms in '22, but in election after election. And I'll remind you, former President Trump is underperforming. In Michigan, nearly 30 percent of voters came out and supported Nikki Haley. And whether it's in South Carolina, New Hampshire, or this coming Super Tuesday, we have 20 percent or more of voters saying they will never vote for former president Trump, partly because of his 91 criminal counts that he's facing, partly because of the chaos that he created as a former president, partly because of his ongoing statements. Just last night at a rally, he said that President Obama does not deter President Putin. He keeps saying things in public that make folks question his mental fitness, as well as his moral character."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and yet, when you ask people, head-to-head on these issues that they care about, who's better equipped to handle things, they are giving President Trump the nod. I mean, in issues like immigration, years ago, it was like a 16-point advantage for him. That's now more than double to 35 points, an advantage that people think what is their number one or number two issue on all the polls. They think that they want President Trump back, that he had better control of things like the border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Shannon, more than two-thirds of Americans strongly supported the bipartisan deal that we hammered out in the Senate. It was a deal that would have invested $20 billion in combating fentanyl, in hiring new border patrol, in finding new deportation flights, and in securing our border. And as you saw in their two border visits this week, President Biden asked former President Trump to work with him, to stop seeking an election issue, but instead deliver a solution for the American people. Former President Trump called his allies in the Senate and defeated that bipartisan bill because he wants an issue, not a solution. I think when the American people see such a sharp contrast on an issue that matters to all of us, where President Biden is showing bipartisan leadership willing to take the tough stances and invest in making us safer and stronger, and they see former President Trump simply trying to have an issue for election, on an issue, frankly, a bill that was endorsed by the Border Patrol, by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" by the Chamber of Commerce, I think the American people see who's interested in and capable of leading, and that's President Biden."

You heard what the Senator said about the fact that 30 to 40 percent of primary voters in a number of states are showing up to vote in the GOP primary for Nikki Haley. Now, not all of those are closed, and so there's going to be some party crossover. But why can't President Trump put this thing away? Why are still 30, 40 percent of people showing up and voting in these primary contests for someone other than him?"

In some of these early states, they allowed Independents and Democrat voters to vote on the Republican side when it comes to picking a nominee in these states. And even with that influx with some Independents and Democrats, Donald Trump overwhelmingly won every single state. Now we move to Super Tuesday. And let me just tell you, it's basically over already. It's going to be over Tuesday night when Super Tuesday ballots come in because there is no path to victory for Nikki Haley. Look, on our side of the aisle, we believe in choices. We want options. The Democrats are the ones who basically kicked Robert F. Kennedy out of their primary. They basically stopped Dean Phillips from being able to even try to mount a campaign against Joe Biden. Nikki Haley had an opportunity to run like everybody else. They all lost. Donald Trump's the nominee. We're going to move forward to November."

      "utterance": "First of all, you can't listen to Nikki Haley. She's the opponent. By the way, she's losing big time. You can't listen to Mr. Meeks because the Democrats never want to solve the border issues. They're the ones that created it. Here's what happened. The House Republicans passed H.R.2 over a year ago. Chuck Schumer did nothing with that bill. Never came up for a debate. The Senate never came to the House and said, you know what? Let's work together in a bipartisan fashion based upon what the House has passed. And let's see where we can meet in the middle. You had Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats go into a smoke-filled room. They created a terrible deal. And when the elements of this deal started being leaked out early, the 5,000 entrants per day, the fact that Joe Biden will be able to have waiver authority over all the provisions, House Republicans started signaling very early, led by Speaker Johnson, that we did not support that deal. When it finally came out and everybody could read it, then everybody rejected it. Even Mitch McConnell voted against it. So it was a bad deal from the start. The Democrats are playing the worst kind of politics, because Joe Biden is the one who broke our southern border. Those are his executive orders when he came into the White House. These are the 10 million people who've come in under his watch and he refuses to lift a finger. Don't talk about bipartisanship when the Senate Democrats would never even talk to House Republicans about what are the solutions. Because if there is going to be a compromise to be found, it is a negotiation between Senate Democrats and House Republicans. Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden do not want to have that conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. And just to clarify, because it keeps coming up, this issue of 5,000 people a day, the backers or the drafters of this, including James Lankford, who I know that you know and respect said, once you hit an average of 5,000 a day, which would happen in week one, then the entire border was closed, not that an additional 5,000 would be able to come. Of course that went nowhere because I know there were other problems people have with the bill. I want to read you something at \"The Daily Beast\" this weekend talking about a book that is not kind to Trump reporters -- Trump supporters. They call them a threat to democracy and say this. \"In the popular imagination of many Americans, the typical MAGA supporter is a rural resident who hates black and brown people, loathes liberals, loves God and guns, believe in myriad conspiracy theories, has little faith in democracy, and is willing to use violence to achieve their goals. According to this new book, \"White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy,\" these aren't hurtful elitist stereotypes, they're facts.\" What do you make of that assessment of Trump supporters?"

    {
      "speaker": "DONALDS",
      "utterance": "I find it to just be insane. I find it to be gaslighting black people and Hispanic people in our country. I find it to be devoid of facts. Michael Cohen, obviously, has never been to a Trump rally and actually talk to Trump voters. That is a lie. It is disgusting. Are we even just having this conversation? Let me tell you the truth. People who are MAGA Republicans, they just want the country to follow the law. They want the country to follow the Constitution. They want our leaders to put America first, not last. They actually want sound money. They want low inflation. They want a secure border. And yet, they want to be respected across the globe. They don't want to have to live under a president like Joe Biden who has a terrible foreign policy that has put our men and women overseas at risk, that is putting our allies at risk. MAGA Republicans want a great America. They don't want a fleeting America. They don't want America in decline. That is what the Democrat Party has brought us. That's the crazy progressive agenda from the radical left. The same radical agenda that would have us choose Hamas over Israel. So whatever Michael Cohen wrote in his book, I really don't care, because it makes no sense at all, because those aren't the facts. I would invite him to come to any Trump rally he chooses. I'll walk side-by-side with him and he can see what's really going on."

Now Illinois has decided to do the same thing. We're back with our panel. But the big news out of SCOTUS, as we wait on that this week, Garrett, is that they're taking up the immunity case and many on the left very upset because it delays the Jack Smith case. In \"The Atlantic\" they say, \"the delay in justice makes it impossible that Trump will never face federal criminal charges for his role in inciting the January 6th insurrection.

And if you take a step back, why we are here? Democrat prosecutors, Jack Smith's - Jack Smith, Biden's DOJ, Fani Willis, all these folks waited about two and a half years to charge President Trump. They took their grand old time until he was a declared candidate for president surging in the polls. So, they waited to actually do this. Now we're talking about having this before an election, which would be completely unprecedented. As you remember, Democrats flipped out on James Comey. This is a hundred times this. You're talking about trying to maybe put a president in jail before the election. And I would also say, if you're talking about presidential immunity, President Trump's argument, actually is very interesting. Judges and members of Congress have immunity when acting in their official capacity. You can disagree with President Trump on whether or not there was voter fraud, but he was clearly acting in his official capacity. Here's why it opens up a Pandora's box. Does that mean that, you know, the Afghanistan servicemembers, their families, could they sue President Biden for manslaughter? He was acting in his official capacity. President Obama with drone strikes. You're opening up Pandora's box in these cases."

I think that voters should know the answers to those questions before they go to the polls.
