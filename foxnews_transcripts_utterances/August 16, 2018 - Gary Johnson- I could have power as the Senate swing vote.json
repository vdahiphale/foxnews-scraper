Look, it's not about out raising your opponents but it's having parody when it comes to money and in the presidential races -- look, in 2016 we raised 12 million dollars to Donald Trump and Hilary Clintons 1.8 billion dollars apiece. So I'm afraid there is a reality attached to having money and being able to get your message out and--"

      "utterance": "Look, you got 10 percent -- almost 10 percent of the vote in your home state. That in an election like that. So that's not too bad but there are a lot of people just say your time has come and gone. Been there, done that. You're kind of quaint (ph) with the legalize pot thing and some other views in it. But that -- you don't excite them as a senator, you say?"

      "utterance": "Well, here's -- look, I've always said I don't want to be a U.S. Senator because I think the job involves bellying up to the trough and that's the last thing we need is more spending. We need to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. So what's laid on my plate is arguably being one of the most powerful senators right out of the shoot because of being the swing vote and how close it will be between Democrats and Republicans and how the swing vote might actually determine senate outcomes. That's terribly exciting, in my opinion. And this is a race that for me will be about nine weeks. I can do anything for nine weeks."

But, I mean, you're going to have to rely on a lot because you might not get a lot of money and then there might be resistance to a third party candidate. But let's say you do make it and into the senate, you're in the middle of this trade war that could still be going on, do you think the president is taking the right approach, getting a hard line with China, hard line with a lot of people."

      "utterance": "No, I don't. I think free trade is free trade and that the issues of intellectual property can be handled in different ways. And, look, we should be all about free trade. We should all be about free market. The private sector does everything better than the public sector, everything, and yet, we continue to expand government. We continue to expect government to do things that really it's incapable of doing."

Let's not forget that the majority of Americans today, 45 percent of Americans that register to vote or registering is independent. Where's the representation when it comes to Democrats and Republicans? And I have dedicated myself to the inequality or just the fact that we are a party system. Paraphrasing George Washington, he said, look. If this -- if our country ever devolves into political parties, we're done for."

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I've always been well-served by telling the truth and I think that that is the truth. Look. We've got to curb the growth in these policies or we're going to find ourselves in a situation where we're going to continue to overspend and at some point, inflation is going to come to bear on all of this."
