It's 5 o'clock in New York City, 4 o'clock in Dallas, Texas, and this is The Five. Welcome to \"The Five\" live from Dallas. We're here on the campus of Southern Methodist University for the whole hour. The SMU Mustang band is playing for us. We have a great show. There's a ton of tight races to talk about in the midterms, the migrant caravan is getting even bigger as President Trump threatens to stop it. Plus, we're answering questions from some of the students in the crowd, and Lawrence has some big surprises for us that he brought back from the Texas state fair. So, Greg, how is Texas treating you so far?",

So turnout will be important and you might be able to tell a lot about 2020 once we finalize this midterm election. But in the house, I can't tell if the Democrats are doing a little bit of tamping down expectations because they want their people to get worried so that they will try to boost turnout or if it's kind of just demoralizing. They have all this build up, and now here you have Tom Perez, the DNC head saying, yeah, I never thought it's really going to be that good anyway. I don't think they'll be a blue wave.

But I think right now for the house if you look at the numbers, things look pretty good for the Democrats, but they need their voters to turn out.

They got the tax cut that they wanted. They may be angry at congress for not getting health care, but they were going to stay at home. With the Kavanaugh stuff and the mob mentality that they have with socialism, now Republicans, especially in the state of Texas, are fired up and they will be going to the polls."

And we don't like people kicking down the border and demanding citizenship. We want it done the right way and the proper way. And there's a lot of fake news about the caravan too. They're making it out to be a bunch of mothers with young children. But if you look at the video, you know, your eyes aren't going to lie to you. There's teenage kids. There's 20-year- old men. And they brutally broke through the border into Mexico, roughed up some of the border police on the Mexican side. They're wearing t-shirts that are calling our president the devil. And a lot of people in America are looking at these visual and saying this looks like a hostile crew. And we're not necessarily going to welcome you with open arms if you're going to behave that way. And then once they get a little north, they pay the drug cartels $5,000 for a family unit, so now the drug cartels are basically acting like tollbooth operators for America. So if the Democrats want open borders, they're on the same side as the drug cartels. Mexico has to step up and stop this.

If you are somebody who wants more legal immigration in the country, if you think that immigration is our strength, this is not helping. You take someone like me, very sympathetic to refugees. This, to me, does not look like refugees. And also, you have able-bodied young men. I understand that the economic conditions in their country are not good, but then stay there and fight for it, OK."

If they so believe in the system of our government, why are they violating it so brazenly while holding onto their flag and talking about how great their country is as they're storming our border? Our border is what defined a country. It's crazy. And to the point about how -- Trump demonizing other people, who's been demonized the most? Every time you try to come out for some kind of process, they call you heartless or racist. Maxine Waters told people to go after Republicans and conservatives, and that is essentially demonization.

And because they're not learning anything of practical value, it's true, students won't realize this, of course. $1.5 trillion, it's basically our own Venezuela, a third world socialist sinkhole existing within the United States, immune to market forces and common sense, and you and your kids are paying for this crap. If you're 23, you won't be able to afford a home and you can't get married until you're done paying for the promos new butt lift. It's not a bad thing. What a bargain.
