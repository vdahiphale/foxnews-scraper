They know they're wise, they know they're all wise and they're designed to placate the working class in older Americans who just a few years earlier had voted for Trump. Well, the fact is right now Biden plans to reverse nearly all of the Presidents hard won successes for working class Americans. Most importantly Trump successes on trade and immigration. Today we learn that Biden has stacked his Department of Homeland Security transition team with radical open borders fanatics. For instance, the head of the agency review group is Ur Jaddou, Former Chief Counsel at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Obama. She currently heads in activist group that calls for putting 11 million undocumented Americans on a path to full citizenship.

Well, a blanket amnesty would in and of itself become a magnet for millions of additional illegal's to make the dangerous track here.

Now aside from mass amnesty it's bad enough, here are the big goals. He's going to halt deportations for 100 days upon taking office. And figure out then I guess how to avoid departing as many illegal's as possible by narrowing the scope of any enforcement in the future. Biden will also end the incredibly successful remain in Mexico policy for those who cross their southern borders seeking asylum. Now he's also going to rip up agreements from #Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to take in those rejected asylum seekers. Biden will raise the cap on refugees as well. So right now, we take in about 15,000 a year from all across the globe. He is going to raise it to 125,000 annually. And he's also going to eliminate the travel restrictions on people coming from terrorist hotbeds that Trump put into place years ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now every one of these actions are going to lead to either a more dangerous America or lower wages for working class Americans including as I said immigrants and minorities who obey the laws, just want to earn a decent wage for a hard day's work. Biden's wealthy backers, they believe that honest Americans must always sacrifice and never complain, don't you dare complain about welcoming in more illegal immigrants into the country. Now remember Big Tech was livid when Donald Trump put a freeze on what we are called H1B visas back in June. They - what Trump wanted to do is protect American tech jobs instead of allowing a flood of foreign tech workers into the country.

He has a National Security team that is basically uninterested in the whole national part of its duties. A Former Trump Pentagon official tells Politico, Biden is aiming to build and effective bipartisan defense department leadership team. Reaching out to more formal officials who are appointed by Jim Maddox to talk about the transition and potentially serving. Now let me translate that and to explain in English. Basically neocons are going to retake control of our foreign policy unless Trump actually pulls all of our troops out of Afghanistan by the end of the year. Troops are going to be stuck there for four more years. Trump refusal to go along with the military industrial complex is why the troops love him, but the top military brass and the defense contractors, not so much. Case in point, Jim Jeffrey the outgoing special envoy to Syria just today boasted that he and other military leaders flagrantly lied to the President and misled the public to keep boots on the ground in Syria after Trump said we are coming home. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, it's outrageous and it's disgusting that career officials would put American soldiers in harm's way for their own personal goals a political views. And by the way, these are goals and views that the voters rejected when they elected Trump in 2016. They wanted out of these wars, but not surprisingly, the media celebrated this flagrant dereliction of duty, abuse, disobedience whatever you want to call it. Yet President Trump, look he is still fighting for Americans. Today he angered Biden's campaign bundlers with an executive order banning U.S. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } investments in companies controlled by the Chinese military. This current presidential vote tally doesn't mean that America endorses though Biden's open borders, pro- war idiocy. You have to understand that. Think about it at this way. The GOP cleaned up in state legislatures, they flipped at, what at least ten house seats, didn't lose in a single incumbency. And if he wins, this upcoming runoff - both runoffs in Georgia, we are going to have a strong bow work against the Left extreme agenda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tomorrow, we're going to see that America first energy on full display when Trump supporters apparently from across the country defend on DC, the demand accountability and transparency about this contested election. Remember four years ago, the media hailed the women's march as a repudiation of Trump selection. So will the media provide the same type of narrative this weekend? The resistance has a new face, and this time they are resisting Joe Biden, his handlers, his donors and all of their efforts to sell out America. And that's \"The Angle\".

He's got to pick up not just one, but two, but three, maybe even four states where Biden is leading or has been declared the winner. And he said, look, I still have this path. I am very, very optimistic. And basically, there's two approaches he is making. There are the states like Georgia and Arizona where he believes he can find enough votes to go ahead of Joe Biden and win those states. And then there are the other states where he's trailing by bigger margins -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, 55,000 in one, 140,000 something in another -- where he feels that there were so many votes that he believes were illegally cast, that were cast when his campaign's observers were being locked out of the process, that he wants to have those votes disqualified and then can win that way. So it all depends on these legal challenges. And the reason he called me was to lay out the hope that he had, the optimism that he had for each of those particular instances.",

They know they're wise, they know they're all wise and they're designed to placate the working class in older Americans who just a few years earlier had voted for Trump. Well, the fact is right now Biden plans to reverse nearly all of the Presidents hard won successes for working class Americans. Most importantly Trump successes on trade and immigration. Today we learn that Biden has stacked his Department of Homeland Security transition team with radical open borders fanatics. For instance, the head of the agency review group is Ur Jaddou, Former Chief Counsel at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Obama. She currently heads in activist group that calls for putting 11 million undocumented Americans on a path to full citizenship. And it's even not such a sweeping change to America would just require actual legislation to pass through both houses of Congress so there could be compromised and work between the parties, well, a key guide and allies just don't see it that way."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Executive orders, that's what he's talking about. Well, a blanket amnesty would in and of itself become a magnet for millions of additional illegal's to make the dangerous track here. And that would guarantee that wages would be depressed and opportunities loss for legal immigrants and an entry level American worker. That's how it always plays out. But Biden's plan for mass wage that goes even further than this. Earlier this week, CBS news got a hold of Biden's immigration plan. Now aside from mass amnesty it's bad enough, here are the big goals. He's going to halt deportations for 100 days upon taking office. And figure out then I guess how to avoid departing as many illegal's as possible by narrowing the scope of any enforcement in the future. Biden will also end the incredibly successful remain in Mexico policy for those who cross their southern borders seeking asylum. Now he's also going to rip up agreements from #Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to take in those rejected asylum seekers. Biden will raise the cap on refugees as well. So right now, we take in about 15,000 a year from all across the globe. He is going to raise it to 125,000 annually. And he's also going to eliminate the travel restrictions on people coming from terrorist hotbeds that Trump put into place years ago. Now every one of these actions are going to lead to either a more dangerous America or lower wages for working class Americans including as I said immigrants and minorities who obey the laws, just want to earn a decent wage for a hard day's work. Biden's wealthy backers, they believe that honest Americans must always sacrifice and never complain, don't you dare complain about welcoming in more illegal immigrants into the country. Now remember Big Tech was livid when Donald Trump put a freeze on what we are called H1B visas back in June. They - what Trump wanted to do is protect American tech jobs instead of allowing a flood of foreign tech workers into the country. But Biden remembers, he doesn't care about protecting American tech workers jobs."

Biden's great American sell out is just as bad by the way in the foreign policy realm. He has a National Security team that is basically uninterested in the whole national part of its duties. A Former Trump Pentagon official tells Politico, Biden is aiming to build and effective bipartisan defense department leadership team. Reaching out to more formal officials who are appointed by Jim Maddox to talk about the transition and potentially serving. Now let me translate that and to explain in English. Basically neocons are going to retake control of our foreign policy unless Trump actually pulls all of our troops out of Afghanistan by the end of the year. Troops are going to be stuck there for four more years. Trump refusal to go along with the military industrial complex is why the troops love him, but the top military brass and the defense contractors, not so much. Case in point, Jim Jeffrey the outgoing special envoy to Syria just today boasted that he and other military leaders flagrantly lied to the President and misled the public to keep boots on the ground in Syria after Trump said we are coming home. Now, it's outrageous and it's disgusting that career officials would put American soldiers in harm's way for their own personal goals a political views. And by the way, these are goals and views that the voters rejected when they elected Trump in 2016. They wanted out of these wars, but not surprisingly, the media celebrated this flagrant dereliction of duty, abuse, disobedience whatever you want to call it. Yet President Trump, look he is still fighting for Americans. Today he angered Biden's campaign bundlers with an executive order banning U.S. investments in companies controlled by the Chinese military. This current presidential vote tally doesn't mean that America endorses though Biden's open borders, pro- war idiocy. You have to understand that. Think about it at this way. The GOP cleaned up in state legislatures, they flipped at, what at least ten house seats, didn't lose in a single incumbency. And if he wins, this upcoming runoff - both runoffs in Georgia, we are going to have a strong bow work against the Left extreme agenda. And tomorrow, we're going to see that America first energy on full display when Trump supporters apparently from across the country defend on DC, the demand accountability and transparency about this contested election. Remember four years ago, the media hailed the women's march as a repudiation of Trump selection. So will the media provide the same type of narrative this weekend? The resistance has a new face, and this time they are resisting Joe Biden, his handlers, his donors and all of their efforts to sell out America. And that's \"The Angle\".

What Joe Biden has long wanted is to reject the America first label because he's embarrassed by it, he's got a bunch of foreign friends, the globalist community who are constantly saying this isn't good for us, and let go back to where we have consensus. Now consensus is one of these words that sounds good in foreign policy, but let me be very clear, consensus means that other people get to VETO our policies. They get to water it down, take for instance, the 15 members of the Security Council. We go in, and we have to have consensus so that 14 other countries get to water down our policy. And that is the type of policies that Joe Biden embraces. He wants a globalist world. He wants his foreign friends to be happy. And so when country say like Germany say we really don't want to pay our fair share at NATO, we're going to be angry if you force us to, Joe Biden says we'd like you to pay, but we are not going to force you. And that's what we saw for eight years of the Obama Biden administration, the attacks on America first I think have got to stop."

This is - they hold whole Joe Biden 47 years in Washington, D.C., his whole focus is to spread around the wealth, let's have a whole bunch of wars, let's give everybody a little bit of a piece of the action. Let's create jobs and let's make Washington, D.C. more powerful. This is the total opposite of what America first is, which is to spend the money on our people and to demand that other countries pay their fair share. I actually don't think it's mean spirited at all and that's what it's been portrayed as somehow that we are mean to the rest of the world when we say you should pay your fair share at NATO.

It looks like they are making people poor and they are guaranteeing that this people will remain uneducated because uneducated voters tend to vote for Democrats. I have talked about this extensively over the last four years. I have talked about what the Left has done to the education system. They have intentionally watered it down when school in session, right, replacing hard academics. Kids aren't learning about engineering and science anymore, they're learning about psychological conditioning. They're running about white privilege. They're learning about Black Lives Matter. They're learning how to be angry little marks is. What better way than just to say you know what we're not going to teach you anything at all, anymore. We want you to be home. We want you to be on your tablets. We want to make sure you're not learning anything. We want to keep you fearful. And you're exactly right, of course the leader sort of, send their kids to school, people that have money they can afford it are going to make sure their kids get an education. The ones that are going to suffer are going to be the impoverished people. But that is the point. There is no basis for this, in terms of a health basis for him to do this. We already know that, is been proven multiple times that kids are not spreading the coronavirus, that children, I read an article two weeks ago, children have a ten times higher chance of dying from the flu then dying from COVID-19. But that's not going to stop these Governors because they after something much worse and that is making sure that these kids remain uneducated because uneducated people turn to Democratic voters for a lifetime."

I am sorry for at least the time being until you think it's safe, but these kids need to be in school and they need to be in school on Monday through Friday in a full schedule. This is child abuse, I mean I said it since the beginning of this pandemic, this is child abuse and there is going to be hell to pay. Maybe not now, may be or it didn't happen in this election, but it's going to happen in 2022, because we're going to see just how bad this damage is to kids in the coming year."

I mean at the end of the day, the public school system is not serving these kids in the first place, remember I talk about all the time. 75% of black kids, black boys in California can't pass a basic reading exam and now they're not even going to be allowed to go to school in your cities. You can't find children that are proficient in reading and in math. So I mean, this is a larger problem it's going to get worse, but I believe that this is purposeful it's by design and it's just true to the Democrat Party and their routes of un-educating all Americans."

So, again to my surprise when I found out that there was a ballot that was cast in my name. I was very surprised and it was verified by four sources which I did look up the four official Arizona sources that were connected with Maricopa County.

Where do President Trump's legal challenges stand? And what path forward does he see for his campaign given Biden's sizable lead in a key state. Of course, one is Pennsylvania. The president himself laid it out to my next guest in a surprise call. When I asked Trump how quickly it might turn things around, he might turn things around, he said I don't know. It's probably two weeks, three weeks. He closed with a good natured warning for everyone who has told him there is no hope -- never bet against me. Joining me now is Byron York, \"Washington Examiner\" chief political correspondent and FOX News contributor. Byron, there's apparently a huge crowd that is going to descend on Washington tomorrow. I don't know how many people, but I think quite a few, a lot. And they want to have facts and real information about a path forward for their president. What did the president say to you? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Basically, I had been on FOX saying how incredibly difficult it would be for the president to win. He's got to pick up not just one, but two, but three, maybe even four states where Biden is leading or has been declared the winner. And he said, look, I still have this path. I am very, very optimistic. And basically, there's two approaches he is making. There are the states like Georgia and Arizona where he believes he can find enough votes to go ahead of Joe Biden and win those states. And then there are the other states where he's trailing by bigger margins -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, 55,000 in one, 140,000 something in another -- where he feels that there were so many votes that he believes were illegally cast, that were cast when his campaign's observers were being locked out of the process, that he wants to have those votes disqualified and then can win that way. So it all depends on these legal challenges. And the reason he called me was to lay out the hope that he had, the optimism that he had for each of those particular instances."

What's the remedy for what happened in Pennsylvania were, again, or in Michigan where poll watchers, they say in lots of video, we've played some of it on the show, they are in the room, but they are 30 yards, what is the remedy for that? A new election, all those ballots are discounted?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "It seems very unlikely. I think the remedy is not to throw out tens of thousands of votes. And one of the things I had pointed out earlier is that in the past half-century, there have been three statewide elections that were overturned as a result of recounts. And each of those originally was so close that just at 200 or 300 votes separated the two candidates, and therefore they went into recount, and it went the other way. We haven't had one where 10, 12, 15, 20, 30,000 votes separated the two candidates. So far, the president has not been succeeding in court. There is one case, though, in Pennsylvania that's extremely important not just for this election, but for all elections, and that is the case in which the state supreme court of Pennsylvania rewrote the election law. The constitution gives state legislatures the exclusive power to do that, and in this case the state supreme court rewrote it, and that's what Republicans are trying to change."
