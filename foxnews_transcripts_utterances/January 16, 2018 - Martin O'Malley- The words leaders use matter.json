As I get some explosive new details about last Thursday's meeting here on immigration that suggests the White House is planning to take a very hard line in these negotiations. Let's first talk about that hearing today you've mentioned that was supposed to be contentious because it was going to be all about the president's plan to build a wall. Instead, it got fiery about what he said or didn't say behind closed doors. Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held firm in saying, last Thursday she did not hear the president utter the word \"s-hole\", leading Cory Booker to charge the what he called here silence and amnesia, made her complicit in the president's comments. Nielsen, clearly trying to pivot and change the narrative and maybe send a signal to the president's political base, saying that he's taking action to crack down on illegal immigration. The secretary announcing, as you noted, the administration is talking to federal prosecutors now about criminal charges against officials in sanctuary cities all around the country if they refuse to follow through on federal orders to deport criminals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also new today, the Department of Justice revealed it's going to try and go directly to Supreme Court to fast-track its appeal of a federal judge's ruling in San Francisco that new DACA applications can start. Meanwhile, Republican Lindsey Graham today, charged all that dramatic turn from one week ago today when the president gathered leaders from both parties in the cabinet room and said he wanted a deal where he took care of the DACA kids, \"with love\" while also tightening border security. Graham charged that last Thursday morning around 10:00 a.m., he and Democrat Dick Durbin called over the president to re-demand on a bipartisan deal they had. But by the time they made it to the oval office around noon last Thursday, someone on the White House staff like Senior Advisor Steven Miller, a hardliner on immigration, had convinced the president to turn against the deal.

Much of the media world seems to agree the story told by the woman who calls herself, Grace, about her date with comedian Aziz Ansari, certainly, does not rise to the level of Harvey Weinstein-type misconduct. An op-ed by the Washington Post says the Aziz Ansari tale isn't about a powerful person trying to humiliate and subjugate someone who wants nothing more than to chase their dreams. Instead, quoting, it's about a date that went badly. One that did not live up to the expectations of the woman involved. Caitlin Flanagan of the Atlantic went further calling the woman's story, quote, 3,000 words of revenge porn. Intended not to validate her account as much as it is to hurt and humiliate Ansari. But critics wondered if the woman is guilty of trying to hurt Ansari or simply guilty of bad timing. In other words, would she have been as roundly criticized at the height of the Me Too Movement? For example, three months ago when the Huffington Post seemed to cast aspersions on all men saying this about Me Too, quoting, the social media campaign is, of course, intended as a wake-up call for men. If every woman you know has been harassed or assaulted, then every man you know has likely made a woman feel unsafe. And it should be noted that not everyone is giving Ansari a pass. An L.A. Time opinion contributor tweeted, quote, I was finally able to read the account of the date with Aziz Ansari from the described events he appears to have no understanding whatsoever of sexual consent nor do his defenders, it seems. That said, the Me Too narrative is now consistently being challenged. Actress Catherine Deneuve denounced the movement because she believes people who did not deserve to be condemned are facing the same consequences as sex offenders.

      "utterance": "Martha, great to see you. A senior official here just told me a few moments ago that they're all but daring Democrats to shut down the government over DACA. As I get some explosive new details about last Thursday's meeting here on immigration that suggests the White House is planning to take a very hard line in these negotiations. Let's first talk about that hearing today you've mentioned that was supposed to be contentious because it was going to be all about the president's plan to build a wall. Instead, it got fiery about what he said or didn't say behind closed doors. Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen held firm in saying, last Thursday she did not hear the president utter the word \"s-hole\", leading Cory Booker to charge the what he called here silence and amnesia, made her complicit in the president's comments. Nielsen, clearly trying to pivot and change the narrative and maybe send a signal to the president's political base, saying that he's taking action to crack down on illegal immigration. The secretary announcing, as you noted, the administration is talking to federal prosecutors now about criminal charges against officials in sanctuary cities all around the country if they refuse to follow through on federal orders to deport criminals. Also new today, the Department of Justice revealed it's going to try and go directly to Supreme Court to fast-track its appeal of a federal judge's ruling in San Francisco that new DACA applications can start. Meanwhile, Republican Lindsey Graham today, charged all that dramatic turn from one week ago today when the president gathered leaders from both parties in the cabinet room and said he wanted a deal where he took care of the DACA kids, \"with love\" while also tightening border security. Graham charged that last Thursday morning around 10:00 a.m., he and Democrat Dick Durbin called over the president to re-demand on a bipartisan deal they had. But by the time they made it to the oval office around noon last Thursday, someone on the White House staff like Senior Advisor Steven Miller, a hardliner on immigration, had convinced the president to turn against the deal. Here's Graham."

      "utterance": "Something happened between 10:00 to 12:00, and I like Secretary Nielsen; she's a nice person. And we'll get to the bottom of this, but here's what's going to matter. How does it end? How does it end? Does it end with a government shutting down? We cannot do this with people in charge at the White House who have an irrational view on how to fix immigration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, a Senior administration official just fired back to me moments ago that that is not how this played out. This official said Graham and Durbin begged for an oval office meeting to present their own deal that went around a framework that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was already working on. This official declaring of Graham, \"He tried to sabotage the framework. Nobody knew what was in the damn Graham plan. The president was frustrated and hit him with questions, and Lindsey had no explicative answers. And the president shut him down.\" That from a senior official. So, will the government shut down with some Democrats insisting they're not going to support a budget deal unless there's a clean DACA bill in there. This senior administration official told me \"we can call that bluff all day long\". They are basically digging in here saying they will give a little bit on DACA, but they have to have the wall. They have to have an end to chain migration and also an end to that visa lottery program. So, they are digging in here tonight at the White House. We'll see how that plays out, Martha."

I don't think that's a particularly good use of money but that's what the president wants and that's what compromise is about. So, I hope they do reach a deal."

He has said, since he was elected he said things that were a little bit stronger than this during the election, but he's -- you know, we want to deal with this with love, we want to keep, you know, the kids who are good and who are prospering here in the United States. We want to keep them here. But we want a tradeoff; we want border security which Democrats have said for a very long time they were in favor of stiffening the security at the southern border.

Unfortunately, look, I was a mayor and I was a governor and what you have to understand is that leadership matters and the words that leaders use also matter. When do you a blanket statement that a whole group of people from a continent or people from s-hole countries, that tends to erode the trust necessary for compromise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But that -- but do you agree with me that statement, you know, you can you think it's egregious, you can think it's awful, horrible, whatever -- everybody has their opinion on that. But shouldn't derail the process? Should it be an excuse to hang everything up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'MALLEY",

Look, I have come to expect very, very little from President Trump by way of manners, by way of kuth, by way of treating people with dignity and respect. That's a given. He's not going to change. He's in perfect health supposedly, which means he's only going to get worse. So, that's what we're dealing with right now, and we need to notwithstanding how abusive the president can be and how coarse and what a bad example he is for our kids. We need to find a way to serve the national interests and realize that real people's families hang in the balance here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

That, of course, that's up to you. That's a personal decision. But if you're, you know, the parents of Kate Steinle and you're listening to Democrats say that having supported border security all these years and a stronger fence and a stronger border that now you are not willing to do that, and you'd like to see Republicans have to shut down the government over that issue. Can you imagine how they feel, how their sensibilities are affected by that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'MALLEY",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, absolutely. Look, I have set with families. It's not as if you have a family of all DACA kids or a family. I mean, a lot of families have children who were born in our country who are Americans and they also have kids that are covered by DACA. I mean, this is affecting very real people. I spoke with a little girl, and she was in 8th grade and every day she goes to school thinking when she comes home her family is going to have the doors kicked in and they're going to be gone and she'll be here alone. So, these are real people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

They also want to end the visa lottery system -- a recipient of, which plowed down a whole group of people and killed them on the Westside Highway, not far from where I am right now. Are you on board with that? Would you encourage your fellow Democrats to say, you know what, those are two areas that we should negotiate with the White House and Republicans on?"

So, you heard Ed's set up and you heard the interview. Something happened, Marc, you know, between the group that was congenial at the table on Tuesday. It seems to me that then everybody went back to their corners and they heard, you know, they got an earful from their bases and they say, don't you give in on that, don't you give up on that. And you know, when you get back in there, you better hold your ground and you better fight this thing. So now, we're in a situation where it looks like we're going to have to do another C.R. to get through the funding bill the end of this week and getting nowhere on immigration which looked a little bit promising on Tuesday, at least those in the center."

They want the issue. Because the president of the United States sat there with them and he said not only did he say he wanted to legalize the DREAMERS -- the 800,000 or so of the dreamers. He wanted to go as far as comprehensive immigration reform that would legalize all 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. That is an -- and he said, I'll take the heat for both Democrats and Republicans if we can cut a deal. He wants a wall next change for that; he wants some changes in immigration, but he's willing to go and legalize all 11 million people. That is an extraordinary offer for the Democrats to have."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Much of the media world seems to agree the story told by the woman who calls herself, Grace, about her date with comedian Aziz Ansari, certainly, does not rise to the level of Harvey Weinstein-type misconduct. An op-ed by the Washington Post says the Aziz Ansari tale isn't about a powerful person trying to humiliate and subjugate someone who wants nothing more than to chase their dreams. Instead, quoting, it's about a date that went badly. One that did not live up to the expectations of the woman involved. Caitlin Flanagan of the Atlantic went further calling the woman's story, quote, 3,000 words of revenge porn. Intended not to validate her account as much as it is to hurt and humiliate Ansari. But critics wondered if the woman is guilty of trying to hurt Ansari or simply guilty of bad timing. In other words, would she have been as roundly criticized at the height of the Me Too Movement? For example, three months ago when the Huffington Post seemed to cast aspersions on all men saying this about Me Too, quoting, the social media campaign is, of course, intended as a wake-up call for men. If every woman you know has been harassed or assaulted, then every man you know has likely made a woman feel unsafe. And it should be noted that not everyone is giving Ansari a pass. An L.A. Time opinion contributor tweeted, quote, I was finally able to read the account of the date with Aziz Ansari from the described events he appears to have no understanding whatsoever of sexual consent nor do his defenders, it seems. That said, the Me Too narrative is now consistently being challenged. Actress Catherine Deneuve denounced the movement because she believes people who did not deserve to be condemned are facing the same consequences as sex offenders. And former secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, offered this, watch."

You just mentioned the standard that all women must be believed. There's this other standard where the only thing that you have to worry about is whether a woman feels uncomfortable. And these were the judgments that we were using to determine whether we should take part in the Me Too panic. It was a panic. And it was this attempt to like come up with some kind of sexual morality after we have thrown off all objective sexual morality and it's clearly not going so well. I mean, these are not good ways to govern our behavior even if it's true that men and women should think about forming relationships before they have sex."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That's a novel idea. Ben, you wrote about this quite a bit, and you talked about her assertion that he should have picked up on her nonverbal cues.

    {
      "speaker": "BEN SHAPIRO, DAILY WIRE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, there was nonverbal cues that were given including getting completely naked in his apartment and performing sex acts multiple times on him. If I were Aziz Ansari I would be thinking that's a pretty solid nonverbal cue that you might be into things. I mean, I had a hard time believing that she really expects Aziz Ansari than anyone from Me Too expects men to be mind-readers. This is the problem. It's one thing to say that we should believe women about objective verifiable facts, or even just objective views of what happened. You know, my hand went here, and then my head went here, you know, that kind of stuff. But when you're talking about we have to believe all women's subjective perceptions of events that are often very messy, that are very confusing, that are very chaotic, and in which the feelings conflict in one person. Forget about both people. It conflicts for a woman. I mean, this woman was enthusiastic at the beginning of the date, by the next morning she was talking about how terrible it was. Is it the job for men to now decide when women are capable of consent? I thought the entire purpose of the feminist movement was to say that women are supposed to be mistresses of own consent. That it's not up to men to say, listen, I don't think it's possible for you to get consent right now. I don't think that sex is in your best interest, and I don't think that we ought to be doing this. That would be man explaining to a woman presumably. So, I guess, men are caught between the rock and hard place of -- if we say no and the woman actually is giving nonverbal cues that say yes then we're man-splaining. But if she's giving nonverbal cues that we think say yes, but she thinks says no, then, I guess, we're guilty of what? Sexual assault or sexual abuse?"

And the other one is also -- it's something we had in our kit bag once before but we got rid of it a number of years ago, it's a sea based cruise missile that has a nuclear tip on it. What's happening is our adversaries are going back and buying these, sort of, tactical lower yield nuclear weapons and adding them to their arsenal. They're theory is that they're going to use those capabilities to end the conflict to their favor. That's a conventional conflict that may not be going well and then they would use that and terminate the war. And they also believe that given we don't have that capability, the alternative for us is to use a major strategic bomb, which would be disproportionate in terms of what the casualty outcome would be. And they think they can hold us in check. So that's why we're developing the capability."

The reality is that we got rid of all of that. But, we had those weapons and our adversaries had those weapons. And what we believe is that if our adversaries have low to high nuclear weapons we should have it as well because it is deterrent. For 40 plus years that deterrent worked. The critics of this believe that if our adversaries have lower yield weapons and we have lower yield weapons, then we're more prone to use them. But the evidence does not support that after 45 years of the cold war and no nuclear exchange ever. And the other thing, we've got to remember, it's important for our audience, those nuclear weapons that we had all during the cold war didn't just prevent nuclear war, it prevented the most likely outcome which was a war in Europe between Russians and NATO, or the Soviet Union and NATA, and that prevented a conventional war.

You know, I think, he's probably been that way his whole life. It's probably one of the reasons why he's been successful. He's just one of those people, I think, that just does not require a lot of sleep. I told the president if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old. I don't know."

President Trump, he said was blessed with great genes, you heard him, and excellent health, physically and mentally. An assessment that was dramatically different from what we heard from author, Michael Wolff, who questioned President Trump's mental fitness."

      "utterance": "That was interesting this afternoon. It went on for about an hour. And the doctor claimed that the president wanted to have the cognitive part of the test. Can you explain what the, sort of, the strategy behind this whole appearance was this afternoon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Look, I think for President Trump, this was a matter of transparency. This was allowing his physician to come out and talk about the fact that he is fit for duty. And, quite frankly, Martha, I have an opportunity to engage with the president. I see him in action every day where he's talking to his policy advisors, asking the tough questions. Very engaged as to what's happening day in and day out. And directing the staff of what needs to be done from a policy perspective. What we have seen is that Democrats have decided to play this game, this narrative talking about mental fitness instead of actually doing the work of the people and governing. And that's where President Trump, actually, is stand strong on that as our leader and really focusing on what we need to be doing, which is that of pushing forward economic success as we've seen this past year with the passage of the tax cut law benefiting millions of American families. And really honing in on his agenda which, as we know, President Trump is producing results."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I thought it was very interesting window into -- in some ways the personality of the president and what makes him tick. And I felt when the doctor said, you know, he was asked about how he deals with stress. And he said he doesn't really seem stressed out to me very often. He said and my office is right across from his. I thought it was hysterical when he said he doesn't even stop in for a band aid. He kind of likes to self- monitor his health. But he says when he's dealing with pressures of the office he's pretty good at waking up in the morning and re-setting, which I found very interesting. Do you have any thoughts on that theory?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, you have to understand, I mean, President Trump has been a success his whole life. You know, going back to being a successful businessman, to being successful on television as a -- really pioneering reality TV. And then, winning the presidency the first time and really taking on a role which is the toughest job in America. And this president has embraced it. He understands the challenges that come with it. And one thing that he has done here in Washington is that he actually reset the way politics run here. He expects results from congress. He expects results from his cabinet members. And that's why he's such a successful president. And that's why he actually is that political genius that we have a chance to see day in and day out."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Why the focus on this today, you know, with the tax reform bill, it's very interesting the numbers that they put out there, the increase in growth in small businesses that are run by women, Mercedes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, this is such an important message that we want to amplify and share with American women throughout this country. In so many of us who are out there working day in and day out are hard-working women who basically are the ones that balance the checkbooks, that are the ones focused on their kids' education, that are the ones really being the heart and soul of their families. And so, I think it was an important message to send because of the fact for President Trump, not only does he have these incredible women in power in his cabinet, as well as Ivanka and his wife Melania who plays such an important role, but to share the economic success story of President Trump and what his team is working on."

But he says they have a lot more questions and that Mr. Bannon will be returning. He was issued an on the spot subpoena today to answer questions about his time at the White House. So here is tonight's quote, it comes from Sandy who quotes Voltaire. What is tolerance? It is the consequence of humanity. We are all form of frailty and error, let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly. That's the first law of nature. Email us your favorite quote at \"The Story\" at foxnews.com. That's The Story.
