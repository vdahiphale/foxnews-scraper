They'll hurt Georgia. So, the blowback against this is growing, which forced even liberal Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff to put out a statement last night saying, \"I absolutely oppose and reject any notion of boycotting Georgia.\" But then he said that look, corporations that are disgusted, like we are with this voter suppression bill, should stop any financial support for the Georgia Republican Party.

Here's a question for Ms. Abrams: if Georgia really is trying to resurrect the evils of Jim Crow and segregation, then how could businesses remain there in good conscience?

It would destroy Georgia's businesses and actually could destroy her own political future. Thus, it was no surprise to see the White House on a cleanup mission after Biden's boycott blunder. Maybe they got a call from Stacey Abrams as well. One unnamed Senior Advisor insisted that Biden's endorsement of a boycott, well, it wasn't really an endorsement of a boycott. He was speaking from the heart. That was him. The adviser said for him, it's not dictating what the MLB - Major League Baseball - should be doing, but he supports the decisions of the players. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But we all know what this is really about. This is about bullying corporations into supporting Nancy Pelosi's massive election rigging scheme called H.R.1. The measures would override all state voting prerogatives and ensure a permanent Democrat majority from coast to coast. This would actually invalidate the votes of 10s of millions of Americans through nationalized ballot harvesting, the elimination of voter ID requirements and a lot more. But the good news is, Texas is now following in George's footsteps. Yesterday, the State Senate passed voter integrity measures of its own. Well, and what happened then? Well, predictively, Dallas based American Airlines and Dell Computer they've already announced their opposition to the commonsense bill. That's a really dumb move on their part. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And going forward, I'm going to say this - I'm trying to say this every night going forward, every Republican lawmaker, not just in Georgia or Texas, but beyond, should put these companies on notice.

And if these big corporations think they're going to get better results with Democrats in charge of all 50 states, good luck with that. All right. Joining me now is Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, you see what's happening. These corporations are just petrified. It reminds me of what they did during the BLM riots of last summer. They all just fell in line.

And we actually had more early voting days added, so easier to vote, but you vote in person. And there is a difference between in-person and by mail. By mail should be the exception to the rule, and only for those who can't show up in person, because it's much easier to verify who someone is if they show up in person. There's nothing Jim Crow about this. In fact, what is very insulting, and really just gets to me is they're implying that people of certain races are not able to comply with rules, show up, or have a driver's license or figure this out.

So, we want to make sure that we're able to see what's going on when they're counting the ballots. And if there are irregularities, record them, why would that be a problem?

Plus, come on, it's \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo. But first, whoops! Well, it turns out that bowing down to the social justice warriors really is a dangerous and self-defeating strategy. Case in point. Democrats' lies about Georgia's voter integrity law, equating it to Jim Crow, well, it sends an all sorts of Far Left activists down the boycott Georgia warpath, including, well, that fringe figure that guy, President Joe Biden.

They'll hurt Georgia. So, the blowback against this is growing, which forced even liberal Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff to put out a statement last night saying, \"I absolutely oppose and reject any notion of boycotting Georgia.\" But then he said that look, corporations that are disgusted, like we are with this voter suppression bill, should stop any financial support for the Georgia Republican Party. And then Stacey Abrams, the mastermind behind the fraudulent attack on Georgia's voter ID law, also has been caught in a trap of her own making."

Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American voters whose votes are most suppressed under SB 202 are also the most likely to be hurt by potential boycotts of Georgia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, none of this makes any sense. OK. Here's a question for Ms. Abrams: if Georgia really is trying to resurrect the evils of Jim Crow and segregation, then how could businesses remain there in good conscience? Shouldn't everyone, even the low-income voters, citizens have to sacrifice to force Georgia businesses to get in line here and force the state legislature to do what they should do? Well, what happens is Abrams sees where all this is leading. It would destroy Georgia's businesses and actually could destroy her own political future. Thus, it was no surprise to see the White House on a cleanup mission after Biden's boycott blunder. Maybe they got a call from Stacey Abrams as well. One unnamed Senior Advisor insisted that Biden's endorsement of a boycott, well, it wasn't really an endorsement of a boycott. He was speaking from the heart. That was him. The adviser said for him, it's not dictating what the MLB - Major League Baseball - should be doing, but he supports the decisions of the players. But we all know what this is really about. This is about bullying corporations into supporting Nancy Pelosi's massive election rigging scheme called H.R.1. The measures would override all state voting prerogatives and ensure a permanent Democrat majority from coast to coast. This would actually invalidate the votes of 10s of millions of Americans through nationalized ballot harvesting, the elimination of voter ID requirements and a lot more. But the good news is, Texas is now following in George's footsteps. Yesterday, the State Senate passed voter integrity measures of its own. Well, and what happened then? Well, predictively, Dallas based American Airlines and Dell Computer they've already announced their opposition to the commonsense bill. That's a really dumb move on their part. And going forward, I'm going to say this - I'm trying to say this every night going forward, every Republican lawmaker, not just in Georgia or Texas, but beyond, should put these companies on notice. A lot of them, by the way, do plenty of business in China, as we pointed out. They have no problem with that. But you side with the vote riggers who are lying about these reforms, and you will lose every tax break, every incentive every credit going forward. And if these big corporations think they're going to get better results with Democrats in charge of all 50 states, good luck with that. All right. Joining me now is Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, you see what's happening. These corporations are just petrified. It reminds me of what they did during the BLM riots of last summer. They all just fell in line. But how dangerous is this, given what we've already seen in Georgia, and now in Texas for them?"

      "utterance": "What's amazing to me that the head of Delta, the head of Coca-Cola, they don't even bother to read the bills. In fact, in Texas, they admitted they didn't even read the bills at all. All of these proposals are to try to make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat. I've been involved with this. I've communicated with people in all 50 state legislators, I've called them on the phone, I've talked to the conservative ALEC group about this, and we've now passed it in Kentucky. And we actually had more early voting days added, so easier to vote, but you vote in person. And there is a difference between in-person and by mail. By mail should be the exception to the rule, and only for those who can't show up in person, because it's much easier to verify who someone is if they show up in person. There's nothing Jim Crow about this. In fact, what is very insulting, and really just gets to me is they're implying that people of certain races are not able to comply with rules, show up, or have a driver's license or figure this out. And I think that's very racist in they're thinking that they're certain groups of our people who are incapable of following basic rules. I don't think it's true. I think the trend lines for all the different races voting have been good in our country for 20 or 30 years. And all these election bills do is try to make it easier to vote, but harder to cheat."

So, we want to make sure that we're able to see what's going on when they're counting the ballots. And if there are irregularities, record them, why would that be a problem?

Because here's the thing, Coca-Cola is now telling people to apologize for being white, apologize for being arrogant, apologize for all these things, supposedly, that white people are doing and that's a very racist sort of philosophy. It's this woke sort of critical race theory. But it's now infected a publicly traded company. And when they start saying things like that, they're actually going against what their mandate is. Their mandate is to maximize profit. But they're - now they're turning off 40 percent of the country who don't really want to be woke up and told that we're horrible people, and don't believe that there is horrible racism in our country. It's been getting better generation after generation. And yet Coca-Cola wants to make us all feel like race is a predominant thing in everyone's live. And if you're white, you're somehow guilty or evil. And that's a kind of a crazy philosophy for a mainstream company to get. that wants to sell products to all of us.

I mean, just as recently as 2003, there was a case in D.C., where the Department of Defense was barred from forcing an anthrax vaccine on the troops, because it was experimental, which is the exact circumstance that we have here and yet they seem to be ignoring all of this law. Laura, these vaccine passport proposals violate the right to travel under the Constitution. They violate our right or privacy, they violate equal protection. They violate due process, and they may even violate the First Amendment to the extent that a decision to get vaccinated is an expressive activity. So, I don't see how these survive, even if it is in the private sector. And in the private sector itself, there are civil rights statutes in the states as well as statutes that bar private parties from conspiring with the government to violate your civil rights that can be used to prevent companies from discriminating against people on the basis of a suspect classification like this."

We don't need the government's permission to do basic things. The Constitution protects those rights. And so this is going to be fought at every level by my organization \"Center for American Liberty,\" as well as I'm sure, many other patriots out there. We will not tolerate this because it is a slippery slope. And we're not even getting into the fact that big tech - and you remember that during the beginning parts of this crisis, we had big tech pushing these tracking apps so that you could figure out contact tracing, or you could figure out if you were near somebody who was COVID positive, that was all about getting our data.

And this is really a form of that. This is the government tracing you, tracking you and barring your entry and your participation and really forcing this vaccine. This vaccine is - it may have elements that people of faith object to, such as being derived from aborted fetuses. There's so many other reasons why people of faith or people of conscience decide that it's not for them. Even for health reasons, maybe you already had COVID, and you recovered, you had the antibody.

And we'll be discussing that today, and among other things. And one of those other things our administration is a commitment to buy American."

But Trump was enjoying the moment, not the hassle, but he was enjoying it. Biden doesn't look like he's having any fun, and neither are we."

      "utterance": "We can't assume that all of our residents celebrate Easter, so when you are actually talking about Easter eggs, I'm like, like what Marvel has, like Easter eggs in a movie or something, or in a videogame? Even during the holidays, we can't say \"Christmas\" or specific to one religious holiday. We just, we always say holidays just because we have to be inclusive here at Western."
    },

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Have to be inclusive. Western Carolina University says this is not a formal policy. News flash to that housing coordinator, Christmas is a federal holiday. And just because a holiday is religious doesn't mean you can't mention it. I say mention and celebrate all of them, Passover, Easter, the end of Ramadan. Those who want to take part will. The others can stay home in their rooms and watch Marvel movies for all I care. Easter eggs."

All right, fighting for religious freedom on Good Friday, Christian baker Jack Phillips back in the left's crosshairs, but once again, he's not backing down. Shannon Bream breaks it all down, the latest attack on religious liberty coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Three years after scoring a big win for religious liberty in the Supreme Court, Jack Phillips, remember, he was the owner of that Masterpiece Cakeshop, is back in court. This time he's fighting off a predatory lawsuit from a transgendered lawyer who back in 2017 requested a cake to celebrate a gender transition. Phillips, of course, refused and says it was all part of a setup meant to financially destroy his 30-year- old business. Apparently, there is no other bakers in the entire United States. Joining us now, Shannon Bream, anchor of FOX NEWS AT NIGHT and author of the bestselling book -- I love saying that -- \"Women of the Bible Speak.\" Shannon, first of all, congratulations on the book. I'm so happy for you, one of the nicest people, one of the smartest people on television."

      "utterance": "Thank you."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ms. Shannon, I thought of you when this case came back, because it seems like this is just a redux of what we saw before, that he won, the case that he won."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and the thing is, you know, having clerked at the Supreme Court, you know how this works and how this case came down. The fact is he did have a win there, but it didn't settle this underlying legal question that keeps coming up about where the intersection of religious freedom and religious beliefs collide with LGBTQ beliefs and those lives and those rights. So listen, the day that his case was announced it would be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which didn't resolve the underlying question, this individual called the shop and said I want to have a cake that's pink inside, blue outside, and it's going to be a transition gender reveal cake. And they said we don't celebrate those kinds of things, they don't line up with our believers. So then the individual said I would like to order a cake with Satan on it smoking a joint. They also said, no, we won't be making that cake. I talked to Jack Phillips about this last week and his attorney because they are back in court again, and he said, listen, I'm just trying to do my job. I want to use my skills and my talents to make custom creations, but obviously this person was calling for a very specific reason, and that is to take him back to court. And that's where he is, again."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "My goodness. Speaking of the court, Shannon, many on the left are now calling for Justice Steve Breyer to step down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAHLIA LITHWICK, WRITER AT SLATE",
      "utterance": "There has been a lot of pressure, Lawrence, on Justice Stephen Breyer, who is 82, to step down, to step down not today, yesterday, last week, in January, to give up his seat. I think there is a sense that we've all learned a lesson after Ruth Bader Ginsburg."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Shannon, as someone who knows the courts so well what are the chances of this happening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "We hear nothing coming from him or anyone close to him, that he's not continuing to plan and work and keep moving forward. You remember this, though, with Justice Ginsberg, the calls from the left, and there were these pieces, op-ed saying you're doing a disservice to the country, everything that you stand for, you've got to step down now. Her take on it was sort of like you're not going to get somebody qualified and confirmed who would vote the way exactly that I do, and I'm going to stay here as long as I can. Of course, the left is very mad about the way that she left the bench, and President Trump was able to get his third confirmation to the bench. Justice Breyer, though, doesn't seem like he's very worried about the chatter. I don't think he's going anywhere. He doesn't seem like he is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I just love this thinking, this guy has been around for decades, they're going to push him off the court because they are unhappy about something. Now, Shannon, I want to get to your new book, \"Women of the Bible Speak.\" Now, in the book, you write that \"Over and over throughout Scripture, we see God the Father first, and then God in the form of his son Jesus, use people who are not among the top echelons of society as either esteemed religious leaders or aristocratic elites.\" Why, Shannon, was that significant to you, that point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "I love highlighting all these different women in the book, and I want them to be what they are in the Bible, which is relatable and flawed. Some of them are very humble, didn't come from a prominent family or anywhere else. We also included some people who were a little bit naughty and got a little bit off track just to show that God can use everyone. We've got a prostitute in here. We've got a murderer. We've got somebody who double crosses her father-in-law by acting like a prostitute and getting pregnant by him. It's hard for people to believe these stories are in the Bible, but they all had a point, and there is a reason why they are all included. And I just think it's beautiful to see how God works through everyone, whether they are faithful, whether they make a mess and get off track, because we all have those experiences. So I thought it was important to include them."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's all the time we have tonight. But first, I want to just remind all of you, this Easter is a time for renewal and rebirth, hope. Yes, you bet, hope. A lot of people have been demoralized for the last year, but you can't be. We don't have time for that. And Passover ends as well. I hope you were all able to spend time with your family and your friends and continue to remember what matters most -- faith, family, friendship, and you bet, this country. We are going to do everything we can in the coming days and weeks to remind you what really matters, and how to hold the powers that be accountable across the board. Don't be afraid. There's no reason to be. That's all the time we have for this evening for this special edition of THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS AT NIGHT team, they take it all from here.
