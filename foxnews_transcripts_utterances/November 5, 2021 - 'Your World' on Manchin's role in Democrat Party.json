The Pfizer CEO coming up to tell us the magic behind what some are calling a whole new game when it comes to tackling the pandemic. You just take a pill, and your chances of avoiding hospitalizations and even death tumble 90 percent. We are on top of that. And it's a stunning development here that's being echoed around the world. But, in the meantime, what's happening in Washington. If only there were a pill to deal with political anxiety. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And now to growing concern that the progressives and the moderates in the Democratic Party are not seeing eye to eye, this just moments ago from U.S. Democratic congresswoman Jayapal, who is, of course, very big in that Progressive Caucus, saying that: \"If moderates want to wait for a CBO score, progressives are willing to wait to vote on both Build Back Better and the infrastructure bills together.\" I think that's her way of saying, your way or our way, or, well, I don't know, maybe, the highway.

And keep in mind that if the House goes ahead with the infrastructure vote today, they can probably pass it even if they have some attrition of votes on the Democratic side of the aisle, because you have about 15 Republicans who could vote for this in the House of Representatives. Now, this is the plan. We think that there's going to be a vote on the infrastructure bill later today. That is something that they want to do. The Democrats don't have the votes to pass the social spending bill. the House wants to decouple infrastructure from the social spending plan. The left held up passage of infrastructure. Liberal wanted the bills melded together, but the House could show a win by aligning with the Senate and passing infrastructure. Progressives are pushing back on that.

Now, incidentally, although the Democrats don't seem to appreciate it, I think Joe Manchin has saved the Democratic Party from a political disaster if that bill is adopted, because, as we saw in Virginia, to some extent, in New Jersey, people got the message that those programs sounded good.

There's many other elements -- there are many other elements in the legislation. They are very important, very important to the success of our economy.

I call it Build Back Better for women because it makes a big difference in being transformative for women in the workplace. We had hoped to be able to bring both bills to the floor today. Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, but its top line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. So, today, we hoped to pass the BIF and also the rule on Build Back Better, with the idea that, before Thanksgiving -- it should take them another week or so to get the numbers that they are requesting, as -- I don't know. That's how long it takes. And, as we do, then we will have a Thanksgiving gift for the American people.

I believe that the votes today to pass the Build -- infrastructure bill and to provide for a path forward by adopting the rule for the passage of the Build Back Better legislation will be a giant step forward.

I think that what we're about to do is hopefully pass a piece of legislation that will be very transformative to many of our communities. If you look at this bill, the so-called infrastructure bill, we see funding that gets us to about 70 percent of the way with a 100 percent bill out for broadband in our country. That, to me, is very, very important. You're not going to be able to have the kind of medical care that we need unless we have telehealth and telemedicine. You're not going to have the adequate education for our children unless there's online learning. That has to take place. And rural businesses are not going to be able to thrive unless they have just-in-time delivery of their services and their products. So, broadband alone was a big, big deal for me. But if you look at the communities that I represent, rural communities, many of them, these communities with this bill get the water and the sewage kind of development that is needed to make these communities attractive for future growth and development. This bill gets us a long ways down that road, and not to mention what it does for our ports. The Charleston Port is in my district. Our ports. When you see a state like South Carolina building, and now we do more tires in South Carolina than they do in Ohio. And we have got Mercedes-Benz. Their Sprinter is made in North Charleston. Volvo, and these plants, BMW, they have got to have the ability to get these products out. So, this bill, this infrastructure bill is huge for my state and the community that I represent. And then that gets us to the rule on Build Back Better. And in Build Back Better, the reason we have got to have that bill is because that's where so much of what we need for families to get to where they need to be, for the communities to get to where they need to be. Just take, for instance, children in that bill is where we made it permanent for another year the tax credits for children, tax reductions, I call it, for families with children. These things are very, very important, not to mention the other parts of the family that are taken care of in that bill. And so when I think of what we have got to do for the cost of pharmaceuticals, I have to use -- I try to use the word pharmaceuticals, rather than the drugs. The cost of pharmaceuticals, the cost there, it's in Build Back Better. And so I think that there's strong support, if not unanimous support, in our caucus for Build Back Better. And so today, for us to do the infrastructure bill, give the president this bill to sign, so that he can keep the job growth that we just heard about this morning moving forward, that is a huge deal for us. And then we will go on to do the rule, so we can go home and await these final numbers coming from wherever they have got to come from and do what we need to do to pass that bill sometime out into the future. And I will let the speaker tell us when that will be.",

      "sentences": "What you're seeing right now are the fractures inside the Democratic Caucus and the challenge of governing when you only have a three-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi, she has these disparate wings of her caucus, the liberals, the moderates, here and ne'er the twain shall meet. And this is where, when you have just three votes, you need to get everybody on the same page when you're trying to do big things. It's obvious that the moderates were very displeased with trying to go ahead and vote today without a final price tag on this bill from the Congressional Budget Office. And I have been told just in the past few minutes that there's a coalition of the progressive members who say that they will not vote for the infrastructure bill if they put that on the floor because those bills are not riding together. Remember that that was the demand of the progressives. And this is where Nancy Pelosi said, well, we will find out. Keep in mind that you do have some Republicans, anywhere from nine to 15 Republicans, who could make up the difference. This is all about the math, as I always say here, if you have a significant number of Democratic defections. Or do some of those Republicans, kind of in a Machiavellian way, perhaps see that here's an opportunity to give Democrats a loss and withdraw their support? I mean, Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, indicated earlier today that he didn't think that this would help any of those Republicans running in 2022. So that's very significant there. Again, so here's the timing. What they have to do is, they're going to have a pre-debate, a pre-debate to set up the parameters -- this is called the rule in the House of Representatives - - on the social spending bill. They're not going to put that piece of legislation the floor. Then they would vote on infrastructure. Remember that the House of Representatives did everything that they had to do several weeks ago on this bill. The Senate approves that piece of legislation in early August. So, if the House passes that bill, those two bills are in alignment and can go to the president for his signature. Now, again, here's the other problem you start to run into from a timing and a schedule perspective. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, indicated that he wanted to start debate in his chamber on the 15th of November. You heard Steny Hoyer say that maybe we will pass the social spending plan the week of November 15 and then get this done by Thanksgiving. If you're waiting for the House to get this done, the Senate is going to take a lot longer to get this done. This slams you right up against Thanksgiving. And if you have problems there, well, here's the other thing that you're staring at, December 3. That is the date that the government is scheduled to shut down, that they run out of money and also hit the debt ceiling. So, Neil, we have talked about this many times before. Maybe what they do is glom all of these issues together. But, again, Democrats have been very resistant about talking about deadlines. We had the president come to the Capitol in late September. We thought there was going to be a vote then. They did not. He went away and it sat out there for a month. He came a little more than a week ago, thought there was going to be a vote then. We thought we might be here all weekend. Nothing there. The longer that you let these bills sit out there -- as I always say, it's kind of like houseguests and fish. People start to find more problems. By the same token, they start to ripen. Sometimes, people say, OK, I really want to vote for this bill. There is kind of the parliamentary equivalent of the Stockholm Syndrome. If you keep everybody here over a period of time...",

The Democrats don't have the votes to pass the social spending bill. the House wants to decouple infrastructure from the social spending plan. The left held up passage of infrastructure. Liberal wanted the bills melded together, but the House could show a win by aligning with the Senate and passing infrastructure. Progressives are pushing back on that.

We know that he spent most of his afternoon, though, at the memorial service for the late Colin Powell. And he also said very confidently earlier today that he was going to come out and answer questions after the House passed these bills. It's not clear if they're going to pass a bill or just a rule, like Chad was talking about. It's not clear if any of this is even going to happen today.

That's a better way to think about this, because the White House can't even confirm if the two of them have talked today. The president also is saying two different things about the better-than-expected jobs report earlier. He's saying that's proof that the plan is working, but that means that the plan is working without these plans. And he's saying the only way to continue economic recovery is to spend a few trillion taxpayer dollars more. What's going to happen? Will we see him again?

Well, the figure they're bouncing around for this spending package, as you're looking in Washington, not too far outside Nancy Pelosi, the speaker's office there. It's about a $2 trillion package, give or take, I don't know, a couple of hundred billion. But the fact of the matter is, as things stand right now, it could be a lot pricier than that. Wharton has just completed an examination of the whole thing and said it could easily be double that. Let's get the read from the guy who crunched the numbers, Kent Smetters. He's the Wharton Budget Model faculty director. Professor, thank you for joining us. How did you come up with the much, much higher number?"

But we have been asked by members of Congress, what would happen if some of the temporary spending provisions were made more permanent, such as child tax credit? And that's where, under this alternative, illustrative scenario, we estimate that total spending would be about $4.26 trillion, so more than double over the next decade."

And we issued that brief last week that compared on a line-item basis our numbers vs. the White House. And so we just have different numbers. And that is a disagreement about how much each item would bring in. And that comes down to some of the tax provisions, as well as some of the spending offsets. So, for example, on IRS enforcement, they deduct a much larger number than we project."

Traditionally, IRS funding would not be scored under the assumption that people are supposed to pay their taxes anyway. But -- so our number is bigger than what CBO would produce based on previous practice."

He always -- he may be more liberal on some things, conservative on others, but he's always moving to the center to try to bring different opinions together to get something done. And that's exactly what the government in Washington needs now, instead of all the catcalling and attack and counterattack. I think Joe Manchin has single-handedly saved the republic from the adoption of some legislation that will cost taxpayers a lot and probably increase the debt, hasn't been able to consider it. I mean that social service entitlement, the second bill being considered in the House. Now, incidentally, although the Democrats don't seem to appreciate it, I think Joe Manchin has saved the Democratic Party from a political disaster if that bill is adopted, because, as we saw in Virginia, to some extent, in New Jersey, people got the message that those programs sounded good. Somebody was going to have to pay for them. And it was going to be the taxpayer."

For broadband to help people communicate better, whether it's distance learning, telemedicine or commerce, or just family relations. There's many other elements -- there are many other elements in the legislation. They are very important, very important to the success of our economy. But in order to Build Back Better, we wanted to do that and pass the Build Back Better bill. I call it Build Back Better for women because it makes a big difference in being transformative for women in the workplace. We had hoped to be able to bring both bills to the floor today. Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, but its top line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. So, today, we hoped to pass the BIF and also the rule on Build Back Better, with the idea that, before Thanksgiving -- it should take them another week or so to get the numbers that they are requesting, as -- I don't know. That's how long it takes. And, as we do, then we will have a Thanksgiving gift for the American people. I do want to thank the Black -- Congressional Black Caucus for the creative alternative that they presented today that advances the agenda, but does -- to do so in a way that, again, is historic and transformative.

These two bills will make, as the president says, a generational change for our country. I believe that the votes today to pass the Build -- infrastructure bill and to provide for a path forward by adopting the rule for the passage of the Build Back Better legislation will be a giant step forward. And I am absolutely convinced beyond a doubt that, before Thanksgiving, the week of the 15th, we will pass the Build Back Better legislation. All members of our caucus have indicated they are for BIF.

I think that what we're about to do is hopefully pass a piece of legislation that will be very transformative to many of our communities. If you look at this bill, the so-called infrastructure bill, we see funding that gets us to about 70 percent of the way with a 100 percent bill out for broadband in our country. That, to me, is very, very important. You're not going to be able to have the kind of medical care that we need unless we have telehealth and telemedicine. You're not going to have the adequate education for our children unless there's online learning. That has to take place. And rural businesses are not going to be able to thrive unless they have just-in-time delivery of their services and their products. So, broadband alone was a big, big deal for me. But if you look at the communities that I represent, rural communities, many of them, these communities with this bill get the water and the sewage kind of development that is needed to make these communities attractive for future growth and development. This bill gets us a long ways down that road, and not to mention what it does for our ports. The Charleston Port is in my district. Our ports. When you see a state like South Carolina building, and now we do more tires in South Carolina than they do in Ohio. And we have got Mercedes-Benz. Their Sprinter is made in North Charleston. Volvo, and these plants, BMW, they have got to have the ability to get these products out. So, this bill, this infrastructure bill is huge for my state and the community that I represent. And then that gets us to the rule on Build Back Better. And in Build Back Better, the reason we have got to have that bill is because that's where so much of what we need for families to get to where they need to be, for the communities to get to where they need to be. Just take, for instance, children in that bill is where we made it permanent for another year the tax credits for children, tax reductions, I call it, for families with children. These things are very, very important, not to mention the other parts of the family that are taken care of in that bill. And so when I think of what we have got to do for the cost of pharmaceuticals, I have to use -- I try to use the word pharmaceuticals, rather than the drugs. The cost of pharmaceuticals, the cost there, it's in Build Back Better. And so I think that there's strong support, if not unanimous support, in our caucus for Build Back Better. And so today, for us to do the infrastructure bill, give the president this bill to sign, so that he can keep the job growth that we just heard about this morning moving forward, that is a huge deal for us. And then we will go on to do the rule, so we can go home and await these final numbers coming from wherever they have got to come from and do what we need to do to pass that bill sometime out into the future.

I don't tell anything what people tell me, not even you, my dear good friends, but I have a pretty good feeling."

We have not had this level of progress in terms of where we are on build back, the BIF, bipartisan infrastructure framework, what we call the job creation legislation, and the opportunity to have a path to Build Back Better for women, and for women because there's so much in there that is liberating for women, women in the workplace, and dads, too, who have home responsibilities, whether it's child care, whether it's eldercare and home health care, whether it's children learning, parents earning, with the -- again, the child tax credit that helps pay the bills. But in so many ways -- and, of course, we're very proud of the fact that, in this legislation, we have the opportunity for people in the 12 states that did not embrace the Affordable -- the Medicaid provisions in the Affordable Care Act to be taken under the Affordable Care Act. This is transformational. And everything I mentioned, everything I mentioned is supported by Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema, everything that I just mentioned. There's some things that they may add, subtract or whatever. But 99 -- over 90 percent of the bill was built House, Senate, White House. So, if there are a couple of things at the end that are different, we will deal with those. But this is, again, transformative, historic.

We have heard as well from a number of other key players in the Progressive Caucus that it's either together or none.\" That certainly is the kind of sentiment they're relaying here. So to Chad Pergram now and the significance of all of this, and what, if anything, we can expect today, tonight. What do you think, Chad?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "What you're seeing right now are the fractures inside the Democratic Caucus and the challenge of governing when you only have a three-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi, she has these disparate wings of her caucus, the liberals, the moderates, here and ne'er the twain shall meet. And this is where, when you have just three votes, you need to get everybody on the same page when you're trying to do big things. It's obvious that the moderates were very displeased with trying to go ahead and vote today without a final price tag on this bill from the Congressional Budget Office. And I have been told just in the past few minutes that there's a coalition of the progressive members who say that they will not vote for the infrastructure bill if they put that on the floor because those bills are not riding together. Remember that that was the demand of the progressives. And this is where Nancy Pelosi said, well, we will find out. Keep in mind that you do have some Republicans, anywhere from nine to 15 Republicans, who could make up the difference. This is all about the math, as I always say here, if you have a significant number of Democratic defections. Or do some of those Republicans, kind of in a Machiavellian way, perhaps see that here's an opportunity to give Democrats a loss and withdraw their support? I mean, Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, indicated earlier today that he didn't think that this would help any of those Republicans running in 2022. So that's very significant there. Again, so here's the timing. What they have to do is, they're going to have a pre-debate, a pre-debate to set up the parameters -- this is called the rule in the House of Representatives - - on the social spending bill. They're not going to put that piece of legislation the floor. Then they would vote on infrastructure. Remember that the House of Representatives did everything that they had to do several weeks ago on this bill. The Senate approves that piece of legislation in early August. So, if the House passes that bill, those two bills are in alignment and can go to the president for his signature. Now, again, here's the other problem you start to run into from a timing and a schedule perspective. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, indicated that he wanted to start debate in his chamber on the 15th of November. You heard Steny Hoyer say that maybe we will pass the social spending plan the week of November 15 and then get this done by Thanksgiving. If you're waiting for the House to get this done, the Senate is going to take a lot longer to get this done. This slams you right up against Thanksgiving. And if you have problems there, well, here's the other thing that you're staring at, December 3. That is the date that the government is scheduled to shut down, that they run out of money and also hit the debt ceiling. So, Neil, we have talked about this many times before. Maybe what they do is glom all of these issues together. But, again, Democrats have been very resistant about talking about deadlines. We had the president come to the Capitol in late September. We thought there was going to be a vote then. They did not. He went away and it sat out there for a month. He came a little more than a week ago, thought there was going to be a vote then. We thought we might be here all weekend. Nothing there. The longer that you let these bills sit out there -- as I always say, it's kind of like houseguests and fish. People start to find more problems. By the same token, they start to ripen. Sometimes, people say, OK, I really want to vote for this bill. There is kind of the parliamentary equivalent of the Stockholm Syndrome. If you keep everybody here over a period of time..."

But you keep people here trudging through the same trenches day after day after day, somebody cries uncle and they say, OK, let's just vote for this and get out of here. If they were to stay here this weekend -- apparently, they don't think that's the case. They don't have the votes on that. And you're not going to get a CBO score for at least a week, week-and-a-half. So that's why it's not worth their time to burn the effort over the weekend here and maybe vote the first of the week, Monday, Sunday, Tuesday, some combination thereof, Neil."

I don't know how you guys feel about the politics of all of this, but just think if miraculous drugs had to come to the market the same way that they get things done or presumably try to get done in Washington. I don't think there would be available now the potential of a pill to deal with COVID. Pfizer's CEO on getting that done and what it could mean now -- after this."

      "utterance": "A pill to treat COVID. Now, Merck already has one out there, but along comes Pfizer with one that could be at least twice as effective.

      "speaker": "DR. ALBERT BOURLA, CEO, PFIZER",
      "utterance": "The efficacy of this oral pill, it is 90 percent. And the study was performed in one of the most challenging populations. All of them, they had COVID, but, in addition to COVID, they had comorbidities, either obesity, or cardiovascular diseases, pneumonias, heavy smokers, et cetera. And the results were almost 90 percent. That means that, instead of 10 people of this population going into hospitals and ICUs, only one will go. Imagine the difference, not only for the health care system, but also for the individuals. The treatment was done at home, because these are pills. So this is really a game-changer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "You take the -- it is 10 pills. You take two pills, one morning and one pill in the evening, for five days. And there's an additional pill that you take once a day, so three pills per day in reality."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, at the first sign of symptoms, is that when you should take this, or can it be after that? How would you describe who benefits from this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "The study saw that it worked extremely well even a bit later. So, we had 89 percent effectiveness for people that they got -- they started the treatment within three days that have been diagnosed. But when we expanded that to five days of being diagnosed, the efficacy was 85 percent, so very relevant, very similar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, what if you have already been vaccinated, Doctor? Is there a benefit to this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "I think the -- one, vaccine -- vaccines are made to protect people not to get disease, and people should not confuse the two. People should get vaccinated. And they should be able to protect themselves and their families by doing that, because, otherwise, they can spread the disease. But there is a percentage that will not be vaccinated. And there is always big numbers that are -- right now they are having COVID every day in the United States. So, this is a wonderful tool, medical tool, in the hands of the doctors to keep those people alive, to start with, but also out of the hospitals. So, it is a significant difference. And because, before, all treatments were injectables, you had basically to go to hospital or in a very supervised medical environment to get the treatment. Now you can do it at home. Very big difference."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, just to be clear, Doctor, I mean, normally, if you test positive for COVID, as I was a couple of weeks ago, for example, they put you on a -- and I was fully vaccinated, with your vaccination, as a matter of fact, and it would have been a lot worse had I not been. I understand that. But the immediate treatment with monoclonal antibodies, that sort of thing, how does your pill deal with breakthrough cases or those who are close to them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "Yes. First of all, as with all things, the doctors should examine the individual and make a decision as to which is the best course of treatment. But how the pills are designed to work, it is that, once you are diagnosed with COVID, instead of going -- what you are doing, you are taking the pills at home, so you will not end up in the hospital. Usually, the monoclonal antibodies or other injectable treatments, they need to be administered at hospital."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Would this pill be available to kids?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "No, we started the pill from adults 18 years of age and above. And we have two other studies that are ongoing right now. One, it is in standard risk. These are people that do not have comorbidities, and some of them also are vaccinated and they have breakthrough cases. But, also, we tested in another study for protecting the household members of someone who will get the disease. So, if someone gets the disease, you give not only the pills to him, but also you give the pills to the people living with him at home, so that we prevent them getting the disease. So, we will see how those studies will work. But, so far, all three studies are 18 years and above."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

And we are going to file these results likely before Thanksgiving to the FDA and to the European authorities, Japan authorities, Canada authorities, et cetera. The other two studies, they are continuing enrolling, the -- in standard risk and in household contacts. And they should give us results in the first quarter."

    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",

I expect, actually, the others, it's way easier to be able to demonstrate the results. Here, it was the most difficult."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Could you give me an idea, Doctor, assuming everything goes OK, and you get the kind of approval you're looking for, about the rollout of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that, one, it is regulatory approvals. And those, I can't speak about how long FDA will take. But I can tell you that we will submit before the end of the month, likely before Thanksgiving. Then it's up to them to give the approval. I suspect that they will do it quickly, so sometime in December. We will have already this year a few million pills manufactured. I think it should be in less than -- around, let's say, two million pills, around 200,000 courses, because we have 10 pills, as I said, per treatment. And we should be able next year, in year 2022, we are gearing to produce 500 million pills, which is 50 million treatments. All of that is because we have invested at risk without knowing if we had a product or not, and we started manufacturing almost six months ago. But, right now, now that we know that not only we have a pill, but we have a very effective pill, so we are revisiting our forecast as to how many doses the world might need. So, we will try to see how we can increase even further the 500 million pills, 50 million treatments, that we are planning to manufacture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "The cost is -- again, we are negotiating with governments, but it will be way less than the antibodies, I think should be less than half of the antibodies, the cost."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, the monoclonal antibody treatment that's available to people now, this would be dramatically less than that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOURLA",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Dr. Albert Bourla, the head of Pfizer, the CEO there, on the remarkable development today. If it pans out, along with Merck also getting U.K. approval for its pill to treat COVID, it is a big-game changer. For example, take a look what it did alone today to Pfizer's stock. It was up better than 10 percent here. That's another $30 billion in market value, Pfizer a very dominant player in this entire COVID relief arena, including a vaccine just approved for kids as young as 5 and a treatment with booster shots that is now all the rage. So, a stunning development all the way across the board, so stunning it was among the reasons that all three stock market averages raced to new highs today. Now, that very, very strong employment report where we found that more than half-a-million Americans found jobs, didn't hurt. But this one sealed the deal. That'll do it.
