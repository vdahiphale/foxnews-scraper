This poverty center has loads of it -- a $320 million endowment -- and chucks almost 20 percent of it into offshore equities. Cayman Island stuff. I don't understand it. So, this poverty group sits on a pile of offshore dough. That is like a personal trainer with a gut or a priest with a harem.

And that's why they were so many Republicans who came out and so strongly admonished the President for his careless comments after Charlottesville. Because it's such a sensitive issue. Particularly a lot of the lawmakers from the South for whom it is an ongoing issue from their childhood and, you know, their ancestry. But having said that, the President wants DACA to pass. And I think that shows that we do have some complex issues in immigration. A lot of people want the wall. Most people, the vast majority of people want the Dreamers to be able to stay here.

I mean, he's the one who has talked about murdering and thieves. He is the one that said the judge who was a Mexican heritage could not be an arbiter in his case. So, he has some history here that loads the deck. I don't know that if it applies to every Republican but I think in this case, people are saying, hey, what's with Trump and these Mexicans? Why does he have this kind of hard edge to it? People say, well, it really speaks to his base today.

It makes no sense. There is Hirsi Ali, a black feminist who protest against genital mutilation. SPLC placed her name in a guide to anti-Muslim extremists. So, that's extreme? Being against genital mutilation? I wonder what they would make of Gandhi. But that's not the funny part. It's the money. This poverty center has loads of it -- a $320 million endowment -- and chucks almost 20 percent of it into offshore equities. Cayman Island stuff. I don't understand it. So, this poverty group sits on a pile of offshore dough. That is like a personal trainer with a gut or a priest with a harem. The center paid out $20 million in salaries in 2015, but provided just 61 grand in legal assistance. So, the Southern Poverty Law Center appears to have no poverty and do virtually no law.

I don't know, filthy rich and linked to violence? I think the SPLC might end up have to put itself on its own list. Indeed. Jesse. It's a pretty amazing story.

It looked like they looked at the Clinton foundation and they sort of mirror one another. The labeling is very suggestive.

We have some very strong winds and rain but I don't think we've seen the worst of it. Here's what will happen over the next day or so. Going to get pummeled by category 5 storm. We will see that towards the Bahamas and after that is where we start have a lot of questions. We still unfortunately have a lot of questions. This takes us towards Saturday and then we know it's going to make a right-hand turn, where that happens, we still can't say. There looks to be a little bit of a consensus here. We still see them shifting back and forth. To be a 90- mile spread in deterrence. That 90 miles could be the difference between a cat 4 cat 5 landfalls hurricane in Miami. A lot of people still need to be watching this very closely including everybody in the Florida peninsula, the Florida Keys as well. It will also tell you upper coast, Georgia. One of our models, a very reliable model brings a cat 4 hurricane right here Sunday, midday or so in the Miami area.
