Yes, this dumbbell is taken his aggressions out on the barbells. But in all seriousness, our show lost an important ally this weekend, someone who's been a hell of a supporter deeply involved in the success of this program since day one. You could say he was our shining light, our lodestar, our muse second banana in his own family, but number one in our hearts.",

They also just learned the P.P. tapes were fake. Jussie Smollett is a liar and Don Lemon can't read. Of course, this tragic news is leaving a huge hole in my show when it came to laughs Cuomo provided more than a bus full of nitrous huffing clowns. The shock has left many of us in denial.",

But apparently when it came to the Chris Cuomo story, those sources weren't reliable at all because he remained silent for months on the Cuomo scandals, preferring to spend his time playing clips of Fox News and complaining about our huge ratings. And now he's trying to rewrite history. Meanwhile, Cuomo is now claiming that Zucker was aware of everything. His spokesman telling the Wall Street Journal owned by our parent company, the Olsen twins. That Chris said CNN President Jeff Zucker were widely known to be extremely close and in regular contact, including about the details of Mr. Cuomo support for his brother. And now CNN snapping back to In the journal that Cuomo has made a number of accusations that are patently false. This reinforces why he was terminated for violating our standards and practices. So it's about to get uglier than a sheet with a bikini wax. But whoever wins this battle, it can't look good for CNN. If it's no longer the most trusted name in news at regional airports or Delta terminals. Even the broadcasting Balloon Boy wonders, has CNN lost trust as a result of this?",

Well, it turns out getting hired has nothing to do with talent brands or even good hair. Nope, the less engaged you are with the American public, the more likely you'll get hired. You see, CNN is not about ratings. It's about reach. Meaning that the network exists only to create angry clips of fake news which they then disperse on the internet, where its influence is really peddled. It's like a baseball farm team that develops talent to send up to the major leagues, where they will be watched by a bigger audience. So instead of appeal, CNN seeks the opposite. I mean, let's take a look at their current anchors. So, are you angry and petulant? Are you the product of famous parents? Are you miserably arrogant? Are you just plain stupid? Do you look like you passed away 10 years ago? If you fill -- fulfill most of that criteria, CNN is hiring. Because like a very lazy paper boy, CNN is not interested in delivering news. Their real profit model is to attract eyeballs from conflict. Think of the Jerry Springer Show, but in tiny bite sized servings fired like a glitter gun into the population. And the worse you feel about America, the better they do. That should be their slogan or an uneducated consumer is our best customer. So will they find another Chris Cuomo? Maybe we should leave CNN with some lasting words of hope to make them try. Let's say it one more time, shall we?",

She capitulates to those who are donors, but then turns around and flops on what she's committed to that has plagued her this entire time.

Yes, it sounds like it's not the accident. That's the freak. But did people buy that? I'm asking for, for any -- definitely not myself. But how likely is it that this actually happened?

But apparently when it came to the Chris Cuomo story, those sources weren't reliable at all because he remained silent for months on the Cuomo scandals, preferring to spend his time playing clips of Fox News and complaining about our huge ratings. And now he's trying to rewrite history. Meanwhile, Cuomo is now claiming that Zucker was aware of everything. His spokesman telling the Wall Street Journal owned by our parent company, the Olsen twins. That Chris said CNN President Jeff Zucker were widely known to be extremely close and in regular contact, including about the details of Mr. Cuomo support for his brother. And now CNN snapping back to In the journal that Cuomo has made a number of accusations that are patently false. This reinforces why he was terminated for violating our standards and practices. So it's about to get uglier than a sheet with a bikini wax. But whoever wins this battle, it can't look good for CNN.

As you know, we were the first to discover the charms of Cuomo and supported him all the way. And like all these CNN clowns out angling for his job. They're despicable. As you know Chris Cuomo was their highest rated host. True. That's like having the most fingers at a leper colony. The skin biopsy I got last year drew a larger audience than Cuomo. Turns out that skin tag was a Honey Nut Cheerio. But it still be Cuomo in the 18 to 54-year-old demographic, which is important. So what does this mean for the 9:00 p.m. slot?

Well, it turns out getting hired has nothing to do with talent brands or even good hair. Nope, the less engaged you are with the American public, the more likely you'll get hired. You see, CNN is not about ratings. It's about reach. Meaning that the network exists only to create angry clips of fake news which they then disperse on the internet, where its influence is really peddled. It's like a baseball farm team that develops talent to send up to the major leagues, where they will be watched by a bigger audience. So instead of appeal, CNN seeks the opposite. I mean, let's take a look at their current anchors. So, are you angry and petulant? Are you the product of famous parents? Are you miserably arrogant? Are you just plain stupid? Do you look like you passed away 10 years ago? If you fill -- fulfill most of that criteria, CNN is hiring. Because like a very lazy paper boy, CNN is not interested in delivering news. Their real profit model is to attract eyeballs from conflict. Think of the Jerry Springer Show, but in tiny bite sized servings fired like a glitter gun into the population. And the worse you feel about America, the better they do. That should be their slogan or an uneducated consumer is our best customer. So will they find another Chris Cuomo? Maybe we should leave CNN with some lasting words of hope to make them try. Let's say it one more time, shall we?"

According to Garg, so -- it's so garg of him to do this though I have to tell you. The company started taking a closer look at employee productivity metrics. And that's when they noticed the lack of performance. But the CEO says the decision to fire so many, it wasn't an easy one."

This isn't a tiny infraction, this is straight up theft. When I was a federal attorney, I was managing one. So I was in charge of firing."

So this guy doing it over Zoom, I'm like absolutely wipe the slate clean.

The reason that she's made it this far is because she has been propped up by the people of California that were duped into believing that oh, she checks a box. And therefore, we're going to take her from position to position to position as the eight families in San Francisco that have money supported her campaigns along the way. Those of us that lived under her watch as D.A. as attorney general, as Senator understand that she was just simply incompetent, that these stories of civil war have fractioning within her staff, the fact that she can't commit to some type of messaging or some any type of platform. She capitulates to those who are donors, but then turns around and flops on what she's committed to that has plagued her this entire time. So, what we got, what we voted for, what they voted for, is exactly what we're getting now as vice president and you don't run a staff where 30 of them run to CNN, anonymous sources. 30 of how many? 32 without there being a ring of truth.

The book \"Viral\" by Matt Ridley, maybe the most incisive and authoritative book about the search for the source of the virus. And how do I know that? It says so right on the books flap. But also, I read it and it's one hell of a compelling page turner. Joining me now, Author, Columnist, and Member of the House of Lords in the U.K., Matt Ridley."

      "speaker": "RIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, she's, she's a very talented young scientist. She got interested in the origins of this pandemic, she says, it's really important we find out. She began piecing together the story, she found some things that surprised her. She started laying them out. I began to rely on her as a source for some writing I was doing. I was also curious, where did this virus come from. Both of us thought, well, it's probably out of that wet market, the Chinese said it came from, and then we began to find that the wet market theory fell apart. And the laboratory leak theory got stronger. We haven't ended up concluding that it's definitely that we don't know enough. But we've tried to take the reader with us on an exploration of everything we know, and everything we don't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Everything in that book. I mean, you know, I read it, I read it, in one day, because it's so compelling, and it is like a detective. It's a detective novel. And I even think -- even the conclusion, if the viewer knew the conclusion, it doesn't matter, because it's the journey there. I found it was, what was -- go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes, no, exactly -- it's, we were worried that the problem would be solved before the book came out, and then people wouldn't be interested? Well, it's not so. We still don't know the answer. We don't claim that there's enough information to decide one way or the other. But it's pretty clear, it's one of two possibilities, either there was an infected animal in the market, or there was a leak from a laboratory. And the evidence for the latter has got really quite compelling, and it needs to be taken seriously. But a lot of the scientific establishment, a lot of the journalistic establishment just doesn't want to talk about it, which is, which is a pity, because it's a really important issue for the millions of people who've died, and so that we can prevent the next pandemic."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And to that point, I mean, the lesson in your book is to look for the dog that's not barking, the conspicuous absence of a variant or location. So, you have all these experts pushing out all this information, but somehow, they're not talking about the bats in that little cave in that province, or the or this variant that seems to be almost 100 percent like COVID. And that's what kind of triggered your, your fellow author which I like, it's the thing they're not talking about that's the thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's a very nice example of that, where they describe the spike protein right at the start of the pandemic, in this virus. And in a - - and they, they just don't point out that it's got a feature that no other SARS-like virus has ever had in it."

    {
      "speaker": "RIDLEY",
      "utterance": "And, and that, you know, when, when you find out what that feature is, which it takes us a long time to explain in the book, it's a feature they've been putting into viruses deliberately, in various places, in order to make them easier to grow in laboratories. And they had a plan to do exactly that with SARS- like viruses in Wuhan. And that's disturbing, because they knew Western scientists knew about this plan back in 2018. When the pandemic started, they didn't tell us, we found that out from leaked information just a couple of months ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's -- I mean, you come away believing that this was a cover up in a way. I mean, they, in a sense, they succeeded in gain of function before creating a cage for it. I mean, they, they thought that, oh, we could anticipate new strains, that's like, they created a machine to create lottery numbers, right? And they said, oh, look, maybe we could just create the fact the create the strain that's going to come up. It is, it's absolutely mind boggling that they did this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the purpose of the research they were doing in Wuhan, not more than anywhere else on the planet. This is the place doing SARS Coronavirus research on a bigger scale than any other town anywhere in the world. The purpose of that research was to predict the next pandemic or prevent the next pandemic."

      "speaker": "RIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Really worrying possibility, and we need to confront it. Because otherwise, you know, there's tons of labs all around the world, not just in China doing similar kinds of work on dangerous viruses. And somebody needs to get a grip on this. I'm a great fan of biotech research, and so as Alina. You know, we're not against this kind of work, but we think it's a bit odd to be doing it on really dangerous viruses in a way that makes them even more dangerous."
