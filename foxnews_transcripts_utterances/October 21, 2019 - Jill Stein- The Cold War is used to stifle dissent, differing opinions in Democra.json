At the same time, though, you almost never hear anything about what is happening within the Democratic Party.

How vicious and crazy has the infighting within the Democratic Party become? Let's put it this way.

In the past three months, the Democratic field has spent $2.2 million flying private. In Joe Biden's case, flying private amounts to more than five percent of all campaigns, it's almost like he is running for President and so he won't have to fly commercial. Daniel Turner is the Executive Director of Power the Future. He knows a lot about this subject and he joins us tonight. Mr. Turner, thanks very much for coming on. So you hear people -- not enough -- but occasionally people like me say it's an outrage that you on the one hand demand sacrifice from the population in the name of climate and on the other, fly private.

When Tim Mynett filed for divorce last summer, his estranged wife said his affair with Omar dated back to when he worked on her campaign. Mynett repeatedly denied that. And when Omar filed for divorce two weeks ago, she too denied the relationship. But now the couple is reportedly considering their own marriage once their respective divorces are final. Of course, there might be a few legal issues along the way. Conservative watchdog groups have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission because Omar's campaign reportedly paid Tim Mynett and his firm $230,000.00 for things like fundraising and travel expenses. The question now is whether that money was used to fund the affair, which is not allowed. Then there's Ilhan's Omar's relationship history. She married Ahmed Hirsi in a religious ceremony back in 2002. They separated in 2008, then legally married last year. Of course, Omar is also accused of marrying her biological brother so he could obtain American citizenship. And in early October, Omar denied splitting with Ahmed Hirsi until of course she filed for divorce a few days later -- Tucker.",

And FDR and Churchill realized that they really need to get Stalin on board. He has taken massive losses in Stalingrad and the Red Army has been fighting Hitler for a long time. There's a chance though, in FDR's mind that Stalin could go the other way and side with Hitler, and then the war is off. So Stalin says you have to come to Tehran. That's the only place I'm going to meet. Six thousand miles away, FDR travels across the ocean, U-boat and infested waters. And Churchill, Stalin and FDR meet for the first time at the Soviet Embassy and they plan Operation Overlord, which we now know as D-Day that changed the war and change the world.",

But if you look carefully at Pierre Delecto's Twitter account, you will find that peer director really concerns himself with defending the fragile honor of the Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney. In May, for example, Jennifer Rubin at \"The Washington Post\" essentially called Romney spineless, but Delecto shot back, \"Jennifer, you need to take a breath. Maybe you can acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure, even if not in every measure.\" Then two weeks ago, our own Brit Hume suggested Romney was quote \"an unreliable ally.\" And Delecto jabbed back. \"Loyal to principle trump's loyalty to party or person, right Brit?\" So if you're wondering who this Delecto character is, we have an unshocking surprise for you. Peter Delecto is, in fact, Mitt Romney. What tweets did Pierre Delecto like? Well, mostly ones by Mitt Romney or quoting Mitt Romney or praising Mitt Romney as a paragon of virtue. He also liked tweets bashing Donald Trump or attacking people Mitt Romney secretly dislikes like Newt Gingrich. In real life, Mitt Romney won't call for overthrowing President Trump by the 25th Amendment, but as Pierre Delecto, he likes to tweet suggesting that would be a very good idea, indeed. In other words, it's exactly the kind of account this Pierre Delecto account you would expect Mitt Romney of Utah to run. It doesn't express any daring or interesting ideas. It doesn't display any secretly concealed wit. Instead, it is a relentless slog. It is a triumph of bourgeois passive aggression. It is exactly, in every sense, what you would imagine. Of course, it is. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. See you tomorrow.

In a minute, for example, we will talk to one Republican senator who is gravely dissatisfied, angry really with Lindsey Graham's leadership of the Judiciary Committee. He says he is doing nothing to get to the bottom of Russia-gate. So the divides are real. At the same time, though, you almost never hear anything about what is happening within the Democratic Party. Maybe that's because outwardly Democrats seem united in their loathing for Donald Trump. But inside the party, Democrats may in fact hate each other more, even more than they hate Trump.

Now, she offered precisely no evidence for these charges, serious though they are. The one thing that all three of these people have in common is that at one time or another, they have all opposed Hillary Clinton's political aspirations. And according to Hillary, that means by definition, they're traitors. Now remember, as you watch this that Hillary Clinton is supposed to be a very impressive person. Her fellow liberals have told us that since she graduated from Wellesley College more than 50 years ago, and then went on to Yale Law School, famously and married Bill Clinton. She is then, is now one of the best and the brightest. She is the adult in the room. That's what they always tell you. And yet now we learned they were lying about Hillary all along. She's not impressive. She's silly. She's reckless. She's not even very smart. Like dumb people everywhere, she has got a weakness for bizarre conspiracies. That's the real Hillary Clinton. And yet amazingly, her fellow liberals are still defending her."

Remember Evan McMullin, he is that guy that Bill Kristol convinced to run for President back in 2016. McMullin, we were told is a serious principled conservative, unlike everyone else. And yet it turns out, he agrees with Hillary. Here is his take on all this, and we're quoting, \"I believe it's true. Tulsi Gabbard is with the Russians and the Russians are with Tulsi Gabbard. She confirms it every time she opens her mouth.\" End quote. And yet no evidence whatsoever. So then Trump weighed in and keep in mind, Trump is not on the same side as Tulsi Gabbard, much less Jill Stein. But yet, he weighed in and he said, no, he didn't think that two of his political opponents were spies. Well, this sent Washington into conniptions. Neocon buffoon, David Frum declared that the denial itself proved conspiracy, quote, \"Trump last night defended Jill Stein and Tulsi Gabbard against charges of Russian influence. He wasn't supposed to do that. He was supposed to pretend they were not all on the same team.\" So it was all a setup according to David Frum. Is that Tulsi Gabbard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City? This is lunacy, by the way, but it's not accidental lunacy. It's lunacy in the service of a purpose. So last Friday, we had Congresswoman Gabbard on the show, and we asked her, what is this about? And she explained it about as well, as anybody ever has. Watch this."

They've mismanaged the economy, in case you haven't noticed. They've wasted American lives in pointless wars abroad. They forced weird and irrelevant gender theory on a baffled nation, while hundreds of thousands of Americans died of drug ODs, and they paid no notice at all to that, because they didn't care. We've never had a worst set of leaders in this country. That's what all the drama is about. That's what the volatility comes from, because our leadership is terrible. So it's not surprising that this group, the ones who wreck the country, don't take criticism well. Don't like the program? You must be a spy. Jill Stein knows the drill. They've done it to her for years. And she joins us tonight. Dr. Stein, thanks very much for coming on. I should say at the outset, I don't think we agree with each other on very much, but we're still very happy to have you on the show. Because I think you've been maligned.

You know, this was a legitimate media conference, and I was there to share my message, which was peace in the Middle East, a nuclear weapons ban and a global climate Green New Deal.

She's the only Democrat that met with -- twice -- with the war criminal Assad. She's the only Democrat that says that the Democratic Party is the warmongering party, certainly the people running for President. I mean, you go down the list, she is super fluent in Syrian and Russian talking points. It's odd."

He said he would probe whether or not top D.O.J. officials plotted a bureaucratic coup to overthrow the elected President. He said he would subpoena Andrew McCabe, as well as Rod Rosenstein if necessary. So far, Graham's tenure has been defined by total inaction. He has subpoenaed neither McCabe nor Rosenstein, nor has he launched an investigation. Now, his inaction extends to that Ukraine saga as well. State Department official Kurt Volker reportedly has given closed-door testimony that undermines the current impeachment narrative. Two weeks ago, Graham said that if Democrats didn't release a transcript of Volker's remarks, he would summon Volker before the Senate to testify. We're still waiting for that to happen, too. We've asked Senator Graham repeatedly to come on this show to explain this, among other things, we've never been successful in getting him here. Instead, tonight, we're joined by Senator Rand Paul. He serves with Senator Graham. He represents the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He's got a new book out, a fantastic new book called \"The Case against Socialism.\" Rand Paul joins us tonight.

I want to see Brennan testify, and I would ask him very pointedly, did you talk to the British Intelligence agencies? And did you set up spying by foreign Intelligence agencies on the President or the President's campaign? Because I think he did and I think that's against the law. And I've talked to people who are convinced that these people while they may be deceitful, they're sort of, you know, so officious that they probably have paperwork they filled out and those phone calls probably have a record, but I think he did call the British agent and I think he did get them involved. But I also think it'd be interesting to know, Christopher Steele and that Steele dossier, did he talk to Russian agents? That's been the rumor for over a year now that he was getting information from Russian agents. So everything that Democrats have accused President Trump of doing, you know, investigating a political rival with a foreign country. All of those same questions should be asked of the Democrats.

Senator Graham as, you know, is really probably the most aggressive neocon in the Senate. He has butted heads with the President over this. They're currently arguing about Syria. I wonder if his disagreement with Trump on foreign policy questions has caused him to slow walk some of these investigations."

The deep state has an enormous amount of power to look at individuals. And so when Senator Graham and I have fought these fights in the back, in the past, I've always fought for having warrants where a real judge in public has to -- you have to present probable cause. Lindsey has always fought for allowing these to be done secretly. These FISA warrants, even allowing Americans to end up -- Americans be caught up in these. And so this is something that there may be a concern that if we look at the Intelligence state -- the deep state -- that as we find out things that some of their power may diminish, and so there might be a philosophical difference that he wants them to maintain their power. He wants to maintain the Intelligence Community's enormous grip on things."

      "utterance": "Well, the Democratic presidential race is setting a lot of records. For example, no contest in American history has been this focused on climate change. Almost every candidate has a plan to spend billions or in some cases, trillions of dollars in some form of Green New Deal. But this newfound climate activism comes with another odd trend, a taste for private jet travel. It's never been like this in any presidential race. In the past three months, the Democratic field has spent $2.2 million flying private. In Joe Biden's case, flying private amounts to more than five percent of all campaigns, it's almost like he is running for President and so he won't have to fly commercial. Daniel Turner is the Executive Director of Power the Future. He knows a lot about this subject and he joins us tonight. Mr. Turner, thanks very much for coming on. So you hear people -- not enough -- but occasionally people like me say it's an outrage that you on the one hand demand sacrifice from the population in the name of climate and on the other, fly private. Put some flesh on those bones. Why is it ridiculous for a climate change activist to fly private?"

They have said that they want to render jet travel obsolete, so they want to bring us to a place with the economy where oil and gas are no longer allowed to be used as resources. And you would think that they would reflect that in their personal life, right? You would think they would start to, at least in their campaign, put your money where your mouth is, this is a very simple expression, right? And the fact that they are doing this, it's just so -- it shows what a bunch of lies they are peddling."

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both say they want to make fracking illegal on their first day in office, right? By an executive order, they want to make fracking illegal. Half of our oil comes from fracking. If we got rid of half of our oil, and there are millions of men and women who work in this field, besides their jobs being eliminated, what would that do to air travel? The cost of all goods and services, the cost of food et cetera? So they embrace a political perspective that would destroy the economy and raising prices, but then on the other hand, they will jump on a private jet."

Bernie doesn't actually want to find -- you said you flew in coach on an American Airline, which is a miserable experience thanks to government regulation, and Bernie doesn't want to have to endure that and he doesn't want to find himself in row 73 on the center seat between you and Sean Hannity. That's his worst nightmare. He doesn't want to. He doesn't -- and one consequence of this is, they're not actually living where the American people live anymore. They're flying.

When Tim Mynett filed for divorce last summer, his estranged wife said his affair with Omar dated back to when he worked on her campaign. Mynett repeatedly denied that. And when Omar filed for divorce two weeks ago, she too denied the relationship. But now the couple is reportedly considering their own marriage once their respective divorces are final. Of course, there might be a few legal issues along the way. Conservative watchdog groups have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission because Omar's campaign reportedly paid Tim Mynett and his firm $230,000.00 for things like fundraising and travel expenses. The question now is whether that money was used to fund the affair, which is not allowed. Then there's Ilhan's Omar's relationship history. She married Ahmed Hirsi in a religious ceremony back in 2002. They separated in 2008, then legally married last year. Of course, Omar is also accused of marrying her biological brother so he could obtain American citizenship.

November 1943 is when this conference happens and Hitler is on the march in Europe. The U.S. has had minor success in the Pacific against the Japanese, but that could go the other way, too. And FDR and Churchill realized that they really need to get Stalin on board. He has taken massive losses in Stalingrad and the Red Army has been fighting Hitler for a long time. There's a chance though, in FDR's mind that Stalin could go the other way and side with Hitler, and then the war is off. So Stalin says you have to come to Tehran. That's the only place I'm going to meet. Six thousand miles away, FDR travels across the ocean, U-boat and infested waters. And Churchill, Stalin and FDR meet for the first time at the Soviet Embassy and they plan Operation Overlord, which we now know as D-Day that changed the war and change the world."

They get him on an elevator onto there, onto the ship, and they start the trek over. It is escorted by other ships. While they're over -- heading over, they try to do an exercise to show the President of the United States how good they are at the U.S. Navy and the next ship over, the William S.

FDR had a little bit, towards the end, a god complex that he could solve everything. And he believed he could keep Stalin in a corner and contain him even after the war. What happened was after the Yalta Conference, he goes back to the U.S. and dies and Stalin is emboldened. And that's the beginning of the Cold War. He essentially takes over Eastern Europe."

      "utterance": "You should watch Brett's \"Three Days at the Brink\" Special. It aired on Fox yesterday, but a director's cut version is now available at Fox Nation, so you can check it out there. Well, next, we want to talk about an obscure Twitter account called Pierre Delecto. The account is very concerned with defending Mitt Romney and attacking his enemies. Why do you think that is? We will tell you after the break."

      "utterance": "Sean Hannity interview the President today for the hour as Larry King used to say. That interview is amazing, I've heard. It starts in just a minute. But first tonight, we'd like to tell you about an obscure Twitter account from a man called Pierre Delecto. Now if that sounds like an adult film actor, we didn't choose the name. But if you look carefully at Pierre Delecto's Twitter account, you will find that peer director really concerns himself with defending the fragile honor of the Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney. In May, for example, Jennifer Rubin at \"The Washington Post\" essentially called Romney spineless, but Delecto shot back, \"Jennifer, you need to take a breath. Maybe you can acknowledge the people who agree with you in large measure, even if not in every measure.\" Then two weeks ago, our own Brit Hume suggested Romney was quote \"an unreliable ally.\" And Delecto jabbed back. \"Loyal to principle trump's loyalty to party or person, right Brit?\" So if you're wondering who this Delecto character is, we have an unshocking surprise for you. Peter Delecto is, in fact, Mitt Romney. What tweets did Pierre Delecto like? Well, mostly ones by Mitt Romney or quoting Mitt Romney or praising Mitt Romney as a paragon of virtue. He also liked tweets bashing Donald Trump or attacking people Mitt Romney secretly dislikes like Newt Gingrich. In real life, Mitt Romney won't call for overthrowing President Trump by the 25th Amendment, but as Pierre Delecto, he likes to tweet suggesting that would be a very good idea, indeed. In other words, it's exactly the kind of account this Pierre Delecto account you would expect Mitt Romney of Utah to run. It doesn't express any daring or interesting ideas. It doesn't display any secretly concealed wit. Instead, it is a relentless slog. It is a triumph of bourgeois passive aggression. It is exactly, in every sense, what you would imagine. Of course, it is. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. See you tomorrow.
