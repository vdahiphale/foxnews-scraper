Did you ever date somebody for a while and after you break up, you realize the whole relationship was fake? Everything she told you was bull, all your big moments were meaningless. That's 2020. We got catfished last year. All the lies were designed to install Biden. The media actually broke itself dragging Joe crossed the finish line. The Press died from all the lies. That's one of the side effects of Trump derangement syndrome. Now that Biden has been installed, the truth is finally coming out. It has a way of doing that. And it's stunning. Remember this.",

ABC News who pushed the lie was forced to run this headline: \"Police did not clear Lafayette Park area so Trump could hold a Bible photo-op.\" Park Police already started clearing the rowdy crowd hours before they learned Trump planned on walking through. A new study just released found masks didn't slow COVID spread. University of Louisville researchers found mask mandates and mask use weren't associated with slowing the spread and were poor predictors of COVID spread, quote, \"Our findings do not support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates decrease with greater public mask use.\" In fact, the study found evidence that masks were harmful especially in children. How about this one? Study shows hydroxychloroquine and zinc treatments increased coronavirus survival rates by almost three times. The study was conducted by St. Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey on hundreds of patients. This is the third such study supporting hydroxy, but Twitter will censor you for disinformation if you post about it because science. And of course, you'll remember DeSantis was called a killer for opening beaches. This Grim Reaper stood in the Florida sand satirically trolling the Governor. Remember? CNN made him a star. It turns out, sunlight kills COVID and it didn't spread on beaches. It largely spread indoors where people were locked down. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. The doctor now under fire for lying about funding the Wuhan lab. Fauci rallied scientists to dismiss the lab leak theory while he was scrambling behind the scenes to wipe his fingerprints from it. But don't you dare criticize Fauci, He was wrong on masks, gain-of-function, lockdowns, and hydroxy, he doesn't take criticism well.",

Until we can confront that and talk about that, this is really going to continue. I was on Long Island this weekend, visiting a really dear friend, and I was really disturbed. I saw, you know, dozens and dozens of pickup trucks with, you know, expletives against Joe Biden on the back of them, Trump flags and some cases, just dozens of American flags, which, you know, is also just disturbing because essentially, the message was clear, it was, this is my country, this is not your country.

      "sentences": "That right there is why the press is broken, right there. She says it's clear that white Americans flying flags and pickup trucks are racist to think they own this country. How is that clear? Mara Gay is a journalist. Did she get out of her car and interview the flag waving truck drivers? Did they tell her that's what they believe? No, that's her opinion, based on nothing. This is exactly what Rush Limbaugh called the drive-by media. They drive by an innocent scene, shoot it up with a bunch of lies, and then just drive away leaving chaos behind. And if you are disturbed by an American flag, that's not our problem, that may be your issue. People fly the flag because they love the country. Maybe they served, maybe their family died serving. And people who drive pickup trucks work for a living and do the jobs that make the country great. Sometimes you need room in the back, Miss Gay. White Americans don't own this country. They own land and businesses and trucks just like black Americans do. It says a lot that \"The New York Times\" editor is disturbed by a peaceful display of American flags, but the deadly riots that rocked the nation last summer, not quite as disturbing. How do you know these patriots associate America with whiteness? You don't. I have a feeling a lot of Americans don't obsess about race nearly as much as \"New York Times\" editors do. Americans can associate whatever they want with their country. If I see a flag, I can see freedom, religious liberty, and capitalism, whatever I want. And she can see oppression and division; that's her right. But we don't have to separate anything from what we see in the flag. Americans are proud of their country, not because of their race, but because their forefathers forged this great nation. They worked the land, they raised their families and they fought the wars. What \"The New York Times\" doesn't understand is America is about a shared history, a shared heritage, a unique experiment. It is everyone's country, those of us who are citizens. Mara is trying to separate us by race, but we're trying to unite us by an idea, and that idea is inscribed in the Declaration. If \"The New York Times\" would get to know flag-waving Trump supporters, maybe they'd understand them, but they don't want to understand them. They want to hate them. It makes them feel morally superior in their ignorance, and that's what Mara Gay is. She is ignorant and she admits it. When people called her out for her comments, she played the race card, quote, \"I see I'm being trolled with the American flag this morning. Trolling a black journalist with the American flag is not the own some people think it is.\" See, just like Fauci, if she complains, see, you can't criticize her. She hides behind her identity when her identity has nothing to do with it. It's her character people have a problem with. Trump supporters may be mocking her, not because she is black, but because she lies about them. She is the same woman who can't do basic math. Remember, she and Brian Williams believed Mike Bloomberg could have taken the $500 million he spent on the campaign and given every American a million.",

You can't cover the guy you hate most, because you have no critical distance from it. Watching them defend Fauci, I mean, who, you know, maybe a fine person. I have no -- I don't know him.

He gets a job as a building contractor doing drywall and electrical work, you know, not just a laborer and then he joins MS-13, and he is in for 10 years. He committed murder. Everyone in that prison had committed murder. They were all gang members and he gets deported back to El Salvador, where he is going to spend the rest of his life in a cell. What's so interesting is he didn't become a member of the gang until he got to LA, until he got to the United States.

Why would you come to this land of opportunity and join a murderer street gang and then commit murder? Like, we're not doing this right. And I think we all know that, but this was yet another reminder, one quick thing I'll say is that El Salvador is responding I think in a way that we can learn from. How embarrassing is that? Learning from the government of El Salvador. But we can. They have decided we're not taking this crap anymore. You get what you put up with.

They were able to sow the seeds of doubt in some of the American public. There are like a large percentage of Joe Biden voters that are now saying, oh, man, if I would have known, I'm like, if you would have known like, I wrote a book about it a year ago. If all of these things were known, but when you have a multitrillion dollar mainstream media complex, combined with social media and Big Tech fully weaponized against conservatives, it's really hard to get that message out. So, there are people that get it. You get it. I get it.

ABC News who pushed the lie was forced to run this headline: \"Police did not clear Lafayette Park area so Trump could hold a Bible photo-op.\" Park Police already started clearing the rowdy crowd hours before they learned Trump planned on walking through. A new study just released found masks didn't slow COVID spread. University of Louisville researchers found mask mandates and mask use weren't associated with slowing the spread and were poor predictors of COVID spread, quote, \"Our findings do not support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates decrease with greater public mask use.\" In fact, the study found evidence that masks were harmful especially in children. How about this one? Study shows hydroxychloroquine and zinc treatments increased coronavirus survival rates by almost three times. The study was conducted by St. Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey on hundreds of patients. This is the third such study supporting hydroxy, but Twitter will censor you for disinformation if you post about it because science. And of course, you'll remember DeSantis was called a killer for opening beaches. This Grim Reaper stood in the Florida sand satirically trolling the Governor. Remember? CNN made him a star. It turns out, sunlight kills COVID and it didn't spread on beaches. It largely spread indoors where people were locked down. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. The doctor now under fire for lying about funding the Wuhan lab. Fauci rallied scientists to dismiss the lab leak theory while he was scrambling behind the scenes to wipe his fingerprints from it.

Cuomo was no hero, DeSantis was. The protests weren't peaceful. Trump didn't gas protesters for a church photo- up. COVID probably came from a lab Fauci funded.

Hunter lobbied his dad to fire the prosecutor and casually drops N-bombs when he is not dodging paternity tests from strippers he knocked up after getting bribed with diamonds from Communist China.

I think as long as they see Americanness as the same as one with whiteness, this is going to continue. We have to figure out how to get every American a place at the table in this democracy, but how to separate Americanness -- America from whiteness. Until we can confront that and talk about that, this is really going to continue. I was on Long Island this weekend, visiting a really dear friend, and I was really disturbed. I saw, you know, dozens and dozens of pickup trucks with, you know, expletives against Joe Biden on the back of them, Trump flags and some cases, just dozens of American flags, which, you know, is also just disturbing because essentially, the message was clear, it was, this is my country, this is not your country. I own this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That right there is why the press is broken, right there. She says it's clear that white Americans flying flags and pickup trucks are racist to think they own this country. How is that clear? Mara Gay is a journalist. Did she get out of her car and interview the flag waving truck drivers? Did they tell her that's what they believe? No, that's her opinion, based on nothing. This is exactly what Rush Limbaugh called the drive-by media. They drive by an innocent scene, shoot it up with a bunch of lies, and then just drive away leaving chaos behind. And if you are disturbed by an American flag, that's not our problem, that may be your issue. People fly the flag because they love the country. Maybe they served, maybe their family died serving. And people who drive pickup trucks work for a living and do the jobs that make the country great. Sometimes you need room in the back, Miss Gay. White Americans don't own this country. They own land and businesses and trucks just like black Americans do. It says a lot that \"The New York Times\" editor is disturbed by a peaceful display of American flags, but the deadly riots that rocked the nation last summer, not quite as disturbing. How do you know these patriots associate America with whiteness? You don't. I have a feeling a lot of Americans don't obsess about race nearly as much as \"New York Times\" editors do. Americans can associate whatever they want with their country. If I see a flag, I can see freedom, religious liberty, and capitalism, whatever I want. And she can see oppression and division; that's her right. But we don't have to separate anything from what we see in the flag. Americans are proud of their country, not because of their race, but because their forefathers forged this great nation. They worked the land, they raised their families and they fought the wars. What \"The New York Times\" doesn't understand is America is about a shared history, a shared heritage, a unique experiment. It is everyone's country, those of us who are citizens. Mara is trying to separate us by race, but we're trying to unite us by an idea, and that idea is inscribed in the Declaration. If \"The New York Times\" would get to know flag-waving Trump supporters, maybe they'd understand them, but they don't want to understand them. They want to hate them. It makes them feel morally superior in their ignorance, and that's what Mara Gay is. She is ignorant and she admits it. When people called her out for her comments, she played the race card, quote, \"I see I'm being trolled with the American flag this morning. Trolling a black journalist with the American flag is not the own some people think it is.\" See, just like Fauci, if she complains, see, you can't criticize her. She hides behind her identity when her identity has nothing to do with it. It's her character people have a problem with. Trump supporters may be mocking her, not because she is black, but because she lies about them. She is the same woman who can't do basic math.

Why would you continue to defend him? And the answer, of course, is that once the whole edifice starts to collapse, you know, you're going with it. The building is coming down. They should get out, but they are riding it right to the bottom. It's really shocking to watch it."

He winds up in LA, an immigrant from El Salvador, one-third of the entire population of El Salvador now lives in the United States. So, it's a very common path. He gets a job as a building contractor doing drywall and electrical work, you know, not just a laborer and then he joins MS-13, and he is in for 10 years. He committed murder. Everyone in that prison had committed murder. They were all gang members and he gets deported back to El Salvador, where he is going to spend the rest of his life in a cell. What's so interesting is he didn't become a member of the gang until he got to LA, until he got to the United States. And it's just another reminder, there's something about the way that we're doing immigration that not only doesn't work for us, it's really counterproductive. Why would you come to this land of opportunity and join a murderer street gang and then commit murder? Like, we're not doing this right. And I think we all know that, but this was yet another reminder, one quick thing I'll say is that El Salvador is responding I think in a way that we can learn from. How embarrassing is that? Learning from the government of El Salvador. But we can. They have decided we're not taking this crap anymore. You get what you put up with. We only have an out of control murder rate, because we're allowing it to happen, no mas, we're not doing this anymore. And they've really -- I mean, they have dropped murders by 70 percent. We could do that if we wanted to in Baltimore and Chicago. Our leaders don't want to."

It doesn't happen in Logan Circle. It happens in Suffolk County, Long Island, it happens maybe in Maryland, or in Iowa or in, you know, the outskirts in Texas. But these are the kinds of things that are happening throughout the country and if you don't put a spotlight on it, more and more people are going to die, and it just seems like today, the media doesn't care about it, Tucker, and I'm glad you're highlighting this.

WATTERS' WORLD reached out to Hunter's lawyer and the White House, but have not heard back. Joe Biden and the mainstream media went silent on the story.

But let's not forget, they got exactly what they wanted, Jesse. They don't care about the truth. They were able to weaponize fake information to try to hurt Donald Trump, and that was their objective all along. They were able to do that. They were able to sow the seeds of doubt in some of the American public. There are like a large percentage of Joe Biden voters that are now saying, oh, man, if I would have known, I'm like, if you would have known like, I wrote a book about it a year ago. If all of these things were known, but when you have a multitrillion dollar mainstream media complex, combined with social media and Big Tech fully weaponized against conservatives, it's really hard to get that message out. So, there are people that get it. You get it. I get it. A few of us do, but when those people are suppressed so badly that average Americans, hardworking Americans that are now looking upon the mess whether it's the border, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's energy independence, whether it's fuel prices and commodity pricing, all of these things are a total disaster, and I told you so.

More and more people are carrying guns in their cars these days. Whether you are doing it legally, illegally, tell the officer, hey, I'm grabbing my license from here. Hand over what he needs. Nothing that the police officers do is personal. You know, we are human beings, sometimes we have good attitudes, sometimes we have bad attitudes. I will agree with that, but nothing is personal.

First of all, the stripper thing, when I read that, Larry Flynn's club is giving out, you know, membership passes and bottles of booze to people who get vaccinated.

    },

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "This one is a little more innocent. You're looking at Jason Derulo doing that. He is a singer for those who don't know. You put a corn cob on a drill you turn the drill on it's sort of like a life hack type thing."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Swipe left. All right, unless you're a hockey player, I think girls like if you're missing a tooth. Number four, basketball beer challenge. Now this one doesn't seem that dangerous."
    },

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "The full face wax. Okay, so somebody a barber, whoever you go to, puts wax all over your face and aggressively rips it off. I guess, this is in place of shaving."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right. And to the haters, this is not a guy in blackface. That is wax on his face. I just want to clarify for the audience."

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Right."

      "utterance": "Number six, the last one, dry scooping challenge. Now, people are eating that powder like a pre-workout."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Pre-workout powder."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Protein."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "I didn't know that pre-workout powder was a thing. But yes, apparently it's really high in caffeine. It comes in powder form. You're supposed to put it in a water bottle. But teenagers are just putting it directly into their mouth. And like I said, high in caffeine. So if you have an undiagnosed heart condition, this could be really bad. Which is why there's a 20-year-old woman who said that she had a heart attack because of this. That woman apparently was a stripper. That doesn't have anything to the story, but I just thought that you would appreciate that."

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "The beer one kind of sounds like fund. I don't know. I mean, you can't get hurt that bad."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right, send the bills my way. Carley, thank you."

      "utterance": "Before you know it, Father's Day is going to be here and I have the perfect gift, a signed copy of \"How I Saved the World.\" Now you won't get the physical copy and time for Father's Day, but you will get a little certificate, you just print it out at home and then you'll let dad know that a signed copy is going to be on his doorsteps on July 6th. And the only way to do this if you had to savetheworldbook.com, savetheworldbook.com, so go to that now and make dad happy for Father's Day. It's what every dad wants. It's basically -- I started here at FOX in the basement, and now look at me, I have a bunch of shows and it tells the story about how my liberal parents sent me into the wilderness to survival camps and how I survived and then how I survived at FOX. You know go into these beaches with these college students and asking them who won the Civil War. They just say France and basically hanging out with the President on Air Force One. Stories that I've never told anybody. You will learn in \"How I Saved the World.\" And I saved it because you're here watching. That's all for tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. \"JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE\" is next, and remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.
