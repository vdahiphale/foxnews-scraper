And the reason for that is not just the personal tax cuts that put more money into people's pockets. They did do that. But also, the corporate tax cut, because that led to a boom in investment. That leads to higher productivity and more productive workers get paid more.

Remember, we've got like five or six candidates who are going to be capable of getting delegates. We have got six people who got delegates already. So if they get 35 percent that means of the total of delegates at the national convention, they won 14 percent of those delegates. Now they need to get to 50 percent of the total delegates. That means that of the remaining 60 percent of the delegates who will be selected after the March 3rd, they got to get 60 percent in order to get those 36 points to bring them to that magic number of 50 plus one. That's going to be awfully hard to do given that the field is so divided. That's why Bloomberg is going to be a potentially very destructive force and not necessarily that he's going to be playing on the 3rd of March and is going to be in double digits and above 15 percent in many, many states.

The Mayor of Houston is notorious for never endorsing and yet he has come out for Bloomberg.

Now McCabe, Inspector General on the record found wrongdoing, lied under oath, all the rest of it. It got him fired. And yet he's getting off the hook.

Remember she used three firewalls, three firewalls, a D&C Perkin Coway and Glenn Simpson's Fusion GPS, and she hired, I think it was legal, a foreign national British Christopher Steele who interned and enlisted embedded or hired Russian sources to create a smear dossier in our political opponent. And then she used her contacts along with Glenn Simpson and the DOJ, the FBI, the CIA to see that dossier and we lost 22 months of time when they pursued this Russian hoax. And she has never come to terms with the fact that she lost the election, she reduced 25 or 30 different reasons all blaming someone else, but who had been a traditional American politics that when you lost election, you conceded and you were magnanimous about it, you said I lost it because I campaigned in the wrong place in the wrong way at the wrong time.

He was not saying that we should have redlining and that it should be, you know, we should have these discriminatory practices. He was saying this method that they used to end redlining was the problem because that's what led the fact that the banks were giving loans to people who cannot afford them or didn't have the proper credit, that's what happened leading up to the mortgage crisis.

Here's a clip of the interview that airs in full tonight on Fox Business."

The idea would be to combine and simplify all existing savings accounts that give tax breaks like IRAs and 401Ks. And does anyone who's been to or listened to what Trump rally knows how much the president likes talking about how well 401Ks are doing under his administration. The strong economy is one of his greatest strengths heading into November. And while he did get a first round of tax cuts through in 2017, there have been complaints that it didn't do enough for average Americans. So, President Trump started raising the possibility of a phase two tax cut or tax cuts 2.0 in March of 2018. Now it appears he wants to put it on paper at the same time his Democratic rivals are putting out plans focused on raising taxes for wealthy Americans. It will be quite a contrast. Ed?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, very much so. Look, I love Larry Kudlow. I love what he was talking about there because actually the tax cuts we've already seen are the heart of two of this administration's biggest accomplishments. First of all, the jobs numbers, the fact that we have historically low unemployment. And secondly, the fact that earnings are rising especially for those at the lower end of the income scale. And the reason for that is not just the personal tax cuts that put more money into people's pockets. They did do that. But also, the corporate tax cut, because that led to a boom in investment. That leads to higher productivity and more productive workers get paid more. So, actually the whole tax cut package was incredibly important and it's rally significant that they want to do it again and I totally support that. Plus, as Kristin said, it's a fantastic political contrast with what the Democratic candidates are saying going into the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "We'll get to the Democrats in a minute. But Steve, if the president is doing so well in the economy, Gallup is saying more than 6 in 10 Americans believe they're better off now than they were three or four years ago. Why have more tax cuts, why have more stimulus that might overcook the economy? If things are so well, why does he need to do more?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, you've got to keep it going. I mean, a good economy doesn't just happen. The fact that we've got this good economy now is the result of the previous measures. Not just a tax cut, also the deregulation. And if you want to keep that going, remember, we are already in the longest expansion in history. We've never gone this far without going from one recession back into the next recession. A lot of people say while Trump is just building on the Obama economy and so on, actually what he's doing is really substantively different. Because it's so much harder to keep the good times going at the end of an expansion than is it at the beginning where you're just bouncing back. So, if we want to keep that going you've got to give, put more fuel in the tank, if you like --"

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Steve, you mention the contrast with 2020 Democrats, it's not just that folks like Bernie Sanders who want to call back the Trump tax cuts, if you will. They actually want to raise your taxes. They are saying it. Bernie Sanders has said in multiple debates, to pay for all these trillions of dollars, they won't even give us a price tag on everything, Medicare for all, student loan debt, you know, relief and all the rest, they are going to raise taxes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. And that's going to hit people two ways. Not just directly in their paychecks where they'll see more money going out of their paychecks to the government, but it's also going to hit the economy more generally because if you raise taxes, and remember, they also want to reverse the corporate tax cut. They all want to do that. Even the so-called moderates in the race. Mike Bloomberg of all people who should know better put out a tax plan which is about hiking up the corporate tax rate so it's one of the highest in the world, making it less competitive. That will hurt job creation. That will mean that you won't have that productivity increase."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Steve, in the last 30 seconds I have, is there another contrast potentially? Larry Kudlow said look, we want to bring this up in September after the summer right before the election. You and I both know Nancy Pelosi is likely to block that. Doesn't it also send the signal Democrats who took over the House have been obstructing his agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Exactly right. That's why this is so smart. Because it focuses the spotlight on an issue where the president is strong. And it raises the stakes. He said, look, here is something really good that you can get, but if you want to get it you not only have to put me back in the White House, we have to win back the House of Representatives and keep control of the Senate."
