But I feel like the communications on this continues to be botched every time you turn around.

It's the most significant change to recommendation since the lockdowns began over a year ago. And the administration is hoping that it will encourage more Americans to get vaccinated.

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Oh, I think -- look, its welcome news. I think it's late in coming. I think they could have done this a long time ago. I think many of the states are well ahead of where the CDC is, and I do feel like this -- look, I'm not saying that they don't have challenges in terms of a public health crisis, I get that. But I feel like the communications on this continues to be botched every time you turn around. They'll say one thing, for example, you remember, the CDC said schools can be open and then four days later it was like, well, actually school can't be open. Well, why? What happened between them was -- the only thing I can think of is that it's politics because it wasn't like new science came forward and said schools can be open and kids are spreading it. That didn't happen. So I'm hoping that people will take this as (inaudible). I noticed today when I walked from my apartment to here, people that were fully vaccinated, no one was wearing a mask. We were all like walking around. And so maybe it will give people the confidence they need or incentive in order to do that. But right now I feel like, you know, they botched so much of the communication over and over again that this, I don't know, maybe people won't believe it or they'll maybe continue to listen to state officials who have already said you don't have to wear a mask when you're outside and vaccinated. The last thing is on the optics, I mean, that is a really good point. Why are you -- if you're going out there to make a statement about how you can -- I mean, without a mask if you are fully vaccinated, why are you walking up there like that? But that's -- the one that takes the cake was when he wore the mask during the Zoom meeting at the climate summit. When you're by yourself in a Zoom, I'm pretty sure you do not need to wear a mask and I am not, well, I don't think you have to ask the CDC about that. I just think that's common sense."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

I was thinking to myself we were worried a few weeks ago about a coming fourth wave, but now it looks like with the vaccines, really, everybody getting vaccinated, I think more than half now of the eligible Americans who have vaccine or had at least the first shot. Is it the case that we can say that the vaccines are winning out and Biden as president, therefore, is winning this big fight?"

      "utterance": "The American people are winning the war, period. And the Biden -- Biden and Co. need to do more to encourage people to go out and get those vaccines. Twenty-two percent in that Fox News poll said that they didn't plan to get it. So what did they do today? They came out and told the American people they could do something that they've been doing for the last year without being vaccinated."

I was e-mailing with a very prominent doctor. If you've been vaccinated, they should come out and say you can be surrounded by other people who have been vaccinated inside. You can go eat dinner. You can be inside someone's home. You can go to a party. That it's the -- right now, case numbers and hospitalizations are low like a mild flu in this country. So, where are we with this? I just think that it is a reluctance to give away power accumulated in government over the last year. Why do it in dribs and drabs? There are still more than half the states have public mask mandates in place. Get rid of them. Get rid of them. Let them -- are they going to be Neanderthals too, absolutely. The only thing that's going to come out of this announcement today is surely some left-wing lunatics are going to start picking fights with people who are out in the streets not wearing masks, the self-appointed shame police, the screeching pod people (inaudible) demanding proof of your vaccine. It's going to be a nightmare in New York."

So, Greg, I was thinking, you know, I wonder if Biden should acknowledge that Donald Trump played a big role in terms of getting the vaccine in place and the reason I was thinking that, Greg, because I think lots of people picking up on Dagen's point, who are refusing to get vaccinated are older Trump supporters. And so, I'm thinking, well, if he gave credit to Trump, would those people then say, okay, I'll go get vaccinated?"

And likewise, we're not going to wait for the media or some wonks to tell us it's 100 percent safe. We understand the common sense, right? Outside, no mask. You want to wear one, go for it, no one cares. If you're vaccinated and you're inside, no mask. But if you're in a crowded place indoors and you don't want people to stare at you, wear a mask. But that's up to you. But if you're in church and you're vaccinated, don't wear a mask. If you're in a car alone, no mask, you look stupid. If you're jogging, if you're cycling, if you're horseback riding, no freaking mask. If you're going into a restaurant and you don't want the hostess to play cop when you walk in, where the mask. Here is the problem. You don't want other people playing the cop, right, because the government has taken something incredibly simple that humans can decide for themselves and they're creating confusion and unnecessary conflict. We understand it, we get it. Whenever the government starts creating regulatory laws, they create an opportunity for conflict that creates the worst kind of outcome. So you think about selling loose cigarettes, right? No cop wanted to arrest a man for selling loose cigarettes, but that's a law. You start creating little public police officers that run around and they're like the pandemic cop, you're going to have tons of problems. Lastly, what kills me about this is this isn't the biggest pandemic problem, it's the smallest one, which should be handled by us. We handle the small ones, government handles the big ones. What's the big one? The national crime wave, right? We have murders, we have assaults, we have grand larceny. You could -- are you laughing about it? Juan, only you would laugh about murder?"

I don't need the government to tell me that I don't need to or do need to wear a mask. I don't wear a mask outside anymore, but about 90 percent of people in Manhattan still wearing it. And I'm thinking it doesn't have anything to do with the virus. I'm thinking there might just be shy insecure people that like covering their face. I'm serious. I think there is a certain segment of the population that enjoyed wearing the mask, enjoyed covering up and does not want to see -- have people see them maybe when they are not looking so good.

I think you can always find one disturbed person, an addict or a thug to, you know, behave badly with a police officer. Today, we also have going on in this country, people up in arms in North Carolina because apparently a black man was shot in the back of the head in North Carolina. We also have a black librarian in her 60s driving to a funeral, yanked out of her car, her wig pulled off and she's pushed around on the ground by cops. So, I think we can cite both sides. I just don't want the extremes. I like what Dana was just saying a moment ago. Let's look for where there is reason and where we can find solutions. And I think that, you know, there is no question about the level of injustice that black people suffer disproportionately at the hands of the police. But I think that when you look at Tim Scott, when you look at Cory Booker, when you look at Karen Bass, they are really working to try to get police reform done this time.

But I would say that if Pompeo had disclosed classified Israeli military intelligence to the Russians, we would have already had hearings dialed up and potentially special counsel triggered.

But in fact, you had some Israeli generals and others before this tape supposedly took -- was taped, saying, yes, it was Israel that was involved. So, what you're hearing from the Iranian Foreign Minister doesn't quite make sense. But I mean, to me, when you talk about, you know, this right-wing going after John Kerry. They don't like John Kerry. It just worries me. You know, like, last week, we had the hamburger story. Oh, Biden is going to take your hamburger.

I think you have to get like 12 percent of the previous people who voted in a previous election to come out. You can do that. But it's hard to defeat somebody who's that popular at this moment. With regard to the census numbers, people thought California was going to lose more. So, the Democrats are breathing a big sigh of relief right now. They thought it was going to -- they were going to lose more in Florida and it just didn't happen."

They happen a million times per year, the mishaps are statistically rare, but the media doesn't care or they will lie about the statistics. Last year, Dana, according to the FBI, there were 10 million police arrests last year, a hundred -- 1,004 police-involved fatalities. 41 were unarmed, nine Black, 19 White, more whites by percentage of arrests.
