She has said that the teachers union will have a seat in Joe's White House for as long as he's here. And their policies, as you could see, were all being created by the teachers union. And I fought this for eight years in New Jersey, Jesse, and we need to stand up because it's even worse now. I'll give you one quick example. In Randolph, New Jersey, the Board of Education voted to remove the names of all holidays, off of the calendar, because they want us to name Columbus Day, Indigenous Persons Day, and we're getting pushed back.

Claudette made landfall in Louisiana this morning, causing flash floods and some isolated tornadoes. Parts of Florida and Georgia are under a tornado watch tonight. Claudette is expected to sweep through the Carolinas tomorrow. Meantime, several West Coast states are under excessive heat warnings through the weekend as high as soar into the triple digits. At least nine people were heard when a pickup truck plowed into a group of cyclists in Arizona. It happened at a charity bike race in the town of Show Low. Police say the truck driver was shot by responding officers when he tried to get away. Six victims and the suspect are listed in critical condition. Top Republicans rally in Florida at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference. Several speakers including Governor Ron DeSantis hammered the Biden administration on border security, crime, and the economy. This year's event was dubbed \"Road to Majority\" as the G.O.P. sets its sights on winning back the House and Senate in next year's midterm elections. Juneteenth celebrations taking place across the country today, including a march in Galveston, Texas. The events commemorate June 19, 1865 when enslaved African-Americans in that city received the news that they were free. It has since become the longest running African-American holiday in our nation's history. This year's celebrations took on even more significance after Congress and President Biden moved to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. I'm Jon Scott.

When Bill Clinton won in 1992, they overreached. We took back the Congress in '94 with Hillary Care. In 2008, Barack Obama wins, he overreaches with Obamacare and many other things, and we take back the Congress again. And it was nowhere near what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are doing here.

We feel abandoned.\" And when those men and women feel abandoned, they simply cannot do their job, when they feel like they're the problem rather than the people committing crimes because that's what Democratic politicians here in New Jersey and all across the country are saying, that's a huge problem.

Yet more people per capita died in New Jersey than anywhere else in the United States. People already know this, they're recognizing it. They're frustrated, they're angry.

She has said that the teachers union will have a seat in Joe's White House for as long as he's here. And their policies, as you could see, were all being created by the teachers union. And I fought this for eight years in New Jersey, Jesse, and we need to stand up because it's even worse now. I'll give you one quick example. In Randolph, New Jersey, the Board of Education voted to remove the names of all holidays, off of the calendar, because they want us to name Columbus Day, Indigenous Persons Day, and we're getting pushed back. So, they said, we're removing Memorial Day, we're removing Labor Day, we're removing Veterans Day. This is insanity, and this is what's going on.

But what I will say is, having had COVID, seeing how random it is in the way it goes after you and having a number of members of my family, two in fact, die from COVID and young people, it seems to me that taking the vaccine is like putting on your seatbelt. You know, it can't guarantee you that if you get an accident, you're not going to get hurt or killed. But it makes it much, much less likely.

LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"NO AGENDA\": Yes, they are exceptionally well- trained and this group is -- their name is the Elite Group and what they are enforcers for Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, which is CJNG, and they are -- you know, they specialize in targeted assassinations, executions, kidnappings, and all the rest of it. And this gear isn't just for show, Jesse. They're wearing cell phone jammers on their uniforms, which are critical because many of the cartels are now -- have now adopted a tactic that terrorists in the Middle East have used very successfully, which is targeting people with drones and using drones to drop bombs on, you know, opposing cartels and on the Mexican Armed Forces. I've experienced a little taste of that on the battlefield in Mosul with the Iraqi Special Operations troops fighting to take back Mosul. I was with a Commander who was being hunted by these drones, and I can tell you, it's pretty terrifying and very effective. So, they use the cell phone jammers to stop those attacks. They use them to prevent people from calling for help or calling for their families, when they are -- you know, when they're doing kidnappings. And they also use them for, you know, very sophisticated maneuver operations on the battlefield where they can mask their routes, they can mask their attacks, and also they can mask their exfil from, you know, the way they exit it difficult situations."

Claudette made landfall in Louisiana this morning, causing flash floods and some isolated tornadoes. Parts of Florida and Georgia are under a tornado watch tonight. Claudette is expected to sweep through the Carolinas tomorrow. Meantime, several West Coast states are under excessive heat warnings through the weekend as high as soar into the triple digits. At least nine people were heard when a pickup truck plowed into a group of cyclists in Arizona. It happened at a charity bike race in the town of Show Low. Police say the truck driver was shot by responding officers when he tried to get away. Six victims and the suspect are listed in critical condition. Top Republicans rally in Florida at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual conference. Several speakers including Governor Ron DeSantis hammered the Biden administration on border security, crime, and the economy. This year's event was dubbed \"Road to Majority\" as the G.O.P. sets its sights on winning back the House and Senate in next year's midterm elections. Juneteenth celebrations taking place across the country today, including a march in Galveston, Texas. The events commemorate June 19, 1865 when enslaved African-Americans in that city received the news that they were free. It has since become the longest running African-American holiday in our nation's history. This year's celebrations took on even more significance after Congress and President Biden moved to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. I'm Jon Scott.

Tonight, one of the world's most controversial hackers has a warning for the U.S.A. We are in big trouble. \"Sabu\" Hector Monsegur is a former hacker behind the anonymous Lulz hacking collectives. They attacked places like the Senate, Visa, and Mastercard. They called themselves hacktivists. In 2011, Hector hacked the F.B.I., and he got caught. He became an informant. And after serving time in jail and being banned from the internet for years, he turned things around. Now, he hacks for good to help people. Here with why the U.S. should be worried, former Black Hat hacker Hector Monsegur. All right, Hector, what is the United States missing with this new cyber war it seems like we're now involved in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HECTOR MONSEGUR, FORMER HACKER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a great question. We do not have enough people to deal with the threats. We don't have enough law enforcement that actually understands cyber, and all of the organizations that I've worked with around the nation and we see the news all the time, you know, still haven't reached a certain threshold in their security posture. So, we're going to continue to see these attacks just happen every day, and as they get worse and worse, it'll be exponential."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So remember, we launched Space Force. Do we need like a new cyber war department like a separate from the Department of Defense, just to beef up with a bunch of hacktivist people like yourself, maybe ex Black Hat hackers to show us what to do to handle these Russians?"

    {
      "speaker": "MONSEGUR",
      "utterance": "Well, we do have CISA, right? And there's other organizations around there. We do have the Computer Emergency Response teams and all sorts of organizations. The thing is that we kind of need to work together. I think that for a long time, the U.S. government has relied heavily on Federal contractors, which I have no problem with, for the most part. I think they've improved over the years. But we still need more outside help. That's for sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So, from a strategic perspective, when Joe Biden hands Putin a list of our top 16 targets that we don't want the Russian hackers to touch, does that sound like something maybe we shouldn't have done from a former hacker's perspective?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MONSEGUR",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think it's a good idea. But the truth of the matter is, and I'll be very honest with you, most of the sophisticated actors will go around those targets. So you know, yes, they may have a list of 16 targets or more, but then they will find equivalence, counterparts within the same industries, and just target those, and still create the same sort of chaos. Yes, that's pretty much, you know, what we need to be concerned about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So when you hacked the F.B.I., how did they catch you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MONSEGUR",
      "utterance": "Well, it wasn't necessarily attacking the F.B.I. directly, it was again, going around right, if you go around the target and they caught me because of bad operational security. I mean, I really didn't care to get caught and that's kind of -- it led to my downfall. I think at that point in my life, I wanted to be caught, and, you know, start my life anew. But, you know, the one thing I would have to say, Mr. Watters is that, a lot of these threat actors, you know, their modus operandi shifts pretty much daily. Their strategies and techniques, tools and procedures are constantly lifted from open source technologies or from each other. So, it's very hard to make attribution claims for a lot of these attacks, which is problematic for not only the government, but for yourself as a journalist."

You print it at home, let dad know a signed copy will be on his steps, July 6th. And obviously, you haven't gotten dad a gift, I know. It's the day before. It's very hard to shop for dad. So head to savetheworldbook.com and you can go do that right now. And guess what? I did the same thing for my dad. I gave my dad for Father's Day my book. So Happy Father's Day, dad. I love you very much. Great father. Obviously, I turned out fantastic. And you taught me a little bit how to write, and now, I have a book. Thank you. Go read it. That's all for tonight.
