It was inflated by Obama to include able-bodied workers up to 400 percent of the poverty line. So this is completely out of its original intent. The fight now, and the reason a lot of moderate Republicans are scared is because under this bill it goes from 400 percent down to 350 percent. This is a marginal retrenchment of what makes you eligible for Medicaid. And people are used to what was. They don't want to give it back. That's the reason that Obamacare repeal is in trouble. The country is not where it was seven years ago. It's the reason that the left usually wins, because when you hand out goodies since the New Deal, it is extremely hard to bring them back.

Even with the differences that Republicans have in how to deal with it, that indicates if we do the following, the cost of health care is going to come down. We are going to bring transparency to pricing. We are going to have hospitals having to post what a colonoscopy costs here versus what one costs there. We're going to bring the prices down like it occurred for Lasik eye surgery to every common surgery in the United States, that's what's going to happen. I think if a really good strong communication strategy on a free-market approach to health care was done, I think you'd have a much better look at the public approval polls for both the Republicans and for Obamacare. I think that was absent here. I think it's part White House failure. I think its part Congressional Republican failure.

It's not the lack of coordination between the House and Senate. It's the fact that Medicare was inflated. It was supposed to be for women and poor children and the disabled. It was inflated by Obama to include able-bodied workers up to 400 percent of the poverty line. So this is completely out of its original intent. The fight now, and the reason a lot of moderate Republicans are scared is because under this bill it goes from 400 percent down to 350 percent. This is a marginal retrenchment of what makes you eligible for Medicaid. And people are used to what was. They don't want to give it back. That's the reason that Obamacare repeal is in trouble. The country is not where it was seven years ago. It's the reason that the left usually wins, because when you hand out goodies since the New Deal, it is extremely hard to bring them back. That's the core issue here."

They have been voting for this in Congress for seven years, and they said just give us the House, give us the Senate. All we need is the White House. And they got it. And if they don't deliver on this, this is the political bind they're in because their voters expect them to do this. And there are many Republicans who think if they can't get this done, they are not going to get tax reform and they're not going to get any of the other things that they want to do."

      "utterance": "Can they govern or not? I disagree that we've had great communications on Obamacare. A year ago Obamacare was a lot less popular than it is today. We elected President Trump. We have the Republicans in the House and Senate. And we don't have a communication strategy nationwide? Even with the differences that Republicans have in how to deal with it, that indicates if we do the following, the cost of health care is going to come down. We are going to bring transparency to pricing. We are going to have hospitals having to post what a colonoscopy costs here versus what one costs there. We're going to bring the prices down like it occurred for Lasik eye surgery to every common surgery in the United States, that's what's going to happen. I think if a really good strong communication strategy on a free-market approach to health care was done, I think you'd have a much better look at the public approval polls for both the Republicans and for Obamacare. I think that was absent here. I think it's part White House failure. I think its part Congressional Republican failure. There is a lot of wonky think tank guys in Capitol Hill, but they don't speak in practical terms that most people can understand. That's a failure, and the Democrats of course are exploiting it."
