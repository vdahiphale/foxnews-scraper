Another huge day of breaking news. We have a lot to get to. President Biden giving his big speech on COVID and he's getting very defensive over the surge on omicron cases. Kamala Harris stepping in it again after contradicting the White House on a key issue. And after Biden's agenda went up in flames, the squad pushing a radical plan for the president to still Build Back Better. But first, President Biden trying to convince Americans everything is under control as cases of COVID spike. The president with more harsh words for the unvaxxed while touting his response to the pandemic.",

And all of a sudden, I was like, wait, are we really in that same situation? And the answer is no. He kept saying, wait, wait, don't panic but FEMA is on its way. And so I took a step back and I said listen, remember Governor Cuomo? He was like you have to send ventilators, you have to send help or people are going to die, yelling at President Trump, and what happened? He sent a military ship. It went unused. He sent thousands of ventilators, they went unused. Here we are now nearly two years later. We are not in the same situation. Yes, omicron is highly transmissible, you are seeing cases surge across the country especially here in the northeast. We're still battling delta. But here's the thing, the hospitalization rate is less than a third of what it was in the last winter. And then not to mention, what it was initially. What we have to look at is yes, our hospital stressed right now. Absolutely. It was stressed pre-omicron. Whys is that? That's because people weren't going in getting their medical care. This is a government made problem because of -- they shut it down. They didn't allow surgeries and other things that they considered to be voluntary to be done. And not to mention the fact that you have thousands of doctors, nurses and other hospital staff and health care workers who have either quit or been fired because of this mandates. If you want to focus on helping hospitals, these are the ways that you do it. And while President Biden was correct, yes, the cases and hospitalizations and deaths are being fueled by those 50 and above who are unvaccinated, the better thing to do right now is this tailored approach. We need to target the vulnerable, get them vaccinated, get them boosted, and do everything we possibly can to get treatments to the market because -- to keep people out of the hospital. That's what we can do. Make sure there are workers there and keep patients out of the hospital. We have a lot of treatments that are anywhere from 30 to 90 percent effective at keeping people from being hospitalized with COVID. If they are given early on so patients need access to testing, their primary care doctors, and they need to expedite getting these treatments to patients.",

Somebody tell him to stop whispering, that it is not effective and it is off-putting. He looked like he was auditioning to be a commentator on CNN talking about wrong and moral purveyors was. We know who he's trying to cast aspersions at. He clearly thinks his job is done as president because he did nothing to placate the fears of Americans. He needed to change the narrative because we're going to -- probably a few days away from having one million positive cases of COVID in this country, just to like maybe by next week. So, start -- shift away from talking about, as Greg has said, as we have said for nearly two years, case numbers, and switch to hospitalizations and deaths, and how it's much better than it was. Talk about the 95 percent of elderly Americans over 65 who have gotten least one shot. Talk about -- so, get away from that. And it would help him not only to preach safety and security to the American people, but also like the political narrative. Because a million cases, can you imagine the anvil being hung around Donald Trump's neck if he was still the president? So politically, it helps him. But why aren't their tests? Ari Fleischer tweeted this. He states have $1 trillion. Why don't you have testing capabilities in these states? Because they don't know what they're doing.",

One of the reasons that you don't have workers at the hospital for example because of its highly transmissible. I felt that the speech could have been given and should have been given last night. A quick evening speech, go do it at 6:30 p.m., let everybody have their evening because 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon, that's for roundtables on electric vehicles and charging stations. That is not the time to say like this is so serious. The other problem is that we're technically in year three of the pandemic and the testing thing is still not good enough. And you can say that the Trump administration didn't hand you a good enough testing thing. Fine. Okay. But now you are 12 months in. And the testing is still this bad and no one is lighting a fire under the FDA. You can find a test anywhere at CVS or anything. If you want to travel, you got to get a test so that you can get on. You want to make sure grandma and grandpa are okay, you got to get a test. But where are you going to get a test? And it becomes just anxiety producing.

November 8th, the South Africans said, hey, we got a mutation. We're going to keep an eye on it. So that's November 8th. It's December 21st today. December 1st, the first one in America.

And it's creating psychosomatic symptoms. I'm very suggestible. One minute I feel great. The next, I think I'm dying. This is insane. This is -- the point I'm making is, this is a panic from the top down. It's not from above. It's not a typical hysteria that you would get about some kind of strange phenomenon. This is a reverse hysteria. It's coming from government bureaucracy, right? So the problem here is that you have a mild but highly contagious strain that almost everybody is getting.

But we have a government bureaucracy that is terrified of losing an election and terrified of litigation. So what now is not a death panic, it's a hassle panic because we all want to go home and be with our families and they're screwing us over. But, what this intense panic tells you, the government is not an appropriate vehicle anymore for telling us what to do. They are done because the vehicle only has one speed and its panic. It's driven by one incentive, re-election. It's not driven, it's not skewered towards risk management. Adults understand risk management. You saw that with Biden. He doesn't understand it. He believes that there should be zero risk. That is a child mentality. So it is up to us to pick the date. I've been having a conversation with Scott Adams. We decided that the date for this is February 1st. We are the hostage negotiators on behalf of America to discuss with the government about what to do since no one else has volunteered. We have to talk to the government about a return to normalcy because they are not going to do it. They are too cowardly. So it's up to us to actually say this is what we want.

You could also blame the Trump administration, CDC, FDA, and NIH who had an inability to test early on and the fact that they weren't able to give us accurate information early on in the pandemic. You can also blame the teachers lobbying union powerhouse that kept children out of school to their detriment. And what about the Biden administration? The fact that children are still being kept out of school despite the fact that he says they shouldn't be but he's not coming down hard on the schools that are closing right now and the fact that we still can't test. But I do agree with her that Americans are not to blame for this pandemic. And while they should continue to encourage vaccination and boosting, at this point it needs to be a targeted approach saying here -- you have access to this, this is the information, but this is what we can do, expand access to treatments and allow people to move on, make sure we target those vulnerable, and those high risk but allow the rest of the population to move on.

Another huge day of breaking news. We have a lot to get to. President Biden giving his big speech on COVID and he's getting very defensive over the surge on omicron cases. Kamala Harris stepping in it again after contradicting the White House on a key issue. And after Biden's agenda went up in flames, the squad pushing a radical plan for the president to still Build Back Better. But first, President Biden trying to convince Americans everything is under control as cases of COVID spike.

      "utterance": "You know, Jesse, it felt like a little bit like deja vu, taking us back to spring 2020. We're talking about FEMA. We're talking about military help all coming in. And all of a sudden, I was like, wait, are we really in that same situation? And the answer is no. He kept saying, wait, wait, don't panic but FEMA is on its way. And so I took a step back and I said listen, remember Governor Cuomo? He was like you have to send ventilators, you have to send help or people are going to die, yelling at President Trump, and what happened? He sent a military ship. It went unused. He sent thousands of ventilators, they went unused. Here we are now nearly two years later. We are not in the same situation. Yes, omicron is highly transmissible, you are seeing cases surge across the country especially here in the northeast. We're still battling delta. But here's the thing, the hospitalization rate is less than a third of what it was in the last winter. And then not to mention, what it was initially. What we have to look at is yes, our hospital stressed right now. Absolutely. It was stressed pre-omicron. Whys is that? That's because people weren't going in getting their medical care. This is a government made problem because of -- they shut it down. They didn't allow surgeries and other things that they considered to be voluntary to be done. And not to mention the fact that you have thousands of doctors, nurses and other hospital staff and health care workers who have either quit or been fired because of this mandates. If you want to focus on helping hospitals, these are the ways that you do it. And while President Biden was correct, yes, the cases and hospitalizations and deaths are being fueled by those 50 and above who are unvaccinated, the better thing to do right now is this tailored approach. We need to target the vulnerable, get them vaccinated, get them boosted, and do everything we possibly can to get treatments to the market because -- to keep people out of the hospital. That's what we can do. Make sure there are workers there and keep patients out of the hospital. We have a lot of treatments that are anywhere from 30 to 90 percent effective at keeping people from being hospitalized with COVID. If they are given early on so patients need access to testing, their primary care doctors, and they need to expedite getting these treatments to patients."

Somebody tell him to stop whispering, that it is not effective and it is off-putting. He looked like he was auditioning to be a commentator on CNN talking about wrong and moral purveyors was. We know who he's trying to cast aspersions at. He clearly thinks his job is done as president because he did nothing to placate the fears of Americans. He needed to change the narrative because we're going to -- probably a few days away from having one million positive cases of COVID in this country, just to like maybe by next week. So, start -- shift away from talking about, as Greg has said, as we have said for nearly two years, case numbers, and switch to hospitalizations and deaths, and how it's much better than it was. Talk about the 95 percent of elderly Americans over 65 who have gotten least one shot. Talk about -- so, get away from that. And it would help him not only to preach safety and security to the American people, but also like the political narrative. Because a million cases, can you imagine the anvil being hung around Donald Trump's neck if he was still the president? So politically, it helps him. But why aren't their tests? Ari Fleischer tweeted this. He states have $1 trillion. Why don't you have testing capabilities in these states? Because they don't know what they're doing."

And still the CDC protocols I think are still way too stringent especially for this particular variant. They're saying you swab to isolate for 10 days. One of the reasons that you don't have workers at the hospital for example because of its highly transmissible. I felt that the speech could have been given and should have been given last night. A quick evening speech, go do it at 6:30 p.m., let everybody have their evening because 2:30 p.m. in the afternoon, that's for roundtables on electric vehicles and charging stations. That is not the time to say like this is so serious. The other problem is that we're technically in year three of the pandemic and the testing thing is still not good enough. And you can say that the Trump administration didn't hand you a good enough testing thing. Fine. Okay. But now you are 12 months in. And the testing is still this bad and no one is lighting a fire under the FDA. You can find a test anywhere at CVS or anything. If you want to travel, you got to get a test so that you can get on. You want to make sure grandma and grandpa are okay, you got to get a test. But where are you going to get a test? And it becomes just anxiety producing. The thing that was really missing from the speech and it has been for a while is hope and optimism."

The other problem is there is nothing new or different. Mark Halperin has a newsletter he puts out every morning and he pointed out that last month, the White House did a fact sheet on COVID and then they did one for today's speech and the lead paragraphs are the exact same. And we are not in the same exact situation. When you are the president of the United States, you have the ability to convene different people, call people. Why not go and do something different or maybe stand there with a Republican. Imagine that. Like find some Republicans that are willing to stand with you."

So I think that the headlines you're going to see in the morning are just more of the same, which is why their numbers are going down. They just feel like there is no way for them to move. The other problem -- my last point is, when they say that they were surprised by the variant -- it makes me so mad because for the last two, now we're in year three, learning about viruses again, we all know that they mutate. November 8th, the South Africans said, hey, we got a mutation. We're going to keep an eye on it. So that's November 8th. It's December 21st today. December 1st, the first one in America. So you know exactly what's going to happen. We saw it happen with delta. There -- it's already here. So now we're having all these right before Christmas and there are still no test? I really think that that fall squarely on them."

You have no idea. I just sent home what, four - - four employees? Stress is peaking. It's a combination of holiday stress, a combination of hassles that you have to deal with when you're traveling. And they are adding this on top. So there is an environment of panic gushing through the city, going through our offices that is 100 times worse than omicron. Its nuts. And it's creating psychosomatic symptoms. I'm very suggestible. One minute I feel great. The next, I think I'm dying. This is insane. This is -- the point I'm making is, this is a panic from the top down. It's not from above. It's not a typical hysteria that you would get about some kind of strange phenomenon. This is a reverse hysteria. It's coming from government bureaucracy, right? So the problem here is that you have a mild but highly contagious strain that almost everybody is getting. You get tested, it's going to come positive. That's what is happening with everyone I know. But the only tool that we have is a sledgehammer. So we have the testing and then what we do is we send everybody home."

Now we're doing it. And it turns out if you get this thing, it's as tolerable as a cold. Most of the people that I know that have it had sniffles and that's it. But we have a government bureaucracy that is terrified of losing an election and terrified of litigation. So what now is not a death panic, it's a hassle panic because we all want to go home and be with our families and they're screwing us over. But, what this intense panic tells you, the government is not an appropriate vehicle anymore for telling us what to do. They are done because the vehicle only has one speed and its panic. It's driven by one incentive, re-election. It's not driven, it's not skewered towards risk management. Adults understand risk management. You saw that with Biden. He doesn't understand it. He believes that there should be zero risk. That is a child mentality. So it is up to us to pick the date. I've been having a conversation with Scott Adams. We decided that the date for this is February 1st. We are the hostage negotiators on behalf of America to discuss with the government about what to do since no one else has volunteered. We have to talk to the government about a return to normalcy because they are not going to do it. They are too cowardly. So it's up to us to actually say this is what we want. February 1st, we are done."

And you can't have the President of the United States asking you to characterize your own family members as being enemies. I mean, obviously, my family members are vast and boosted. They would have submitted to the clinical trials of Warp Speed if they could have. But there are people who have mothers and fathers and cousins that are unvaxxed and you can't ask people to say that these people are enemies right now. Biden is an old-school politician, divide and conquer. It's only knows. You divide people by race, by gender, by social class, and you only have to get 50.1 percent and then you ride that majority. That doesn't work in a pandemic. You're trying to get as many people on your side as possible, so he has to unite.

I will say though that, I don't know, I think there is some blame that could go around. I mean you look at the CCP and they suppressed whistleblowers, they kept -- concealed information. You could also blame the Trump administration, CDC, FDA, and NIH who had an inability to test early on and the fact that they weren't able to give us accurate information early on in the pandemic. You can also blame the teachers lobbying union powerhouse that kept children out of school to their detriment. And what about the Biden administration? The fact that children are still being kept out of school despite the fact that he says they shouldn't be but he's not coming down hard on the schools that are closing right now and the fact that we still can't test. But I do agree with her that Americans are not to blame for this pandemic. And while they should continue to encourage vaccination and boosting, at this point it needs to be a targeted approach saying here -- you have access to this, this is the information, but this is what we can do, expand access to treatments and allow people to move on, make sure we target those vulnerable, and those high risk but allow the rest of the population to move on.

Because she was showing a modicum of political independence by just simply saying I'm not vilifying and demonizing the unvaccinated. Because as Greg pointed out, Black voters and Latino voters, voters of color, there's vaccine hesitancy in those groups of people along with a White Trump voters. So, she was -- she was making a very calculated decision. You can almost see her inside her own head of where I'm going to go with this. And I think the tell was the interview that she did with Charlamagne as badly as it ended, it was still very focused on issues that matter to voters of color. And she is staying focused on that.
