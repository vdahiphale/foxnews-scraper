So they don't want to believe that Iran has this long history of escalations. Right? They want to believe that Trump started this fight. They don't want to look back in history since 1979. They don't want to look - since the JCPOA was signed, since they tested multiple nuclear capable missiles, since they quadrupled funding to Hezbollah, since they more than doubled their own funding to the IRGC, since they instigated multiple civil wars, the list goes on. And, again, started - killed an American citizen, took down a U.S. drone, boarded U.S. Navy vessels and orchestrated an attack against our embassy. They want to ignore all that. And when we finally react, when we finally say enough is enough, we are a superpower. We are the United States of America. We will not let this stand.

And God, I tell you what, Martha, I'm absolutely sick of this. We shouldn't be this way. We should be unified. Every member of Congress should be calling for free Iran. The Iranian people are more like us than you realize. The regime is so evil. But these people want freedom. 1,500 of them gave their lives fighting that regime not too long ago. They are not unified against United States.

The - any escalation of military presence, the fact that we - there was discussion of going to war, people were fearful.

Legal analysts were undecided if the device was meant to gain sympathy for potential jurors, relief from a bad back, or a little of both. It certainly did not target the hard strings of Judge James Burke who aggressively called out Weinstein for using his cell phone in court saying, quote, \"is this really the way you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life by texting and violating a court order?\" That prompted Weinstein's defense team to accuse the judge of bias and ask that he recuse himself. The judge refused saying, he's not biased and was only trying to scare Weinstein. Of the 240 potential jurors who showed up, at least 100 have been dismissed for various reasons including some who know Weinstein's family, friends, and others who in the post Me Too world said they could not be impartial. Still, the judge hopes to have 12 jurors and six alternates by late next week. But before a single juror in New York had been questioned, events in Los Angeles upended Weinstein's legal team when the L.A. district attorney abruptly filed additional charges, alleging that Weinstein raped one woman and sexually assaulted another woman in separate incidents on consecutive days back in February of 2013. In New York, the disgraced movie producer is on trial for allegedly raping a woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a production assistant in 2006. The allege victim from 2006 will reportedly testify. Opening statements are expected later this month and the trial itself could take a few months. We saw the first delay this week when a prosecutor got something in her eye and had to make an emergency eye doctor run. Finally, the movie mogul's trial might also include movie stars. Charlize Theron and Salma Hayek have been listed as possible witnesses. Martha?",

The Democrats know that, but they keep using the straw man argument, like, \"don't send us to war.\" We're not going to war. This President has no intention of going to war. There isn't this false choice between doing nothing and letting ourselves get punched in the face, letting our American citizens die, letting our embassies get attacked, and going to full scale war? There's options in between, like taking out the guy who's responsible for that attack and reestablishing our deterrence. I'm so tired of these false talking points and the sloganeering that is absolutely meaningless, and she knows it. That's what's so frustrating."

      "utterance": "Yes, that's fair. I mean, we should never be overly optimistic. But with all the facts that we have now, it does appear like we've reestablished deterrence in a pretty effective way. We've forced the Iranians to recalculate. We've drawn very clear red lines. They're no longer escalating rapidly in violence. I saw that clip from Elizabeth Warren about \"why now?\" OK, Elizabeth Warren, I've got an answer for you. The reason why now is because Soleimani just orchestrated an attack on our embassy, killed an American citizen. And we had very good intel, from the CIA, from the DNI, from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They said it was the best - some of the best intel that ever seen that there was an imminent attack coming within days. So Elizabeth Warren, that is why."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So I was going to ask you the answer to that. So I'm glad you brought that up. In terms of Jackie Speier - Congresswoman Speier. She suggests that the action that the President took is more the reason for the tragic crash of this jet were 176 people killed, more so than then the Iranian missile that was - that the decision was made to send that Iranian missile or perhaps it was a system that was just seeking anything that was incoming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRENSHAW",
      "utterance": "That's such a disgusting, and deplorable accusation. I'm reluctant to even address it, but we have to, because they keep saying it. Pete Buttigieg, a presidential candidate said something similar. The implication was similar, that somehow this is our fault. So this this relies on a false premise that history begins with Donald Trump's actions. And the Democrats often believe this. So they don't want to believe that Iran has this long history of escalations. Right? They want to believe that Trump started this fight. They don't want to look back in history since 1979. They don't want to look - since the JCPOA was signed, since they tested multiple nuclear capable missiles, since they quadrupled funding to Hezbollah, since they more than doubled their own funding to the IRGC, since they instigated multiple civil wars, the list goes on. And, again, started - killed an American citizen, took down a U.S. drone, boarded U.S. Navy vessels and orchestrated an attack against our embassy. They want to ignore all that. And when we finally react, when we finally say enough is enough, we are a superpower. We are the United States of America. We will not let this stand. The Democrats wring their hands and look to blame the United States. And when the Iranians make a very tragic mistake, and it is extremely tragic. It really is that they downed their own airliner and we know why it happened. But to blame us for that is so absurd, and frankly immoral, and they know it. And God, I tell you what, Martha, I'm absolutely sick of this. We shouldn't be this way. We should be unified. Every member of Congress should be calling for free Iran. The Iranian people are more like us than you realize. The regime is so evil. But these people want freedom. 1,500 of them gave their lives fighting that regime not too long ago. They are not unified against United States. They are more emboldened now against their regime, and they will be even more emboldened if we would actually act like the freedom loving people that I know we are and supported them with moral support."

      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "One, is that we should be united as a country. But there is a response - there's a very - a Senator - famed Senator - Republican Senator from Michigan, that was an isolationist, but in the late 40s, worked with President Truman and said, \"politics should stop at the ocean's edge.\" But, I also think that the President's got a responsibility to communicate with the Congress, which is not his strength. The - any escalation of military presence, the fact that we - there was discussion of going to war, people were fearful. Republicans and Democrats, Independent, Americans were worried about what the possible consequences would be. This general was a very evil man. He was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans and other people from around the world. But we don't - its - peace requires diplomacy. It happens in a very bigger picture. President Bush, President Obama had looked at potential similar actions and were concerned about the consequences. So we learned today from - for the President talking to someone in the media that he was worried about four other embassies. Why couldn't they have said that in the congressional briefing? I think it's really important that we improve communication. And I do believe that any military escalation, any discussion of war has to come to the Congress, and I will do anything I can to prevent war."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. If the President says that he wants to prevent war too. And he says that this action was one that was required by an imminent threat, as you just mentioned. And he's elaborated, given a little bit more information on that in an interview with Laura Ingraham that people will hear later tonight where he says, that according to the intelligence, that there were four embassies that were potentially the targets of all of this. So, you know, when you look at that information, and also what he said last night at the rally that he did in Ohio, where he felt that, if he had started going to members of Congress and saying, \"Oh, look, we have this opportunity, should we meet? Should we talk about it later?\" should we - he was afraid that it might leak that the moment which is considered to be a target of opportunity, as its termed by our intelligence agencies, could be missed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "So I would say to him, that there has been a precedent that you consult or you brief, the big - the eight, so that the four leaders of the House Intelligence and the Senate Intelligence Committee. I think that he should have simply have done that. We need to ensure that congressional leadership is included. And when people say that people don't care, when I was home Monday, I had the mothers of men and women that are serving overseas scared to death. I had young people saying to me, is there going to be a draft? I left Michigan, going back to Washington very rattled at how worried just people were. So we need to remember that everybody was concerned and we should be concerned. But we need to be united because that we're Americans. We are not Republicans or Dems."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But we're so - you know, we are so divided, and the President brought up Adam Schiff by name, and he would have been included in that small group that you're talking about. Do you believe that Adam Schiff and the President's relationship could, you know, get past the differences that they've had over impeachment? And do you believe that Adam Schiff would have kept that information completely confidential and would have allowed the President to take the action that he felt was necessary based on the intelligence. Do you believe that I believe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",

Masih Alinejad, author of the \"Wind in My Hair,\" \"My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran,\" joins me now exclusively to respond to this story and to Ilhan Omar. Masih, welcome back. Good to have you here this evening. We'd like to present all sides of the stories here. And your side of the story, I think, is one that does not get told as much as the other side.

They see him as a warmonger, as a war criminal. And that is why I got a lot of attacked by the Islamic lobbyist and she actually shared the, one of the defamatory article against me. But, Martha, what bothered me is that, I reached out there a lot. I sent a message to Ilhan Omar, I wrote on Twitter. I wrote an article on \"Washington Post\" and invited her to join us and show solidarity several time. Once when six women of White Wednesdays got arrested just because of protesting compulsory hijab and other time 29 women in Iran got arrested in one day just because of protesting compulsory hijab. And I asked Ilhan Omar to join us and show solidarity. She was silent. And another time when my brother was taken hostage by the Revolutionary Guard, I reached out her, silence again. And I - my mother was interrogated for three hours just because of my activities, again, she was silent. 1,500 people got killed. She was silent. Right now 176 people got killed in suspicious situation in Iran in a Ukrainian airplane. She's silent."

She break - she broke her silence when I criticized the Islamic Republic, because I am the same person I criticized President Trump in \"Washington Post\" about travel ban, which separated me from my son in the U.K. I haven't seen my son for two years. When I criticized President Trump, why didn't attack me? When I criticized President Trump when he said that he's going to bomb cultural site, nobody attacked me. But as soon as I criticize the criminals of Islamic Republic, and I called them warmongers and I called them terrorists, I called them religious dictatorship, then the Islamic lobbyist here, they attack us--"

I started my work when Obama was in power. And I have to say my dream is to be in my own country. The government of Iran kicked out a lot of journalists, and many journalists for BBC Persian, for Voice of America Persian, for radio free Persian for Manoto TV in London, for Iran International. That doesn't mean that we are working for any kind of government. I criticized bravely President Trump. I took women's march in the New York Street. That day was the best day in my life, because I thought this is the first time that I am protesting against the President, nobody kicked me out from my - the media that I work.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Because, we spoke to Democrats on this program, they all said, the President is going to do it again. He's going to talk to another world leader, he's going to affect the election for 2020. We need to impeach him right away. We can't wait for these legal processes to play out for John Bolton or Mick Mulvaney or any of these witnesses. They can't wait. Then all of the sudden it was like they had nothing but time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of people are still trying to figure out what this whole thing was all about. The fact is, Nancy Pelosi says that she will end this holdout, sounds like it's going to be next week. Probably after the Democratic debate on Tuesday night, that she'll end the holdout without getting what she said she had to get. And she wanted assurances. She wanted to know that the Senate trial will be quote, \"fair.\" And she had to know how the trial would work before she could appoint the managers and send the articles over, and that just didn't happen. So what we've seen now that she has done sided to give in on this is, is that there have been various sort of declarations of victory by some Democrats who said, well, this hold - it prevented Mitch McConnell from summarily dismissing the whole impeachment, which was not going to happen anyway. It provided time for more evidence to emerge. Now, the evidence - there has been new evidence in this and it's come out on its own and would come out anyway. I think maybe the most persuasive one is that some Democrats believe that Pelosi, by doing this, rattled the President, kind of got under his skin, messed with him a little bit, and maybe she just wanted to do that."

They were doing their constitutional duty. She was doing it prayerfully and with a heavy heart. And then, wow, it appeared that she was playing games with the timing on this. So you're going to hear more about this from the President, even when she does finally send these articles over to the Senate and a trial begins. Republicans will say that this holdout, which didn't seem to have a whole lot of purpose, show that Democrats - House Democrats who started this whole thing were not serious about what they were doing."

They're working the rest of the time, and they'll have to be in the Senate. And remember, if the trial does start next week - the Clinton trial took four, five or six weeks to finish.

This trial -- this trial though deals specifically with charges that Weinstein raped a woman in 2013 and sexually assaulted another in 2006.

      "utterance": "Martha, even those who expected high drama during this trial were a bit surprised that the rapid-fire headlines generated in week one, which began with Harvey Weinstein entering court hunched over a walker. Legal analysts were undecided if the device was meant to gain sympathy for potential jurors, relief from a bad back, or a little of both. It certainly did not target the hard strings of Judge James Burke who aggressively called out Weinstein for using his cell phone in court saying, quote, \"is this really the way you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life by texting and violating a court order?\" That prompted Weinstein's defense team to accuse the judge of bias and ask that he recuse himself. The judge refused saying, he's not biased and was only trying to scare Weinstein. Of the 240 potential jurors who showed up, at least 100 have been dismissed for various reasons including some who know Weinstein's family, friends, and others who in the post Me Too world said they could not be impartial. Still, the judge hopes to have 12 jurors and six alternates by late next week. But before a single juror in New York had been questioned, events in Los Angeles upended Weinstein's legal team when the L.A. district attorney abruptly filed additional charges, alleging that Weinstein raped one woman and sexually assaulted another woman in separate incidents on consecutive days back in February of 2013. In New York, the disgraced movie producer is on trial for allegedly raping a woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a production assistant in 2006. The allege victim from 2006 will reportedly testify. Opening statements are expected later this month and the trial itself could take a few months. We saw the first delay this week when a prosecutor got something in her eye and had to make an emergency eye doctor run. Finally, the movie mogul's trial might also include movie stars. Charlize Theron and Salma Hayek have been listed as possible witnesses. Martha?"

      "utterance": "New fallout tonight after the dramatic Megxit by the duke and duchess of Sussex. Buckingham Palace confirming that Meghan Markle returned to Canada while Prince Harry stayed back for discussion with the queen. That will be comfortable -- who reportedly told them not to do this, not to go public with this announcement just yet. Here now, Neil Sean, U.K. media correspondent. He's covered the royal family for years and years. Neil, good to see you tonight."

      "utterance": "So, word is that Prince Charles has sort of suggested that they could get cut off financially. They have marketing opportunities perhaps that they are investigating here. Who is to blame? Is this Meghan's idea or Harry's idea? What are you hearing?"

      "speaker": "SEAN",

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "Apparently, though, it's a joint idea. But what the feeling over here in England is simply this, you know, Harry is a bit of a sap, you know, he's being played for all he's worth. And consequently, if you look today, Meghan has gone back to Canada to see the baby, obviously look after the child. However, leaving Harry here to face the music and face the music he will because of course, her majesty, the queen now wants to see him in person alongside Prince Charles. So, I think if she had any merit and any thought about how this would be played out across, you know, the U.K. taxpaying public that fund the British royal family --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, they haven't been married that long. I mean, how about could it possibly be they're not even, you know, used to this whole process yet? So, boy, that's going to be quite a picture that somebody is going to want to snap in the British tabloids when he's driving to Buckingham Palace to have this conversation. How serious is the queen about this? What you are hearing about her reaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, you know, Martha, she's disappointed. Simply because, you know, when you think about how she welcomed Meghan into the royal family, you know, she let Meghan stay at Sandringham at Christmas. That was the first, you know, never been done before."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Before they were married. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, precisely. And then, you know, we saw trying to integrate whether on the royal train -- she's done everything I think differently to what she did previously to try and make sure that there was a welcoming into the royal family. I think her majesty herself really is really disappointed by the way this is played out, but more disappointed, possibly I would believe, in Prince Harry. She's always that a very soft-spoken. She's always known that he is more vulnerable than William. And when you look also at Catherine and William, you know, that's the reason why they fell out last year, that's the real ongoing feud. This has been building and building. Apparently, though, William did sort of start this off."

      "utterance": "Yes."
