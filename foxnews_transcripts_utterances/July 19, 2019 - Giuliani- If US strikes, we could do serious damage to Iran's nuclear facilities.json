Breaking just moments ago, the U.S. defense secretary, he just authorized the deployment of military personnel to Saudi Arabia as the U.S. now moves to counter the hostile state, the rogue regime of Iran. U.S. Central Command is increasing surveillance in the Straits of Hormuz tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now, Sky News reports out of Britain that the United Kingdom is advising ships to stay away from the Straits of Hormuz for an interim period. Major developments, a lot of breaking news. And at this hour, all eyes are on the Middle East. Iran's hyper aggressive actions in the region, around the world have reached a boiling point. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me speak tonight, stop for a second with the news. I want to speak directly to the Iranian mullahs. I want to tell you, I have known President Trump for 20 -- well, about 23-plus years. Let me tell you what's not going to happen to help you out tonight and what could happen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You keep pushing this button, and I can promise you the president is never going to engage in a boots on the ground, long protracted conflict. No. He is going whatever -- if he acts, he is going to act and it's going to be over quickly. That's my prediction. And you have been warned. It will be over and it will be over quickly. That is my prediction to the Iranian mullahs. So, you'll keep acting the way you're acting, and you will see like we've been right on so many over the years. We will be right on that prediction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we all know if we're going to be honest tonight, we know the prime minister. We know the mullahs in Iran know it. I know the President Trump knows it that the prime minister of Great Britain is weak. President Trump is not weak. If he decides to act, it will be over quickly. And let me add one other thing, you will lose. Today, the rogue regime seized two British tankers sailing in international waters. One ship was ultimately released. The other vessel and its crew are now held hostage by Iranian forces. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just the latest in a string of illegal seizures of tankers passing through the Straits of Hormuz, three in the past six days alone, including a Panamanian-flagged ship from the UAE and a Liberian-flagged ship owned by the U.K. And it's just more hostile action from a malignant government that is just hell-bent on sowing chaos and extremism and terrorism all over the world. We're going to have a lot more in this very important developing story throughout tonight's monologue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've got to first take a break.

And just a couple days ago, an Iranian drone was downed by a U.S. Navy ship after coming perilously close to our vessel after numerous warnings. Let's not forget, Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. At this very moment, radical Islamic militants all over the world are collecting a paycheck from the mullahs of Iran. This hostility cannot and will not stand. The president was very clear today in his warning. I will repeat what I said. The mullahs in Iran, I promise you, if you push this too far, this is not going to be a long conflict. The president will act decisively and it will be over quickly.

      "sentences": "The president was right about Iran, as is the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. What happens next is incredibly important for a number of reasons. Two specifically: one, the Straits of Hormuz is the single most important artery for the world's oil supply and its most narrow point, very narrow point. The strait is only 21 miles wide with shipping lanes of two miles in either direction. That is how precise you have to be. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, it is bordered to the north by Iran and on the south by the UAE in Oman. That little skinny piece there -- well, that connects all of the oil-rich gulf states to the Indian Ocean. And thankfully, because of the president's pro-energy policies as he mentioned today, we are now less reliant on Middle Eastern oil than at any time in modern history. Now, let me add this. This has been the Straits of Hormuz, the most strategically important venue for the free-flow of oil at market prices. Of course, oil represents the life blood of every economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Since Donald Trump has been president, now for the first time in 75 years, America is energy independent.

Any disruption has a district impact on the global oil market and the price you pay at the pump but every economy, the worldwide economy. And tonight, something much more important at play than the price of oil, and that is the protect of international commerce, because right now, at this hour, the safety, the security of the free world is at stake. The mullahs of Iran have stated clearly, numerous times, numerous occasion, they want to wipe the United States of America off the face of the map. They want to wipe Israel off the face of the map. They chant \"death to America, death to Israel\". Their stated main goal is an Islamic caliphate that controls the world. The sick, twisted, convert or die mindset. The Iranian regime has killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and tens of thousands of innocent civilians all over the Middle East. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They are the world's number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism. As we speak, they're fighting numerous proxy wars with armed Islamic militants in multiple countries across the globe. These are the facts. And now, they desperately want a nuclear weapon. This must and can never happen. Look, it's a simple mathematical formula. A squared plus B squared equals C squared. If you have radical Islamists that believe in a caliphate, convert or die, and you add B squared, weapons of mass destruction, well, that is a clear and present danger to the world which could result in a modern day holocaust. This cannot happen. Now, Hannity, is this hyperbole? Is this scare tactic? No. I wrote a book called \"Deliver Us From Evil\". if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's look at the history of the world in the last century alone, where almost 100 million human beings slaughtered, let's see, in the name of communism, fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan. We've got the killing fields in Cambodia and Pol Pot and it goes on and on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All of our lives depend on radical Islamic militants like the mullahs in Iran not getting nuclear weapons. That it's serious for the world. And tonight, let me be very clear, I want to be very clear, I am not calling for war. I'm not calling for one American boot on the ground in Iran. Frankly, I think that would be a really dumb idea. America doesn't want or need another years and years long bloody war. The president has been more than clear, he will not have that and that is not his stated foreign policy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, I don't want to send any of this country's precious treasure, members of our U.S. forces to fight and die in Iran, especially after the wars of Vietnam, Iraq are politicized. We send kids to fight wars, then the wars were politicized by these idiot politicians in Washington, D.C. that stop thinking about winning the war. We don't fight to win these wars anymore. And then, in a sick, ugly twisted way, like in the Biden-Obama years, we handcuff our military with insane rules of engagement. Wow, we're going to tell the military what to do from Washington? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One thing has become very, very clear -- Iranian aggression must and it will be stopped eventually. Iran's nuclear ambitions must be extinguished. And they must never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. It's that simple. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At some point, probably in the near future, the United States will have to use our highly advanced and capable weapons to take out every possible nuclear site inside of Iran. It's that simple. That's why the president's urgency for his military build-up after the decline of the military and the Biden-Obama years was crucial and necessary. Year one, the president spent $718 billion for the next generation of American weaponry, $700 billion in year two. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, we've got to learn from our mistakes. Politicians can no longer be trusted to win wars. That's why I have been saying for quite a bit of time now, that America must be forward-thinking. We must build the next generation of weaponry offensive and defensive. So, that means we can easily, when necessary, counter hostile regimes and in this case that would be the Iran mullah’s ambitions for nuclear weapons. Now, future wars with the next generation of weaponry that the brightest minds in the world are creating, future wars can be fought by pushing buttons in an office in Tampa. We have already seen that generation at its very infancy stage. It will become more so sophisticated. We will lead the way and it will also lead to defensive weapons so that people can't do it to us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, no more old-school boots on the ground, door-to-door fighting by American sons and daughters only to politicize it later and say, never mind. No nation building and hoping that we can change the hearts and minds of evil regimes. No more bribing dictators. Oh, Bill Clinton, this is a great deal for the American people, while he made a deal Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un's father, bribing him. And, of course, the bribe of -- well, the dumbest thing ever in the history of foreign affairs of the United States, that would be the Biden-Obama Iranian deal where they took $150 billion in cash and other currencies and put it on cargo planes and they dropped it in a tarmac for the mullahs in Iran. Is that not the dumbest thing any politician, president, vice president has ever done? Here's a fact. Bribing dictators is never going to work. Temporary nuclear deals with zero accountability when you don't have anywhere any time inspections, that's not going to work either. And you better believe the world, our enemies, people that want to see a weakened America, China's watching tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The hostile regime of Russia -- by the way, we can bring Russia and Putin to their knees tomorrow if we just out-produce the energy and get it our Western European ally. It's over for them. Putin, Russia will be on their knees. No more Russian interference. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } North Korea is watching tonight. What happens in Iran will have ramifications all over the globe. So, the question is, how did we get here. Time for a quick history lesson. 2015, Obama and Biden loosened sanctions, a dumb idea, on Iran. And as we just mentioned, they gifted the mullah’s cargo planes of cash. In exchange, the government of Iran promised not to build nukes for, well, ten years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course, the radical Islamic extremist government of Iran continued to fund terrorism with our money all over the world. They continue to chant death to Israel, death to America. They continue to be the number one state sponsor of terrorism around the world and thanks to Biden-Obama, well, they had cash to burn. And that means this all changed. Donald Trump was sworn in as president. He's not Biden, he's not Obama and I'll be very frank, he knows, the world knows, he's not Theresa May either, who I think, the president knows, even the Iranians know, is weak. He pulled the United States out of that horrific Iranian nuclear deal, reimposed devastating sanctions. Iran's economy is in a freefall and because of the reimposed sanctions, they're facing years-long recession. And meanwhile, inflation is spiraling out of control. It's working. The president's policies are working. This year alone, it will likely top 40 percent. Iran is clearly feeling the pain, so this saber-rattling, desperately wanting to disrupt the world's supply of oil to force more money in a new deal on their terms. That is not going to happen under President Trump. I can tell you 100 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The U.S., well, we're going to send -- their nuclear program if they push this, I promise the mullahs of Iran, it will be over and over quickly and your nuclear ambitions will be in the Stone Age. You'll be sent a message that any new deal will be on America's terms. And obviously, this is incredibly serious situation. Lives are at stake. The free world is at stake. We have to think about the consequences for Israel if we take action. But, today, the mainstream media, they don't care about any of that. They spend all of their time asking the questions, absurd, the president, absurd questions about Congresswoman Omar and the squad and accused them of racism. I'll show that later in the program. Journalism is dead and buried. Each day, they just keep digging in, and digging in and digging in. And it's critically important news to cover. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now, Fox News contributor, retired CIA senior intel officer, 30 years CIA analyst and officer, Dan Hoffman. Fox News military analyst, Colonel David Hunt. Let's go to you, Colonel, and ask you, OK, do you agree with my assessment? I've known the president 23 years. I probably have interviewed him more than anybody else in media today. He is committed. There won't be boots on the ground. If he does act, he's going to win. It will be over fast.

GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALYST, \"WITCH HUNT\" AUTHOR: See, he signed three of the four. So - look, I looked at these questions. They are so inane and pointless that they're almost laughable. For example, he wants Mueller to be asked \"Isn't it true that the Trump organization explored a construction project in Moscow?\" Well, yes, he's a developer. That's not a crime. Another one was, \"Well, isn't it true that the Trump campaign met with a Russian lawyer?\" Well, yes, but that's not a crime. My favorite though is, \"Isn't it true that a Trump associate heard a rumor that the Russians had Hillary Clinton's e-mails?\" Well, yes, but it's not a crime to hear a rumor. It's very tempting to dismiss. Comey is a guy who just doesn't know anything about the law. He thinks everything is a crime somehow. But it's more than that. He is a malevolent and pernicious, partisan, and the audacity of a guy. Remember, he's the guy who stole government documents that were privileged, leaked them to the media to trigger the Special Counsel, and now he has the temerity to pen a column of here are the questions that the Special Counsel should be asked.

Breaking just moments ago, the U.S. defense secretary, he just authorized the deployment of military personnel to Saudi Arabia as the U.S. now moves to counter the hostile state, the rogue regime of Iran. U.S. Central Command is increasing surveillance in the Straits of Hormuz tonight. And now, Sky News reports out of Britain that the United Kingdom is advising ships to stay away from the Straits of Hormuz for an interim period. Major developments, a lot of breaking news. And at this hour, all eyes are on the Middle East. Iran's hyper aggressive actions in the region, around the world have reached a boiling point. Let me speak tonight, stop for a second with the news. I want to speak directly to the Iranian mullahs. I want to tell you, I have known President Trump for 20 -- well, about 23-plus years. Let me tell you what's not going to happen to help you out tonight and what could happen. You keep pushing this button, and I can promise you the president is never going to engage in a boots on the ground, long protracted conflict. No. He is going whatever -- if he acts, he is going to act and it's going to be over quickly. That's my prediction. And you have been warned. It will be over and it will be over quickly. That is my prediction to the Iranian mullahs. So, you'll keep acting the way you're acting, and you will see like we've been right on so many over the years. We will be right on that prediction. Now, we all know if we're going to be honest tonight, we know the prime minister. We know the mullahs in Iran know it. I know the President Trump knows it that the prime minister of Great Britain is weak. President Trump is not weak. If he decides to act, it will be over quickly. And let me add one other thing, you will lose. Today, the rogue regime seized two British tankers sailing in international waters. One ship was ultimately released. The other vessel and its crew are now held hostage by Iranian forces. Just the latest in a string of illegal seizures of tankers passing through the Straits of Hormuz, three in the past six days alone, including a Panamanian-flagged ship from the UAE and a Liberian-flagged ship owned by the U.K. And it's just more hostile action from a malignant government that is just hell-bent on sowing chaos and extremism and terrorism all over the world. We're going to have a lot more in this very important developing story throughout tonight's monologue. We've got to first take a break. We've got the very latest developments from our West Coast newsroom. Tonight, our own Trace Gallagher. Trace, a lot happening just in the last 15 minutes."

      "utterance": "Yes, Sean. Those additional military resources you mentioned in Saudi Arabia are on top of numerous bombers, battleships and a carrier strike group already in the Persian Gulf. Of course, this all ramped up today when the British flagged oil tanker Stena Impero which has a crew of 23 was in the Strait of Hormuz headed towards Saudi Arabia when it was approached by Iranian small boats and a helicopter. Iran's Revolutionary Guard later said the ship was seized for noncompliance with international maritime laws, which is a vague blanket charge that offers no specific violations. The British ship is now in an Iranian port, but the company that owns the tanker says it has been unable to contact any crew members. And less than an hour after the Stena Impero was seized, the Liberian tanker Mesdar with a crew of 25 was also held by Iranian forces. But now, as you mentioned, we're told the Mesdar has been set free to continue its journey. Here's British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Watch."

The U.S. Navy brought down the drone by using an electronic jamming device to disable it. Iranian officials say the drone is not theirs. The Pentagon says it is. And today, President Trump said this about the latest escalation. Look."

But we do have another piece of breaking news to report tonight with our own Catherine Herridge. According to Catherine's sources tonight, Nellie Ohr who was working with Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS is now a top target of a congressional investigation. Joining us now more with this huge news, Catherine Herridge. Catherine, you've been great on this story from the get-go. This is a big part of the puzzle tonight."

      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, the significant developments. Sources tell Fox News that House Republican investigators are seeking the opposition research from Nellie Ohr that focused on the Trump family. Nellie Ohr testified on the hell at the end of last year, she told lawmakers that she was willing to provide the research that focused on then-candidate Donald Trump, his children and the first lady specifically, any foreign travel and foreign contact. Ordered the opposition research on the Trump family for Fusion GPS, the same firm behind the DNC, Clinton funded dossier. Nellie and her husband, Bruce, who also testified on the Hill last year, go to the heart of the genesis of the FBI Russia probe. Bruce Ohr was demoted at the Justice Department because of his relationship with Fusion GPS. And as you reported broadly, in the fall of 2016, he became the back channel to the FBI for the unverified dossier. Sources tell Fox News that House Republican investigators want to understand if Nellie Ohr's research got to the FBI or got into the Steele dossier. Fox News reached out to her attorney and asked if she was still willing to provide the research if she needs a subpoena and what accounts for the six-month delay, but there was no immediate comment, Sean."

Tonight, the British, they're working to free its tanker that was seized by Iran in international waters. Of course, this act of aggression is not isolated in anyway, shape, matter or form. Remember, not long ago, Iran shot down a U.S. surveillance drone that was flying in international airspace. And just a couple days ago, an Iranian drone was downed by a U.S. Navy ship after coming perilously close to our vessel after numerous warnings. Let's not forget, Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. At this very moment, radical Islamic militants all over the world are collecting a paycheck from the mullahs of Iran. This hostility cannot and will not stand. The president was very clear today in his warning. I will repeat what I said. The mullahs in Iran, I promise you, if you push this too far, this is not going to be a long conflict. The president will act decisively and it will be over quickly. I am 100 percent confident. Take a look."

And remember this, the agreement, the ridiculous agreement made by President Obama expires in a very short period of time. It was a short-term agreement. When you're dealing in countries, you have to deal in 50 years and 100 years. You don't deal in the short term. It was a ridiculous agreement. It goes to show you, I was right about Iran."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "The president was right about Iran, as is the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. What happens next is incredibly important for a number of reasons. Two specifically: one, the Straits of Hormuz is the single most important artery for the world's oil supply and its most narrow point, very narrow point. The strait is only 21 miles wide with shipping lanes of two miles in either direction. That is how precise you have to be. Now, it is bordered to the north by Iran and on the south by the UAE in Oman. That little skinny piece there -- well, that connects all of the oil-rich gulf states to the Indian Ocean. And thankfully, because of the president's pro-energy policies as he mentioned today, we are now less reliant on Middle Eastern oil than at any time in modern history. Now, let me add this. This has been the Straits of Hormuz, the most strategically important venue for the free-flow of oil at market prices. Of course, oil represents the life blood of every economy. Since Donald Trump has been president, now for the first time in 75 years, America is energy independent. We're now officially a net exporter of energy. It is less strategically important those straits than ever before. Now, nearly 20 percent today of the world's oil supply is shipped through those narrow Straits of Hormuz. Any disruption has a district impact on the global oil market and the price you pay at the pump but every economy, the worldwide economy. And tonight, something much more important at play than the price of oil, and that is the protect of international commerce, because right now, at this hour, the safety, the security of the free world is at stake. The mullahs of Iran have stated clearly, numerous times, numerous occasion, they want to wipe the United States of America off the face of the map. They want to wipe Israel off the face of the map. They chant \"death to America, death to Israel\". Their stated main goal is an Islamic caliphate that controls the world. The sick, twisted, convert or die mindset. The Iranian regime has killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and tens of thousands of innocent civilians all over the Middle East. They are the world's number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism. As we speak, they're fighting numerous proxy wars with armed Islamic militants in multiple countries across the globe. These are the facts. And now, they desperately want a nuclear weapon. This must and can never happen. Look, it's a simple mathematical formula. A squared plus B squared equals C squared. If you have radical Islamists that believe in a caliphate, convert or die, and you add B squared, weapons of mass destruction, well, that is a clear and present danger to the world which could result in a modern day holocaust. This cannot happen. Now, Hannity, is this hyperbole? Is this scare tactic? No. I wrote a book called \"Deliver Us From Evil\". Let's look at the history of the world in the last century alone, where almost 100 million human beings slaughtered, let's see, in the name of communism, fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan. We've got the killing fields in Cambodia and Pol Pot and it goes on and on. All of our lives depend on radical Islamic militants like the mullahs in Iran not getting nuclear weapons. That it's serious for the world. And tonight, let me be very clear, I want to be very clear, I am not calling for war. I'm not calling for one American boot on the ground in Iran. Frankly, I think that would be a really dumb idea. America doesn't want or need another years and years long bloody war. The president has been more than clear, he will not have that and that is not his stated foreign policy. And, by the way, I don't want to send any of this country's precious treasure, members of our U.S. forces to fight and die in Iran, especially after the wars of Vietnam, Iraq are politicized. We send kids to fight wars, then the wars were politicized by these idiot politicians in Washington, D.C. that stop thinking about winning the war. We don't fight to win these wars anymore. And then, in a sick, ugly twisted way, like in the Biden-Obama years, we handcuff our military with insane rules of engagement. Wow, we're going to tell the military what to do from Washington? One thing has become very, very clear -- Iranian aggression must and it will be stopped eventually. Iran's nuclear ambitions must be extinguished. And they must never be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. It's that simple. At some point, probably in the near future, the United States will have to use our highly advanced and capable weapons to take out every possible nuclear site inside of Iran. It's that simple. That's why the president's urgency for his military build-up after the decline of the military and the Biden-Obama years was crucial and necessary. Year one, the president spent $718 billion for the next generation of American weaponry, $700 billion in year two. And tonight, we've got to learn from our mistakes. Politicians can no longer be trusted to win wars. That's why I have been saying for quite a bit of time now, that America must be forward-thinking. We must build the next generation of weaponry offensive and defensive. So, that means we can easily, when necessary, counter hostile regimes and in this case that would be the Iran mullah’s ambitions for nuclear weapons. Now, future wars with the next generation of weaponry that the brightest minds in the world are creating, future wars can be fought by pushing buttons in an office in Tampa. We have already seen that generation at its very infancy stage. It will become more so sophisticated. We will lead the way and it will also lead to defensive weapons so that people can't do it to us. In other words, no more old-school boots on the ground, door-to-door fighting by American sons and daughters only to politicize it later and say, never mind. No nation building and hoping that we can change the hearts and minds of evil regimes. No more bribing dictators. Oh, Bill Clinton, this is a great deal for the American people, while he made a deal Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un's father, bribing him. And, of course, the bribe of -- well, the dumbest thing ever in the history of foreign affairs of the United States, that would be the Biden-Obama Iranian deal where they took $150 billion in cash and other currencies and put it on cargo planes and they dropped it in a tarmac for the mullahs in Iran. Is that not the dumbest thing any politician, president, vice president has ever done? Here's a fact. Bribing dictators is never going to work. Temporary nuclear deals with zero accountability when you don't have anywhere any time inspections, that's not going to work either. And you better believe the world, our enemies, people that want to see a weakened America, China's watching tonight. The hostile regime of Russia -- by the way, we can bring Russia and Putin to their knees tomorrow if we just out-produce the energy and get it our Western European ally. It's over for them. Putin, Russia will be on their knees. No more Russian interference. North Korea is watching tonight. What happens in Iran will have ramifications all over the globe. So, the question is, how did we get here. Time for a quick history lesson. 2015, Obama and Biden loosened sanctions, a dumb idea, on Iran. And as we just mentioned, they gifted the mullah’s cargo planes of cash. In exchange, the government of Iran promised not to build nukes for, well, ten years. Of course, the radical Islamic extremist government of Iran continued to fund terrorism with our money all over the world. They continue to chant death to Israel, death to America. They continue to be the number one state sponsor of terrorism around the world and thanks to Biden-Obama, well, they had cash to burn. And that means this all changed. Donald Trump was sworn in as president. He's not Biden, he's not Obama and I'll be very frank, he knows, the world knows, he's not Theresa May either, who I think, the president knows, even the Iranians know, is weak. He pulled the United States out of that horrific Iranian nuclear deal, reimposed devastating sanctions. Iran's economy is in a freefall and because of the reimposed sanctions, they're facing years-long recession. And meanwhile, inflation is spiraling out of control. It's working. The president's policies are working. This year alone, it will likely top 40 percent. Iran is clearly feeling the pain, so this saber-rattling, desperately wanting to disrupt the world's supply of oil to force more money in a new deal on their terms. That is not going to happen under President Trump. I can tell you 100 percent. The U.S., well, we're going to send -- their nuclear program if they push this, I promise the mullahs of Iran, it will be over and over quickly and your nuclear ambitions will be in the Stone Age. You'll be sent a message that any new deal will be on America's terms. And obviously, this is incredibly serious situation. Lives are at stake. The free world is at stake. We have to think about the consequences for Israel if we take action. But, today, the mainstream media, they don't care about any of that. They spend all of their time asking the questions, absurd, the president, absurd questions about Congresswoman Omar and the squad and accused them of racism. I'll show that later in the program. Journalism is dead and buried. Each day, they just keep digging in, and digging in and digging in. And it's critically important news to cover. Joining us now, Fox News contributor, retired CIA senior intel officer, 30 years CIA analyst and officer, Dan Hoffman. Fox News military analyst, Colonel David Hunt. Let's go to you, Colonel, and ask you, OK, do you agree with my assessment? I've known the president 23 years. I probably have interviewed him more than anybody else in media today. He is committed. There won't be boots on the ground. If he does act, he's going to win. It will be over fast. You agree with me?"

A military strike to go after that won't work."

Now, as you mentioned, Sean, that's not where we want to go. We would like to talk the off ramp to negotiations. Iran is practicing nuclear brinkmanship, mounting increasingly aggressive attacks against us in the Persian Gulf, enough they think to induce us to eliminate the sanctions which are crippling Iran's economy. But we know that's not going to happen."

And I think the colonel was saying, couldn't we effectively take them out 100 percent? Maybe we would need nuclear weapons for that. But the point is, we could set them back five or ten years. I'd be happy with that. If we could make it impossible for them to develop nuclear weapons in the next five to 10 years, I'm convinced there'll be regime change there. I mean, it could happen this year or next year. The other thing that's underestimated - and I saw significant video evidence of this, and I have a couple of interviews I want to show you.

And this is fact. You can see it. You also see signs. I saw several signs of men selling their kidneys for $500 in order to feed their families. So they're in significantly difficult trouble. So if we - if we had to hit them back - and I agree, that should be the last resort. We could do serious damage to all of their nuclear facilities. We take some of them out. We set the others back five or 10 years. We also should immediately take out their naval capacity so they stop screwing around with the Strait of Hormuz. The U.K. should help us with that or they should resign from NATO (ph)."

But - we've always known that they sort of lean to the left. But what we have seen over the past two years, two-and-a-half years with this Russia coverage has been the most appalling thing I have ever witnessed. And I've been - I've worked for newspapers for 25 years. And I've always - I've always understood that they were sort of left-leaning.

More on this coming up. First, big developments tonight. And our quest to investigate the investigators and expose the deep state efforts to target the President and his family goes as Catherine Herridge reported tonight, GOP investigators, they are continuing to seek records related to Fusion GPS's paid Nellie Ohr - that's right, the wife of Bruce Ohr, the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ back in the day, two demotions. And by the way, her work targeting the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump, and other members of the Trump family just when you thought it couldn't get any more disgusting. And meanwhile, the deep state continues to try to rewrite history like super-patriot Jimmy (ph) Comey published today his own list of questions for former Special Counsel, Mueller, which conveniently excludes questions about his FISA abuse, his spying on the Trump campaign, him using the bought-and-paid-for Hillary dossier that even the FBI concluded 90 percent plus was BS. Here with reaction, author of the upcoming book \"Witch Hunt\", Fox News Legal Analyst, Gregg Jarrett; investigative reporter, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, let's go to the news first. I find this pretty fascinating because Jimmy (ph) Comey, well, he's got a lot of questions I want to ask him, and I'd be glad to send them out to him anytime he wants.

Look, Sean, what's happening here, even with Mueller's testimony with this article that James Comey published today, this is what the military calls the FPF. This is their final protective fire. This is it. This is all they have left. We already know there was obviously no collusion with Russia and the Trump administration or the Trump campaign. Absolutely out of the question. There's been no collusion. We know there was - there was nothing else that the Trump campaign - as far as obstruction of justice, we know there was no obstruction of justice. But what they're trying to prove here, Sean, right now, is they're laying the groundwork for the Democrats to move forward with any kind of impeachment because now they're in the hot seat. There is an investigation. This investigation is wide and expansive with the Department of Justice. We have people looking into not only Comey's actions and the FBI's actions, but into everybody else's actions that was associated with the investigation into President Trump. And this is all the ammunition they have left, and that's what they are trying to do. They are just spreading their ammunition out and hoping that something will save them. And it won't."

Look at Comey tonight, like, the super-patriot who said he never spied. He signed the FISA warrant for spying, but he never spied. How many FISA warrants did Comey sign? GREGG JARRETT, LEGAL ANALYST, \"WITCH HUNT\" AUTHOR: See, he signed three of the four. So - look, I looked at these questions. They are so inane and pointless that they're almost laughable. For example, he wants Mueller to be asked \"Isn't it true that the Trump organization explored a construction project in Moscow?\" Well, yes, he's a developer. That's not a crime. Another one was, \"Well, isn't it true that the Trump campaign met with a Russian lawyer?\" Well, yes, but that's not a crime. My favorite though is, \"Isn't it true that a Trump associate heard a rumor that the Russians had Hillary Clinton's e-mails?\" Well, yes, but it's not a crime to hear a rumor. It's very tempting to dismiss. Comey is a guy who just doesn't know anything about the law. He thinks everything is a crime somehow. But it's more than that. He is a malevolent and pernicious, partisan, and the audacity of a guy. Remember, he's the guy who stole government documents that were privileged, leaked them to the media to trigger the Special Counsel, and now he has the temerity to pen a column of here are the questions that the Special Counsel should be asked. He is insufferable, he is sanctimonious, and I think most people just wish he'd crawl in a dark hole somewhere and go away."

Iran says the ship violated maritime laws and is now being held in an Iranian port. But the company that owns the tanker says it has been unable to contact any crewmembers. A Liberian oil tanker was also seized by Iran today but has now been set free. Today the British Foreign Secretary said, \"If the situation is not resolved quickly, there will be serious consequences,\" and U.S. Central Command says it has aircraft in the Strait of Hormuz that are monitoring and are in contact with U.S. ships operating in the region.
