      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” In general, the left isn't big on admitting things, even obvious things. But in the case of Robert Mueller's congressional testimony yesterday, they really don't have a choice. Tonight, most on the left are conceding, yes, it was a total disaster for their cause. How is Nancy Pelosi reacting tonight? And what does Donald Trump, Jr. think of what happened yesterday? Both of them respond exclusively right here in just a moment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first tonight, The Russia hoax ended yesterday, we can say that. It ended not with a bang, but with the muddled half memories of a fading old man slipping in and out of focus. America set transfixed by Robert Mueller's halting testimony before Congress. No honest person could have come away at the end believing that the President of the United States colluded with the Russian government to steal an election. That was the allegation, you'll remember. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then after the most extensive investigation in modern American history, we found the truth. And so tonight, we can say conclusively, once again, what we told you the day this all started, the whole thing is a crock. It never happened. They were lying to you. That's clear now. The debate is over. But that doesn't mean the Russia story has quite ended. There are loose ends. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For two and a half years, some of the most powerful people in America, supposedly serious, well educated people, very smart people. These people made wild and untrue and totally reckless allegations about issues critical to the life of this country, all on the basis of no evidence whatsoever. It's hard to believe they did that. But they did do it. What should happen to these people now? Congressman Adam Schiff for example. Schiff claimed he possessed actual evidence of Russian collusion, and he didn't just say that one time, he said it repeatedly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Schiff was bluffing, which is to say why lying. He still is actually.

But wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. If Donald Trump is working for a hostile foreign power, as Adam Schiff has told us countless times that he is, how can we not impeach him? No one on CNN asked Adam Schiff to explain that contradiction, unfortunately. Not that it matters, because think about it for a second, and you'll see exactly what's going on. Adam Schiff never believed a word he was saying about Russian collusion. I suppose the good news is Schiff is not delusional. The bad news though, is that Adam Schiff is a soulless liar. He is a man willing to say literally anything for political advantage, and that's really the worst of all, being a lunatic would be much more appealing than that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Naturally, Washington being the place that it is, Adam Schiff has been richly rewarded for his shameless deceit.

And there are a lot of them, the journalists, the pundits, the fellow lawmakers who helped Adam Schiff tell his lies.

Thousands of American troops died in the process, trillions of dollars were wasted. It was the single greatest mistake in this country in generations, and yet -- and here's the key -- nobody in Washington was ever punished for it. The people who planned it went on to even better jobs. One of them is now our National Security adviser, John Bolton. Five years after the Iraq War, our economy collapsed. Remember that?

They skate by on the usual mixture of aggression and BS. \"Nothing to see here, keep moving.\" Imagine for a second, what would happen if you let your kids act like that? Well, they'd been prison by now. So, maybe it's time to stop the cycle in Washington. How about this? If you get caught lying about the big things, whether it's about weapons of mass destruction, or subprime mortgages or Russian collusion, you have to admit it and serve penance, not necessarily prison time, though we're open.

You can't do that. No, sorry. You've got to leave. You've got to relocate to Camden, New Jersey, maybe or Gary, Indiana, and do something useful, like clean motel rooms for minimum wage, put the little \"sanitized for your protection\" strips on toilets. Not forever, just for a decade or two. Until you've learned your lesson.

I mean, I'm watching a guy that led an investigation, he was the head of the F.B.I., he was a former prosecutor, spent two years and almost $50 million investigating it and I see a Congressman ask, \"Let's talk about Fusion GPS.\" \"I've never heard of it.\" I mean, that'd be like a builder talking about not understanding what a foundation is. To not even have a finite understanding of how this all started tells the American public everything they need to know, Tucker. This was a hoax set up by the Democrats from moment number one. It wasn't true. This investigation wasn't about trying to figure out what happened, it was trying to back into the result that they wanted. They couldn't do that, because there was nothing there. But they dragged people through the mud for two years. They spread it in the media ad nauseum without fail. You saw your prior guest earlier today saying the same things. He still may be working with Putin. Yes. Because Donald Trump needed to live his lifestyle -- pretty cool luxury -- to go work for the Russians rather than because he is sick of what's going on in American politics, because he is sick of politicizing every single aspect and being willing to ruin people's lives, send American lives to fight wars for things that don't exist -- all of this nonsense that you talk about, because there's no accountability in Washington, D.C. And I think the American people finally saw it, that this man who was the lead of the major -- the largest investigation in American history, really the largest hoax at this point, he didn't have a fundamental understanding of not only where it began, but what was even involved? How it took place? Ultimately, I think the American public saw that he was put in there as a figurehead because he was the former leader of the F.B.I. He was a decorated Marine, and that he would do what's right. But no one is talking about this guy put in 19 leftist Hillary Clinton donor lawyers, all -- they worked on the Clinton campaign. They went to her what would have been Inauguration Party. They were there celebrating it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He had no idea who was running the ship. The inmates were running the asylum, and those inmates were the Democratic Party who are doing whatever they could to destroy my father's presidency, because they see that he is actually getting things done. He is actually getting things done for the American people. He is actually delivering on the promises that he made. And what I'd love to see as an American, and someone who has really been dragged through the mud myself in this whole hoax, is I'd love to see the Democrats actually do something for Americans for a change, not for their power base, not for the political elite, not for their nonsense, crazy that they're running with these days, but for actual hard working Americans. How about getting the USMCA passed through Congress? How about working on an infrastructure bill? How not doing anything other than trying to destroy my father, who is actually delivering for the people that he said he would deliver for? All American people.",

And that is, from all the pieces that came out and all the pieces that we've collected, we feel like the Democratic Party is the hostile intelligence service here, if you will, that targeted the President and wants to get him removed from office. And if there's anything that was in the purview of Director Mueller, it was to look at Russian influence in the 2016 elections. And in fact, he didn't do that. I mean, what he did is, he took facts from everywhere and that entire report is trying to pin those facts around the idea that the theory that Donald Trump was in bed with the Russians, that is not the way you do an investigation. And we're -- today we sit and yesterday when he concluded his testimony said, one of the real bad things here is they're going to do it again. Well, yes, they are, because he did nothing to stop it. And the F.B.I. did nothing to stop it. And that's what really makes this different. The F.B.I. has been compromised and the facts are very clear. We don't know today, if it's still compromised by the Democratic Party, and too many questions remain unanswered. We don't have time to go into all of them. But let me just give you one little piece of something that we look at when we do counterintelligence investigations like this. You always look at and you ask, who initiated the meeting? In any kind of thing -- who initiated this meeting? With say the target. And so let's take Trump Tower. They all are raving about that terrible meeting at Trump Tower.

He'd met with Perkins Coie, the law firm that was representing the DNC and paying for and filtering money to Christopher Steele to write the dossier. The same law firm, by the way, that would not allow the F.B.I. to get into the DNC network, when we had the e-mails all hacked. This is awful. This is this is very obvious. And I think you'd be hard pressed to find an experienced F.B.I. counterintelligence agent who really knows what they're talking about. I worked Russian counterintelligence for 20 years.

You know, this country's history speaks very strongly about the fact that we have rejected that. We had a Civil War to reject the idea that people should be treated differently because of how they look or for an immutable personal trait, like race or gender. And yet here she is, in the 21st Century, usually railing as we know about the supposed false racism of the President because it's political, and then her own -- and some leftists were actually saying we heard her tone that she was being satirical, when she said that. No, she wasn't, she was being serious. This is a point of view that she felt comfortable presenting before she was a major national figure, and I think that that's what is the truth here. And at the same time, here, you've got a woman of color -- this is another thing that approves -- is that racism and bigotry is equal opportunity. Right? It is not with one group. It's not with one gender, it's not with one race. It is really about a major desire to control and to malign individuals who maybe are more inclined to not necessarily agree with you or believe what you believe. And we've seen historically how that works. You denigrate individuals and others as a problem, you see separate them and in this country, every day we work and we practice being Americans by rejecting, but the very thing she suggested, which is of course we should look at other people and judge them on their race. And then once we do that we should set policy and law enforcement and surveillance on them based on how they appear. It is the antithesis of the American dream.

For example, forbes.com called Epstein one of the quote \"largest backers of cutting edge science around the world,\" no mention of his criminal past. It turns out a PR firm paid a \"Forbes\" contributor $600.00 to attach his name to a pre-written story. In 2013, the \"National Review\" called Epstein a smart businessman with a passion for science, no mention of his passion for underage girls. That story was actually authored by a publicist for Jeffrey Epstein. The \"National Review\" apologized. And finally, \"The Huffington Post\" lauded Epstein for helping scientists thrive. The sex crimes part was not included. Tonight, prison officials are investigating whether Epstein was attacked in jail, staged an attack or tried to commit suicide. He was found Tuesday morning, nearly unconscious with injuries to his neck. Some believe the injuries were self-inflicted to get transferred out of jail. But others say suicide and assault have not been ruled out and another inmate has been questioned.

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” In general, the left isn't big on admitting things, even obvious things. But in the case of Robert Mueller's congressional testimony yesterday, they really don't have a choice. Tonight, most on the left are conceding, yes, it was a total disaster for their cause. How is Nancy Pelosi reacting tonight? And what does Donald Trump, Jr. think of what happened yesterday? Both of them respond exclusively right here in just a moment. But first tonight, The Russia hoax ended yesterday, we can say that. It ended not with a bang, but with the muddled half memories of a fading old man slipping in and out of focus. America set transfixed by Robert Mueller's halting testimony before Congress. No honest person could have come away at the end believing that the President of the United States colluded with the Russian government to steal an election. That was the allegation, you'll remember. And then after the most extensive investigation in modern American history, we found the truth. And so tonight, we can say conclusively, once again, what we told you the day this all started, the whole thing is a crock. It never happened. They were lying to you. That's clear now. The debate is over. But that doesn't mean the Russia story has quite ended. There are loose ends. For two and a half years, some of the most powerful people in America, supposedly serious, well educated people, very smart people. These people made wild and untrue and totally reckless allegations about issues critical to the life of this country, all on the basis of no evidence whatsoever. It's hard to believe they did that. But they did do it. What should happen to these people now? Congressman Adam Schiff for example. Schiff claimed he possessed actual evidence of Russian collusion, and he didn't just say that one time, he said it repeatedly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "And there is significant evidence of collusion. There is ample evidence -- and indeed there is -- of collusion of people in the Trump campaign with the Russians. I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, in the end, you know what happened or didn't. Schiff did not produce the evidence. He didn't have it because it doesn't exist. Schiff was bluffing, which is to say why lying. He still is actually. As of yesterday, Schiff was continuing to claim that the Trump campaign quote, \"embraced foreign, help made use of it and covered it up.\" In other words, collusion. Schiff still believes the collusion hoax or does he? Today Adam Schiff went on CNN to carry water for his boss, Nancy Pelosi. \"Impeachment might not be a great idea,\" he told CNN's viewers. But wait, that doesn't seem to make sense. If Donald Trump is working for a hostile foreign power, as Adam Schiff has told us countless times that he is, how can we not impeach him? No one on CNN asked Adam Schiff to explain that contradiction, unfortunately. Not that it matters, because think about it for a second, and you'll see exactly what's going on. Adam Schiff never believed a word he was saying about Russian collusion. I suppose the good news is Schiff is not delusional. The bad news though, is that Adam Schiff is a soulless liar. He is a man willing to say literally anything for political advantage, and that's really the worst of all, being a lunatic would be much more appealing than that. Naturally, Washington being the place that it is, Adam Schiff has been richly rewarded for his shameless deceit. He is still the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. That's one of most powerful jobs in all of government. Schiff is all but certain to be there for years. But what about his enablers? And there are a lot of them, the journalists, the pundits, the fellow lawmakers who helped Adam Schiff tell his lies. These are the people you'll remember who blithely accused the sitting President of the United States of treason."

      "utterance": "The exchange isn't long, but it really tells you everything you need to know. Pelosi told our show the President is a traitor who is committing treason, and yet, she doesn't want to impeach him. How does that make sense? Well, it only makes sense when you understand that Pelosi doesn't mean a single word that she says. Everything is political, meaning it's only about power. That's not just annoying. It's also ominous. And here's why. Fifteen years ago, this spring, we invaded Iraq to stop a WMD program that didn't exist. Thousands of American troops died in the process, trillions of dollars were wasted. It was the single greatest mistake in this country in generations, and yet -- and here's the key -- nobody in Washington was ever punished for it. The people who planned it went on to even better jobs. One of them is now our National Security adviser, John Bolton. Five years after the Iraq War, our economy collapsed. Remember that? The subprime meltdown? The specific causes were complex, but the themes were instantly recognizable -- greed and stupidity. And yet, once again, no one was ever punished. Now, fast forward another 11 years to today, right now, America stands on the brink of yet more foolish foreign entanglements, and on the brink of and potentially another financial meltdown. Why is that? Because nobody in Washington has learned anything. And why would they learn anything? When they screw up there are never any consequences. They skate by on the usual mixture of aggression and BS. \"Nothing to see here, keep moving.\" Imagine for a second, what would happen if you let your kids act like that? Well, they'd been prison by now. So, maybe it's time to stop the cycle in Washington. How about this? If you get caught lying about the big things, whether it's about weapons of mass destruction, or subprime mortgages or Russian collusion, you have to admit it and serve penance, not necessarily prison time, though we're open. But punishment of some kind. You can't stay in Washington making six times the average American salary. You can't do that. No, sorry. You've got to leave. You've got to relocate to Camden, New Jersey, maybe or Gary, Indiana, and do something useful, like clean motel rooms for minimum wage, put the little \"sanitized for your protection\" strips on toilets. Not forever, just for a decade or two. Until you've learned your lesson. Call us when you've done that, but not before.

They did the criminal investigation of mainly obstruction in order to stop impeachment chatter. And it's not that they wouldn't impeach Trump if they thought they could. But the real purpose of impeachment was the political goal of rendering Trump unelectable by autumn of next year.

After the testimony, my contacts reported that they were beyond disappointed to hear directly from Robert Mueller that his team did not investigate the Steele dossier and whether it was part of the Russian playbook in 2016. They say the key question is where the Russian intelligence operation targeted the dossier's author, former British spy, Christopher Steele. Privately former Intelligence officers have told me, the Russian campaign was likely designed to damage both candidates -- Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- because Moscow's ultimate objective was to tarnish the eventual winner and the office of the presidency. According to this Justice Department memo, Mueller's job was to investigate Russian election interference and related matters, but he testified that the dossier predated his appointment. That's technically true, but the National Security Court extended the surveillance warrant from Carter Page based on the Steele dossier through the summer of 2017, overlapping with Mueller. This exchange from yesterday has not had nearly enough play, and it goes to the heart of the issue."

I mean, I'm watching a guy that led an investigation, he was the head of the F.B.I., he was a former prosecutor, spent two years and almost $50 million investigating it and I see a Congressman ask, \"Let's talk about Fusion GPS.\" \"I've never heard of it.\" I mean, that'd be like a builder talking about not understanding what a foundation is. To not even have a finite understanding of how this all started tells the American public everything they need to know, Tucker. This was a hoax set up by the Democrats from moment number one. It wasn't true. This investigation wasn't about trying to figure out what happened, it was trying to back into the result that they wanted. They couldn't do that, because there was nothing there. But they dragged people through the mud for two years. They spread it in the media ad nauseum without fail. You saw your prior guest earlier today saying the same things. He still may be working with Putin. Yes. Because Donald Trump needed to live his lifestyle -- pretty cool luxury -- to go work for the Russians rather than because he is sick of what's going on in American politics, because he is sick of politicizing every single aspect and being willing to ruin people's lives, send American lives to fight wars for things that don't exist -- all of this nonsense that you talk about, because there's no accountability in Washington, D.C. And I think the American people finally saw it, that this man who was the lead of the major -- the largest investigation in American history, really the largest hoax at this point, he didn't have a fundamental understanding of not only where it began, but what was even involved? How it took place? Ultimately, I think the American public saw that he was put in there as a figurehead because he was the former leader of the F.B.I. He was a decorated Marine, and that he would do what's right. But no one is talking about this guy put in 19 leftist Hillary Clinton donor lawyers, all -- they worked on the Clinton campaign. They went to her what would have been Inauguration Party. They were there celebrating it. He had no idea who was running the ship. The inmates were running the asylum, and those inmates were the Democratic Party who are doing whatever they could to destroy my father's presidency, because they see that he is actually getting things done. He is actually getting things done for the American people. He is actually delivering on the promises that he made. And what I'd love to see as an American, and someone who has really been dragged through the mud myself in this whole hoax, is I'd love to see the Democrats actually do something for Americans for a change, not for their power base, not for the political elite, not for their nonsense, crazy that they're running with these days, but for actual hard working Americans. How about getting the USMCA passed through Congress? How about working on an infrastructure bill? How not doing anything other than trying to destroy my father, who is actually delivering for the people that he said he would deliver for? All American people."

Then, you know Mueller is going to be the savior. We're going to get him this time. They just keep doubling down. Again, because there's no one that's willing to hold them accountable. You know, maybe you, may be Sean in the next hour, a few people, but the mainstream media will still by and large run with just about anything that they tell them. They don't have to be fact based.

And that is, from all the pieces that came out and all the pieces that we've collected, we feel like the Democratic Party is the hostile intelligence service here, if you will, that targeted the President and wants to get him removed from office. And if there's anything that was in the purview of Director Mueller, it was to look at Russian influence in the 2016 elections. And in fact, he didn't do that. I mean, what he did is, he took facts from everywhere and that entire report is trying to pin those facts around the idea that the theory that Donald Trump was in bed with the Russians, that is not the way you do an investigation. And we're -- today we sit and yesterday when he concluded his testimony said, one of the real bad things here is they're going to do it again. Well, yes, they are, because he did nothing to stop it. And the F.B.I. did nothing to stop it. And that's what really makes this different. The F.B.I. has been compromised and the facts are very clear. We don't know today, if it's still compromised by the Democratic Party, and too many questions remain unanswered. We don't have time to go into all of them. But let me just give you one little piece of something that we look at when we do counterintelligence investigations like this. You always look at and you ask, who initiated the meeting? In any kind of thing -- who initiated this meeting? With say the target. And so let's take Trump Tower. They all are raving about that terrible meeting at Trump Tower. That meeting was initiated by Natalia Veselnitskaya. She is the one who called Donald Trump, Jr., not the other way around."

What did Glenn Simpson, the President of Fusion GPS, who had he met with before all of this? He'd met with Perkins Coie, the law firm that was representing the DNC and paying for and filtering money to Christopher Steele to write the dossier. The same law firm, by the way, that would not allow the F.B.I. to get into the DNC network, when we had the e-mails all hacked. This is awful. This is this is very obvious. And I think you'd be hard pressed to find an experienced F.B.I. counterintelligence agent who really knows what they're talking about. I worked Russian counterintelligence for 20 years. So did many of the people I talked to. This is not about Donald Trump. This is about the Democratic Party weaponizing Intelligence agencies to convince the nation. They've known for decades as to how those people work, and in this instance, turning it against the President to get him removed from office. That's what the resistance does."

This is a city where the average teacher starts at $52,000.00 a year where if you doubled that, it's $104,000.00 a year; you're still $11,000 short of the poverty level in San Francisco, and these guys voted unanimously to spend $600,000.00 to remove this painting.

This is not, you know, white hat black hat deal. They're both kind of awful. I agree with you completely. However, she is the lawmaker, and she made it into a race case. I guess that's what bothers me. Why do that?"

And really, you know, sensitive and afraid. And so I think you know, when you said that she wasn't afraid I'm not so sure. I think a lot of people react aggressively when they are afraid. So I think, her being nine months pregnant, having her daughter or I believe it was her -- she has another nine-year-old daughter there. I can see how she might be a little intimidated. And the man called her a lazy B word which in my opinion, where I come from may even be worse than saying go back to where you're from."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I don't even know what go back to where you're from means and apparently she's the one who said it. No, I agree with you. I just don't -- as soon as she said a white man did this. He claims he's not white, but whatever. Why make it a race thing. How about a rude guy did this? Do you know what I mean? Or some jerk did this. I get it. That's totally fine. But we all should like make an effort to de racialize things, in my opinion."

But what I can say is, you know, him going up and approaching this pregnant woman because she had a couple of extra items was ridiculous, and then it calling her a lazy B word when in fact, she's founded a nonprofit. She's an elected official, and she's a mother and she is nine months pregnant. She's anything but lazy. I think that that went a little overboard."

That honor goes -- it's really not even contested -- to a friend freshman Member of Congress named Ilhan Omar. In a recently discovered interview with Al Jazeera, Omar said that if America cared about keeping its citizens safe, we'd stop worrying about Islamic terrorism, which is really no problem at all. And instead, profile white men. Watch."

And so if fear was the driving force of policies to keep America safe, American safety inside of this country, we should be profiling monitoring and creating policies to fight the radicalization of white men."

      "utterance": "Yes, there's even an attempt -- that was from last year, which is interesting, because she now has an opinion piece out calling Donald Trump a racist when she had called for while she was a State Representative for racial and gender profiling by Federal law enforcement. You know, this country's history speaks very strongly about the fact that we have rejected that. We had a Civil War to reject the idea that people should be treated differently because of how they look or for an immutable personal trait, like race or gender. And yet here she is, in the 21st Century, usually railing as we know about the supposed false racism of the President because it's political, and then her own -- and some leftists were actually saying we heard her tone that she was being satirical, when she said that. No, she wasn't, she was being serious. This is a point of view that she felt comfortable presenting before she was a major national figure, and I think that that's what is the truth here. And at the same time, here, you've got a woman of color -- this is another thing that approves -- is that racism and bigotry is equal opportunity. Right? It is not with one group. It's not with one gender, it's not with one race. It is really about a major desire to control and to malign individuals who maybe are more inclined to not necessarily agree with you or believe what you believe. And we've seen historically how that works. You denigrate individuals and others as a problem, you see separate them and in this country, every day we work and we practice being Americans by rejecting, but the very thing she suggested, which is of course we should look at other people and judge them on their race. And then once we do that we should set policy and law enforcement and surveillance on them based on how they appear. It is the antithesis of the American dream. And it's not who we are as a people at all."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Tucker, to avoid federal charges of abusing underage girls in decades in prison, in 2008, Jeffrey Epstein agreed to a slap on the wrist plea deal for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13 months in jail, allowed to leave five days a week to go to work and then he tried to repair his reputation. And The \"New York Times\" says some were happy to oblige. For example, forbes.com called Epstein one of the quote \"largest backers of cutting edge science around the world,\" no mention of his criminal past. It turns out a PR firm paid a \"Forbes\" contributor $600.00 to attach his name to a pre-written story. In 2013, the \"National Review\" called Epstein a smart businessman with a passion for science, no mention of his passion for underage girls. That story was actually authored by a publicist for Jeffrey Epstein. The \"National Review\" apologized. And finally, \"The Huffington Post\" lauded Epstein for helping scientists thrive. The sex crimes part was not included. Tonight, prison officials are investigating whether Epstein was attacked in jail, staged an attack or tried to commit suicide. He was found Tuesday morning, nearly unconscious with injuries to his neck. Some believe the injuries were self-inflicted to get transferred out of jail. But others say suicide and assault have not been ruled out and another inmate has been questioned. And finally former President Clinton says he had six encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, all after 2002, but \"The Daily Beast\" now says Epstein made numerous visits to the Clinton White House, a Clinton spokesperson says the former President knows nothing of the crimes or the charges -- Tucker."
