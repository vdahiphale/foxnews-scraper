This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE live from the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida, where The Patriot Awards just wrapped up over at Fox Nation. Tonight, the Biden ship is sinking and certain Democrats are looking for the lifeboats. My 'Angle' will come a little later on in the show. Also, what do folks down here think of Biden's cognitive state? Plus, an update to what became apparently a viral moment from Monday's show. Raymond Arroyo has it all in Seen and Unseen. But we begin tonight with the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, as the jury completed day two of deliberations. Now, the jury has asked five questions of Judge Schroeder with most of the inquiries focused on videos from that night. Now, those pieces of evidence have taken on a great deal of significance throughout the trial, and are now at the center of the defense's request for a mistrial. They're alleging that prosecutors gave them a hard to see low res version of what was, in their mind, potentially exculpatory evidence. And that they only supplied one-third of the information that was deserved and needed. Now, the defense claims that when the prosecution finally did hand all that information over, testimony had already concluded. Now this is just the latest example that has us and should have you asking, how could the jury's deliberation be taking this long? I want to first lay out why this case should just be open and shut. For starters, all of the video evidence that was handed over indicates that then 17-year-old Rittenhouse was acting in self defense. And to make matters worse for the prosecution, their case was directly refuted by their own witnesses.",

Just the one instance that you just laid out, like this is - there's ground for a major sanction against this prosecutor. David, thank you tonight. Now, I want to bring in Dinesh D'Souza, host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast. Dinesh, now, I think you're saying that this trial and the verdict, which still obviously is unknown. They come in a pivotal time in America's culture, or our cultural moments. Explain that. DINESH D'SOUZA, \"THE DINESH D'SOUZA PODCAST\" HOST: Well, this isn't just a trial about Rittenhouse. I think more broadly, what you have is Rittenhouse is being portrayed as a kind of symbol of the Trump movement. In fact, the prosecution early on was very eager to try to show him fraternizing, or associating with the Proud Boys. They wanted to try to make Rittenhouse a symbol for Trump's America. By contrast, the rioters, the looters, the arsonists, these are - this is Antifa. These are the people that the media has protected for a year. And if you were to read the media accounts of this confrontation, you would never get a sense of who these people are, or what they were doing, or all the violence they were engaging in, or the fact that they chased Kyle Rittenhouse and not the other way around. So it seems to me that you have these two rival narratives, and very oddly prosecutors who are normally standing up for the rule of law, this prosecutor Binger has essentially become a kind of apologist for the left- wing narrative. Oh, it's just a riot. Oh, it's just arson. Oh, he just threw this. Oh, he just blocked that. So, basically what you have is - and I think this is where the implications of the trial reverberate broadly. They want to get Rittenhouse, because they want them to be a stand in, if you will, for the whole 'Make America Great Again' movement.",

If I were on the jury, I wouldn't just acquit him, I'd give the kid a medal. You know, why? Because the prosecutor himself said, it was too dangerous out there. I didn't want to go there. The cops were in retreat. Think about the male population of Kenosha, where were they? Basically sitting at home, powering in their homes, while all these people were burning things and setting things on fire and attacking people. So Kyle Rittenhouse was one of the few guys who had the guts to get out there when no one else did. And so think about it, in a society where you don't have rule of law and people keep saying, Oh, it's vigilante justice. But when you don't have rule of law, when the cops are nowhere to be found, vigilante justice is the only kind of justice you have.",

The few sane people left in the Democrat Party would be looking for the exits. Now, last February, one of the smarter economists out there, who happens to be a Democrat, warned his party about inflation. They kind of brushed him aside. Now, several months later, we now see that Clinton's Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was correct. And Biden's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is dead wrong. Today, another prominent Democrat Steve Rattner, who was Obama's car czar, is now trying to pull his party back from the cliff's edge. Now, Steve Rattner, who was called the car czar, as I said, for his role in the auto bailout, is trying to warn his party saying, \"How could an administration loaded with savvy political and economic hands have gotten this critical issue so wrong? The administration should have come clean with voters about the impact of its spending plans on inflation\". We told him. We told you this. Now, Rattner is not a dumb person. He knows that the longer inflation hangs around, the poorer Americans are going to get. Their paychecks aren't stretching as far as they should, and if they get raises, well, the raises are just gobbled up by higher costs for everything. All of which worsens Democrats' chances upholding on to power in 2022 and then 2024. Now, check this out. At least nine House Democrats have officially announced, they are not seeking reelection next year. And another one with the dust today, a nine-term Democrat from North Carolina will soon announce his retirement from Congress. Now, if true - now do the math with me. That's 10 Democrats sinking - oh, no, they're jumping ship off the sinking ship. Now just look at the generic ballot. The latest Washington Post ABC News poll has the GOP up by 10 points. OK. You have to understand what this means. If history is any guide, a 10-point win actually translates into something like 100 seat gain, 100 seats. Of course, the truly smart Democrats, they're just switching parties all together. In South Texas, 10 terms Senate Republican Ryan Guillen, who's the state rep there declared himself today from Democrat he's now Republican. \"The ideology of defunding the police, destroying the oil and gas industry and opening our border has disastrous consequences for those of us who live in South Texas.\" Now, Guillen will be the third Latino Republican in the Texas State House. The New York Times' Tom Edsall noted, this is a red wave now among Texas Hispanics writing, \"Democrats shouldn't panic. They should go into shock.\" I love this. However, not all Democrats are piling onto the lifeboats, some liberals with very impressive degrees, they simply refuse to see this as a - an actual substantive problem. Instead, they've convinced themselves that this entire Democrat freefall, it's just due to the public's faulty perceptions. \"Robert Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia, suggests that the flood tide of political trouble maybe beyond Democratic control. Biden and the Democrats have had almost all bad news, all amplified in news reports. It's all perception.\" What? Like, he's just a passive bystander. OK. So doubling down on the delusion today, Democrats in the House, spend hour upon hour I could not believe this. I tuned in in the hotel here in Florida. Like, are they still on this topic? Pushing for the censure of Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, who stupidly tweeted some anime cartoon of - I guess, he was killing AOC.",

But they want to engage in just petty retribution over things that have no effect on the lives of Americans. That's what Kevin McCarthy was getting out there. So if Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are watching. Let me be really clear, it's time for both of you to just ignore the lifeboats, jump ship, and swim over to the Republican ship. These lower approval numbers alone should be enough incentive to just ditch the disaster party all together. By the way, it's clear that neither of you agree with a radical insane agenda that's being rammed through Congress at all. It's obvious. And if that's not enough, consider this. In both Arizona and West Virginia, Biden's approval is below 35 percent. So if neither of you have the guts to actually say no to this insane spending bill, I think your voters are going to throw you overboard anyway. But I was thinking about this today. Raymond and I were talking about it. It shouldn't just be about Sinema and Manchin, put all our hopes on Sinema and Manchin. That's ridiculous. To all of you senators, unless you want to go down in the history books as just a complete leftwing ideologue, you better step forward tonight. The Build Back Better is just all wrapped up with debt and trickery. And the whole cost analysis and estimates, it's all false. So anyone with an ounce of integrity should go to Biden tomorrow and say no to this travesty. The bill has to be killed. That means Senator Mark Warner, Tim Kaine of Virginia. Your state just voted to reject Democrat policies, elect Glenn Youngkin. And yet you're going to sign onto this AOC- Bernie Sanders spending extravaganza? It's insane. Jon Tester in Montana, let's see some Montana coming out of your pores for a change. We are going to hold you personally responsible, Senator, for allowing this travesty to go forward. Angus King in Maine, you are supposed to be an independent. You didn't run as a Bernie Sanders leftist. Where's the independent spirit in you? Shaheen in New Hampshire, live free or die? You promised to be pragmatic. There's literally nothing pragmatic about spending $4 trillion during an inflationary spiral. You need to go to Ron Klain, chief of staff of the White House, and say this is over. Now, if all we cared about here at THE ANGLE was helping the GOP, we'd sit back, let this bill passed and tank the entire economy for good. But we actually love the country. We want to save the country. Democrats, even those living in denial, know that if things don't drastically change, they're going to lose big league in the midterms. And of course the solution to this plummeting popularity is glaringly obvious. Stop the spending, work to rein in out-of-control inflation, prevent Americans from losing everything they worked so hard for. The fact that most are doing this, they are just doubling down on these policies that got us here tells you everything you need to know about their true priorities. Their intent on sinking the ship. They want to watch us all drowned. That's The Angle. All right, a new poll shows Americans are worried about Biden's mental health.",

This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE live from the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida, where The Patriot Awards just wrapped up over at Fox Nation. Tonight, the Biden ship is sinking and certain Democrats are looking for the lifeboats. My 'Angle' will come a little later on in the show. Also, what do folks down here think of Biden's cognitive state? Plus, an update to what became apparently a viral moment from Monday's show. Raymond Arroyo has it all in Seen and Unseen. But we begin tonight with the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, as the jury completed day two of deliberations. Now, the jury has asked five questions of Judge Schroeder with most of the inquiries focused on videos from that night. Now, those pieces of evidence have taken on a great deal of significance throughout the trial, and are now at the center of the defense's request for a mistrial. They're alleging that prosecutors gave them a hard to see low res version of what was, in their mind, potentially exculpatory evidence. And that they only supplied one-third of the information that was deserved and needed. Now, the defense claims that when the prosecution finally did hand all that information over, testimony had already concluded. Now this is just the latest example that has us and should have you asking, how could the jury's deliberation be taking this long? I want to first lay out why this case should just be open and shut. For starters, all of the video evidence that was handed over indicates that then 17-year-old Rittenhouse was acting in self defense. And to make matters worse for the prosecution, their case was directly refuted by their own witnesses."

The defense team had to send a email that specified that they know that the prosecution has been withholding evidence and they must supply their version of the video.

And among those requests were FBI's surveillance video and drone footage as well, that showed the moments leading up to the fatal shooting of Mr. Rosenbaum. Now, David, if you got the drone footage, obviously, it's from on high looking down. Are you optimistic that that footage is going to be good for the defense, your client - your friend, Kyle?"
    },

      "speaker": "HANCOCK",

So he claimed that young Kyle actually yelled across the hood. And that is what provoked Rosenbaum, right? So that was his initial tape. That was his initial version of this event. And then, seemingly out of nowhere, he receives a drone video from a hobbyist drone that supposedly paints a different picture. But the image that they took that they showed the jury was one frame, one frame that you can see that his actual support hand is always in the picture. So that support hand that they claim was holding that weapon that was there prior to Kyle getting to that vehicle and after he left. That was a artifact, or a reflection. They chose one frame and they tried to tell the jury that that proved that Kyle was holding a weapon. It is absolutely false."

      "utterance": "I said this last night, David, but I think there are grounds to sanction the prosecution on this case, given what's unfolded. Just the one instance that you just laid out, like this is - there's ground for a major sanction against this prosecutor. David, thank you tonight. Now, I want to bring in Dinesh D'Souza, host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast. Dinesh, now, I think you're saying that this trial and the verdict, which still obviously is unknown. They come in a pivotal time in America's culture, or our cultural moments. Explain that. DINESH D'SOUZA, \"THE DINESH D'SOUZA PODCAST\" HOST: Well, this isn't just a trial about Rittenhouse. I think more broadly, what you have is Rittenhouse is being portrayed as a kind of symbol of the Trump movement. In fact, the prosecution early on was very eager to try to show him fraternizing, or associating with the Proud Boys. They wanted to try to make Rittenhouse a symbol for Trump's America. By contrast, the rioters, the looters, the arsonists, these are - this is Antifa. These are the people that the media has protected for a year. And if you were to read the media accounts of this confrontation, you would never get a sense of who these people are, or what they were doing, or all the violence they were engaging in, or the fact that they chased Kyle Rittenhouse and not the other way around. So it seems to me that you have these two rival narratives, and very oddly prosecutors who are normally standing up for the rule of law, this prosecutor Binger has essentially become a kind of apologist for the left- wing narrative. Oh, it's just a riot. Oh, it's just arson. Oh, he just threw this. Oh, he just blocked that. So, basically what you have is - and I think this is where the implications of the trial reverberate broadly. They want to get Rittenhouse, because they want them to be a stand in, if you will, for the whole 'Make America Great Again' movement."

      "utterance": "To the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, it reminded a lot of people of something. The Brett Kavanaugh hearings in which Brett Kavanaugh cried his way through the hearings.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "I mean, for me, Laura, the defining aspect of Kyle Rittenhouse is not his tears. It's in fact his unbelievable bravery. If I were on the jury, I wouldn't just acquit him, I'd give the kid a medal. You know, why? Because the prosecutor himself said, it was too dangerous out there. I didn't want to go there. The cops were in retreat. Think about the male population of Kenosha, where were they? Basically sitting at home, powering in their homes, while all these people were burning things and setting things on fire and attacking people. So Kyle Rittenhouse was one of the few guys who had the guts to get out there when no one else did. And so think about it, in a society where you don't have rule of law and people keep saying, Oh, it's vigilante justice. But when you don't have rule of law, when the cops are nowhere to be found, vigilante justice is the only kind of justice you have."

He seems to even have some mental problems. Here's a guy who puts on this kind of theatrical outfit. He marches his way into the Capitol seemingly unobstructed. What does he do when he gets there? Basically nothing but prance around. And so he becomes a symbol of the capital takeover. But here's a guy who's been in prison now. He's been locked up for months and months to give him 41 months seems to be outrageously disproportionate to anything that that poor guy did. So my heart goes out to him.

The Republican leadership is nowhere to be seen. And I think this is part of what fuels the appetite of the Democrats. They can get away with it they think.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Jumping ship, that's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. All right. We knew it would happen sooner or later with the economy deteriorating Biden's approval ratings plummeting. The few sane people left in the Democrat Party would be looking for the exits. Now, last February, one of the smarter economists out there, who happens to be a Democrat, warned his party about inflation. They kind of brushed him aside. Now, several months later, we now see that Clinton's Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was correct. And Biden's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is dead wrong. Today, another prominent Democrat Steve Rattner, who was Obama's car czar, is now trying to pull his party back from the cliff's edge. Now, Steve Rattner, who was called the car czar, as I said, for his role in the auto bailout, is trying to warn his party saying, \"How could an administration loaded with savvy political and economic hands have gotten this critical issue so wrong? The administration should have come clean with voters about the impact of its spending plans on inflation\". We told him. We told you this. Now, Rattner is not a dumb person. He knows that the longer inflation hangs around, the poorer Americans are going to get. Their paychecks aren't stretching as far as they should, and if they get raises, well, the raises are just gobbled up by higher costs for everything. All of which worsens Democrats' chances upholding on to power in 2022 and then 2024. Now, check this out. At least nine House Democrats have officially announced, they are not seeking reelection next year. And another one with the dust today, a nine-term Democrat from North Carolina will soon announce his retirement from Congress. Now, if true - now do the math with me. That's 10 Democrats sinking - oh, no, they're jumping ship off the sinking ship. Now just look at the generic ballot. The latest Washington Post ABC News poll has the GOP up by 10 points. OK. You have to understand what this means. If history is any guide, a 10-point win actually translates into something like 100 seat gain, 100 seats. Of course, the truly smart Democrats, they're just switching parties all together. In South Texas, 10 terms Senate Republican Ryan Guillen, who's the state rep there declared himself today from Democrat he's now Republican. \"The ideology of defunding the police, destroying the oil and gas industry and opening our border has disastrous consequences for those of us who live in South Texas.\" Now, Guillen will be the third Latino Republican in the Texas State House. The New York Times' Tom Edsall noted, this is a red wave now among Texas Hispanics writing, \"Democrats shouldn't panic. They should go into shock.\" I love this. However, not all Democrats are piling onto the lifeboats, some liberals with very impressive degrees, they simply refuse to see this as a - an actual substantive problem. Instead, they've convinced themselves that this entire Democrat freefall, it's just due to the public's faulty perceptions. \"Robert Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia, suggests that the flood tide of political trouble maybe beyond Democratic control. Biden and the Democrats have had almost all bad news, all amplified in news reports. It's all perception.\" What? Like, he's just a passive bystander. OK. So doubling down on the delusion today, Democrats in the House, spend hour upon hour I could not believe this. I tuned in in the hotel here in Florida. Like, are they still on this topic? Pushing for the censure of Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, who stupidly tweeted some anime cartoon of - I guess, he was killing AOC."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

But they want to engage in just petty retribution over things that have no effect on the lives of Americans. That's what Kevin McCarthy was getting out there. So if Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are watching. Let me be really clear, it's time for both of you to just ignore the lifeboats, jump ship, and swim over to the Republican ship. These lower approval numbers alone should be enough incentive to just ditch the disaster party all together. By the way, it's clear that neither of you agree with a radical insane agenda that's being rammed through Congress at all. It's obvious. And if that's not enough, consider this. In both Arizona and West Virginia, Biden's approval is below 35 percent. So if neither of you have the guts to actually say no to this insane spending bill, I think your voters are going to throw you overboard anyway. But I was thinking about this today. Raymond and I were talking about it. It shouldn't just be about Sinema and Manchin, put all our hopes on Sinema and Manchin. That's ridiculous. To all of you senators, unless you want to go down in the history books as just a complete leftwing ideologue, you better step forward tonight. The Build Back Better is just all wrapped up with debt and trickery. And the whole cost analysis and estimates, it's all false. So anyone with an ounce of integrity should go to Biden tomorrow and say no to this travesty. The bill has to be killed. That means Senator Mark Warner, Tim Kaine of Virginia. Your state just voted to reject Democrat policies, elect Glenn Youngkin. And yet you're going to sign onto this AOC- Bernie Sanders spending extravaganza? It's insane. Jon Tester in Montana, let's see some Montana coming out of your pores for a change. We are going to hold you personally responsible, Senator, for allowing this travesty to go forward. Angus King in Maine, you are supposed to be an independent. You didn't run as a Bernie Sanders leftist. Where's the independent spirit in you? Shaheen in New Hampshire, live free or die? You promised to be pragmatic. There's literally nothing pragmatic about spending $4 trillion during an inflationary spiral. You need to go to Ron Klain, chief of staff of the White House, and say this is over. Now, if all we cared about here at THE ANGLE was helping the GOP, we'd sit back, let this bill passed and tank the entire economy for good. But we actually love the country. We want to save the country. Democrats, even those living in denial, know that if things don't drastically change, they're going to lose big league in the midterms. And of course the solution to this plummeting popularity is glaringly obvious. Stop the spending, work to rein in out-of-control inflation, prevent Americans from losing everything they worked so hard for. The fact that most are doing this, they are just doubling down on these policies that got us here tells you everything you need to know about their true priorities. Their intent on sinking the ship. They want to watch us all drowned. That's The Angle. All right, a new poll shows Americans are worried about Biden's mental health."

Three months have gone by, have you heard from anyone in the administration giving you any more clarity on what happened and why?"

      "speaker": "PAULA KNAUSS-SELPH, MOTHER OF STAFF SERGEANT RYAN KNAUSS",
      "utterance": "No. We were sent a sorry letter two days ago that arrived at our doorstep from the president. And my question is, why? Why send it so much later?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Wait, wait. Did you just say you just got a letter from Biden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNAUSS-SELPH",
      "utterance": "In fact, I talked to some other families tonight, and they received one two days ago also. So \"sorry\" is a little late right now for all of us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So General Milley, General Austin, the Cent Com commander, no one has been fired. One of the biggest losses of lives -- American lives -- in a military scenario that we've seen in recent decades, and not one firing? Not one reprimand? Are you surprised about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNAUSS-SELPH",
      "utterance": "This is Ryan Christian Knauss, he's a real human, and he's a proud military soldier. And Ryan knew when he served his country that he could lose his life because he was serving his country. But the politics that was part of this was not military strategy in Kabul. And so this is a valuable member of our society who not just gave it all, the 12 others that gave it all, all of our families, we are deeply hurt that our president and the administration has not come forth to say who is responsible for our children's deaths. What members of our families can sleep well at night because we do not know what next will be caused by this terrible, terrible decision-making going on? There is too much at stake in our nation. We must stand up and be accountable for what we do. Our children paid the price for people who are not accountable in this administration."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Paula, your tears are the tears of a broken mother. We all in our lives live our daily lives, and we go about our daily inconveniences, complain about stuff that doesn't matter. Your son, a young, beautiful young man, lost his life, and no one in our country has been questioned, in my mind, appropriately by Congress, Republicans or Democrats. What can you and the other families do together, combined, to continue to raise awareness about this? Because his name, his face, his life, will never be forgotten by us, by this show, by all the people here tonight who are here for the FOX Nation Patriot Awards."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Never. Never going to be forgotten. But it's going to be more -- it's got to be more than this. This cannot happen ever in the United States of America. If someone makes an egregious error of judgment that affects the lives of any American, we need accountability. I'm infuriated about this. And this is your son. This is all of our -- this is really all of our sons. This is your son. He served this country in uniform. He deserves better, you deserve better, we need answers here. And Republicans in the U.S. Senate, Democrats in the U.S. Senate, have got to step up and asked Milley, Austin, all these people, we want answers. And they all should be kicked out on their you-know-whats as well."

      "utterance": "It's infuriating."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNAUSS-SELPH",
      "utterance": "We cannot continue to hand flags to our families and have no answers for why we are without our children. We must have answers, and we must be able to stand up and take responsibility when it's due. So I ask Americans to stand up. We who are the families that are left behind, we are standing up. We will stand up for our military and our veterans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Paula, it took an enormous amount of personal courage for you to be here. You didn't want to have to be here and speak out, and you did because you are speaking for so many other families who can't. Don't shake -- that's righteous anger. We are right there with you. We're not going to shop. Ryan -- Ryan is with us. We love you. We love you, thank you so much for everything that you've been through, and your family, and we are with you. We are going to fight for this. Paula, thank you."
