This is the quote, \"The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell,\" majority leader, \"has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises. What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility complicated by the position of Mr. McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, in Mr. Trump's cabinet according to more than a dozen people briefed on their imperiled partnership. Angry phone calls and private bad-mouthing have devolved into open conflict, with the president threatening to oppose Republican senators who cross him and Mr. McConnell mobilizing to their defense.\" That is quite a paragraph but I wanted to read it because it is quite a scene here in Washington. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We just never see this with a Republican president and a Republican Senate majority leader in open combat. The comments of the people quoted in that piece on the record no doubt were talking with the blessing of their principles. So this is just basically open warfare between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think Matt makes a very interesting and relevant point. The president is going to need Mitch McConnell in at least some kind of relationship there in order to get things done this fall. There's a lot that needs to get done. There are things that have to get done. There are things the president wants to get done, like tax reform or tax cuts and what have you. I think the big question tonight is, does the president see this article? Almost certainly. Does he react to it in an extemporaneous way as he's talking tonight? Does he take shots at Jeff Flake, does he take shots at John McCain? And laying behind all of this is the president's praise for Steve Bannon, his tweet about Steve Bannon going back to Breitbart News and how effective Breitbart is likely to be with Steve Bannon back at the helm, his comment again that we talked about last night to Peter Boyer suggesting that he was encouraging Steve Bannon to take on the Republican establishment. You have a situation going into this very consequential fall where you could see this open warfare grow rather than shrink.",

      "utterance": "Steve, take a look at The New York Times. It's just out with this piece that says Trump and McConnell locked in a cold war, threatening the GOP agenda. This is the quote, \"The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell,\" majority leader, \"has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises. What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility complicated by the position of Mr. McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, in Mr. Trump's cabinet according to more than a dozen people briefed on their imperiled partnership. Angry phone calls and private bad-mouthing have devolved into open conflict, with the president threatening to oppose Republican senators who cross him and Mr. McConnell mobilizing to their defense.\" That is quite a paragraph but I wanted to read it because it is quite a scene here in Washington."

      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD",
      "utterance": "It is an incredible piece of reporting that reflects an incredible series of developments. We just never see this with a Republican president and a Republican Senate majority leader in open combat. The comments of the people quoted in that piece on the record no doubt were talking with the blessing of their principles. So this is just basically open warfare between Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. I think Matt makes a very interesting and relevant point. The president is going to need Mitch McConnell in at least some kind of relationship there in order to get things done this fall. There's a lot that needs to get done. There are things that have to get done. There are things the president wants to get done, like tax reform or tax cuts and what have you. I think the big question tonight is, does the president see this article? Almost certainly. Does he react to it in an extemporaneous way as he's talking tonight? Does he take shots at Jeff Flake, does he take shots at John McCain? And laying behind all of this is the president's praise for Steve Bannon, his tweet about Steve Bannon going back to Breitbart News and how effective Breitbart is likely to be with Steve Bannon back at the helm, his comment again that we talked about last night to Peter Boyer suggesting that he was encouraging Steve Bannon to take on the Republican establishment. You have a situation going into this very consequential fall where you could see this open warfare grow rather than shrink."

But Republican senators aren't just going to let the president insult anyone in the Senate. They're just not going to do that. They're not going to continue to let that happen. And I think that's what you're seeing here."

      "utterance": "But Jeff Flake writes a book. You have to put this in context. And the fact that you have a Senate majority leader fighting with a president in their own party, I've seen that. You are right that it's unusual that it's so public, but are these hostilities always there? They are always there. What's different in the era of Trump? When you have private hostilities, they often become public hostilities."
