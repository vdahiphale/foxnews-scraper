It may be, folks, that we now live in a country where only the already famous can get elected president of the United States. What's known as name recognition and politics is one of the steepest and most expensive climbs for most candidates. But when you are Oprah Winfrey or Donald Trump, as the president has already proven, you are already there, folks.

Can you imagine Oprah Winfrey losing primaries to Joe Biden? I can't. I think that if Oprah Winfrey runs against a bunch of typical Democratic politician, they'll have a very hard time knocking her out of the race. Obviously, Republicans couldn't knock Donald Trump out of the race, and he was less than a celebrity than Oprah Winfrey is. I think it's because Americans have this sort of dual track mind when it comes to what they think the president does. On the one hand, we think that the president is there to do policy and engage in policy we like. And then, there's really what we think the president does, which is stay stuff, right? When we think of people who say stuff, we tend to think of celebrities. We tend to think of the people who are on our T.V.s all the time. We think of these people as sort of the figureheads on the prowl of the ship of state. And in that sense, if there are people who are very famous, and we've already made our decisions about them, it's a lot easier for them to survive. The slings and arrows has been politicians we may not have ever heard of and can be taken down with a single scandal. Remember, in 2012, Rick Perry was basically knocked out of the primaries because he had mandated the Gardasil, a vaccine for particular type of cancer for young girls. That knocked him out of the primaries in 2012.

So, I think the chances are actually pretty good that if Oprah decided to run, she'd win the nomination. In the general election, I do have my doubts as to whether she would actually defeat the president. The last poll that I saw was from March and it showed Oprah defeating from Trump something like 47-40. But those aren't incredible numbers for Oprah.

They can't immigrate legally because there's a cap. So what we want to be able to embrace everyone but within the framework of following the rules. And I'll remind you, some of this began after -- in the '80s after the civil war in El Salvador, a refugees stream into California where as in MS-13 then moved into the United States, now a transnational terrorist group essentially. So when we have emergencies, the vetting process changes, things are done quickly, and we've got to stick with the rule of law, which is what the president promised.

All of this kicking off as you say, the mainstream media whipped into a frenzy over the possibility of Winfrey running after her speech and a joke from Golden Globe host Seth Meyers about the possibility. Today, sources close to her telling CNN she is actively considering it. Her longtime partner Stedman Graham telling the L.A. Times, \"it's up to the people. She would absolutely do it.\" And Hollywood already swooning. Actresses like Reese Witherspoon, taking to social media to cheer Winfrey on. Tweeting, \"I will now officially divide time like this; everything that happened before Oprah's speech; everything that will happen after.\" And NBC, a thorn in the current president's side, appearing to jump on the bandwagon as well with this tweet, eventually deleted, a GIF of Winfrey with the text: \"Nothing but respect for our future president.\""

By the way, 11 years after that 1988 interview that we showed between Winfrey and Mr. Trump, the president did a 1999 interview with Larry King in which he declared that if he ran for president, his number one choice for vice president would be Oprah Winfrey.

So, you have two of the most high-profile people in American history battling it out. She obviously is another self-made billionaire, and she has cultivated, particularly female audiences, for the last 30 years. She's a television star. She has a really great personal story. On the other hand, she is a conspiracy theorist, she is on the far left, and her image as sort of unite or not and divider would certainly take a hit were she to get political. It's one thing for President Trump, who basically has been hit with every piece of mud and emerged unscathed to run for reelection. Oprah Winfrey is basically seen as this almost angelic figure in American pop culture, and if she has hit at all with any sort of scandal, it may not affect her quite the same way. If you want to move from a place where 90 percent of people love you, to a place were 50 percent of people hate you, quickly move into politics."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Do you think, you know, when you look at America as a society, are we living in a world where you almost have to be a celebrity? You look at all the people who've thrown their names in the ring: Mark Cuban, Kanye West has talked about it, The Rock has talked about it. And you know, you start to wonder if you're living in the sort of freakish parallel universe lately."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "I think there's some truth there. I think the idea that high- name recognition makes a difference, particularly in primaries, is absolutely true. Can you imagine Oprah Winfrey losing primaries to Joe Biden? I can't. I think that if Oprah Winfrey runs against a bunch of typical Democratic politician, they'll have a very hard time knocking her out of the race. Obviously, Republicans couldn't knock Donald Trump out of the race, and he was less than a celebrity than Oprah Winfrey is. I think it's because Americans have this sort of dual track mind when it comes to what they think the president does. On the one hand, we think that the president is there to do policy and engage in policy we like. And then, there's really what we think the president does, which is stay stuff, right? When we think of people who say stuff, we tend to think of celebrities. We tend to think of the people who are on our T.V.s all the time. We think of these people as sort of the figureheads on the prowl of the ship of state. And in that sense, if there are people who are very famous, and we've already made our decisions about them, it's a lot easier for them to survive. The slings and arrows has been politicians we may not have ever heard of and can be taken down with a single scandal. Remember, in 2012, Rick Perry was basically knocked out of the primaries because he had mandated the Gardasil, a vaccine for particular type of cancer for young girls. That knocked him out of the primaries in 2012. Donald Trump got hit with everything, including the kitchen sink, and he won the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Unreal. You know, when you take a look at this potential matchup, you know, you've got Oprah Winfrey, who I think would be so embraced by Democrats that she probably wouldn't be standing up there with 17 other candidates. I mean, you know, when Donald Trump tried it, everyone just laughed at him. They thought he was not going to last; wouldn't make it through December, wouldn't make it through the fall. I mean, that's a very different dynamic here, Ben."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "I think that's true. And I think Democrats also have a way of anointing candidates that Republicans simply have not had. In 2016, obviously, they anointed Hillary Clinton. 2012, they thought about -- in 2008, rather, they thought about anointing Hillary Clinton, and then Oprah Winfrey is the person who helped pushed Barack Obama over that finish line. So, I think the chances are actually pretty good that if Oprah decided to run, she'd win the nomination. In the general election, I do have my doubts as to whether she would actually defeat the president. The last poll that I saw was from March and it showed Oprah defeating from Trump something like 47-40. But those aren't incredible numbers for Oprah. She has, I think, 49 percent approval versus 33 percent disapproval. Wait until she actually has to go through a political cycle or two and see how those numbers hold up."

She's being cheered by people who said nothing about her for 20 years, and there she is pretending that she's leading the fight. In what way has she led the fight? I sort of missed it. And just because she said some stuff last night, I haven't seen how things have materially changed. And as Reese Witherspoon has mentioned that she measures things before Oprah and after Oprah, what changed after Oprah? Oprah said a bunch of stuff. Well, I was under the impression that most of us agreed with that stuff when the stuff first broke. And she wowed at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- where were their reporting on the sexual harassment and abuse scandal for the last 20 years? It is literally their job to cover Hollywood, and yet it took the New Yorker and Ronan Farrow to cover all this stuff. Where was the Hollywood Foreign Press Association that was receiving such applaud to the hands of Oprah Winfrey? Again, a woman who is good friends with Harvey Weinstein being cheered by Meryl Streep, a woman who's standing -- gave a standing ovation to Roman Polanski."

You know, Karl, you look back to that moment and it sort of, you know, ha-ha, the funny idea of these celebrities running for political office.

I'm not certain that Oprah Winfrey can tap into that same kind of -- tap into a similar vein of enthusiasm other than anti-Trumpism. And frankly, look, if this is the best the Democrats can do, elections tend to be reactions to the last election. I think the next election, the best avenue for the Democrats is to say he wasn't up for the job, he has not demonstrated the ability to get things done. We've got somebody who's demonstrated the ability to get things done.

A woman who was the victim of sexual assault and sexual harassment, unlike Donald Trump who was accused of that. And she's spoken to it and get empowered women to stand up and fight back, and the woman who really spoke -- and this are the most important point -- a woman who spoke with a sense of inspiration and empowerment last night. It's a mistake to define what we're witnessing today in conventional political terms. The reason she's an antidote to Donald Trump is because while you see Republicans and Democrats condemn the kind of vitriol and hate and divisiveness from the Trump White House, she spoke with a sense of inspiration, a sense of empowerment and was an uplifting moment, and that's what captured the nation's attention."

If Zimmerman is becoming the New York State Chairman of Oprah for president, this is a sign of how desperate the Democrats are, how thin their field is, how weak their bench is, and how eager they are to grab the first celebrity who comes along and stands up in front -- as Charlie said -- an audience that was totally on her side, totally with her on the issue of harassment."

He wants to build on the success of what we're seeing from this tax cut bill where every day, just today, announcing more benefits to their employees.

And one lie or one close to a lie about a material matter and he's facing a potential indictment. I don't know what would happen with the indictment because he is a sitting president. No sitting president has ever been indicted for a crime. But if the feds want to trap you, they are very, very good at doing it. Donald Trump is a very headstrong person who probably believes he's smarter than his interrogators and he may be, but he doesn't know more about the case than they do.

That's the advice that I would give to him. That is pretty much standard advice. Now, I've never represented the president. An extremely strong willed person who may very well say I'm going to talk to them no matter what you want and I'm going to go do it even if you don't come with me.

Treason is defined as providing aid and comfort to the enemy or waging war against the United States. I assumed this was hyperbole on Steve Bannon's part. Now, whether he has to justify that hyperbole under oath to a congressional committee I'm not so sure that he has to. Or they've probably had better things to do than ask him about that.

How should the White House respond, what should they be doing behind the scenes with all of this? This was the suggestion, if you remember, from Susan Rice. How can Trump help Iran's protesters? Be quiet, she wrote. And that is exactly what did not work last time in 2009. Even as this 26-year-old woman's death became a powerful symbol that ordinary Iranians wanted desperately to overthrow their government's tight religious reigns. The Obama administration back then remained quiet, but the president now has spoken out very forcefully. And a new report in Politico Magazine says that this time it could be very well different. This is a quote from that piece. We are witnessing the death throes of the Islamic republic. Even if the uprising ends today it is but one step in a long struggle to achieve a more representative democratic and popular government. Here now, Michael Waltz, former Green Beret commander and Fox News contributor, and David Tapuri, a former state department official and Obama campaign foreign policy advisor. Gentlemen, welcome, good to have both of you with us tonight.

But I agree with you that the Obama administration did not do enough in 2009. So it's a mistake for us to follow the same game plan. And President Trump has been wise to stay very clearly upfront that he supports regime change. That is the U.S. policy and we need to state that and we need to state our support for the protesters. But we need to do more than just tweet. We have to support the protesters by putting more sanctions in place on the revolutionary guard in Iran and pushing the U.N. to do more against Iran. We have to actively support these protesters, but at the same time we can't let the Iranian regime use it as a talking point that this is a U.S.-led effort. It has to be an Iranian led effort with the U.S. doing everything it can behind the scenes to support the protesters."

But I'll take it a step further. This Obama-era argument that we should stand by while people are arrested, tortured, even killed for standing up against a theocratic dictatorship that has killed Americans since the 1980's and continued to hold Americans hostage today is a red herring and it was an excuse from the Obama administration because at the beginning, from the outset, they wanted an Iran deal and they wanted to do nothing to stir the waters from Tehran to Damascus to Lebanon to get that deal through. And now these people have seen hundreds of billions of dollars flow back into their countries, sanctions be lifted, particularly by the Europeans, and nothing in their lives have changed except that the regime has gotten richer and they're paying for foreign wars. These people are protesting because they're hungry, not for political reasons. And what I hope the president will do next is to begin, as David suggested, supporting them with material aid, with communications equipment and with other covert means to go for the throat of the regime, because that's the only way they're going to stop."

These protests may be put down, but there is a movement in Iran that one day, hopefully soon, is going to ultimately overturn the police state that is the Iranian regime right now.

David and Lieutenant Michael Waltz, thank you very much, great to see you both tonight. So, the Trump administration taking a dramatic step today, and had immigration activists furious, do the administration go too far or is this exactly what the people who voted for President Trump want him to do? And being that was strong pushback from some circles, where do we draw the line. Should immigrants be allowed to stay forever, even if they were only given a temporary right to come to this country?

Some 200,000 Salvadorans have enjoyed, quote, temporary protected status in this country, since earthquakes hit their Central America country back in 2001, and there were provisions made for them to move here during the repair process. But they could now be forced to leave the United States by September of 2019 or -- so they have 18 months essentially to leave the country or to make other arrangements or potentially face deportation. So here now, Tammy Bruce, columnist for the Washington Times, and Richard Fowler, national syndicated radio talk show host, both are Fox News contributors. You know, this was always intended to be a temporary situation. It also exists with Honduras, with Haiti. President Trump is standing by his promise and assurances during the election, Tammy, that he would change and stick to the rules of our immigration policies."

Actually, President Obama also began -- I don't want to call it reporting, but removing many of the Salvadorans in particular, thousands per year for the last several years. So this is not a new activity. The difference is that President Trump announced it. He said, you know, we recognize how many there are here and that there was a deliberate announcement to the American people that this is policy. That there's a reason why there were temporary is in the name of the protection and that this is important to do. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has noted that many people may have an issue with, that the administration may be open to amnesty for these individuals. So you got a year and a half year for us to figure this out. But if the amnesties for the dreamers is an example as the CBO's has noted, will cost us 26 billion over nine years, I'm wondering how the deficit hawks in congress would look at that in the financial impact of amnesty."

And I think, maybe, I'm a little reminiscent of my mom retired on Friday -- she's an immigrant to this country from the nation of Jamaica, and she immigrated here legally. But after 40 years of service as a registered nurse in a public hospital she retired. And I think for me she always said growing up you can't know where you're going but you remember where you came from. And so for me, immigrant blood runs through my veins and it runs through many -- all three of our veins, at one point."

      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "And so for these individuals, while, yes, their status is temporary, we are a nation of immigrants and we're such a blessed country, and because of that we've opened up our hands and open up our hearts to these individuals."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So there's no limits, there's no parameters? Borders open, everybody should come in."

      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Wait, I think opening up the borders is different. These individuals came here for humanitarians reasons. The Hattians are very similar. The Nepalese are very similar. Yemen, there some folks here from Yemen who are CPS status. They've come here, they contributed to our economy. A good majority of them work, a lot of them buy mortgages. They got married, they have children. And so, now for us to rip their culture away from them, that's not who we are as Americans. That's not who we are as Christians."

      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "If I could add to Richard's premise, the issue is that there's also when you have a certain number of people here who are immigrants, even if they're considered refugees, that means that the numbers of other individuals who want to come here are capped. So you have as an example Filipinos, people from the Philippines, who can't get here because there's a zero dynamic -- same with actually Mexicans who want to immigrate legally. They can't immigrate legally because there's a cap. So what we want to be able to embrace everyone but within the framework of following the rules. And I'll remind you, some of this began after -- in the '80s after the civil war in El Salvador, a refugees stream into California where as in MS-13 then moved into the United States, now a transnational terrorist group essentially. So when we have emergencies, the vetting process changes, things are done quickly, and we've got to stick with the rule of law, which is what the president promised. And yet, obviously, having a year and a half to figure out exactly how to approach this, but we got to be conscious about it."

President Trump makes a pit stop to deliver a message to the forgotten men and women of the country in Nashville today. We'll be right back."

Live look at Atlanta where the president is about to be there for the kickoff of the national college championship for football, Crimson Tide versus the Georgia Bulldogs, on his way there tonight. The president stopped in Nashville and he spoke to the farmer's bureau there and this is the sound bite of the night, listen."
