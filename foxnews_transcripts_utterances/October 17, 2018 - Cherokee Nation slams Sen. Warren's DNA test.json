Then his disgusting ploy imploded. And the TV anchors who indulge him fled sensing they were becoming his victims too. But why complain? He's been a gift for the Republicans and a disaster for the Democrats. Are we sure he wasn't on Trump's payroll all along? Now, Avenatti has taken to challenging people to fight on twitter like a town Palooka relieving past fight at the local bar. So how does this serial trickster get away with it? Does the state bar care about ethics violations? Isn't there a disciplinary committee or is he exempt because he's a liberal attack dog.  His punishment should be harsh. Make him represent himself.

The allegations that she got ahead in her career as a result of it.

She might get out of it because it's 2 years from now, but in my mind she's cooked. I mean, speaking of Cherokee, she has more in common with the Jeep than she does with the tribe, and that's why they kicked her off the reservation because -- it was just insulting to them that she for the second time was exploiting Native Americans for her own advancement.  First, you know, in college and now this. And they knew it and it disgusted them. And, by the way, to the point about Trump, he doesn't owe her anything because she said if she's Indian and she didn't. He didn't say part Indian, he says if she's Indian. And the fact is, if the majority -- I guess European-Americans have more Native American blood than she does, which is the case according to the New York Times and me being 2 percent Native American, he doesn't owe her a dime.

Now, when judges do that it's to send a message, your lawyer is a moron. Poor Stormy, as a rule, people pay her for sex, now Avenatti reversed the charges. Sleazy lawyers are often called ambulance chasers. Avenatti is worse. He chases spot lights, and when he catches them he looks ridiculous. But he's good at one thing costing his own side money. A few months ago his firm was order to pay $10 million bucks to an attorney who once worked there. And what about the Kavanaugh debacle? The gang rape accusation arrived like the carnival side show the media so badly wanted. Avenatti was the clown with the biggest clip-on nose hocking his little horn. Then his disgusting ploy imploded. And the TV anchors who indulge him fled sensing they were becoming his victims too. But why complain? He's been a gift for the Republicans and a disaster for the Democrats. Are we sure he wasn't on Trump's payroll all along? Now, Avenatti has taken to challenging people to fight on twitter like a town Palooka relieving past fight at the local bar. So how does this serial trickster get away with it? Does the state bar care about ethics violations? Isn't there a disciplinary committee or is he exempt because he's a liberal attack dog.  His punishment should be harsh. Make him represent himself.

And so the president, obviously, said that she's a horse-face or whatever on twitter, and now anybody on the left is upset about that. I wouldn't say that, but here's what I would say, the left has used the word C word to describe people in the Trump family and then everybody applauded that.  They fantasized about killing the president. They've called him a fatso, Nazi, mental patient. They've loved that kind of language. And now, all of a sudden, they're clutching their pearls when the president says the word horse face? Please. To be surprised now that Donald Trump says bad thing and uses dirty nicknames about people three years later, either you haven't learned a thing after the last three years or you're just dense.  This is what he does and this is how he wins.

They think the reason they lost that is because he got involved with the ridiculous allegations and these statements that were made. And the bottomline is he's putting Stormy Daniels in a position where she's probably not going to pay these legal bills for her, and he's going to go and try to find some other woman to jump into this trap of politics saying -- they're claiming he will represent her, it will be great, they're going to win, and yet his track record shows exactly the opposite.

But I want to take President Trump out of this. Yes, he has mocked Elizabeth Warren. Yes, he has called her Pocahontas. Putting that aside, it's The Boston Globe that called for Elizabeth Warren to clarify what her record is when it comes to her heritage. It wasn't -- Trump asked for it, but The Boston Globe in this election cycle said that she needed to provide some proof about the discrepancies because of the reasons that she said before, in naming it in one thing, not naming it in the other. The allegations that she got ahead in her career as a result of it. So sure, the president has used it against her, I think as he should, because she's a fraud; and she clearly used it to get ahead in her career.  But it wasn't just him. It was the Boston Globe who was asking for some clarification about her background."

But you threw to the media, and we've left the media out of this. The media is culpable. They're in concert with the left to create this toxic puddle of identity politics. It's no longer now for the Democratic Party to be about the content of your character. It' now the color of your ancestor's skin.  This is not what Martin Luther King anticipated. And so what's happened is, the result is the Democratic party has no ideas.  It has no stances, because they're too busy chasing their oppression ratio.  Who is more oppressed in this intersectionality? So you don't have anything to say about the war in Afghanistan. You don't have anything to say about cyber terror. You don't have anything to say about automation. You have nothing to say about Saudi Arabia. You have nothing to say about Iran. You have nothing to say about black-on-black crime.

They advertised pumpkins for $5. They quickly sold out, but the good news is that they raised a lot more money, $23,000 in just three days, and they are on their way to getting a service dog to help Ian, and he can ride the bus and go to school. And the extra money is going to be donated to others who need service dogs of their own."

Over the weekend, a giant pig, and I mean giant pig, was on the loose in Highland, California. Local police and residents called to report the pig, which is the size of a mini horse that was running around the neighborhood. And the pig is a repeat offender, so the deputies took care of the problem; knew where he lived. They've been called to the area before. And the deputy was very smart and took her jalapeno Doritos to lure him back home and secure him behind the gate. So after the incident took place, on Facebook, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said, \"Crime fighting to safely secure a mini-horse- sized pig, we do it all.\""
