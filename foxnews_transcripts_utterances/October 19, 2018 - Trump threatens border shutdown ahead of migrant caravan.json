It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A breakaway group of migrants from the caravan moving through Guatemala has reportedly reached the border with Mexico. This comes just hours after President Trump threatened to send in the military to secure the border if the migrants aren't stopped. The president blaming Democrats for the new crisis on Twitter, claiming their support of weak immigration laws is making the situation worse. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is putting her foot down saying her party isn't planning on working with President Trump. Oh, she says, I'm sorry, I don't see any of us voting for wall funding. We have a responsibility to secure our borders. There are ways to do that that consistent with civilization, humanitarianism, and who we are as a nation.

So, it makes me believe that these people are being coached. And you're hearing things like NGO's sending activists and lawyers down to Central American countries and they're helping them with the caravan. They're coaching them on what to say when they get to the border. And it's interesting, where do they get the cameras from? You know, we're hearing a lot of these NGO's are bringing these camera crews in, then all of a sudden the people get off the van, they walk when the camera crews come out. The camera crews stop recording, then they hopped back in the van. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then once they get to Mexico, they pay the drug cartels and the smugglers $5,000 per family unit to get them across. The drug cartels are the only ones making any money in this process. The drug cartels and the open border Democrats, they are on the same side. These drug cartels have made $2.5 billion in smuggling alone per year. That's on top of the drug profits, and that's a lot of money. So we have to change the immigration laws so that you treat people that cross the border, if you're from Central America, the same way you do is if you're from Canada and Mexico.",

The government hasn't sufficiently done that. And I think part of this rest on congress because we've got a very confusing immigration system. And Democrats and Republicans, I'm convinced this is the one issue where they will never work together. But it's interesting because they have a president who actually -- even though he's a hard-liner rhetorically on immigration, I think there's a lot that he would give to Democrats in order to come up with a compromise. And I don't think you would see that with the Obama administration and Republicans in the same way, or with past Republicans administrations. So they need to fix that. And if you think about the kind of people you want to have in this country, you want people who are hardworking, people who are ethical, people who look out for their families and their communities, and people who are very physically strong.  So I think we need to set up an American ninja warrior obstacle course at the border, and whoever can make it -- they can't fake it, they get through. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's prudent, it's measured, and you just heard the president say there's going to have to be something severe that happens. So when you give him like half a second to try to deal with this. You remember when the congress passed a bill that would have allowed the 9/11 victims' families to sue Saudi Arabia and Khalesee Mohamad, and President Obama vetoed that bill. There wasn't a lot of complaining in the media at the time about that kind of action. But I do think that the Saudis are reckless and impulsive. You have an American green card holder with, you know, there are 18,000 of them serving in our U.S. military, like, you cannot do this. We turn a blind eye to Saudi. We do not give them a lot of grief for a lot of things. Human rights violations, the way they treat women. The punishment that they use, how they treat their guest workers.  We need them as an ally in the region but we're not idiots. We understand what's going on. I think the president is very clear eyed about that. And one of the things that is important is sending a signal that it's unacceptable, some of the things that might happen, we won't be able to see, OK.

We'll also be answering questions from students. That's going to be fun. And for Jesse and Greg and Juan, they'll be enjoying a local barbecue hot spot yet to be named. So we're very excited about that. Hope you watch the show. Juan.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A breakaway group of migrants from the caravan moving through Guatemala has reportedly reached the border with Mexico. This comes just hours after President Trump threatened to send in the military to secure the border if the migrants aren't stopped. The president blaming Democrats for the new crisis on Twitter, claiming their support of weak immigration laws is making the situation worse. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is putting her foot down saying her party isn't planning on working with President Trump. Oh, she says, I'm sorry, I don't see any of us voting for wall funding. We have a responsibility to secure our borders. There are ways to do that that consistent with civilization, humanitarianism, and who we are as a nation. We have to remove all doubt about that. And with only 19 days to go until the midterms, a new Fox News polls shows what's extremely important to voters, 46 percent say is immigration. I just want to show this other poll, the Fox News poll with vote preference among those saying that border security is extremely important, the Republican candidate at 58 percent, the Democratic candidates at 35 percent, and with this new caravan, Jesse, moving its way north 19 days before the election, not good timing for Democrats."

      "utterance": "No. I mean, it really -- visually it has a big impact on voters when they see this. It's not a theoretical problem.  And it's just not this one caravan we're talking about. I mean, in terms of size, caravans like this are coming across the border all day, every day, and there's really not a lot we can do about it because a lot of these loopholes are baked into our immigration and asylum system. I mean, it's used to be adult male Mexicans crossing the border, and now it's mostly families and teenagers from Guatemala and from Honduras, and we can't turn them back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "The Mexicans you could."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "The Mexicans you could. But you have to bring in and take, when you apprehend them, into the rest of the country. And they're all claiming credible fear. Now, credible fear, that excuse, has spiked over the last couple of years. Yet, when they use it, the economy in Honduras is going up, yet crime in Honduras is going down. So, it makes me believe that these people are being coached. And you're hearing things like NGO's sending activists and lawyers down to Central American countries and they're helping them with the caravan. They're coaching them on what to say when they get to the border. And it's interesting, where do they get the cameras from? You know, we're hearing a lot of these NGO's are bringing these camera crews in, then all of a sudden the people get off the van, they walk when the camera crews come out. The camera crews stop recording, then they hopped back in the van. Then once they get to Mexico, they pay the drug cartels and the smugglers $5,000 per family unit to get them across. The drug cartels are the only ones making any money in this process. The drug cartels and the open border Democrats, they are on the same side. These drug cartels have made $2.5 billion in smuggling alone per year. That's on top of the drug profits, and that's a lot of money. So we have to change the immigration laws so that you treat people that cross the border, if you're from Central America, the same way you do is if you're from Canada and Mexico."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And, Kennedy, the other thing is in these caravans, what -- the Department of Homeland Security is reporting that the number of sexual assault happening along this route, and not just -- in the caravan, as Jesse was saying about 1600 migrants try to cross the border a day, they're finding repeated incidents of sexual assault for children even. I mean, this is happening across the board."

      "speaker": "KENNEDY, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. That's horrible. I mean, we saw some of that, unfortunately, in the shelters in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. And it is, you know, an unfortunate aspect of human nature.  And, you know, we have to find a way to let really good people into the country, and keep really bad people like that out of the country. The government hasn't sufficiently done that. And I think part of this rest on congress because we've got a very confusing immigration system. And Democrats and Republicans, I'm convinced this is the one issue where they will never work together. But it's interesting because they have a president who actually -- even though he's a hard-liner rhetorically on immigration, I think there's a lot that he would give to Democrats in order to come up with a compromise. And I don't think you would see that with the Obama administration and Republicans in the same way, or with past Republicans administrations. So they need to fix that. And if you think about the kind of people you want to have in this country, you want people who are hardworking, people who are ethical, people who look out for their families and their communities, and people who are very physically strong.  So I think we need to set up an American ninja warrior obstacle course at the border, and whoever can make it -- they can't fake it, they get through."

And about the president's persistence -- I think yesterday, remember, we quoted her as saying it was a manhood issue for him. It's a political issue. He sees it as a promise he made to his base that he wants to deliver for his base. But if you go back in time, remember going back to President Bush, going back President Obama, you have Republicans and Democrats working on the immigration issue, working on border security, but Trump has made it all about the wall, and what Nancy Pelosi is saying, hey, this is not about the wall. It's not a good expense of money or time, and certainly not to be mean to people."

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's a cop-out. It's actually disgusting. What happened to the Democratic Party, as Juan said, Bill Clinton, President Obama, understood that border security helps to find a country and -- like it or not, the wall is actually part of border security. How could it not be? We have fences. We have a president that's interested in putting up a wall. Again, like I've said before, if you're on safari and you're being chased by a rhino, you hop into the first truck you see. You don't wait for the fourth truck. So there's a huge dishonesty going on with the media here where they willfully ignore the land between Honduras and Guatemala and the United States. Imagine how many lives will be saved and how many rapes would be prevented if they actually -- were able to stop. Once they leave their country and lay claim to some land there rather than having to risk their lives making it to our border.

With that said, though, I mean, we do business with a lot of unsavory characters around the world.  It's best when they're not throwing it in our face and remind the whole world of that. But at the same time, I wouldn't be canceling the arms deal and I don't think we destroy an alliance over that. We'll come up with some sort of sanctions or repercussions in order for them to understand this is not allowed in a civilized society. But as a news story, this is not having any impact on voters. People really don't understand the story or care about it that much. And the Democrats and the media are complete hypocrites, trying to score points off this. If this guy wasn't a journalist that had been killed, I don't even think the media would be covering this story. I remember -- how many people died in Syria that were gassed by Assad? Obama didn't even lift a finger after all of those people were heinously killed. I mean, come on.  And then you look at other Democrats saying, oh, you know, we have to do something about Saudi Arabia. We have to pull out of this, pull out of that. Is Hillary Clinton going to give back the $25 million the Saudi royal family gave her foundation? I don't think so. What this is about the Democrats don't like Saudi politics because it's all about oil. They've always tried to peel this country away from Saudi Arabia for energy issues.  And right now, whatever the president does, if he embraces an ally like he's doing now, he's criticized. If he antagonizes an ally like he's done in the past he's criticized. He can never win."

I think you're absolutely right about Hillary Clinton, and she would have done the exact same thing. And this political cronyism goes back so many administrations, further back than her husband, and American presidents have always protected this kingdom for one reason or another.  And the world is going to look very different when we're no longer reliant on oil. And I wish we were more self-reliant when it comes to our energy reserves. But, you know, you have environmentalists in this country who are -- they're very torn and hypocritical when it comes to who we accept energy from. We still need energy. We still need oil. We're not quite there yet. But hopefully we will use American brainpower in order to wean ourselves off that because it has made horrific strategic partnerships."

      "utterance": "Well, I want to talk about what Brennan said about the president.  I think it's unfair because you go back to the Obama administration, I don't think they would have handled it differently. I don't if they'll handle it better. Do I think that, immediately, President Obama would have sent John Kerry without even picking up a suitcase directly to Saudi Arabia? And when he gets back from three days, he comes back -- what's the first thing that happens, Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, meets with the president and Secretary Pompeo, and he pulls out of the Saudi conference. It's prudent, it's measured, and you just heard the president say there's going to have to be something severe that happens. So when you give him like half a second to try to deal with this. You remember when the congress passed a bill that would have allowed the 9/11 victims' families to sue Saudi Arabia and Khalesee Mohamad, and President Obama vetoed that bill. There wasn't a lot of complaining in the media at the time about that kind of action. But I do think that the Saudis are reckless and impulsive. You have an American green card holder with, you know, there are 18,000 of them serving in our U.S. military, like, you cannot do this. We turn a blind eye to Saudi. We do not give them a lot of grief for a lot of things. Human rights violations, the way they treat women. The punishment that they use, how they treat their guest workers.  We need them as an ally in the region but we're not idiots. We understand what's going on. I think the president is very clear eyed about that. And one of the things that is important is sending a signal that it's unacceptable, some of the things that might happen, we won't be able to see, OK. So these really rich Saudi people that might be involved somehow that want to travel over to the United States, make it a little hard for them to do so. We don't need to know all the things the administration is doing but we should trust them."

They don't care about the journalist.  They don't care how he died. They're looking at it as an opportunity to tie it to Trump because they certainly didn't care about all the injustices that you've listed about Saudi Arabia. I mean, they've done some horrible things. And also, to your point, for the better part of a decade, we've discussed the importance of being energy independent. We've talked on many segments on the phenomenal success of shale. We've talked about that. The people who are against shale, against fracking, are the same people right now screaming about the Saudis. The whole point of shale, the whole point of fracking is so we aren't reliant on psychopaths in the Middle East. But now the left has protected the psychopaths because they don't want us to do fracking. They don't want the shale. So there's a lot of hypocrisy going around."

When you try to defend someone from a large angry group, you're really just a sheep, reminds me of the other M-word, moronic. And Brooke Baldwin isn't even related to Alec. Sorry it's not woke to portray a mob as protesters. When you offer excuses for harassment, you become its defender at airports, restaurants, campuses, the streets, online. But if you've never said anything that stood you apart from the crowd, how would you even know? And before you cite right-wing anomalies, that's merely fringe for the left. It's now main stream. There's a new one or two every day. Like the professor telling people to contaminate or steal the food of Republicans at restaurants. Just another miscreant inciting mob action built upon previous excitements by leftist leaders, celebs, and activist. I guess that's a protest too.

And the other likes sports and building things and, you know, wears Adidas track pants. So -- and then I know another young girl that was obsessed with dolls. All she wanted was a doll and play with princesses her whole life, and her mother kind of steered her away from that, because she didn't want to plant a gender stereotypes. And it actually, the course correction had a negative effect, and now she's desperate for dolls and girls; and it's a little too much. So there's other things you can show them.
