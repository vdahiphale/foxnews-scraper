The other two witnesses who had been called on Wednesday, Kent and Taylor, set up the broad outlines of the story, and she was the victim in this. She loses her job. But one weakness in her testimony, as you saw in her disposition as well is she never quite knows what's happening. She knows what's happening to her. She has a Ukrainian telling her to watch her back, or they're out for you. But she really doesn't actually know what was going on and can't testify to what was going on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So the Democrats have a very strong case when they present her as the victim of this plot from Rudy Giuliani, and the Republicans were fairly strong when they tried to ask, tried to get into the idea of, were some of the president's concerns actually legitimate? Were there people in Ukraine taking some role in the 2016 election? Was there corruption that involve the Bidens?

BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, Yovanovitch was clearly the Democrats most effective witness so far. The other two witnesses who had been called on Wednesday, Kent and Taylor, set up the broad outlines of the story, and she was the victim in this. She loses her job. But one weakness in her testimony, as you saw in her disposition as well is she never quite knows what's happening. She knows what's happening to her. She has a Ukrainian telling her to watch her back, or they're out for you. But she really doesn't actually know what was going on and can't testify to what was going on. So the Democrats have a very strong case when they present her as the victim of this plot from Rudy Giuliani, and the Republicans were fairly strong when they tried to ask, tried to get into the idea of, were some of the president's concerns actually legitimate? Were there people in Ukraine taking some role in the 2016 election? Was there corruption that involve the Bidens? And the interesting thing is she didn't really know much about it."

It is a U.S. president's absolute right to appoint ambassadors. They call it serving at the pleasure of the president. The U.S. has now a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than preceding administrations. It is called quite simply America First!

If you go back and you read the transcript of her deposition, she readily admits, she puts this out there. She says, look, I was gone before what most of what you all are focused on is happening. But I think the Democrats brought her in, sort of set the stage to describe what she saw as the senior most diplomat from the United States in Ukraine. I thought she was very effective in that role for reasons that we saw just in the clip you've just played. She was very restrained. She never went beyond what she knew. In that she was asked whether the president meant to intimidate her, and she said, well, I don't know what the president meant, but this is the effect it had to. And she did that time and time again. I thought Democrats pushed a little too hard trying to make her emotional, trying to elicit emotional responses from her. And she didn't do that either, which I thought also enhanced her credibility."

      "utterance": "You elected Donald Trump to drain the swamp? Well, dismissing people like Yovanovitch is what it looks like. Dismissing people like Kent, dismissing people like Taylor, dismissing everybody involved from the Obama holdover days trying to undermine Trump. In his phone call with Zelensky, the new president of Ukraine, talking about CrowdStrike, Trump is clearly trying to get to the bottom of the effort to overturn the 2016 presidential elections. To do that, he's got to get rid and dismiss people who are running interference and trying to protect the people who were part of that effort. Yovanovitch is one of them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "What I didn't get was the Republican questioning by the GOP lawyer, counsel, why they don't try to tie Yovanovitch to Poroshenko, the previous president, and why not emphasize that here is a change in the regime, maybe we should have a change in an ambassador, and hit that, and they didn't."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "That's right. And the most effective questioning came from Elise Stefanik and Jim Jordan and John Ratcliffe, not from the counsel. You have to say that the Democratic counsel, who has had a turn as a television commentator, did a better job with that. But if you are going to make the case that she was dismissed for cause, there was a reason to do it, then you ought to just lay out what the reasons were."

      "utterance": "Yes. And that's the narrative that Republicans would like to hear more about, and that's why they are pushing to be able to ask those types of questions. It's why they've said that Hunter Biden should be added to the witness list. That's the counterstrategy for this from the Republican side, and certainly that's in line with what President Trump would like to see. And you saw a lot of frustration from the president today in that tweet, in the event where he was talking about health care earlier as well, and chatted with us journalists a little bit. He's frustrated, and he would like to see more about this and less about the other."

He later deleted this tweet. I'm troubled by the president's behavior in a way that Elise Stefanik clearly is not, judging from her questioning, but we can have that this agreement.
