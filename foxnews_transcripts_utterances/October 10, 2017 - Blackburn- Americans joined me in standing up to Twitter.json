Now, two A-list of actresses, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have come forward with their stories. Jolie says, Weinstein made advances toward her in a hotel room in the late '90s but she rebuffed him and decided never to work with him again. Paltrow claims, he also came onto her in a hotel room.

And actress Asia Argento says, Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. According to the reporting of the New Yorker, employees of Weinstein were not only aware of his proclivity towards young actresses, they helped arrange the meetings. Yet after Weinstein was fired, the former Chair of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, praised the company tweeting: \"The Weinstein Company has taken the lead against sexual harassment and assault after being widely criticized on social media,\" Brazile deleted the tweet. And for the record, it took Hillary Clinton five full days to comment on the accusations as you noted, same for the Obama's. The last time Michelle Obama made a statement about Harvey Weinstein, she called him a wonderful human being, a good friend, and a powerhouse. Martha.",

They looked at this as a misdemeanor sexual assault case. And that's what strikes me as rather odd. You know, it appears that many people were familiar with the reputation of Mr. Weinstein. If these women's accounts are true, he would be a serial rapist.

Then, when you go to California, the statute of limitations earlier was ten years and then they got rid of it but that's not applied retroactively. So, you have a 10-year limit there. So, the point is that-- I find it strange that even if they didn't think that the tape alone constituted a misdemeanor, it seemed to me that there's plenty of there to investigate for a possible felony.",

Yesterday, he was tangling with Senator Bob Corker, as you know. Tonight, he is drafting plans to push forward with executive action that would actually chip away at ObamaCare without waiting for Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders, who as you know, who have failed several times to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Specifically, the president expected to issue an executive order on Thursday. He did a little teaser on Twitter today that he will use the power of the pen, as you noted, to get more coverage to people quickly by letting health insurance be sold across state lines. That's something conservatives have been talking about for several years. They believe it will lower costs. Here's what the executive order would actually do. Direct several government agencies to rewrite federal rules so that trade associations and other groups of people can offer their own health plans. These association plans would be released from having to follow certain ObamaCare regulations and can be sold across state lines to boost competition. The goal, also, will be to give consumers more choice by charging lower premiums for scale back plans with little benefits. Critics say, this will bring in young, healthy people, who want smaller plans and lead to more trouble for ObamaCare, which will be stuck with the sickest and highest cost patients. Well, the president pushed back on those critics in an interview today that was published in Forbes Magazine, pushing back on the notion that the struggles of former President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement are his fault somehow. The president's declaring, \"what we're doing is trying to keep it afloat because it's failing. I mean, the insurance companies are fleeing and have fled. They fled before I got here. But that being said, no, ObamaCare is Obama's fault, it's nobody else's fault.\" And it's not just health care that the president is pushing forward on. Tomorrow he will be pushing tax cuts in the state of Pennsylvania. Of course, he a key (INAUDIBLE) state he carried last year but there's also a Democratic Senator Bob Casey Jr. who's up for reelection next year, he could be a swing vote on those tax cuts.

Ultimately, prosecutors decided not to file charges and when the allegations went public instead of pursuing the Weinstein story, many reporters instead looked into Ms. Gutierrez's sexual past. Now, two A-list of actresses, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have come forward with their stories. Jolie says, Weinstein made advances toward her in a hotel room in the late '90s but she rebuffed him and decided never to work with him again. Paltrow claims, he also came onto her in a hotel room. She, too, turned them down and told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt, who confronted Weinstein. Actresses Rossana Arquette and Mira Sorvino believe, when they rebuffed Weinstein, it damaged their careers. Other aspiring actresses say they either weren't confident enough or strong enough to fend him off. One time, actress Lucia Stoller says, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex. And actress Asia Argento says, Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. According to the reporting of the New Yorker, employees of Weinstein were not only aware of his proclivity towards young actresses, they helped arrange the meetings."

Hillary Clinton has been a champion for women's rights, she should've been on the forefront of this. Tim Kane came up this morning and said, you know there's no excuse for this. I'm not completely sure what was going through her head right now. She's not running for re- election or election at this point. You can only be praised for making a statement like that.

The audio from that tape that you just played makes me absolutely sick. This is a guy who's a serial predator, he is a pervert, he has preyed upon, probably, half of the women in Hollywood, if not all of them for who knows how long. And everyone looked the other way because people were worried that either their careers would be ruined or people didn't want to lose that access to influence and power. And it's sickening to see this. I mean, Hollywood is rotten. Hollywood has a black soul. And in fact, I was just looking a little earlier, Terry Cruz was tweeting how it's not just some of the women in Hollywood that are being prayed upon, it's some of the men that are being preyed upon as well, and it's not just Harvey Weinstein. And you know what, Martha? The Weinstein Company, they can change their name all they want to, they need to delete their whole account, and their whole company as far as I'm concerned. Because when I was looking at both of these articles, The New York Times and The New Yorker, it discussed how there were numerous executives, Martha, and assistants throughout that entire company that was aware and were complicit."

And we're talking about that with Jonathan Turley in just a moment. You know, you think about, Jessica, sort of the idea of, you know, the casting couch, which is way too cute a phrase for the kinds of things that we see described in this. And when you hear Harvey Weinstein say, you know, I'm used to this, you know, you wonder how many people went in there and had what they considered to be transactional sex with this man because they felt that that was only that they were going to get ahead."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, I completely echo Dana's sentiments, and I know they feel the same way after hearing that tape when you actually hear the voice that just takes it to a whole new level there. And I'm sure there are countless women who, at this moment, don't have the access to becoming out or still don't feel brave enough to do it. I am thankful that so many powerful women have done that, and as Lauren (INAUDIBLE) said, they have paved the way for women who are less powerful to say that. But I do wonder if after saying this and knowing this is something that is a bipartisan problem if we are going to have an outcry on both sides of the aisle here that this should not be tolerated. I know this is our skunk right now."

And I just want to point out, this is Georgina Chapman that you see -- a picture with Harvey Weinstein, this is his wife. But People Magazine is reporting right now that she is leaving Harvey Weinstein. So, perhaps, not a surprise given all of the revelations here. Let's put up with Jeffrey Katzenberg had to say, because we talked last night about the fact that Harvey Weinstein had implored the industry in Hollywood to surround him, to rally to his cause, and to help them out. Jeffrey Katzenberg said, he didn't know whether to just ignore that plea or to respond to it with a letter of his own and he decided to write a letter. He said, I bounced it up to some of my friends, and they said absolutely."

I'm sickened by it, angry with you, and incredibly disappointed in you.\" You know, and it goes back, Dana, to just this question of, you know, the silence and the complicit nature of so many people in this, which really needs to be a lesson here. Because you look at, you know, some of these actresses who came out, Rose McGowan, who's just livid, you know, that she spoke out -- she's very brave, she spoke out, and so many who did not until after the ball started rolling."

But I think it's a shame what has happened to her and what has happened to her career. I saw what Jessica Chastain tweeted, her excuse, Martha, was that she didn't feel that those victim stories were hers to tell. I saw Meryl Streep's statement -- really, if Meryl Streep wins an Oscar for anything, it should be that B.S. letter that she wrote and talking about Harvey Weinstein. Here, you have the woman that's at the center of Hollywood that everyone reveres, and she pretends not to know anything about this man's past?

When you listen to that 2015 tape, which was a wire that was worn by that young woman bravely, why (INAUDIBLE) apparently to pass here in New York City on pressing charges on that? Why would that be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the position of the prosecutors was that, first of all, the New York Police didn't bring them into the loop. Which is a bit odd that they didn't consult with prosecutors to try to build a case from bottom up. But they're certainly correct in saying that the tape doesn't have a clear confession or admission to sexual assault. What it does strongly suggest, however, is that a sexual assault occurred, it's very circumstantial. What's a bit odd is that the office then dropped it. They looked at this as a misdemeanor sexual assault case. And that's what strikes me as rather odd. You know, it appears that many people were familiar with the reputation of Mr. Weinstein. If these women's accounts are true, he would be a serial rapist. I mean, what these women are describing would constitute rape. Now, a misdemeanor sexual assault in New York is only a two-year statute of limitations, but a Class B felony, something like first-degree rape, which could apply here for some of these women, that does not have a statute of limitations. Then, when you go to California, the statute of limitations earlier was ten years and then they got rid of it but that's not applied retroactively. So, you have a 10-year limit there. So, the point is that-- I find it strange that even if they didn't think that the tape alone constituted a misdemeanor, it seemed to me that there's plenty of there to investigate for a possible felony."

      "utterance": "Martha, good to see you. Another example of President Trump's deep frustration with establishment Republicans right here in what he likes to call the swamp of Washington. Yesterday, he was tangling with Senator Bob Corker, as you know. Tonight, he is drafting plans to push forward with executive action that would actually chip away at ObamaCare without waiting for Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders, who as you know, who have failed several times to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Specifically, the president expected to issue an executive order on Thursday. He did a little teaser on Twitter today that he will use the power of the pen, as you noted, to get more coverage to people quickly by letting health insurance be sold across state lines. That's something conservatives have been talking about for several years. They believe it will lower costs. Here's what the executive order would actually do. Direct several government agencies to rewrite federal rules so that trade associations and other groups of people can offer their own health plans. These association plans would be released from having to follow certain ObamaCare regulations and can be sold across state lines to boost competition. The goal, also, will be to give consumers more choice by charging lower premiums for scale back plans with little benefits. Critics say, this will bring in young, healthy people, who want smaller plans and lead to more trouble for ObamaCare, which will be stuck with the sickest and highest cost patients. Well, the president pushed back on those critics in an interview today that was published in Forbes Magazine, pushing back on the notion that the struggles of former President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement are his fault somehow. The president's declaring, \"what we're doing is trying to keep it afloat because it's failing. I mean, the insurance companies are fleeing and have fled. They fled before I got here. But that being said, no, ObamaCare is Obama's fault, it's nobody else's fault.\" And it's not just health care that the president is pushing forward on. Tomorrow he will be pushing tax cuts in the state of Pennsylvania. Of course, he a key (INAUDIBLE) state he carried last year but there's also a Democratic Senator Bob Casey Jr. who's up for reelection next year, he could be a swing vote on those tax cuts. Martha."

Sunday night, people grabbing their children and pets and anything else they could and just jumping in the car to get out fast, and now, a day later wondering what, if anything is left. And I can tell you as you look at the charred wreckage of cars and homes, there is nothing left here. Utility crews are working now to fix down phone lines, down gas and transmission lines, working as fast as possible because until the power is restored residents will not be allowed to come back in, and thousands of people remain evacuated tonight. Seventeen large wildfires are burning in norther California. Together they have scorched nearly 180 square miles, that's an area larger than the city of New Orleans. They've also destroyed more than 2,000 homes and businesses. The charred wreckage here among the 500 homes lost in the tub's fire burning in Sonoma County. This one fire is blamed for 9 of the 15 fatalities that have been reported so far, and there is a growing concern tonight, Martha, that the death toll could rise because a number of people have suffered very serious injuries including burn injuries.

And they've decided that to talk about pro-life, pro-woman, pro-baby, was inflammatory and would evoke a negative response. And they said if I chose to leave that wording out they would allow it to serve. So they double down on censoring me. So I double down on standing for life and fought them back on this.

These are both alpha males. They're both guys who got where they did by being good at what they do. And I think that they have a great relationship, but they also are big enough guys that they can disagree with each other. But this idea that the cabinet is in disarray, Martha, I've been around some of these folks. I don't know Rex Tillerson. I can't speak to him personally.

Iran is already warning of potential consequences if the president does that. It comes amid troubling new signs involving North Korea. U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis urging military leaders to be ready with options if diplomacy fails. So which rouge actor presents the most immediate threat to our country? Tough choices, right?

And so, what he's required to say if he recertify the deal is that Iran is transparently, verifiably and fully implementing the agreement, and that the agreement is in the vital national security interests of the United States, he can't say that because the agreement, under the agreement Iran does not have to allow the IAEA into its nuclear -- into its military facilities. So they cannot literally, transparently, verifiably say that they're complying with the intent of the agreement, which is not to pursue with their nuclear program. And second, he just went to the U.N. and said correctly that this agreement is an embarrassment. So how can he sit then now with congress and certify that this is in the vital national security interest of the United States, so he cannot truthfully recertify."

The IAEA that Marc mentioned, the U.S. secretary of state's office, our own defense department, our intelligence departments have all actively monitored Iran. Seventeen thousand nuclear centrifuges have been removed. Ninety five percent of the enriched uranium has been removed. The one heavy water plutonium reactor has been disabled.

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",

They're also pursuing ballistic missiles whose only purpose is to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. And they're allowed to continue enriching uranium. And it's also -- bad things that they're allowed to continue doing because it's a terrible deal. But the problem with the deal is that it was front loaded, so the Obama administration has already sent them plain-loads of unmarked bills with billions of dollars that they're now using to destabilize the entire Middle East to fund the Taliban, to fund terrorist groups, and left with us now are the restrictions on them. So, you know, it's a terrible deal. But, yeah, you might have to stay in it, but that doesn't mean the president has to say it's in the national security interest of the United States."
