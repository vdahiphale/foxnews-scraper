You have Tom Steyer, who, of course, is a big climate change proponents saying that the president has committed an act of treason against the American people for pulling out of this accord. That's not true. And when you look at the details of what this agreement would have required, you know, 400,000 manufacturing jobs in this country gone, not to mention maybe many millions, potentially down the road. A decrease, $20,000 per family of four in terms of household income, $3 trillion of lost GDP, according to the agreement. And the issue also is the international community seems very upset that we're leaving. But what if the United States pulls out, will other countries pull out? Well, first of all, that shows that we're still leaders in the world, number one. And second of all, the United States for a very long time has been the founder of pet projects and slush funds for the international community. That's actually don't do a lot of good and don't handle the problem that it's supposed to do.

Katie points out that both the Heritage Foundation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimate the GDP loss somewhere around $2.5 or $3 trillion over 10 years. That is substantial. But here's why, I mean, let me explain exactly why it costs us GDP. A lot of this is focused on the automobile industry, so all these car companies are being told they have to increase cafe standards instead of miles per gallon standards. So they're forced to make a lighter and lighter car, cost a lot more money to use aluminum in a car than steel, so it cost them more. That goes on to the consumer. But also these cars are less safe, so the insurance costs are going up to the consumers as well. Also, natural gas is being forced under the accord. We have to pollute less so we have to move away from coal, which is one of our cheapest, most abundant fuel sources in America into a more expensive fuel source. That means our electric bills are going to go up as well. As these costs translate to the consumer, GDP goes down. You have less money.",

And we're going to get to the specifics of it in a couple minutes, but nobody should be surprised and don't be surprised also the coincidence of a brand-new stock market high on the very day that we pull out. Because pulling out of the Paris accord is very, very good for American business. We can argue whether he should get back in with a better deal or not, but certainly business leaders feel optimistic that this was a good idea for the country."

And even those that question, you know, Donald Trump and his issues with climate change or whatever, the point is the deal itself wasn't good. Every deal is not -- I think a lot of people don't really wrap their heads around that because the idea of a deal sounds like a good thing, it sounds positive and productive. But a deal is only as good as the terms it's based on and this one has unenforceable bad terms, they're not productive for American citizens."

That's right, he's the author of \"Dear Reader: The Unauthorized Biography of Kim Jong Il,\" Michael Malice is here also. All right. Katie, a lot of people are saying that the whole world is now going to be on fire. Do you think that that's true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEW CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "No, it is not. The hysteria surrounding the United States leaving the Paris climate accord really is incredible, especially considering all the hysteria we've seen so far with the Trump administration. We have commentators at different network saying this is the day the United States stepped back and is no longer the leader of the free world. You have Tom Steyer, who, of course, is a big climate change proponents saying that the president has committed an act of treason against the American people for pulling out of this accord. That's not true. And when you look at the details of what this agreement would have required, you know, 400,000 manufacturing jobs in this country gone, not to mention maybe many millions, potentially down the road. A decrease, $20,000 per family of four in terms of household income, $3 trillion of lost GDP, according to the agreement. And the issue also is the international community seems very upset that we're leaving. But what if the United States pulls out, will other countries pull out? Well, first of all, that shows that we're still leaders in the world, number one. And second of all, the United States for a very long time has been the founder of pet projects and slush funds for the international community. That's actually don't do a lot of good and don't handle the problem that it's supposed to do. I think that the president said that message in the campaign trail that those days are over and this is the first step to stop American taxpayers funding to go toward one of those slush funds that really wasn't going to solve the problem of climate change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Again, climate change, I'm someone who certainly believed that it's real. I just really don't buy into the idea that regulations are always the answer. I'm one of those market people. I think things like property rights could get involved. And also, you can't have all these regulations if you want to create new businesses and that includes businesses that are green energy. So I would like to see to be some sort of deal though, Eric, something you said was if we get back in, I would like to see there be a some sort of a deal but follow the proper -- following the proper channels of a treaty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Let's just talk a little bit. Katie points out that both the Heritage Foundation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimate the GDP loss somewhere around $2.5 or $3 trillion over 10 years. That is substantial. But here's why, I mean, let me explain exactly why it costs us GDP. A lot of this is focused on the automobile industry, so all these car companies are being told they have to increase cafe standards instead of miles per gallon standards. So they're forced to make a lighter and lighter car, cost a lot more money to use aluminum in a car than steel, so it cost them more. That goes on to the consumer. But also these cars are less safe, so the insurance costs are going up to the consumers as well. Also, natural gas is being forced under the accord. We have to pollute less so we have to move away from coal, which is one of our cheapest, most abundant fuel sources in America into a more expensive fuel source. That means our electric bills are going to go up as well. As these costs translate to the consumer, GDP goes down. You have less money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But Michael -- I want to get Michael in this, too. But here's my thing, Eric. I don't mind being more expensive because I think to do the right thing by our ecosystem is going to maybe be more expensive. That's not even my problem with the deal. You know what it is? It's not enforceable. Those that don't agree to it, those who violate the terms of this agreement, how are you going to enforce it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "We were going to eat most of the cost or a big portion of the cost of this as -- I think we're the third largest -- second or third largest polluter -- the largest polluter, China, gets to continue to pollute more and more and more for 13 years going forward. It's insane."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think it's important, Michael, to show that we do so care about this. We don't want to completely abandon clean energy, green energy because that's where the rest of the world is going. If we just want to stick with coal, we'll be by ourselves sticking with coal and that's not a good thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAEL MALICE, THE OBSERVER",
      "utterance": "We'll by ourselves using (INAUDIBLE) and yards, and that's pretty fine with me. I agree with Katie. This isn't about leadership, this is about obedient and submission of the American government and the American people to a new world order. Now here's how I determine what the facts are here, if you look at markets and price determined information, if aluminum goes up that means there's either less demand, there's more demand, or less supply. If you look at all these predictions, they say that we're all going to be underwater and we should have been underwater in the '90s. If this was all true, beachfront property prices would be collapsing because all those people in the real estate industry will be selling because they're thinking the long game and they're like, well, this is going to worth in 20 years, and we're not seeing that. So I trust the people."

If he was really interested in helping the environment, which I think there are a lot of people in the Trump administration who are. America, by the way, is going to decrease its emissions without the Paris accord. We have decreased our emissions more than any other country in the world. But if you really care about the environment, he would stay as an advisor despite not getting his way on the Paris climate agreement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

Good mission, good intentions, bad unenforceable terms of the deal, France, Germany, and Italy already saying that the deal, quote, cannot be renegotiated. That's ridiculous. Every deal can bind in definition be renegotiated."

Let's first look scientifically what that means. Well, rising seas, we could see the seas continue to rise. We could see flooding in major cities like New York City to Shanghai. Deadlier heat waves would be more abundant. We'd see droughts, wildfires, mass extinction in the natural world. Eco-systems will be disruptive. Coral reefs would bleach out in the ocean. And get this, Jake, low-lying countries such as the Marshall Islands would disappear entirely."

Clearly, a chaotic situation, and this comes after ISIS-linked militants have laid siege to the country's south over the last 10 days. But, there is some good news coming out of the fight against ISIS, today one of the founders of ISIS's propaganda arm reportedly was killed in his hometown during a coalition airstrike in Eastern Syria. Katie, I'll start with you today. ISIS took credit for this at one point, now the police saying it may have been robbery.

Again, we don't have the response or not ISIS, as you were saying in the break, all the time claims responsibility for things that actually didn't do. Why wouldn't, it makes them look more powerful. The thing about terror and ISIS is a lot of their warfare is psychological, making sure that things are horrific, and making sure that they're in our minds because obviously they don't have a defense like a country like the United States does as a terror group and hoping to destroy our way of life through fear.

We're going to take action.\" These are contradictory messages, because we don't know what they're going to be doing, and there's a lot of smoke and mirrors when you're dealing with this country. Now, we've seen something like this. This has gone back. In the '70s. In the '70s, the Americans wanted to prune a tree on the border between North Korea and South Korea, the DMZ; and the North Koreans took that axe, chopped up those Americans. That axe is still on display. I've seen it in North Korea. And did we do? We launched Operation Paul Bunyan. We came back with a huge amount of troops and a huge amount of ships, and we pruned that tree, and we left the stump to give the finger to the North Korean government.

Ninety-six vertical missile launchers. It goes on and on. And each one of these carrier strike groups typically travels, very quietly, with a submarine, as well. These are nuclear vessels.

Every person in the administration has agreed that any strike in North Korea will have absolutely devastatingly catastrophic consequences.
