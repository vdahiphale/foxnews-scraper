And Comey, of course, was very instrumental and said he wanted a special counsel. And that special counsel happened to be Robert Mueller. But I think the events last week, with the funding of the dossier coming into focus, that the Democrats funded it, and the Russian dossier, and the fact that it probably was used by the Obama White House and the Obama Justice Department, the Obama FBI as part of its investigation in Donald Trump. So, because Robert Mueller worked for the Obama administration, I think that's a major conflict. And then, secondly, the Uranium One deal, with the Congress finally getting the gag order lifted on the informant, that would have happened when Mueller was running the FBI. So I think that all of this fits neatly into an idea that this is a conflict that can't be corrected, except for resignation. And let me just say, think of it as a Supreme Court justice. Elena Kagan had to recuse herself from several Supreme Court cases could she had worked on them while she was in the White House. Well, why should we give Robert Mueller a different standard for conflicts of interest, given that people's liberty and reputations, the whole presidential campaign is at stake? I think he has to be purer than Caesar's wife here. And I think these conflicts will muddy the waters and ultimately undercut the credibility of whatever he comes with as it relates to the president.",

So, I think that there's just too much weight here. Look, Neil, if we go back to the campaign, if we go back to the whole issue of Russia, Russia, Russia, it was how divided the country is. And if we're going down the special counsel route, and if the special counsel's findings are going to be seen as partisan at the end of the day, I think this just further divides the country.

And I say, but, listen, assuming you don't get that, but you have your corporate tax rate reduced to 20 percent, aren't you better off financially? Aren't you paying less taxes?

But I digress to make this point. This is now all-encompassing. Anything having to do with Paul Manafort or George Papadopoulos or Rick Gates, that's going to get all the attention right now, who knew what and when. And when it comes the former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, now facing a 12-count indictment that, if he were found guilty on all 12 counts, could keep in prison for the rest of his life, well, needless to see, you have more than just a distraction. Right now, you have a fixation. Kevin Corke at the White House with the very latest. Hey, Kevin."

But it's the Papadopoulos -- Papadopoulos story that is really the more significant one here, because, keep in mind, he's apparently been cooperating with the feds since his arrest back in July. And what that means is, that could have a far-reaching impact as what happens as we continue to examine the Russia investigation. Now, let me tell you about Papadopoulos. He actually pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to federal officials about contacts he had with people that he believed had ties to Russia while he was a non-paid volunteer with the Trump campaign. Meanwhile, the president's one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort indicted on multiple charges, as you pointed out, that he funneled millions of dollars through overseas shell companies and evaded taxes in the process. Mr. Manafort and his longtime associate Rick Gates, who also faces charges, both appeared in federal district court today and they both issued pleas of not guilty. Bond, by the way, set at $10 million for Manafort, $5 million for Gates."

There's clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence the election. We have been saying from day one there's been no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all."

And in case you're wondering about the bond numbers we talked about, Neil, $10 million for Manafort, $5 million for Gates, there's a little bit of a technicality I want to tell you about here. It actually means that these are unsecured. So if they don't show up when they're supposed to, then, of course, the court will expect demanding -- will expect those funds. By the way, Manafort's lawyer called the special prosecutor's charges ridiculous. He noted that trying to use the FARA statute to prosecute his client has only actually happened six times since the 1960s and only once successfully. We will be watching takes story, but, as you pointed out, not a lot of talk about taxes or the foreign trip or the Fed chair, because everybody is talking about Paul Manafort and Mr. Rick Gates."

But you know, Neil, not only am I a defense lawyer, but I was a federal agent. I have even worn wires. And one of the things I'm concerned about is not so much Manafort and Gates and their indictment, and their arrests and everything. It's right now Papadopoulos, because they have had Papadopoulos under a microscope for some time. And I can tell you it's going to come out that Papadopoulos has been wearing a wire. And, boy, that is where I think it could come in. Now, when it comes to what you said, they're trying to squeeze these guys, meaning Manafort and Gates, especially Manafort. They want them to come over to their side and to be able to cooperate in the investigation. As a federal agent, I have done the same thing."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, in Papadopoulos' case, it was the one and only count of lying. Right? So, he could get that alleviated, if not removed, if he's cooperating or if he had wore a wire and he talked to people over these last weeks or months, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And, again, you will find that they don't -- they know that they're not going to get Manafort to wear a wire, because he's like Kryptonite to Superman right now. Nobody is going to want to come close to Manafort. And also I'm sure the judge has ordered him to stay away from certain people in the administration and not have conversations with them. The one thing that all of these guys may have in their favor, though, Neil, is the pardon power of the president of the United States. But I got to tell you, Mueller is trying to even outflank that, Neil, because Mueller has gone to state prosecutors. And so what he's now looking at is, hey, if you pardon them on federal charges, they still could very well be looking at state charges. And so he's trying to get these people to sing. It's a terrible situation they're in."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Ted, help me with this, though. Much has been made of the fact that -- in fact, I think the president himself tweeted as much -- that, look, all these predate his association with me, at least the campaign. I'm paraphrasing here. But is he getting a little too cocky or, you know, thinking that Manafort is not a worry because a lot of this predates his association with the campaign itself, even though some of these issues technically are concurrent with the campaign? But what do you think?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Neil, to be candid with you, they don't -- the FBI, the federal agents, the prosecutors, they don't give a damn about what Manafort did some time ago in the Ukraine. They're using that as a tool, as a pressure tool to get Manafort to talk about what happened during the course of the Trump campaign. Remember, he was the political director for Trump."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. So, let me ask you about this. We're just getting video now of Manafort arriving back home. It was from this home back in the summer, of course, that FBI agents conducted, you know, a raid of the home, while I believe he and his wife were sleeping, and just ransacked the place to get any and all documents they could. What do you think they were after?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "utterance": "It's by design heavy-handed. You couldn't make a more eloquent statement, Neil, about it. It's design. And I got to tell you, you're absolutely right. There's going to be a fixation on Gates, Manafort and Papadopoulos. And it's going to suck all of the oxygen out of the room. And I can tell you, one of the -- one of these guys are going to break. And not only that, Neil. There's other people that Mueller has under his control that are probably already talking. And if those people are talking, I got to tell you, the White House needs to be nervous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Wow. Well, Ted, you're so good. Thank you very, very much, my friend. Ted Williams puts it all in perspective in a language certainly I can understand, which is clear. I like that. What is clear, to Ted's point, though, is that, right now, the president's agenda might not be as clear. Of course, he wants to get tax cuts done. He wants to obviously continue an economic agenda that rates well with the American people. But, again, part of that concern today at the corner of Wall and Broad -- and we're going to be getting into this a little bit more in the show -- is that maybe this disrupted that momentum. To The Hill's editor in chief, Bob Cusack, on all of that. Bob, what do you think."

And I think it's going to be very difficult for Republicans to push that kind of bill if we're waiting for other indictments. Maybe other indictments come. There's no doubt about it. I mean, last week, some Republicans were talking about, OK, it's time to wrap up these investigations. And the timing of this, I think, is not coincidental, with Mueller then bringing one. And then the first batch, we see, OK, with Manafort, there's no collusion. And then there's a campaign adviser, and there's no smoking gun here. But without a doubt, you look at these indictments, and they have got some more stuff coming."

Listen, we have to get it done, no matter what. And there's going to be days, they say, where you think this bill is dead and then we resurrect it, and kind of like health care.

And, remember, I think that the Manafort thing is very damming in a lot of ways, because there's more coming on him. But also they're embarrassing him, kind of mocking his lavish lifestyle of how much money he liked to spend on cars and rugs. And this is a real play on him to squeeze him. Basically, you either talk, or you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

But is it the idea that you just rattle a lot of cages?"

And I think he's going to rattle a lot of cages. And I think he just wants cooperation. And it's clear that he's not getting cooperation from Manafort. And it just depends on who is going to cooperate from this point on."

Thank you, my friend, very, very much. All right, stocks selling off on a report that this is a distraction. That's one thing. But that the corporate tax rates that are going to be cut will be cut, all right, but it might be spread out over as much as five years, then news that the upper income might not be only getting their own bracket, but it could be a higher bracket, and with their write-offs likely going as well, they could be ending up paying a lot more taxes than they do already. Not good for that bunch. Not good for the aggressive position Republicans are taking on getting cuts done -- after this."

The only network that was concerned as well about walking and chewing gum at the same kind, and also mentioning that there's a big tax cut right now that could be going back and forth and asking a legitimate question as to talk that they want to phase in those corporate tax cuts over a number of years, which rattled the markets. To Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino, Madison Gesiotto here as well of The Washington Times. Madison, what do you think? That scared a lot of folks, in that it fueled this argument it is not smooth sailing and there isn't broad agreement among even Republicans on this subject. Now, of course, we learned in the Reagan years that a lot of those tax cuts were phased in, but by a lot bigger and more convincing margins. So, it's still early. Things could change on Wednesday. But what would the fallout be, do you think, if we phase these in, they're not immediate?"

As you said, there's still time. These talks will continue. And I know the president is very set on having a 20 percent rate, right off the bat. And I think this is something that is important.

The fact that it's still in -- still on the table now, where a day before, I guess the House vote on the budget, which would include whatever deductions are in or out, shows you that, for all the president's rhetoric, it's still -- this is still on the table.

So, I look at it as just another step getting closer to nuclearizing ICBMs. He hasn't really done the ballistic missile testing in a couple months that he's done heretofore. I don't know if that -- we have had some impact on that or not. But I'm really looking forward to the meeting that President Trump is going to have with President Xi, who was just kind of coronated by the 19th Communist Party Congress.

And I do believe -- we will see, but North Korea blowing up as a result of Kim Jong-un and the problems he will cause are not in China's national interests. So you have got to believe that, after he has all this power now, that he will start exerting some of it on North Korea and start bringing this thing to a halt.

That was the one, of course, that resulted in the death of our ambassador and three other Americans.

And President Obama should have issued the finding to the Central Intelligence Agency and told them and also to Joint Special Operations Command, destroy this organization as quickly as possibly we can. They actually expected us to come for them. Everybody was hunkering down, and we did nothing. We never went after this organization. We have gotten two people now as a result of it.

There's no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Mr. Manafort represented pro-European Union campaigns for the Ukrainians. And in the course of that representation, he was seeking to further democracy and to help the Ukrainians come closer to the United States and the E.U. Those activities ended in 2014, two years before Mr. Manafort served in the Trump campaign.\" Let me skip a little further here. \"The second thing about this indictment I myself find most ridiculous is the claim that maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds in the United States as a scheme to conceal it from the United States government is ridiculous.\" There you go. All right, we have New York Post columnist, Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Goodwin on putting the focus back on Mr. Mueller himself. Your argument, Michael, has been in therein lies the problem and the inherent conflicts that he generates, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAEL GOODWIN, THE NEW YORK POST",
      "utterance": "Well, look, Neil, I think that, from the very beginning now, Robert Mueller had one major conflict. And that was this relationship with James Comey, who succeeded him at the FBI. And Comey, of course, was very instrumental and said he wanted a special counsel. And that special counsel happened to be Robert Mueller. But I think the events last week, with the funding of the dossier coming into focus, that the Democrats funded it, and the Russian dossier, and the fact that it probably was used by the Obama White House and the Obama Justice Department, the Obama FBI as part of its investigation in Donald Trump. So, because Robert Mueller worked for the Obama administration, I think that's a major conflict. And then, secondly, the Uranium One deal, with the Congress finally getting the gag order lifted on the informant, that would have happened when Mueller was running the FBI. So I think that all of this fits neatly into an idea that this is a conflict that can't be corrected, except for resignation. And let me just say, think of it as a Supreme Court justice. Elena Kagan had to recuse herself from several Supreme Court cases could she had worked on them while she was in the White House. Well, why should we give Robert Mueller a different standard for conflicts of interest, given that people's liberty and reputations, the whole presidential campaign is at stake? I think he has to be purer than Caesar's wife here. And I think these conflicts will muddy the waters and ultimately undercut the credibility of whatever he comes with as it relates to the president."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODWIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I agree that it's difficult. And we have moved down the road. But I think the events of last week changed the dynamics. As I say, the emergence of the dossier into this issue now, because of the fact that the Democrats paid for it and that the FBI used it, you effectively then I think have a very partisan operation going, and because Mueller was part of the partisan operation, in the sense that he worked for the Obama administration, which was trying to help Hillary Clinton and which used the dossier, presumably, for the unmasking, and perhaps the FBI used it as well. So, I think that there's just too much weight here. Look, Neil, if we go back to the campaign, if we go back to the whole issue of Russia, Russia, Russia, it was how divided the country is. And if we're going down the special counsel route, and if the special counsel's findings are going to be seen as partisan at the end of the day, I think this just further divides the country. And I think a lot of people that I'm hearing from are saying, why -- how is Mueller different from Clinton in that sense? Think of the things then that happened in the FBI under Mueller. All of these things then become fair game for people to say, see?"

    {
      "speaker": "GOODWIN",
      "utterance": "Well, no, that's right, but it wouldn't necessarily be starting all over again. You could have the investigation with a new person heading it, in the same way that the argument was made when James Comey was fired. That didn't end the investigation. Mueller took it over. So, I think it's not about the investigation, per se. It's about Mueller's personal conflicts."

But here's the thing I would say as an economist. It's not good for the long-term health of our economy when the tax code tilts the playing field so that you have more investment in housing and less investment in business, because that's where we actually get the jobs and the higher wages."

But if they do something that is right on taxes, the interest groups will get -- be upset with them, which brings me back to the thing I have been complaining about from the very beginning. If Republicans had simply imposed some spending restraint, that would have freed up a lot of resources, a couple of trillion dollars, to do a much more bold, aggressive tax package, where you wouldn't have had to step on so many toes in the swamp and get all these interest groups against you."

I know the reality is that this has got to look like something resembling a balanced measure over the course of the next 10 years. But the fact of the matter is, they're doing a lot of cuts and allowances to make the figures work, which means that this generational tax reform isn't reform. At best, it might be a staggered tax cut, if we're to believe a lot of the reports on the corporate tax cut, phased in over many years. So, what do you make of where this is all ultimately going?"

But I am upset that that halfway step is becoming a third-way step then a quarter-of-the- way step, and maybe, when it's all over and done with, it will only be a 10th of the way. And given that Russia is in the news right now, here's my deal. Why don't we send Podesta and Manafort and Hillary and Trump and Mueller and all these guys, let's send them to Russia, and Russia can send us their 13 percent flat tax.

And, likewise, you only have to lose three Republicans in the Senate to kill the deal, assuming no Democrats vote for the reform package. So I think this thing really is on a knife's edge, even though, in my mind it, is so critical. With our high corporate tax rate, we have so many very serious problems, that this package, even it's though it's much more watered-down than I want, it would solve and address some really critical problems that would be so beneficial for wage-earners and the American economy."

      "utterance": "I think, as you and I have gotten into it, something is better than nothing, right? In the end, when push comes to shove, it might not be your flat tax or across-the-board Reagan-type revolution stuff, but something is better than nothing. But we will see."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so What happens now after the 12-count indictment of Manafort and obviously this growing question as to who is next, what is next? House Intelligence Committee member GOP Congressman Chris Stewart. Congressman, thank you for taking the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. CHRIS STEWART, R-UTAH",
      "utterance": "Good to be with you. And I'll tell you what is next, is, we do tax reform. We are not going to be diverted from that. We are so excited and enthusiastic. And I think we're going to get it done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, is there any concern among your colleagues, though, sir, that this is a distraction that gets in the way? Does it further lock in the notion that Republicans have to get this over the finish line, because you can't count on Democratic help, or what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Well, a little bit, maybe. And I guess it's a bit of a distraction. I mean, look at us. Today, we are talking about Manafort, instead of talking about the essence of tax reform or some of the elements of it. And I know you have previously with other guests, but you and I are talking about something different. So, it's a little bit of a distraction. But, once again, the Republicans in the House are so committed to doing this and moving it forward. And the second thing I would say is, this doesn't tie directly back to the Trump campaign. It doesn't tie back to the president. If someone has broken the law in some way, if they have evaded taxes or didn't register as foreign agents, and that's true, then I think they should be held accountable. Most of us just say, let the special counsel do his work, and we will continue to do ours."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, the reason why I even mention it, sir, is, with this other fellow, George Papadopoulos, and whether he might be talking or trying to squeeze or -- other players to sort of get roped into this, that it does escalate. You don't think it will?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Yes, I really don't. And maybe I am being naive, but I don't think so. And part of the reason is because, as a member of the committee, as you mentioned, we have been looking at this for a long, long time. And if I thought there was something there that was suspicious or that may be uncomfortable that I thought that hasn't come out yet, maybe this compels that to come out, I might feel a little differently. But I just -- there just isn't."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I only mention that because legal minds, like our own Judge Napolitano, worry about a following series of dominoes and all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So far, you see nothing to indicate that that would be the case?"
    },

      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Nothing at all. I really don't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK. About the tax cut, sir -- and I'm glad you mentioned that, because we have been pounding them as well, even reporting this others news. But at their face value, are you concerned when the National Association of Homebuilders says, as things stand now, we can't support it? Others expressing concern about corporate tax cuts that might get phased in over a number of years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Others talking about a new bracket for the upper-income folks that might mean they pay even more taxes than they do now. Any of these concern you or water down what you hoped would be a significant, generational cut in taxes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Well, the thing you just said is so -- is so important, a generational cut in taxes, something that I can look back 30 years from now, like we look back in the 1980s, and say, I was proud to do it. That's clearly the thing we're achieving for. For those who object to it, I would remind them, we don't know what's in it yet. And the other thing - - and this is so important and it's so ironic to me. I can't tell you how many people I have met with about this. And in, I would say, hundreds of meetings, and they say, well, we want this, we want this, you got to protect that. And I say, but, listen, assuming you don't get that, but you have your corporate tax rate reduced to 20 percent, aren't you better off financially? Aren't you paying less taxes? And they would say, well -- either two things. Well, well, one, we don't know, or, yes, we probably will. And, for heaven's sakes, you can't protect your goodies and at the same time still demand the corporate tax rate to be reduced the way we're hoping to. And I think, taken in its totality, almost everyone is better off with this, including the homebuilders, including those who are going to pay state and local taxes that many of them are concerned about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, even in the high-tax states, if you phase it out, but not, let's just say, for the upper income, you are open to that? In other words, we will know the details, as you say, Wednesday, but you're optimistic that this does get passed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "I am. And I go tell you, I know that some -- some of my colleagues and very good friends of mine from New York and California and some of these other high- tax states."

      "utterance": "Right."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

We have got Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, famous last time he was here for saying, you know what, I don't need no stinking tax cut, and neither does the rest of the country, if it means we can help out all those folks who were really hit hard by all those hurricanes. What does he have to say now? He's loaded for bear and coming here, and only here, tomorrow. We will see you then. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
