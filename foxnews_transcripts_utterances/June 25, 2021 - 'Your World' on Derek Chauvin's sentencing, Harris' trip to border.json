And this is \"Your World.\" And minutes ago, you heard it with Martha, Derek Chauvin handed down a sentence from the judge that will keep him behind bars potentially until he's in at least his 60s. Now, there are a lot of complications and details to follow, and still more sentencing that could come down the road with new cases and other charges at the federal level. Suffice it to say, while this range was roughly expected, now we're waiting to hear the reaction from various parties, including from the Floyd fan themselves, because Derek Chauvin speak today. We will give you the details of that. First, I want to go to Matt Finn in Minneapolis, who has been chronicling this case from the very, very beginning, on how things are going right now.

Moments ago, they were chanting \"Black Lives Matter,\" but no protests or any rioting here in Minneapolis, as we have seen before. Moments ago, inside of the courtroom, Judge Peter Cahill handed Derek Chauvin a 22.5-year sentence. The judge said that he did not make his ruling on emotions or on public demand. He said, instead, he based this on the rule of law. He said he's releasing a 22-page memo which will explain how he arrived at his sentencing. The big question heading into today's hearing was whether Derek Chauvin was going to speak. In fact, he did for the first time since George Floyd's death. He never gave an interview. He did not speak during the trial. He did not testify. In fact, he was masked the entire time during the trial. Also, perhaps one of the most profound moments in all of the proceedings, Derek Chauvin's mother gave the victim impact statement. Here is Derek Chauvin and his mother.",

Derek Chauvin kind of giving a cryptic statement there, suggesting that or something else that might come out in the future that would give the judge some type of peace of mind.

And they are bringing charges in the federal system against Chauvin also. Also, as you have already represented, Chauvin's colleagues, other officers who were on the scene, who assisted or helped Chauvin to some degree, those officers are going to be on trial in about a year facing charges for helping Chauvin in this murder. But I would expect that those defense lawyers are going to try to work out a deal. Neil, Minneapolis has suffered with this Chauvin matter for some time now.

He showed no empathy whatsoever towards George Floyd. I heard his mother. It's heartbreaking when a mother has to get up and testify and give the testimony that his mother gave, Neil. But the other side of this is, she will be able to go and visit her son in prison. George Floyd is not coming back.

But what is so sad about this is that a man is dead. And I think, yes, they had to look at those aggravating circumstances that the judge looked at. The mitigating circumstances here is that Chauvin is around 45 years of age. He has some heart condition. He has no criminal record. But when you are a police officer, and you go to jail, you're definitely a target in that jail.

I think also that the defense should have found a way to put Chauvin on the stand to show some remorse. Now, Neil, what is going on here is, there's appellate issues that Chauvin have, and, by the way, some good appellate issues. And one of them may very well lead to a reversal and even a new trial.

And we need to understand, Neil, the broad amount of law enforcement officers in this country, they serve and protect honorably. Derek Chauvin is the exception. He is not the norm. But defunding of the police department, that's going nowhere fast. Crime is up in this country. The crooks are standing on the side, and they're cheering.

New York is an excellent indicator. The guy who is leading in New York, Adams, right now is talking about giving more to police officers, supporting the police officers, so police officers can support the community. The person in second place is talking about defunding. And I don't believe anybody, anybody who's talking about defunding the police department, when crime is rising, should be the mayor of any city. So that's my own subjective feelings about it. But I got to tell you, Derek Chauvin, a rogue police officer, a police officer who did not and does not represent the good men and women who put that uniform on every day and serve and protect us, was given 22 years.

For once, a police officer who wrongly took the life of a black man was held to account. While this shouldn't be exceptional, tragically, it is. Day after day, year after year, police kill black people without consequence. But, today, with Chauvin's sentence, we take a significant step forward, something that was unimaginable -- unimaginable a very short time ago.\" One of the other things -- I'm just looking at this final part: \"To achieve all of this, real lasting change in police departments from coast to coast, we need the U.S. Senate to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act without further delay.\" I just had to get the rest of that statement.

So, he had 10 years tacked on, because the court had found for aggravating circumstances. Obviously, the most important is that he held this position of authority in commission of this crime. It's important for people that realize that this is not the end of sentencing for Chauvin, because he is charged with a federal offense, as are his colleagues.

But, look, to get today's meeting in context, you have to go back a little bit in time on history to get to where today, so people really understand it. When President Trump came into office, he determined that we were going to leave Afghanistan for a lot of reasons. One, it was a never-ending war. It seemed like it was -- we had no intention of winning it. So there's no reason to be there. It was actually a civil war, with factions fighting among themselves that were there. We'd spent $30 billion a year, trillions over the last decade in there. We'd lost 2,500 great Americans there in combat, but we could see no end to it. In fact, the previous commander there, Nicholson, before Scotty Miller was there, said it was in a stalemate, and the president didn't see a reason to stay there. So we turned to Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson and McMaster and then, following that, Bolton. And he said, come up with a plan to have a negotiated settlement to come out of Afghanistan. Well, very frankly, they kind of slow-rolled them. And it wasn't until Secretary Pompeo came in, and we put a special representative for Afghan reconstruction, Zal Khalilzad, that we actually started to work with the Taliban and have an agreement with them. And we had that agreement come together in January and February of 2020. And the agreement was, they would not attack Americans as we had this negotiating process going on. And they kept their word. There has not been an American killed by the Taliban since February of 2020, a year ago, well over a year ago, about 16 months now. And so we also decided in April to come up with a determination in April 2020 on how to get out of there militarily. And we bought our team into the Situation Room. Secretary Esper was there, the vice president where. I was there. Pompeo was there. O'Brien was there. And we discussed ways to do this. We came up with three options, come out by Election Day, come out by inauguration, or come out by 1 May. And the determination by the president, President Trump at the time, was to come out by 1 May. So we started working with the military to downsize that and to work that.

And then, when we passed that to the Biden administration -- and, by the way, Neil, I think both the Trump administration and the Biden administration have this right.

But the government doesn't rule it out. It's issued this report that focus on these aerial phenomena that you have seen so much, including those observed by American military pilots over these many years. It says the UFO report is one that they really can't have firm answers on, that 144 Pentagon documented sightings since 2004 are still unexplained. They said that one was attributed to airborne clutter. As for the other 143, don't know. So, it's still out there, unidentified flying objects, either those that we couldn't recognize that might be human-made or, at least according to the government, possibly from bodies far from ours.

Moments ago, inside of the courtroom, Judge Peter Cahill handed Derek Chauvin a 22.5-year sentence. The judge said that he did not make his ruling on emotions or on public demand. He said, instead, he based this on the rule of law. He said he's releasing a 22-page memo which will explain how he arrived at his sentencing. The big question heading into today's hearing was whether Derek Chauvin was going to speak. In fact, he did for the first time since George Floyd's death. He never gave an interview. He did not speak during the trial. He did not testify. In fact, he was masked the entire time during the trial.

Derek Chauvin kind of giving a cryptic statement there, suggesting that or something else that might come out in the future that would give the judge some type of peace of mind.

Want to go to Ted Williams right now, FOX News contributor, former D.C. police detective, and a darn good one. I might also add that Ted Williams -- I was listening to you earlier. You got this about right, in the range of the mid-20s to 22.5 years, which is the range this ended up being. Explain how that would work. Would he have to -- is there any chance of early release here? Or what are the guidelines?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

But because of the aggravating circumstances that the judge found here -- and when we use the word aggravating circumstances, we're talking about the manner in which George Floyd was murdered, to the fact that there were children around that actually saw the murder of George Floyd. And so those were the aggravating circumstances that led to the 22.5-year sentence. But, as you have already said -- and I can tell you that Chauvin certainly with good behavior can certainly be out well before those 22.5 years."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. The one case that Chauvin has to worry about right now is in the federal sector. Chauvin has been charged with not only violating the civil rights of George Floyd, but he's also -- there was another kid that, earlier in his police career, that he's charged with hitting with a flashlight. And they are bringing charges in the federal system against Chauvin also. Also, as you have already represented, Chauvin's colleagues, other officers who were on the scene, who assisted or helped Chauvin to some degree, those officers are going to be on trial in about a year facing charges for helping Chauvin in this murder. But I would expect that those defense lawyers are going to try to work out a deal. Neil, Minneapolis has suffered with this Chauvin matter for some time now. And I think all parties would be -- it would be in their best interests to work out a deal and to try to get this off the books and so people can move on with their lives."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, the comments were convoluted. I do not think that Derek Chauvin helped himself with the comments. Primarily, what the judge was looking for, Neil, and he did not get, was the word remorse. That's a word that we use, a legal term, but it means getting up, taking all responsibility for your actions, and saying that you're sorry for your actions. He showed no empathy whatsoever towards George Floyd. I heard his mother. It's heartbreaking when a mother has to get up and testify and give the testimony that his mother gave, Neil. But the other side of this is, she will be able to go and visit her son in prison. George Floyd is not coming back. And it's all as a result of Chauvin taking his knee and putting it on this man's neck for nine-and-a- half minutes, just about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Ted, I wonder, when you're talking about his mother being able to visit him in prison, he obviously won't be just any other prisoner, as he hasn't been for all the time he's been in jail. He's been in essentially solitary confinement. I think he's only allowed out an hour every day to exercise, always by himself, always separated from other inmates. Will that likely continue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. They have to protect George Chauvin -- or Derek Chauvin -- I stand to be corrected -- in prison. And so it's likely -- the likelihood of him remaining in solitary confinement or perhaps throughout most of his sentence is certainly going to happen, I believe, Neil. But what is so sad about this is that a man is dead. And I think, yes, they had to look at those aggravating circumstances that the judge looked at. The mitigating circumstances here is that Chauvin is around 45 years of age. He has some heart condition. He has no criminal record. But when you are a police officer, and you go to jail, you're definitely a target in that jail. And I think you're going to find, unfortunately, that Chauvin will be on target, even though he may very well be in solitary confinement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, you touched on this before, Ted, but the prosecutors wanted a much stiffer prison sentence. I believe they were looking for at least 30 years. His own attorney, Eric Nelson, had argued that it would be best for time served or at least less than the law guidelines. So, it sounds to me that this was the middle ground struck. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, it was somewhat of middle ground. I think the defense did not do themselves any good by suggesting that the judge let Chauvin walk. There was no way under the circumstances of this case that the judge was going to let Chauvin walk out of that -- out of his courtroom here today. I think also that the defense should have found a way to put Chauvin on the stand to show some remorse. Now, Neil, what is going on here is, there's appellate issues that Chauvin have, and, by the way, some good appellate issues. And one of them may very well lead to a reversal and even a new trial.

We all know what transpired after George Floyd's tragic death, but it ignited a nationwide movement toward defunding police and taking a look at how police conduct their jobs and whether they're fair to African- Americans, minorities in general. Has this trial, and now this sentencing, 22.5 years, isolated the incident enough to say, we move on, this defunding the police movement went too far? The president himself seemed to indicate with his own crime legislation or push that we have got to find a better balance. Where do you think this goes from here?"

There are going to be individuals who are going to be very disrespectful, unfortunately, to law enforcement officers. And we need to understand, Neil, the broad amount of law enforcement officers in this country, they serve and protect honorably. Derek Chauvin is the exception. He is not the norm. But defunding of the police department, that's going nowhere fast. Crime is up in this country. The crooks are standing on the side, and they're cheering. They're cheerleaders to what's going on in this country. And so, when you talk about defunding police departments, all you're doing is hurting yourself, the citizens, in these various communities."

That turned out to be the number one issue for voters, Democratic voters, presumably the base, the president's party's base, who said, enough is enough. And I'm just wondering whether we now find a happy medium."

And when you don't feel safe in the society, like all with this so-called defunding the police movement, it's bad, it makes people nervous. And you're absolutely right. New York is an excellent indicator. The guy who is leading in New York, Adams, right now is talking about giving more to police officers, supporting the police officers, so police officers can support the community. The person in second place is talking about defunding. And I don't believe anybody, anybody who's talking about defunding the police department, when crime is rising, should be the mayor of any city. So that's my own subjective feelings about it. But I got to tell you, Derek Chauvin, a rogue police officer, a police officer who did not and does not represent the good men and women who put that uniform on every day and serve and protect us, was given 22 years. I think that justice was done in this case.

The baseline for this type of offense is about 150 months. And that's about 18 -- I'm sorry -- that's about 12.5. He got 22.5. So, he had 10 years tacked on, because the court had found for aggravating circumstances. Obviously, the most important is that he held this position of authority in commission of this crime. It's important for people that realize that this is not the end of sentencing for Chauvin, because he is charged with a federal offense, as are his colleagues. Those colleagues have not been convicted. They will be tried in March. Their case is going to be more challenging for the prosecution. But as for Chauvin himself, this may not be the full extent of his time to be served."

What is the likelihood of something like that?"

So whatever's coming is going to come after sentencing. And I can't imagine how it would bring closure to this grieving family. There are issues in trial that are concerning, including possible juror misconduct, including whether this was the right forum, whether they should have taken this case out of the city. But none of those issues are likely to result in a reversal. Those are some of the toughest types of appeals to take."

He's kept away from other inmates. He's allowed, I believe, an hour for exercise every day. That's it. Now, will that continue?"

I -- but it's very difficult for a former officer. They tend to be put under special conditions, because their lives are continually at risk, particularly for a prisoner like Chauvin. That is going to remain the case for the rest of his years. People age faster in prison. And the fastest are ex-officer -- ex-police officers. The level of tension, the threats that they have to deal with are continual, and they're grinding. And that takes an impact on health and your mental status. Also, the seclusion used to protect these officers is itself punishing. I have had clients that have been put into segregation for long periods of time. Only two of those clients in my entire career came out the way they went in. Human beings need interaction. And when you're in segregation, I got to tell you, people have no idea how quickly segregation begins to impact your mental health."

I understand if he doesn't want to make a statement to the court, but to say there's something coming that's going to be really important to you, it was almost insulting for the family. The important thing for them was the loss of their loved one. Whatever may happen with regard to Chauvin's status is -- sort of pales in comparison. But, also, for the court, it was a head..."

Now, sometimes, the defense does get information after a trial that is material. But I'm not too sure why that would have a healing effect upon the family. Those are things like juror misconduct that might be grounds for an appeal. So, I have to tell you, I'm completely at sea on this one. I don't know what he's referring to, because he said that whatever it may be will bring some solace to the family. Now, the only thing that will bring solace to them is if he drops his appeal.

So, firefighters really face a difficult task. But they are some of the best in the world and are certainly up to the task, as long as there is any hope of survivors. The medical examiner's office has confirmed the identity of the first victim they recovered; 54-year-old Stacie Fang died from blunt-force injury due to the building collapse. Firefighters searching the rubble have discovered three additional bodies, bringing the death toll to four. Authorities have confirmed that 120 residents are safe, but 159 remain unaccounted for.

The property owner has filed a class-action lawsuit against the homeowners association, seeking more than $5 million in alleged damages to himself and other victims. His lawyer explains: \"Our investigation continues, but we strongly believe this was preventable.\" And, Neil, because this building that collapsed is so similar to other condominiums, not only in this city, but also neighboring communities, the mayor of neighboring Miami Beach has announced that his city will be conducting an assessment, an inventory of buildings there to see if there are any safety aspects they need to investigate -- Neil."

And the pile of debris, maybe as it settles, with all this water, all this rain -- as you see, I'm soaking wet from being out there -- it does -- some sound could come. But it could also be somebody tapping. So, this is why we have different methods. We have our canines that are looking and are activated, are trained specially for different scents and so on. And when they hit on an area, and then we have the sonar, we have video cameras, we have every type of modern equipment to be able to perform these rescues. And that's what they're doing. So, when they see something -- or hear something -- I'm sorry -- in an area, they try to work in that area. And as we see right now, they're working hard on the top part of the hill, what they call there, the debris mountain of all the building that fell. But they're also working just as hard from underneath. So, sound is very important. But as you're working, and anyone's (INAUDIBLE) you're taking away from that sound that you could possibly hear. So, it's very hard work. It's very slow. But it's very concise. And we have the very best working on it."

We have our county people. We also have local for the municipalities. All these people are working together to determine what actually took place, because, until then, we don't want to rush and say and do this, especially when we're trying to rescue people. But, at the same time, a lot of people are saying, wait a minute, what about my building? Is this going to happen to two buildings down or four buildings down or whatever by the beach and all parts of Florida and everywhere you go? So, this is something -- I guarantee, I give you my word, this is something that's going to be investigated to the maximum level.

There have been many military critics saying that this was a precarious move and could mean, within just months, the present government being overrun by terrorist forces, the Taliban, and some of these others that you have heard so much about. I don't know if that was addressed there with the Afghan leader. But we do know that the former Afghan leader was on the wires today on various news interviews, saying that this will be a perilous move on the part of the U.S. and one that both countries will severely regret, so keeping track of that. Also keeping track, of course, of the Derek Chauvin sentencing today. We told you about this a little while ago, 22.5 years in prison right now for -- conceivably taking him into his 60s before he has even the remote chance of getting out of jail. As you have heard from a number of legal experts and, of course, some of the people gathering around microphones in Minneapolis to air their reaction, most seem satisfied that this is a fair and adequate sentencing, and the country can try to move on. But, as a number of speakers have been saying -- I have been catching their comments on the wire -- this is not a situation that is over. So, we're following all of that and following the vice president earlier today finally going to the border. A lot of people say a lot too little and way too late, but she was there in El Paso.

Now, we know that, in the border in McAllen, we are seeing the epicenter of the border crisis. We just hope that Kamala Harris could have visited the Donna tent facility, where all these kids, unaccompanied alien children are being detained, where women and families units are coming across, and also for her to see the real challenges that Border Patrol agents are facing along the U.S.-Mexico border, the fact that we do not have facilities, the fact that we don't even have roads, as you know, on the border, the proper technology or the proper resources to do our job."

Things have stayed consistent and maybe has somewhat improved. The reason people continue to come to the U.S.-Mexico border illegally is because of the changes in administration. This illegal immigration problem was solved under President Trump. And it started all over again as soon as President Biden took office. And this is all because of the changes to immigration policies. We saw that President Biden immediately got rid of the migrant protection protocols. He made changes to the Title 42 authority that Border Patrol agents had. So all these changes in policies is what's driving this crisis on the U.S.- Mexico border. I want to say that the root causes of immigration are actually in Washington, D.C., within the Biden administration."

But there was a process for that. In fact, it was a pretty organized process, an overwhelming one, but an organized one. So that comparison, that this is now a modern-day Ellis Island, it kind of signals how maybe this administration might want to proceed here, not a migrant swarm that's overwhelming officials, but a way eventually for them to very much get to America. What do you think?"

Unfortunately, in places like in the Laredo sector, we're seeing people that are coming across with very serious criminal records. Just in the Laredo sector, which is about a hundred miles north of the Rio Grande Valley, we have seen an over 1000 percent increase in the arrest of criminal illegal aliens. Those are criminal aliens that have serious criminal records, murderers, rapists, kidnappers. That -- those are facts .We're also seeing, for example, in the Laredo sector, the increase in the apprehension of adult males. These people are not presenting themselves for lawful immigration. They are sneaking across our borders. They're violating our laws. And, unfortunately, when we compare it to Ellis Island, it is not a fair comparison."

Very, very busy news day, as you might have surmised, but, again, the president is meeting with the leader of Afghanistan.

General, very good to see you. That's, in a nutshell, your worry, right, that this is speeding that process, where Afghanistan could be essentially overrun?"

      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, first of all, thanks for having me today. Look, I kind of wish I was in that meeting today with -- fly on the wall, listened with Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah talking to the president. But, look, to get today's meeting in context, you have to go back a little bit in time on history to get to where today, so people really understand it. When President Trump came into office, he determined that we were going to leave Afghanistan for a lot of reasons. One, it was a never-ending war. It seemed like it was -- we had no intention of winning it. So there's no reason to be there. It was actually a civil war, with factions fighting among themselves that were there. We'd spent $30 billion a year, trillions over the last decade in there. We'd lost 2,500 great Americans there in combat, but we could see no end to it. In fact, the previous commander there, Nicholson, before Scotty Miller was there, said it was in a stalemate, and the president didn't see a reason to stay there. So we turned to Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson and McMaster and then, following that, Bolton. And he said, come up with a plan to have a negotiated settlement to come out of Afghanistan. Well, very frankly, they kind of slow-rolled them. And it wasn't until Secretary Pompeo came in, and we put a special representative for Afghan reconstruction, Zal Khalilzad, that we actually started to work with the Taliban and have an agreement with them. And we had that agreement come together in January and February of 2020. And the agreement was, they would not attack Americans as we had this negotiating process going on. And they kept their word. There has not been an American killed by the Taliban since February of 2020, a year ago, well over a year ago, about 16 months now. And so we also decided in April to come up with a determination in April 2020 on how to get out of there militarily. And we bought our team into the Situation Room. Secretary Esper was there, the vice president where. I was there. Pompeo was there. O'Brien was there. And we discussed ways to do this. We came up with three options, come out by Election Day, come out by inauguration, or come out by 1 May. And the determination by the president, President Trump at the time, was to come out by 1 May. So we started working with the military to downsize that and to work that. That gave all of us one year to work it, one year for the military withdrawal and one year for reconciliation between Ghani and the Taliban. To make that work, we actually went to the Pakistanis and got..."

Neil, the Taliban had been winning that fight for the last nine years. They have been on the offense the entire time. We have 260,000 well-trained Afghan troops there that we trained to fight in Afghanistan in their country. And we wanted to have a reconciliation of the governments coming together to have a peaceful settlement out there. And we thought we had that worked fairly well. And then, when we passed that to the Biden administration -- and, by the way, Neil, I think both the Trump administration and the Biden administration have this right. This is on Ghani, because Ghani has pushed back on having a negotiated settlement."

And I think they have started to come together. They're talking again. They're working together again. I have seen the vice president recently, about three weeks ago. I have spoken to the president -- the former president as well out there. I think they're coming together and working together going forward.

Andy, I do want to still talk about this Georgia voting thing, but I'd be remiss if I didn't -- if I ignored the news of the day here. What do you make of this?"

His sentencing guidelines, which are the ones that personally apply to him, take into account his lack of criminal history and the cruelty of his conduct, were about 12.5-years. The judge found three exacerbating factors. I think most informed observers thought that would add about a decade to the sentence, and it did. So I think it was an appropriate sentence."

Do you know what he was speaking about? It wasn't clearly this juror who was seen wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt or, I don't know, \"Get your foot off my neck.\" So I'm just wondering what it was he was referring to."

If he's talking about closure for the Floyd family, maybe he's going to try to plead guilty and dispose of the federal case. But that's sheer speculation on my part."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "I think it's a preposterous lawsuit. But, again, it shows that this Justice Department is putting the might of the government, which is its awesome law enforcement power, in the service of woke progressive politics. In federal law up until five minutes ago, the preference was that people show up at the polls to vote, and, if they had a legally cognizable excuse, they could vote absentee. That's what the federal requirement is. The idea that the Georgia provision, which vastly expands voting beyond that, somehow offends federal law is just ludicrous."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Because the reason why I ask, as you know, more than a dozen other states have or plan to continue pushing for similar laws. Would a successful legal challenge to this one abrupt theirs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's a great point, Neil, because it's not -- it's not so much that it would just stop them in whatever laws they pass. States that are considering whether to enact these kinds of laws similar to one Georgia did will now have to worry about the prohibitive expense of litigating with the Justice Department. The Justice Department has a $30 billion budget. There's not too many states and municipalities that can go toe to toe with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Andy, threw a lot at you there. I appreciate all your help and guidance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You're lucky I didn't want to get into the UFO thing that's just come out, but I will tell our viewers about that right now. Andy McCarthy, FOX News legal eagle, much, much more. But as I did say, there is a report out now that finds no evidence that unexplained aerial sightings -- you have heard a lot about them -- were of extraterrestrial origin. But the government doesn't rule it out. It's issued this report that focus on these aerial phenomena that you have seen so much, including those observed by American military pilots over these many years. It says the UFO report is one that they really can't have firm answers on, that 144 Pentagon documented sightings since 2004 are still unexplained. They said that one was attributed to airborne clutter. As for the other 143, don't know. So, it's still out there, unidentified flying objects, either those that we couldn't recognize that might be human-made or, at least according to the government, possibly from bodies far from ours. That's a good point to end this show and one that we will pick up on my Saturday show, as we look at all the crazy back-and-forths going on in this country and in this world, and now growing talk by no less than the United States government that there are other worlds out there, maybe.
