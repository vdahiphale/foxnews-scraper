Murders are up 30 percent in the last two years in this country. And the bottom line is this nonsense, it's complicated and multifaceted. Crime is not complicated and multifaceted. Crime is simple and it's one- dimensional. You got a criminal and you got a victim. I don't give a darn what happened to the criminal in his life in the past. The only thing I care about is what he is doing today. And they want to make it complicated so that we all feel stupid and say, gee, maybe we don't really know about it. But let me tell you what they're doing. They're denying the trauma that the victims are going through. They are not giving the victims a voice, and they are protecting the criminal by creating bail laws that allow them to go out, reoffend, embolden them, no consequences and I'll go one better because I've sat in these court rooms and I've prosecuted cases.

She gets obviously beaten so badly by a homeless man, that among her many ailments, she is not being able -- she's not able to see out of her eye and she might lose it. This 41 (inaudible) he fostered is facing felony assault charges and you probably guess by now his rap sheet is long, seven priors including assaulting another woman with a screwdriver, a conviction for murdering his 82-year-old foster grandmother in a brutal beating. How does is this guy even out of prison when he was 14. He was out on probation when he committed this latest attack. Now, over in Philadelphia we're getting disturbing surveillance footage of the murder of a Temple University grad. Police say the 23-year-old Everett Beauregard was the victim of unprovoked murder when he was shot and killed while walking home.

So, you have to read the room, they are not reading the room because -- okay, you can maybe make a case it's multifaceted in certain places, but people are seeing this every single day. And if you are at the White House on the political situation that they're in going into the midterms, you see that crime is right below inflation and economy, which you could combine, as one of the major issues. And you add border to that, which the people equate also with crime, then you have a serious law enforcement issue. I thought it was very interesting that Jen Psaki is now -- she's out of the White House. She's a commentator on MSNBC. She's asked about it and she said, yeah, crime is a big deal.

Mary Gay Scanlon who came out to defund the police and reimagine policing. They were both carjacked within 90 days of each other. Bill Walton 6'11\" big redhead who's got all for defunding the police and for Black Lives Matter.

Let me tell you something. She couldn't possibly answer the question, Karine Jean-Pierre, because to do so and to do so honestly would be to indict her boss and the whole administration. Murders are up 30 percent in the last two years in this country. And the bottom line is this nonsense, it's complicated and multifaceted. Crime is not complicated and multifaceted. Crime is simple and it's one- dimensional. You got a criminal and you got a victim. I don't give a darn what happened to the criminal in his life in the past. The only thing I care about is what he is doing today. And they want to make it complicated so that we all feel stupid and say, gee, maybe we don't really know about it. But let me tell you what they're doing. They're denying the trauma that the victims are going through. They are not giving the victims a voice, and they are protecting the criminal by creating bail laws that allow them to go out, reoffend, embolden them, no consequences and I'll go one better because I've sat in these court rooms and I've prosecuted cases. They create rules of evidence that make it impossible for us to know what the truth is. Evidence is being hidden all the time in criminal court rooms. This woman is savagely beaten coming out of JFK.

I thought Congress was supposed to spend the money, so that that might go down in flames in court. I was in Texas and people weren't talking about really the border, they weren't talking about crime. They were pissed off that Biden bailed out grad students. The regular middle class hard-working blue-collar guys could not believe how unfair this administration is. The American people understand the concept of fairness. They understand it more than most concepts because they get it. It's easy to understand. And this was reverse class warfare, and they feel like you have to be kidding me to do this at a time when the economy is teetering on a recession. I was going over my financials with an advisor today, and the amount of money that you have to start putting away for college now if you have young children, it is astronomical."

Hopefully, they'll get that extension or the the pause. My biggest concern is this. The administration continues to lie to us. We know that a recession is when you have two-quarters of negative GDP, OK, a recession. Some people think it's a recession, some people think it isn't. We're going to hell in a handbasket. Everybody knows that. And the last thing that we need to do is put the burden on other Americans to pay for a benefit for people who are not entitled to it. Veterans are entitled to it. Senior citizens who are on a fixed income are entitled to it. These people are not entitled to it especially if they're making, you know, $125,000 a year or 250 a couple. I mean, that's nonsense.
