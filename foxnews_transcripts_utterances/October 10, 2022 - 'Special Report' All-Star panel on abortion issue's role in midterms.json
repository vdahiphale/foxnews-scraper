      "sentences": "Sights and sounds about the conversation over the weekend as we get closer, 29 days till the midterm election. Meantime, a Democratic consultant everybody knows, James Carville, by the Associated Press, gave this quote, \"A lot of these consultants think if all we do is run abortion spots, that will win for us. I don't think so. It is a good issue, but if you just sit there and they are pummeling you on crime and pummeling you on the cost of living, you have got to be more aggressive than just yelling \"abortion\" every other word.\" So let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, co-host of THE FIVE, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, and Matthew Continetti, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Ari, what do you think about what Carville said there and how this race is shaping up?",

What he is saying may be true in an overwhelmingly Democratic district, but the places where the November election will come down to are obviously the battlegrounds where you have much more 50-50 contests, and pure Democrat rhetoric won't cut it. So I think, Bret, when you look at this selection, the biggest trends still is a historical one. The party in power almost always loses a significant number of seats in its first midterm. That will happen again in just four weeks. The Democrats are on track to lose the House of Representatives. The Senate remains a jump ball. I think it's still 50-50. I would bet that it comes down to 51-49 after a long night watching election results.",

I think Rick Scott has laid out an agenda and Kevin McCarthy has laid out an agenda. And I think it's a positive when the parties let you know where they stand. And the country is going to have an opportunity to choose. Do you want prescription drugs that are negotiated by Medicare which Democrats want, but it doesn't seem Republicans do? Do you want a fully funded police bill which Democrats all voted for, Republicans didn't. And do you want Zelenskyy to be supported, which many if not all Democrats want, and it feels like some Republicans don't. This is not a statement about good or bad on these things, but these are things that I agree with. I think we should have Medicare negotiating prescription drug prices. I think we should fund mental health services. When Ari and I were on maybe a few months back, it was a terrible day, the Uvalde shooting was, and we both talked about the need for mental health services. Congress had an opportunity to pass a bill last week, and every Republican but one Congressman voted against it. These are the things Democrats should lay out. Abortion alone is not going to lead us to victory. It's an important issue. It's an important freedom that women and families and doctors enjoy, but we have to make this about our future, and our economic future at that.",

Let's put up Georgia, here we go. Arizona is next. This is Mark Kelly just had a debate over Masters, still has a lead.

But Bret, I also think the polls, and we have seen this in the last several elections, understate, undercount Republican vote. And I think they do it by about two to four percentage points.
