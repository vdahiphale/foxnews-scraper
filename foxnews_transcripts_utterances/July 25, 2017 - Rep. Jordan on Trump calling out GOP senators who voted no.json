      "utterance": "Congressman, the president is on his way to your state here. And it comes at a time where the president had expressed frustration with this back and forth on health care, so much so that, for a while, he was briefly suggesting just let the thing implode, ObamaCare implode, hang it on the Democrats. He thought better of that. But this is a tough battle. Now that the tax cuts are the next battle, and he really, really wants that, and that's what everyone seems to be betting on the real battle that, if Newt Gingrich is right, will have the biggest economic impact right off the bat. Do you see a tax agreement coming to form in the fall that would be retroactive to January 1?"

    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes. Yes, I do. But we need to do both things, because we promised both things. That's we told the voters we were going to do, both repeal ObamaCare, replace it with something that is more patient-centered, and reform and replace our tax code, and lower the tax burden on families, and certainly lower the corporate rate, because we have the highest in the world. So, let's get about doing all that. The one thing we have talked about before, Neil, is, I am convinced we shouldn't function in a revenue-neutral world when it comes to tax policy. Revenue-neutral is a fancy Washington- speak way of saying, tax burden stays the same, we just shift around who pays what."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Some of your moderate colleagues in both the House and the Senate, though, sir, as I'm sure you're aware, are very revenue-neutral mind-set. And some have even said don't make these tax cuts across the board and certainly not for the wealthy. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "All I'm saying is, in revenue-neutral, the connected class get a good deal, the middle class gets a bad deal. We should not do that. We should be focused on deficit-neutral. And this is where I will be glad to work with my moderate colleagues and say, let's cut taxes, let's let families keep more of their money, let's lower the corporate rate, and then let's cut spending. After all, that's what Republicans are supposed to stand for, so let's focus on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, but if Newt Gingrich says he can live with where he gets everything else, a tax cut that doesn't materialize for the wealthy, could you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, we will look at the package. What I'm most focused on is, everybody knows our corporate rate is too high. It's the highest in the world. That needs to come down. Everyone knows our tax code is too complicated. It needs to be simplified. And, frankly, the burden on middle-class families does need to come down. So, let's focus on lowering the tax burden for everyone and let's also focus on controlling spending. That's what Republicans are supposed to stand for, not some fancy revenue-neutral idea, where you raise taxes on some, cut it on others."

      "utterance": "All right."

      "utterance": "Thank you."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "We will be watching that very, very closely. You can see that this is beginning to sort of fine-tune itself when it comes to tax cuts here, that it might not be so big, might not be so broad, but it will still be, or that's what they hope. And there will still be a health care measure. The Senate is debating it as we speak. This could go on and on and on. END Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
