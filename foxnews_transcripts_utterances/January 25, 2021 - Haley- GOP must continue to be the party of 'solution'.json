Further complicating these claims is the fact that on Trump's last day in it office, 1.6 million doses were administrated across the country. Since then, an average of 1.3 million vaccine doses have been administered every day. So when Biden says that he wants a million vaccines a day, he is telling the American people he actually wants to slow down the pace of what it was during the Trump administration. So what the media and the Biden team are doing is a slap in the face to the people who worked tirelessly to develop and deliver more than 40 million vaccine doses to the American people. Shame on them. Speaking of lying about COVID, Governor Gavin Newsom of California is refusing to share crucial data on the virus with his own citizens. The Associated Press reporting Newsom's administration won't disclose key information that will help determine when his latest stay at home order is lifted. State health officials say they rely on a very complex set of measurements that would confuse and potentially mislead the public if they were made public.

And then later we find out that he lied about the masks for our own good so we wouldn't be stupid and go out and buy masks. And herd immunity, we'd get the vaccination, but we wouldn't still social distancing. It's the same idea that he is talking down to us, because we are stupid.

And the true presence, it allows these liberals to do what they do best, play the victim, despite evidence of any serious ongoing threat. And it furnishes them with a backdoor way to execute their next agenda item, purging the military of any political opponents. Now, according to \"The Hill,\" Democrats will accomplish this by inserting language into this year's National Defense Authorization Act to address extremism at the Pentagon and other federal agencies. \"We know that some groups actively attempt to recruit our personnel into their cause, or actually encourage them members to join the military for the purpose of acquiring skills and experience.\" A senior Pentagon official told reporters earlier this month. Now, of course, this is all kind of vague for a reason. The broader and more opaque the language, the easier it is to cancel military members and other government personnel who don't fall in line politically or even culturally. Now, most people would agree that generally dangerous extremists should not be allowed to serve and join in the military.

Even if it does not constitute a criminal offense, attendance at an event designed to delegitimize the results of a presidential election and prevent the peaceful transfer of power raises serious questions about an applicant's suitability for a security clearance. Wow. President Xi Jinping would be very proud. Drive out all political opposition, drive them underground, force everyday Americans to live in fear.

These men and women have endured oftentimes repeated tours of duty abroad, risking life and limb, many times coming back to destroyed families, and now they're viewed with suspicion and targeted by elected officials at home? Republicans need to step up in unison and demand that the Defense Department and the Biden administration clearly define what they think constitutes extremism. Now, if a member of the military voted for Trump, does that make him an extremist? Now, what if someone complains on Facebook that the federal government wastes a lot of money? Is she an extremist? What if they say that Roe vs. Wade should be overturned? Or what if they participate in the March for Life? What if they're conservative Baptists? They believe that sex outside of marriage is immoral, is that extremist? What if they have guns at home and they're lifetime NRA members? Will they now be considered extremists, or even terrorists? We deserve to know. You see where this is destined to lead? And it is certainly not to a freer and more united America. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining us now is Lieutenant Colonel Danny Davis. He served 21 years in the Army and is currently Senior Fellow and military expert for Defense Priorities; and Dinesh D'Souza, executive producer of Trump Card, host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast. Lieutenant Colonel Davis, what about this, what they're doing? They're vetting members of the military for undesirable views that are now branded in these broad terms as threatening to the Republic?"

I mean, there are allegedly 27 people who are accused of doing something illegal with the Capitol riots couple of weeks ago, and 2.5 something million Americans who are on active or reserve duty. There are 18 million Americans who are veterans. And to suggest that because a handful - a tiny handful, is somehow systematically - that there's something involved with the entire national defense apparatus, that we need to go and check on each individual, I think is a way big overstretch and, frankly, an insult to the troops that we have.

Now, that's a distinction in other countries that is routinely overridden. You'll often find in other countries, the ruling party becomes the state, it takes over the police, it takes over the military and uses the military to hand out election flyers. The military becomes an extension of its own ideology. Now, we've been able, by and large, to immunize ourselves against this in America. So I think the Left here is crossing a new boundary. Now, why are they doing it? I think they're doing it because of this. They believe that if we, and by we here, I don't mean radicals. I don't mean terrorists. I'm talking about you and me. I'm talking about the kind of people that they don't hesitate to call extreme. Now, why do they call us extreme? Because they believe that if we had the same information they had, we would think like them. But the truth of it is we do have the same information that they have. We know - we hear their news reports, we know what they have to say and yet we don't agree. So they're really baffled. They think there's got to be some - we must be members of a cult. We must be radicalized in some way we must be living in a cocoon, because if only we listened to Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper and MSNBC, we would basically be on board with their views. So the recalcitrance of Trump supporters and not going along with their nonsense, that convinces them that somehow some conspiracy, some cult, some dangerous extremism must be at work."

So this is a case where the Left is conducting its own internal purge of the military. And I think you're right, this is a very dangerous road to go under.

Now, \"The Ingraham Angle\" can report tonight, the GOP senators will demand a vote for the trial to be dismissed at the outset and after 45 members could join that effort. Now, that would leave Democrats a dozen vote short of what they need to convict. Here now is Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, Fox News Contributor. Mollie they know this is going to fail. Even the Eric Swalwell of the China paramour fame was saying, well, we need to do this to show the world, to show ourselves.

They just rushed into it without in any way exploring the facts on the ground. So the claim that she makes, this assertion she provides without evidence of President Trump inciting a riot, turns out that's not true. President Trump was speaking at the time the Capitol was breached miles away. And everything we know about it from the reporting shows that this was planned well in advance. So the entire Article of Impeachment is based on a false theory that would have been able to be known if they'd spent any amount of time looking into it. But again, it's not about facts, it's not about reason, it's about trying to make sure that they won't have any effective opposition. Partly, that's about sidelining their political enemy. I mean, if another country you had this where you have the government - trying the previous government, while the military is occupying a city, you would just say this is not a healthy situation for the Republic. And yet we have all sorts of people acting like this is totally normal and OK, and not thinking through how to be adults right now in this situation."

We gained a lot of people that were unheard unseen, many of whom, like I grew up in South Carolina, had just been misunderstood, we want to keep them in the party. But the reality is, we lost a lot of women and we lost a lot of college educated. We want to bring them in and we want to expand the tent.

We believe that every person has an opportunity, if they're given the tools to do it.

      "utterance": "Oh, my God, they think we are just complete morons. The Trump administration and Operation Warp Speed were responsible for getting two vaccines to market in less than 12 months. A lot of those folks, by the way, were saying it was never going to happen. This as the infallible Fauci and the media cartel continue to say it would take years. Further complicating these claims is the fact that on Trump's last day in it office, 1.6 million doses were administrated across the country. Since then, an average of 1.3 million vaccine doses have been administered every day. So when Biden says that he wants a million vaccines a day, he is telling the American people he actually wants to slow down the pace of what it was during the Trump administration. So what the media and the Biden team are doing is a slap in the face to the people who worked tirelessly to develop and deliver more than 40 million vaccine doses to the American people. Shame on them. Speaking of lying about COVID, Governor Gavin Newsom of California is refusing to share crucial data on the virus with his own citizens. The Associated Press reporting Newsom's administration won't disclose key information that will help determine when his latest stay at home order is lifted. State health officials say they rely on a very complex set of measurements that would confuse and potentially mislead the public if they were made public. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution senior fellow. Victor, this goes in the category of the American people are too stupid for us to explain stuff, so we're going to conceal stuff that would make us look back."

      "utterance": "Yes, I think everybody wants to know why on the night of the 6th of December and 7th, we went into a total lockdown, and we had 5,000 or 6,000 fewer cases than we do now when we are opening up the entire state. So everybody wants to know, is this a connection between how many people are infected and how many freedom we have or not? He is basically saying shut up. And that is sort of the progressive modus operandi, Laura, where we the people are not educated enough, so we have this technocratic, progressive elite. They make the decisions and they do it for our own good. They are kind of like Platonic guardians. And we saw that with Fauci. Remember, mask bad, mask good. Herd immunity, not until we get 90 percent, maybe 60 percent. Wuhan virus, nothing to do with the lab in China. And then later we find out that he lied about the masks for our own good so we wouldn't be stupid and go out and buy masks. And herd immunity, we'd get the vaccination, but we wouldn't still social distancing. It's the same idea that he is talking down to us, because we are stupid. And that's how the progressive mind works. And then finally, we're in a year zero where all of a sudden around the 20th of January we set the calendar back to zero. And at that point, Joe Biden came out and said Trump had not plan and he killed 400,000 people. But guess what, I don't have a plan either other than the Trump vaccine, and 600,000 will end up dying, and there's nothing we can do about it. We can't stop the trajectory. If he had said that on November 2nd, he wouldn't have been elected. But everything starts over again, and that's where we are now. We are open now for business. Illinois is going to open up, New York, because the Biden economy, as Cuomo said, we need to get people back to work. A month ago, if you put people back to work you were essentially killing them, you had blood on your hands. So it's scary. It's kind of like Maoist China where the news gets recalibrated, the truth gets redefined, and we have this artificial year zero, January 20th, 2021, everything is new, new reality."

Lockdowns won't really help. Social distancing might, but you can't social distance do that forever. One, mask, two masks, three masks, four. How many masks are good enough? We don't know, but that keeps changing. And you mentioned Biden, today he still showed that he is a complete pawn of the teachers' unions when it comes to school openings, Victor. Watch."

They destroyed the reputation, they tried to, of my colleague Scott Atlas who told the nation that you have to social distance, you've got to wear masks, but this has a trajectory that it's going to be very difficult until we have vaccinations. And we don't want to kill people through this lockdown, through substance abuse, spousal abuse, missed procedures, missed surgeries. And they said he was crazy, and he was absolutely correct. It's tragic the way they treat people. Take their ideas and then they defame them."

You see one of his tweets right there to Trump never enacted a Muslim ban. Don't take our word for it. Here's PolitiFact. The order does not specifically bar Muslims. It applies only to citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.\" Funny how CNN's army a fact checkers seemed to miss those lies. Well, that's all the time we have tonight.
