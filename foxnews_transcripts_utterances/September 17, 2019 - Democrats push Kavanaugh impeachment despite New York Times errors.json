Just last month, it was solidified, you know, a now professor, but one of Kavanaugh's classmates, sued the Huffington Post over the article about Georgetown prep being a free for all in a party environment.

The Supreme Court said you're overcrowding in California is literally cruel and unusual. Prison labor, all of these things, and she came out and defended it by saying I wasn't behind offices messaging. I literally had no idea. I find that either inadequate or incompetent.

That's like saying, in the haste of editing our piece on the maiden voyage of the Titanic in the North Atlantic in 1912, we left out the fact that it sank. This was no error. This was a business decision to turn a nothing burger of a story into sirloin steak. When the victim renounced her own victimhood, they left it out. What's worse, the reporters now blamed the editors and the victim suggesting substance abuse. How do they still have jobs? And what about Christine Ford allies who threatened to smear one witness, Leland Keyser, if she didn't back up her story? That's pretty huge, too. It's witness tampering. Somehow, that got ignored as well. But this is the media. The only reason this hasn't happened to you, dear viewer, is that they don't consider you important enough to destroy. So, in the meantime, they'll target your proxies, Republican, justices, families and businesses of Republicans. They shape the smear first, then they work backwards, erasing any facts that hinder their reverse engineering. And so, Kavanaugh is a rapist becomes a foregone conclusion. In time, they'll do this to you if you ever make their radar, because the institutional media is at panic. They're getting killed, and it's not homicide by Trump. Nope, it's all self-inflicted. Suicide by their own arrogant, dishonest hands. Emily, it's interesting, the reporters, like, gently threw the editors under the bus. And then, when they talked about the victim not corroborating, they're like -- she's probably drunk."

And I really hate the hypocrisy coming out of the left where, once again, they're telling someone, oh, here honey, this is what happened. But, oh, you know, your struggles with moonshine are the reasons why you can't remember. And then final point, you know, this has created such a ripple effect in terms of sham journalism. Just last month, it was solidified, you know, a now professor, but one of Kavanaugh's classmates, sued the Huffington Post over the article about Georgetown prep being a free for all in a party environment. And their insinuations, or actually there declarations that he provided the drugs that RFK's son O.D. over. And in the retraction and the correction that Huff Po published, they literally defamed him more, and then they have to retract that. And now, their story, by the way, does not even mention the death of David Kennedy and the O.D. in 1984. And so, I think they basically dug a hole even deeper."

So -- but he wish he kept his calendar from high school because that's the only thing that saved him back then. And the fact that the people are upset about Kavanaugh, yeah, I mean, this is upsetting to him and his family. They do this to Donald Trump every single day.

That feeds into the fears of people who own guns that a civil tag or a red flag system will be used unfairly. I was hoping that wouldn't be the case if you go to a court, you have people who are, you know, health workers or police officers or school principals that are there to talk about the students. Now, what Beto's done is made it sound like, I could just make a phone call and you'd lose your gun. So he -- you know, to get the spotlight for himself, he really screwed up a lot of progress. I also think that there's -- there is progress to be made in cosmetics thing, and cosmetic things that you put onto gun that aren't necessary, that tend to attract a certain type of gun owner.

If I could focus on Kamala Harris, though, for a second, you know, for someone who has had decades of criminal justice experience, I find her over simplification, and also flip-flopping, exhausting, and really confusing. And she started with the take back and then now the buyback, which makes no sense because the government didn't sell it to begin with. But, you know, she builds herself out as a, quote, progressive prosecutor. But when she was California's A.G., it was status quo. And under her reign, there were a lot of -- frankly, atrocities that happened that now she has distanced herself from, right? The Supreme Court said you're overcrowding in California is literally cruel and unusual. Prison labor, all of these things, and she came out and defended it by saying I wasn't behind offices messaging. I literally had no idea. I find that either inadequate or incompetent. And so, for me, coming from California, and with also a criminal justice background, that's why I wanted to take this moment to highlight her jumping on this bandwagon, which I think is ineffective.

You could say that. If you agree with this idea that you can take off school for climate change, then let's substitute the cost with one that you're not -- that's not your ideological cup of tea, right? Maybe you want to protest going to school because it's not a gun -- it's because it's a gun-free zone. Therefore, you, as a parent, or your kids don't feel safe in a school because it's a gun-free zone, therefore we want to take that day off. Right now, you know, every liberal -- their head would explode. Or maybe because of lack of school prayer. Maybe you want to take school off and protest lack of school prayer. Of course you're not OK with that. So the point is, this is all about ideology that you should be against this no matter what it is. You can protest -- you don't want to have boys and girls bathrooms. You could protest that, too. But you're not. So here's the thing. If I were a teacher and you didn't show up for that, I would flunk you. I would flunk you. And as for the chocolate milk, why aren't they doing this with white milk?"

America is actually in a better position now from a safety and security standpoint because we have figured out innovations in fracking being one of them. In addition, there was a great new story today, one of the things that puts out more greenhouse gas emissions than anything else is the production of cement. And today at MIT labs they were going to reveal that there is a new way of actually making cement that will actually capture all of those greenhouse gases. So, innovation is the key to this.

It doesn't make sense, it's not logical. That's not evidence. And playing the judge, jury and executioner as Kamala Harris and the other 2020 presidential candidates like to do doesn't restore my faith that they're actually going to uphold the process and that you know I think the President is right here. That is exactly what the Left is doing, and you know Judge Clarence Thomas in 1991, he said to a friend, the reason that he got confirmed is because African-Americans remain too loyal to him. This was his quote. And he said that in 15 to 20 years, I predict that I will lose that support and I will fall into disfavor because the special interest liberal groups will stop at nothing to get their way and to get that message across and the same thing is happening now with Kavanaugh,"

And it goes back to what I said yesterday. Their tactics were exposed by outsiders. And it makes you wonder how many stories in New York Times, how many stories in The Washington Post that ruin people's lives were also corrupted. That's what I said like I don't trust anything anymore. And maybe that is the great service of the last three years. Well, I just wondered, should we be looking at all of these other stories to find out how many people got screwed.

It reminds me Juan of the Tyson-Holyfield fight. Tyson was losing. He knows he was going to lose. He bites Holyfield's ear in order to get decued and that's how that thing went down.

He knows how to get clean. Obviously, he did something earlier in the day. And he can't seem to wash it off. Some kind of moral failing that that bird has.

So, Patti Baumgartner wanted the cars in her town to slow down, she's like sick of it, she can't take it anymore. She wants her grandkids and everyone else in the neighborhood to be safe, so she armed herself with her blow dryer pose like a police officer with a radar gun and her son showed the photos of the mom online, got the attention of the highway patrol. Noah Pesola and he tracked down Patti and made her an honorary trooper for her efforts. He said that Montana has a speeding issue and her creative response has helped draw attention to the problem."

You got a private tour. I mean it's going to be amazing. I'm sure they have a million, because remember in the beginning of Downtown Abbey it was the white lab that it shows.
