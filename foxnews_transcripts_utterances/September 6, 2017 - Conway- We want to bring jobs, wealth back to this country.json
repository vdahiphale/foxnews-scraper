President Trump -- he continues to work towards keeping a very key campaign promise. He's now calling on Congress to work to pass a massive tax reform plan. That should help you, the American people, of course, after years of suffering under the Obama administration. Also tonight, the destroy Trump media -- they prove they don't care about the Constitution, the rule of law. They are in full complete meltdown freakout mode over the president's DACA decision, which of course is constitutional and doesn't usurp the power of Congress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, the clock is ticking for leaders on Capitol Hill.

We will lay out very simply for Republicans what they need to accomplish.

So earlier today in North Dakota, President Trump, he called for a dramatic, Reaganesque overhaul of the federal tax code -- so desperately needed. Let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Workers would have more money in their pockets after not seeing real raises in years. Companies -- they'd be able to see lower taxes.

So instead of talking about his tax plan, his new reforms, the media is hysterical, it's, like, 24/7 hyperventilating about President Trump and his decision to be constitutional on the issue of DACA, and give Congress an additional six months to do their job, come up with a law-abiding constitutional solution.

Do you know innocent Americans, many of them, have lost their loved ones and American families have suffered because American politicians -- they just refuse steadfastly to enforce immigration laws. And what has the media done about it? Well, on this show for years, we've interviewed on numerous occasions family members who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal immigrants. We've heard firsthand of their devastating stories, more so than any other show that we know. And here's why it's important that we bring this up. The media, the left in this country -- they love to claim they have a monopoly on compassion and acceptance, and conservatives are mean-spirited and hard-hearted. But you know what? Yet they attack the president for following the rule of law, respecting the Constitution, enumerated powers, coequal branches of government and actually enforcing immigration laws and advocating for extreme vetting to protect Americans against our enemies. In reality, the left is a bunch of hypocrites, because if they really cared about the safety and security of the American people, your pain, your suffering -- in other words, they show us phony compassion because if they really cared, they would want to enforce the laws. You know, where was the media talking about the disastrous Obama economy, 50 million Americans in poverty, 8 million more than before Obama was president, 50 million on food stamps, 13 million more after eight years of Obama, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, the worst economic recovery since the '40s, lowest home ownership rate since -- in 51 years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So other than us, did you ever hear about this from anybody else in the media? Do they even care about the forgotten men and women in this country? No, it appears they don't. And they don't have any standards. There's no morals or decency anymore. Look at, for example, Antifa, the media rushing to condemn out-of-control violence? Well, what took them so long? How many people need to be attacked and beaten before the media's going to speak out against the radical Antifa leftists? Here's my larger point tonight. President Trump ran on a specific pro-America, pro-worker, pro-growth agenda. And you know what? It's time for Congress -- they ran on basically the same thing, at least Republicans did -- that they now benefit the American people and get their hands dirty, stay up late at night and do their job and get some sense of urgency about what they're supposed to do. And they'd better be paying attention. And that means you, Mitch McConnell, Mr. 18 percent approval rating. Congress needs to get focused, get to work. They need to start passing tax reform, seven brackets to three, slash middle-class tax rates, they're paying too much. If you slash the corporate tax rate to around 15 percent, allow multi-national companies that have trillions parked overseas, repatriate the money at a low rate, that will create millions of jobs in this country and help people out of poverty and get them off of food stamps, get them back in the labor force. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Congress also needs to get moving. Guess what? Start building the wall. You know what? But put doors all over the wall as long as people come here that want to participate and adopt our values and be a part of our family, we're fine with that. But we do need to vet them. So Congress needs to pass legislation to bring about energy independence. We have millions of high-paying career jobs out there and waiting, and we won't depending on countries that hate us for the lifeblood of our economy. And finally, Republicans in Congress, keep your word. Will you please repeal and replace ObamaCare. Get your act together. This isn't rocket science. These are all the things you all ran on! President Trump has a higher approval rating than the media by far and all of you in Congress. And what have you guys been doing all these years? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here with reaction, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway. I know I'm long-winded, but I feel very passionately. It's time to stop the nonsense! Americans are suffering here. They need jobs. They want to get out of poverty and want to get off of food stamps. And there's an easy path out. What is the media missing?",

      "sentences": "They're missing the fact that you have Democratic senators like Heidi Heitkamp willing to stand with the president today, join him to her home state of North Dakota. Why? Because she knows 73 percent of North Dakotans support tax reform. And that's a state that Donald Trump won running on tax reform and tax relief by 36 points. Then you look at a state where Joe Manchin in West Virginia is up for reelection next year, as well. That's a state Bill Clinton carried by 15 points in 1996, and 20 years later, Donald Trump carried the state by almost 43 points because he ran as a limited government conservative who's going to cut taxes, repeal and replace \"Obama care,\" strengthen our borders, keep us prosperous and safe. Now, you raise a very important point. Many Americans, Sean, want the dignity of work. They want to be self-sufficient. They want to know that they have high-paying jobs that are stable and secure. The best way to do that really is to lower taxes, to lower taxes on our job creators, our job holders and our job seekers and also to repatriate all this wealth that is legally parked offshore. We want to bring the jobs and the wealth back to this country. This is very simple. The president laid it out today. I think North Dakota is an inspiring economic example to the country, if not the world, of what happens when you allow energy production, when you allow entrepreneurship, ingenuity, competitiveness. We have to make our employers competitive so that they can attract and retain an American workforce. The offshoring model under our current tax code does not work. Our offshoring model means that we punish American companies for doing business here, and it forces them to ship the jobs and the wealth overseas. The American model under President Trump simplifies the tax code and makes it more fair, gives a middle tax class tax cut, repatriates that wealth and makes our employers more competitive. This is easy stuff. There's not a Republican in the House or the Senate, and probably the governorships and the state legislators, and there are many Democrats, as well, who ran on this and ought to be able to pass it and make good on their promise. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The attorney general and DHS both concluded that there is no constitutional or statutory authority for DACA, and that rather than take the chance in being sued by these nine state attorneys general, take the chance that what happened to DACA would happen to DACA, in that you would have an immediate rescinding of the program, of the measure, the president went a different route. He provided a longer runway, a six-month wind-down, giving people notice and auguring for a more orderly and efficient process. You know, I like to -- I like to contrast it to the travel halt earlier in the year, where the same people were up in arms about that. That actually does have statutory and constitutional authority. In addition to the constitutional authority for the president, 8 U.S. Code 1882 gives a president broad authority to -- under our immigration system to take action where he sees fit. So there you actually have a statute to read. They refused to do that here. There is no statute to read, and they refused to acknowledge that, too. But look, President Obama himself admitted something that we agree with completely six years later, that it is Congress who makes the laws in this country. Sean, that includes the immigration laws.

It just went to the north. We know that it is going to continue to track up towards the west, tomorrow taking a beating across the Turks and Caicos, then in towards the Bahamas. It's after that by Saturday that we're going to watch a turn in this storm. Where that turn happens will cause very big implications for areas of Florida.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News Alert. And we are following three major breaking news stories tonight. President Trump -- he continues to work towards keeping a very key campaign promise. He's now calling on Congress to work to pass a massive tax reform plan. That should help you, the American people, of course, after years of suffering under the Obama administration. Also tonight, the destroy Trump media -- they prove they don't care about the Constitution, the rule of law. They are in full complete meltdown freakout mode over the president's DACA decision, which of course is constitutional and doesn't usurp the power of Congress. Also tonight, the clock is ticking for leaders on Capitol Hill. Fourteen weeks they have to get their act together and enact the president's agenda before the end of the year. Tonight, we will hold Washington accountable. We will lay out very simply for Republicans what they need to accomplish. That's tonight's very important news-breaking \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, the president once again left the sewer, the swamp that is known as Washington, D.C., left the area to take his tax reform message directly to you, the American people. So earlier today in North Dakota, President Trump, he called for a dramatic, Reaganesque overhaul of the federal tax code -- so desperately needed. Let's take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we reform America's outdate, complex and extremely burdensome -- I mean, this is so complicated and so burdensome -- our tax code. If we want to renew our prosperity, restore our opportunity and reestablish our economic dominance, which is what we should be doing, then we need tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and yes, pro-American. My administration is working with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, lower taxes for businesses of all sizes and middle-class families all across the nation. So it's not only business taxes. It's middle income families. It's families at every level, every level -- tax cuts."

      "utterance": "Here's a question. Do the people in D.C. -- do they care about the 50 million Americans in poverty, the 50 million on food stamps, the 94 million out of the labor force? Do they care that we have a 51-year low in terms of home ownership rate in this country? Now, what the president is calling for today is going to have a profound positive impact on the forgotten men and women in this country and the country as a whole. Workers would have more money in their pockets after not seeing real raises in years. Companies -- they'd be able to see lower taxes. That means they can hire more employees, invest in new technologies, build factories and manufacturing centers. And just like President Reagan, GDP growth and federal tax revenue -- it will soar. Ironically, Washington will have more money to waste. Then, of course, the destroy Trump media -- they don't care about any of this. They're not interested in the truth. They're not interested in the business of offering solutions to people that have been left behind. What is the media's main objective? They create false narratives, outright lies. And their obvious goal is to try and damage, delegitimize President Trump. So instead of talking about his tax plan, his new reforms, the media is hysterical, it's, like, 24/7 hyperventilating about President Trump and his decision to be constitutional on the issue of DACA, and give Congress an additional six months to do their job, come up with a law-abiding constitutional solution. Just take a look at how insane, how obsessed the media is in attacking the president and the attorney general."

The president has already given Congress eight months. Now they have six additional months. If you want DACA, go ask your congressmen and senators. Now, what the media has been trying to do to President Trump -- they've been doing this for months. They are creating lies and a false narrative. And again, they want to smear this president in order to try and scare the American people into turning against him. They peddle nonsense, lies 24/7. And what the president actually did, instead of stomping on the Constitution, shredding the rule of law -- by the way, even Obama recognized he didn't have the right to do it. He said it, like, 20 times. Well, President Trump is giving Congress now an additional six months to do their job, legislate, and come up with a solution. Now, apparently, members of the elite establishment media -- they need to go back to school and maybe take a class on how the government works because it actually takes Congress. They make the laws. We have three branches of government. And the president -- guess what? He signs the laws. There are limits to executive authority and power. Obama said it himself. The media seems so absolutely apoplectic to just go after everything Trump. So let's have Barack Obama himself give them a lesson. Here's the former president over the years, well, before he signed DACA and after he signed DACA, talking about his own limits of executive power. Media, watch, listen, learn. Is this cruel? THEN-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SEN. BARACK OBAMA, D-ILL., SEPT. 8, 2008: ... mock the Constitution? Don't make fun of it! Don't suggest that it's un-American to abide by what the Founding Fathers set up! It's worked pretty well for over 200 years! THEN-PRESIDENT OBAMA, MAY 10, 2011: Sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, you know, they wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how democracy works. OBAMA, MARCH 28, 2011: The notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order -- that's just not the case. OBAMA, JULY 25, 2011: Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. But that's not how -- that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. OBAMA, FEB. 4, 2013: The problem is, is that, you know, I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. OBAMA, FEB. 2, 2013: If we start broadening that, then, essentially, I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option. OBAMA, NOV. 25, 2013: If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we are also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition."

All the president did here and wants to do here is follow the law of the land and protect the American people. For example -- and this is something the destroy Trump media will never tell you, which is why we take over for them. I've been down to the border over a dozen times. I have seen what goes on there firsthand -- crime, drugs, illegal immigration and even trafficking of people. There are good people who do come into this country. They want a better life. But not everyone is good. I have proof. Back in 2014 during one of my many trips to the border -- well -- and I've been there so many times. I sat in a briefing, a security briefing with then-Texas Governor Rick Perry. And what we learned was shocking. Over a seven-year span, illegal immigrants -- that's right, in Texas alone -- had committed 642,000 crimes, including murder and other violent crimes against Texans. Watch this security briefing."

      "utterance": "So is your corrupt media -- are they paying any attention? Do you know innocent Americans, many of them, have lost their loved ones and American families have suffered because American politicians -- they just refuse steadfastly to enforce immigration laws. And what has the media done about it? Well, on this show for years, we've interviewed on numerous occasions family members who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal immigrants. We've heard firsthand of their devastating stories, more so than any other show that we know. And here's why it's important that we bring this up. The media, the left in this country -- they love to claim they have a monopoly on compassion and acceptance, and conservatives are mean-spirited and hard-hearted. But you know what? Yet they attack the president for following the rule of law, respecting the Constitution, enumerated powers, coequal branches of government and actually enforcing immigration laws and advocating for extreme vetting to protect Americans against our enemies. In reality, the left is a bunch of hypocrites, because if they really cared about the safety and security of the American people, your pain, your suffering -- in other words, they show us phony compassion because if they really cared, they would want to enforce the laws. You know, where was the media talking about the disastrous Obama economy, 50 million Americans in poverty, 8 million more than before Obama was president, 50 million on food stamps, 13 million more after eight years of Obama, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, the worst economic recovery since the '40s, lowest home ownership rate since -- in 51 years. So other than us, did you ever hear about this from anybody else in the media? Do they even care about the forgotten men and women in this country? No, it appears they don't. And they don't have any standards. There's no morals or decency anymore. Look at, for example, Antifa, the media rushing to condemn out-of-control violence? Well, what took them so long? How many people need to be attacked and beaten before the media's going to speak out against the radical Antifa leftists? Here's my larger point tonight. President Trump ran on a specific pro-America, pro-worker, pro-growth agenda. And you know what? It's time for Congress -- they ran on basically the same thing, at least Republicans did -- that they now benefit the American people and get their hands dirty, stay up late at night and do their job and get some sense of urgency about what they're supposed to do. And they'd better be paying attention. And that means you, Mitch McConnell, Mr. 18 percent approval rating. Congress needs to get focused, get to work. They need to start passing tax reform, seven brackets to three, slash middle-class tax rates, they're paying too much. If you slash the corporate tax rate to around 15 percent, allow multi-national companies that have trillions parked overseas, repatriate the money at a low rate, that will create millions of jobs in this country and help people out of poverty and get them off of food stamps, get them back in the labor force. And Congress also needs to get moving. Guess what? Start building the wall. You know what? But put doors all over the wall as long as people come here that want to participate and adopt our values and be a part of our family, we're fine with that. But we do need to vet them. So Congress needs to pass legislation to bring about energy independence. We have millions of high-paying career jobs out there and waiting, and we won't depending on countries that hate us for the lifeblood of our economy. And finally, Republicans in Congress, keep your word. Will you please repeal and replace ObamaCare. Get your act together. This isn't rocket science. These are all the things you all ran on! President Trump has a higher approval rating than the media by far and all of you in Congress. And what have you guys been doing all these years? Here with reaction, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway. I know I'm long-winded, but I feel very passionately. It's time to stop the nonsense! Americans are suffering here. They need jobs. They want to get out of poverty and want to get off of food stamps. And there's an easy path out. What is the media missing?"

      "speaker": "KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "They're missing the fact that you have Democratic senators like Heidi Heitkamp willing to stand with the president today, join him to her home state of North Dakota. Why? Because she knows 73 percent of North Dakotans support tax reform. And that's a state that Donald Trump won running on tax reform and tax relief by 36 points. Then you look at a state where Joe Manchin in West Virginia is up for reelection next year, as well. That's a state Bill Clinton carried by 15 points in 1996, and 20 years later, Donald Trump carried the state by almost 43 points because he ran as a limited government conservative who's going to cut taxes, repeal and replace \"Obama care,\" strengthen our borders, keep us prosperous and safe. Now, you raise a very important point. Many Americans, Sean, want the dignity of work. They want to be self-sufficient. They want to know that they have high-paying jobs that are stable and secure. The best way to do that really is to lower taxes, to lower taxes on our job creators, our job holders and our job seekers and also to repatriate all this wealth that is legally parked offshore. We want to bring the jobs and the wealth back to this country. This is very simple. The president laid it out today. I think North Dakota is an inspiring economic example to the country, if not the world, of what happens when you allow energy production, when you allow entrepreneurship, ingenuity, competitiveness. We have to make our employers competitive so that they can attract and retain an American workforce. The offshoring model under our current tax code does not work. Our offshoring model means that we punish American companies for doing business here, and it forces them to ship the jobs and the wealth overseas. The American model under President Trump simplifies the tax code and makes it more fair, gives a middle tax class tax cut, repatriates that wealth and makes our employers more competitive. This is easy stuff. There's not a Republican in the House or the Senate, and probably the governorships and the state legislators, and there are many Democrats, as well, who ran on this and ought to be able to pass it and make good on their promise."

And when it comes to DACA, we really need to talk about the facts here. The attorney general and DHS both concluded that there is no constitutional or statutory authority for DACA, and that rather than take the chance in being sued by these nine state attorneys general, take the chance that what happened to DACA would happen to DACA, in that you would have an immediate rescinding of the program, of the measure, the president went a different route. He provided a longer runway, a six-month wind-down, giving people notice and auguring for a more orderly and efficient process. You know, I like to -- I like to contrast it to the travel halt earlier in the year, where the same people were up in arms about that. That actually does have statutory and constitutional authority. In addition to the constitutional authority for the president, 8 U.S. Code 1882 gives a president broad authority to -- under our immigration system to take action where he sees fit. So there you actually have a statute to read. They refused to do that here. There is no statute to read, and they refused to acknowledge that, too. But look, President Obama himself admitted something that we agree with completely six years later, that it is Congress who makes the laws in this country. Sean, that includes the immigration laws.

It just went to the north. We know that it is going to continue to track up towards the west, tomorrow taking a beating across the Turks and Caicos, then in towards the Bahamas. It's after that by Saturday that we're going to watch a turn in this storm. Where that turn happens will cause very big implications for areas of Florida. What we know at this point, we are to see impacts in Florida possibly making a landfall of a hurricane here in south Florida.

This was such a big deal and didn't James Comey want to pay this guy Steele all this money for the phony Russia hookers, Ritz story, going to the bathroom on a bed story that was proven false? SARA CARTER, \"CIRCA NEWS\": Well, I've spoken to sources on the Hill about this. This is something I've been looking into, Sean. And this is one of the questions they want answered, and this is one of the questions that they have been stonewalling on. They have been stonewalling members of Congress, and particularly Chairman Nunes, others like Trey Gowdy, Chairman Grassley on the Judiciary Committee on all of these questions. They want to know did the FBI verify anything in that dossier before they used it to do anything like issue FISA warrants to begin an investigation?"

So what we are hearing is, and this is information coming from sources, is that it was possibly a never Trumper at first that began this original inquiry into Trump to put the dossier together, and then other people became involved. And this is what the committees want to know. The House committee wants to know, the intelligence committee wants to know what to the FBI use? What were they looking at? Did they verify anything in there before they went forward with an investigation? And if they didn't, that raises enormous questions, Sean, because that means they would have started this investigation. Remember, they briefed the president on this salacious dossier, and a lot of it has been proven false. They briefed the president on this."

It's a violation of the Hatch Act. You are not allowed to use your public office for political purposes. So the only way to get to the bottom of this is to force the Department of Justice and the FBI to turn over the documents and testify. If they don't, then the committee should move one of two things. Criminal contempt, as in the Eric Holder case, in which people can be held criminally responsible, or civil contempt in which you sue the FBI and force them through a federal judge to turn over the documents."

He's never been proven wrong in 11 years, unlike \"The New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" and CNN. So here's my question.

And we don't even know what happened with that money you were supposed to give them. What happened to it, Hillary? Let us know what happened. So Hillary, since you can't tell us what really happened, then you need to go home and you need to go to bed. And that is my final word."

Anyway, thank you for being with us. As always, we will see you back here tomorrow night. This show is not the establishment, destroy-Trump-media. We are there fair and the balanced part.
