Qualified immunity is a very big deal. If you want to destroy policing in America, make sure that every cop can be sued when they leave the house. So there's a way to find qualified immunity reform, take the cop out of it. My idea, along with Senator Scott, is you can't sue the police officer, you sue the department if there's an allegation of civil rights abuse or constitutional rights abuse. We can solve that problem. We can solve the issues if there's will to get there and I think there is will to get their own part of both parties know.",

The Iranians are off the mat. He's opening up negotiations with the Iranian regime that they haven't done a damn to change. Afghanistan is going to fall apart. Russia and China are pushing us -- already pushing him around. So I'm very worried. I think he's been a very destabilizing president.

He has governed so far, not just from the near left, but pretty much from the far left. I mean he is out there. And Republicans, obviously, are not coming toward that stuff. And, you know, you heard in Kevin -- when Kevin McCarthy said, you remember the proposal that -- the proposal that the GOP senators made on the -- on the COVID bill, which went nowhere. So I think, you know, we'll see. But -- but I don't -- I don't think there's a case to be made that -- that he's been, you know, as a centrist reaching out to Republicans at all.",

During the campaign, he talked about being a bridge to future Democrats, in effect being a transitional president. It seems to me, looking at these hundred days, he's been a transformational -- or tried to be a transformational president, much more so than -- than Obama, more so than Bill Clinton, more in -- in the -- following the footsteps of FDR and LBJ. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I think you're right about that and I think that is a surprise when you look at some of the rhetoric from the campaign trail where he did talk about being this bridge figure where he certainly was positioning himself as more of a centrist than people like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. I think in some ways this is a situation where his presidency is trying to meet the moment. He certainly stepped into the White House at a time when he was facing multiple crises on multiple fronts and I think that that has reshaped the agenda. I think also he is taking some real lessons that he feels like he learned from serving as Obama's number two in terms of how ambitious you need to be at the start. He knows very well that as a president your runway is pretty short in terms of getting big legislation done. And so while we're seeing big, grand ambitions right now, he knows that when he looks six, eight months down the road, when he looks into his second year of his presidency, all of those get a lot harder.

And while we will celebrate our anniversary a little later, today is no different. President Biden marks his own milestones this week. On Wednesday, he will address a joint session of Congress for the first time. A day later, he will mark his 100th day in office. Ahead of that, we have new FOX News poll's on the state of his presidency. When it comes to job performance, 54 percent approve of how Mr. Biden is doing while 43 percent disapprove. To compare, Barack Obama had 62 percent job approval at his hundred day mark and George W. Bush was at 63 percent, but Mr. Biden is doing better than the 45 percent approval Donald Trump had four years ago. We'll have more polls later this hour. But first, Congress is trying again to reform the nation's policing laws in the wake of the guilty verdict in the murder of George Floyd. In a moment we will talk with Democrat's Congresswoman Karen Bass, sponsor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But we begin with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who's working with fellow South Carolina Senator Tim Scott on a compromise. Senator Graham, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\"."

They filibustered Tim Scott's bill because they didn't want Tim Scott and President Trump to get credit for it. There's no reason we shouldn't have done it last time. We'll try again. Qualified immunity is a very big deal. If you want to destroy policing in America, make sure that every cop can be sued when they leave the house. So there's a way to find qualified immunity reform, take the cop out of it. My idea, along with Senator Scott, is you can't sue the police officer, you sue the department if there's an allegation of civil rights abuse or constitutional rights abuse. We can solve that problem. We can solve the issues if there's will to get there and I think there is will to get their own part of both parties know."

      "speaker": "It's a pretty simple solution",

      "utterance": "No, not in my opinion. We just elected a two-term African-American president. The vice president is of African-American-Indian descent. So our systems are not racist. America is not a racist country. Within every society, you have bad actors. The Chauvin trial was a just result. What's happening in Ohio where the police officer had to use deadly force to prevent a young girl from being stabbed to death is a different situation in my view. So this attack on police and policing -- reform the police, yes, call them all racist, no. You know, America is a work in progress but best -- best place on the planet and Joe Biden spent a lot of time running the place down. I wish he would stop it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, during the campaign, he made us all believe that Joe Biden would be the moderate choice, that he really -- that court packing was a bonehead idea. All of a sudden, we got a commission to change the structure of the Supreme Court, making D.C. a state. I think that's a very radical idea that will change the makeup of the United States Senate. AOC said his first 100 days exceeded her expectations. That's all you need to know. I like Joe Biden, but I'm in the 43 percent. He's been a disaster on foreign policy. The border is in chaos. The Iranians are off the mat. He's opening up negotiations with the Iranian regime that they haven't done a damn to change. Afghanistan is going to fall apart. Russia and China are pushing us -- already pushing him around. So I'm very worried. I think he's been a very destabilizing president. And economically, he's throwing a wet blanket over the recovery, wanting to raise taxes in a large amount and regulate America basically out of business. So I'm not very impressed with the first 100 days. This is not what I thought I would get from Joe Biden."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to pick up on one of your last points there. You say that you believe that this president and Democrats in Congress have been involved in a power grab, but I think they would push back by saying, look, we passed COVID relief without a single Republican vote in either the House or the Senate. And as we talk now about infrastructure and social programs that the president is proposing, would you, or do you know of any Republican who would support paying for that by raising taxes on either corporations or the wealthy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think the pay-fors that they have are going to sell to the Republican Party but if you want some good news on the 25th anniversary of your show, there's probably an $800 billion and $900 billion infrastructure bill that we could all agree on. Joe Manchin has a pay-for. I'm not going to raise corporate taxes to 28 percent. At the end of the day, I'm willing to not pay for some of the infrastructure spending because I think it over time pays for itself. We're not going to do a couple trillion dollars, 85 percent of it has got nothing to do with infrastructure. But I think there's a bipartisan compromise coming about. Watch Joe Manchin. Joe is going to be a key player here. I met with him a couple of days ago. I think there's a sweet spot an infrastructure or we can find pay-fors that won't hurt the economy. If you raise taxes now, you're going to destroy jobs."
    },

      "utterance": "I got less than a minute left here, Senator. But you say -- Joe Manchin is talking about raising corporate taxes not to 28 percent, but from 21 percent to 25. The Republican plan doesn't have any tax increases in it."

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I'm going to talk to Joe about it. I want to make sure it doesn't hurt the economy. We're competing with the world writ large. A lot of the money we spent for COVID had nothing to do with COVID that is unspent. We can direct some of that to infrastructure. This $1.9 trillion package we talked about didn't get one Republican vote because it was just unrelated to COVID, most of it, and six bills were passed bipartisan before Biden came in. So there is a willingness to be bipartisan on COVID, but it's got to be related to COVID. So, yes, there is a deal to be done on infrastructure, I think."

And the argument is look, the money isn't with the individual cop, it's with the police officer and if there's a bad cop, the department will get rid of them anyway. Would you be willing to go for that on immunity, sue the police department, not the officer?"

Let me give you an example. In Minneapolis, for instance, if Chauvin had not been convicted, even though he was fired, do you know that he could go through arbitration and that police chief has no ability not to rehire him?

You can look at each of our institutions. Why is there such massive inequality when it comes to education, when it comes to health care? Why does that exist?

In your same poll it would say to a two to one margin, the American public wants this president to work with the Republicans find a solution. We're going to hit 100 days. I have not met with the president one time nor had one conversation with him. We have a crisis at a border that he created. The person he put in charge, the vice president, hasn't even been down to see it.

And, you know, you heard in Kevin -- when Kevin McCarthy said, you remember the proposal that -- the proposal that the GOP senators made on the -- on the COVID bill, which went nowhere. So I think, you know, we'll see. But -- but I don't -- I don't think there's a case to be made that -- that he's been, you know, as a centrist reaching out to Republicans at all."

They're now talking about, I guess when you all add it up, more than $3 trillion in infrastructure and social spending. And I think the default position is that they're going to do the same thing again through reconciliation and a straight party line vote. Is that bipartisanship?"

If you look at the COVID relief plan, Republican voters support it in polls. If you look at infrastructure spending, right now for the lion share of that, Republicans support it. If you look at immigration reform, Republicans support it. They wanted it to happen. So even as Republican voters support much of President Biden's plan, he has unified voters across political lines, but what he has not unified has been Republicans in Congress. They have reverted to the kind of obstruction tactics that they used against Clinton when he was trying to save the economy back in '93, against Obama in '09 when he was facing the economic collapse."

      "utterance": "Julie, the biggest surprise for me about President Biden is not his policies, whether he's near left or far left. The biggest surprise for me are his ambitions. During the campaign, he talked about being a bridge to future Democrats, in effect being a transitional president. It seems to me, looking at these hundred days, he's been a transformational -- or tried to be a transformational president, much more so than -- than Obama, more so than Bill Clinton, more in -- in the -- following the footsteps of FDR and LBJ. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I think you're right about that and I think that is a surprise when you look at some of the rhetoric from the campaign trail where he did talk about being this bridge figure where he certainly was positioning himself as more of a centrist than people like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. I think in some ways this is a situation where his presidency is trying to meet the moment. He certainly stepped into the White House at a time when he was facing multiple crises on multiple fronts and I think that that has reshaped the agenda. I think also he is taking some real lessons that he feels like he learned from serving as Obama's number two in terms of how ambitious you need to be at the start. He knows very well that as a president your runway is pretty short in terms of getting big legislation done. And so while we're seeing big, grand ambitions right now, he knows that when he looks six, eight months down the road, when he looks into his second year of his presidency, all of those get a lot harder. So I think it will be interesting to compare the posture that he's taking right now in his first hundred days, his first couple months to where he is next year."

I -- he know -- he just basically overthrew the set of policies and practices that -- that the president, President Trump, had put in place and the result is what you see and -- and it's -- you know, it's there for all to see and for all their -- all their quibbling over whether you call it a crisis or not, people can see that it's a hell of a mess and he's paying the price for that in terms of what people think of how he's done on the issue.

But the perception is the opposite in a lot of these central American countries.

People know that they're going to get sharp questions. You know, I think a lot of this is being able to disagree without being disagreeable, knowing that you can go to a Sunday show where you will get really fact-based questions and expect honest, revealing answers. And that's become the epitome of what, you know, what FOX NEWS SUNDAY is known for."

Looking back over these past 25 years, this has been the job of a lifetime, getting to travel the world, interview top newsmakers and then share our stories with you. We've tried to play it straight down the middle, to be just as tough and probing with officials from all sides. We've tried to cut through the spin and talking points and do our best to get to the facts, get to the truth. That's what reporting is all about. And that's what we'll keep trying to do here. And that's it for today. Have a great week. And we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
