The story itself did not have good evidence. It had no evidence. It had anonymous sources with nothing to support it other than claims of a treasure trove of material that they hadn't even seen. It contradicted known facts. It also just told the story in a very biased way about business dealings with Russia. So there were many reason why people should not have taken it -- have not run the story.

It had tremendous power in terms repudiating the story. I will say this as someone who was a daily journalist much like you, that stories from anonymous sources and not seeing the document are not bad journalism. We think back to the most famous investigation in our town, Watergate, Woodward and Bernstein and Deep Throat. They didn't see any documents per se. They were relying on him and secondly relying on confirmation sources. If you have two sources preferably independent of each other or testifying to the same thing, almost every major news organization in America goes with that story. What's interesting to me is that in fact Buzzfeed says they contacted the special prosecutor's office to say we're running the story and the response was zero like --"

The e-mail said we're going with the story that Michael Cohen was directed by President Trump himself to lie to Congress. Nothing about that he had said this to Mueller's office. Nothing about Mueller's office supposedly have documents and testimony to support this. So that made it easier, I think, for the spokesman just to do the typical way we decline to comment.

That's what we're all all trying to do. And two, you have to be transparent with the reader about how you got the information you got. After this report came out, that's when we started to learn OK, they didn't see the documents, they are relying on sources, let's see the documents.

This is after the Mueller statement which if it doesn't knock the story, it certainly raises questions about the fundamental truth of it. She said the New York Times did corroborate this part of the BuzzFeed story, that Donald Trump Jr. was briefed on this ongoing deal and sounds like he lied to Congress. I have not been able to find -- I talk to people a lot of time -- any story that says that. That would be seen as corroboration for BuzzFeed after the point where we didn't know that the Trump Moscow Project was still being discussed. So people just went on there and said anything."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "There's also just a problem of people not being very well informed about the story. For instance, that Donald Trump Jr. did testify at length and extensively about Russian dealings. That's actually why we know a lot about them. That was one of the things that was contradicted -- that contradicts the BuzzFeed story. But this idea that this is just BuzzFeed when in fact there have been dozens upon dozens of stories that are false, that had to be pulled back, had to be corrected. Just last week, New York Times botched a major Russia story. It happens with alarming frequency. In fact, the entire narrative is the problem, that the media have just poured themselves into for two years. They throw caution to the wind. Rarely if ever does anyone get held accountable. We had a couple of resignations on just one of CNN's many false stories on the Russia probe. They have sometimes not even explained their errors. They have gotten stories just flat-out wrong, never held anyone accountable, never explained, never retracted. The American people are absolutely sick of the narrative that has been pushed without evidence. At the same time, there is a lot of evidence supporting the idea that the FBI and Department of Justice behaved improperly by putting spies against the Trump administration, by wiretapping people, putting spies against Trump campaign affiliates, wiretapping them. These things that are based on hard facts, actual testimony, actual evidence get downplayed or ignored by many people in the media. Both of those things are major problems."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, here is my take, and that is, you know, it may -- I know that Michael Cohen, his lawyer, has said in court filings that Trump directed him to do everything, so maybe more to learn here. But you cannot, even in this anti-Trump environment, go with the story that says the president of the United States suborned perjury without having it absolutely nailed down. The media want to DEFCON 1 (ph) over these blizzard of segments and stories saying, you know, we must move to impeachment, this is terrible. Very little skepticism despite the fact that it was unnamed sources and even as no other news organization could confirm this. Usually it is a big scoop if somebody else manages to get a confirming source. So this is not just, I think, humiliating for BuzzFeed but it really is a kind of black eye for every organization. Not that it shouldn't have been covered, but that just blanketed it with lots of punditry and denunciation without knowing essential truth of it. Sara, let me come back to you. We played the clip earlier about Rudy Giuliani with CNN's Chris Cuomo. He said, no, I never said there as no collusion in the campaign with the Russians, just behalf of President Trump. Then he put out a clarification saying his words have been misinterpreted. Any time you put out a clarification, it is not a good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "It is never good. Look, I think what we are seeing with Rudy Giuliani is that he's trying to be the president's attack dog. But sometimes it's hard to be the attack dog when the details are just so fluffy. And so he's getting himself into situation where he is becoming the story. That's exactly the thing you want to avoid when you're the spokesperson for the president."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

And Cohen came out with a tweet and said, you know, yes, I did it at the direction of the president. I truly regret my blind loyalty to the president.

There are some polls out there that are less than good because they rely on, you know, phone calls as opposed to -- robocalls as opposed to direct phone calls.

      "utterance": "OK, all right, so yesterday, the president gave a televised speech. He offers this deal. He wants to launch the $5.7 billion for the wall but he will extend by three years not deporting any of the dreamers who are here under DACA and some other things. The Washington Post headlines, Trump speech gets thumbs down from the Democrats. MSNBC declared it as dead on arrival as soon as he was off the screen. Now, it is true that Democrats came out and rejected it. But did you see anything or anyone in the press giving the president credit for at least attempting a compromise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I don't think I have seen anyone in the press give President Trump credit for anything in a few years. But it is just also one of these things when people talk about the political dynamic or the power plays involved. What is more important is we have a shutdown and at some point, people need to get to the table. I don't see a lot of pressure being applied -- you know, the president makes offers, they are rejected on arrival. Well, who is going to actually get the government open?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We'll talk about the shutdown on the next segment. Juan, maybe it was a bad compromise the president offered, maybe it was just trying to put pressure on the Democrats by going publicly rather doing it behind the scenes. But the stories all say Trump or White House aides say he was -- it was cast as a compromise. It's a fact. He offered something he hadn't offered before. Why can't the press just say that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I think they should say that high. I think that we also have to keep in mind, the president has the bully pulpit. He spoke to the American people. And so it was clear that he was doing this. I think, to your point, he was doing this as a point of political leverage. He knew that they weren't accepting it. And so for the press to say oh, this is going to be a breakthrough or this could be the end the shutdown, I think that would have been bad reporting."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

We are going to talk about -- in the next segment, we are going to talk about the actual effects of the shutdown which are starting to get more media attention. Also ahead, later on, The Atlantic's new cover has a one more headline, impeach. Are liberals now just openly demanding the president's ouster?"

      "utterance": "Yeah. One of the big consequences of this is that working for the government has always had a really good reputation of being reliable, of having a sustainable paycheck, getting great benefits throughout your life. I mean, you hear people struggling like this. One of the biggest reactions from them is I worked so willy (ph) to the government because I thought that this would be stable. I never dreamed I would go weeks without a paycheck. That damages the P.R. quite frankly for working for the government that has been great for decades."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think, Juan, in the beginning, there wasn't that much of this because there was the sense that the shutdown won't be over a week, so it's like a pay vacation and so forth. Now that we -- who knows when this thing will end? People missing more paychecks. So, are journalists -- is it smart for journalists to now put more of the focus on the people who -- no fault of their own and caught in the middle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you have to do it. That is good reporting. My worry is that this becomes partisan because it could be viewed as bad coverage, adds pressure specifically on the president because he said he would take responsibility for the shutdown, pressure on him and not pressure on the Democrats."

You want to make sure you are covering the plight. There are some low-income workers. You also want to make sure you're telling the accurate story that the average federal employee makes something like $130,000 a year in salary and compensation. That far exceeds the average employee in the United States. You want to make sure you are telling the full story. But there are people who are at the lower end of that who are going to be facing some --"

It could be as much as a half percent off of growth per month. Now, we are at the one-month mark. All right, Sara Fischer and Juan Williams, thanks very much for coming to our temporary studio here. Mollie, we will see you in a few minutes. Ahead on \"Media Buzz,\" even as the president's nominee for attorney general strongly backs Robert Mueller, liberal pundits slammed him anyway.
