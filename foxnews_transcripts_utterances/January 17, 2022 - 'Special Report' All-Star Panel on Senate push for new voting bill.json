And it's interesting that when it came to mandates, the Biden administration was pro-mandate as far as executive order, and obviously the Supreme Court has prevented them for the business side moving forward. But now there is a big uproar about Glenn Youngkin's executive orders about mask mandates. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": And their position seems to be that blue governors are issue mandates or blue presidents, but not red presidents, and that doesn't seem to be how it works in the real world. Glenn Youngkin won this state, the state that Biden won by 10 points, by promising parents that they could have a say in their children's education, whether that's in the curriculum or in whether they decide to mask their children. And this is an issue that clearly worked very well for him in winning that election, and also will probably be a big issue going forward.

The thing is this whole issue, whether he is softer on the rhetoric or not, has been an extreme gaslighting of America. Nobody thinks that we have a voting rights problem like we had in 1964 in this country. Nobody thinks that in an election where you had tens of millions of people voting with no problem, that you have a voting rights problem. We do have an issue where election integrity is in question, where we had hundreds of changes to our laws and processes, sometimes done in an unconstitutional manner, where we flooded the zone with tens of millions of mail-in ballots, where we had insecure drop boxes. And so this idea that if you care about election integrity or you want to make it slightly more difficult to cheat that you are therefore engaging in voter suppression is a lie, and it's really dangerous lie that should not be said because, of course, if both winners and losers can't trust election results, and that changes depending on the election who is frustrated by this, then you can't have a republic going forward. And so this rhetoric, while softer, is still dangerous if we want to have a country going forward.",

Joe Biden eulogized a man who ran for president as a segregationist. He was friends with other segregationists when he was in the U.S. Senate. So what these people are wondering is if people can change, can states change? Like my own in South Carolina where we have one of only three black U.S. Senators. And by the way, two of the three are from states that they want to monitor under the Voting Rights Act. Georgia and South Carolina, two of the three. So we have had an Indian descent governor, our chief justice is an African American, and we have the highest ranking African American in the House, Jim Clyburn, who will stay in office as long as he lives and maybe even beyond that. So I will just be damned if South Carolina needs limousine liberals telling us that our state has not changed. And when that's the message then, yes, your party is in trouble.",

So what you're seeing is that people who were supportive are saying hey, where are the results right now? And we wanted results on x, y, z, be it the climate, be it voting rights.

We had seen the entire country reorient our focus away from the Middle East and more toward China. And then now here we are a year later, and everything seems to have gone poorly. The manner in which we withdrew from Afghanistan was a disaster, but Iran and Russia seem to be taking advantage of weakness.

He campaigned, saying he wanted to end the war in Afghanistan and he would do it. And he did it. So you can talk about the exit. And I think, sad to say, some people lost their lives.

Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis? Where do we stand? Whose side are we on? Will we stand against voter suppression, yes or no? Will we stand against elections subversion, yes or no?"

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yes, that original speech, a lot of people in the media loved it, but it went over like a led balloon on Capitol Hill, calling people racist for opposing his fairly radical voting changes legislation. The thing is this whole issue, whether he is softer on the rhetoric or not, has been an extreme gaslighting of America. Nobody thinks that we have a voting rights problem like we had in 1964 in this country. Nobody thinks that in an election where you had tens of millions of people voting with no problem, that you have a voting rights problem. We do have an issue where election integrity is in question, where we had hundreds of changes to our laws and processes, sometimes done in an unconstitutional manner, where we flooded the zone with tens of millions of mail-in ballots, where we had insecure drop boxes. And so this idea that if you care about election integrity or you want to make it slightly more difficult to cheat that you are therefore engaging in voter suppression is a lie, and it's really dangerous lie that should not be said because, of course, if both winners and losers can't trust election results, and that changes depending on the election who is frustrated by this, then you can't have a republic going forward. And so this rhetoric, while softer, is still dangerous if we want to have a country going forward."

      "utterance": "I think he needs to get that Kool-Aid off his upper lift. That sounds delusional. I will give you a perfect example. Joe Biden eulogized a man who ran for president as a segregationist. He was friends with other segregationists when he was in the U.S. Senate. So what these people are wondering is if people can change, can states change? Like my own in South Carolina where we have one of only three black U.S. Senators. And by the way, two of the three are from states that they want to monitor under the Voting Rights Act. Georgia and South Carolina, two of the three. So we have had an Indian descent governor, our chief justice is an African American, and we have the highest ranking African American in the House, Jim Clyburn, who will stay in office as long as he lives and maybe even beyond that. So I will just be damned if South Carolina needs limousine liberals telling us that our state has not changed. And when that's the message then, yes, your party is in trouble."

      "utterance": "Well, I like the bad followers. I thought it was funny, because if you talk to people in the Democratic Party right now in terms of their disappointment with Biden, it's what's driving down the poll numbers. It's what's driving down that chart that you put up earlier, Bret. It's not Republicans. Republicans never bought in. So what you're seeing is that people who were supportive are saying hey, where are the results right now? And we wanted results on x, y, z, be it the climate, be it voting rights. And they say we don't see it, so they are disappointed. Does that carry through to the midterms? Does it carry through to 2024? I don't know. Obviously, right now people are having basically a referendum on the first year of President Biden."

I have gone head-to-head with Putin and made it clear to him we are not going to take any of his stuff. It's not because the example of our power, but the power of our example. That's why the rest of the world has repaired to us. And it's got to be restored."

Now we have seen one year of foreign policy under the Biden administration. We're back with our panel for some analysis. Trey, you look at Afghanistan. That was really the biggest thing, I think, that caught people's attention. But around the world, if you bounce around the world, there aren't big foreign policy wins for this administration."

Yes, he has been around for a long time, but as Robert Gates said he has been wrong on almost every single major decision. You mentioned Afghanistan. Russia is emboldened, China is emboldened, North Korea is undeterred, but thank God he was tough on France. One of our oldest and most treasured allies, thank God he undercut them on the submarine deal. That's the only country we have been tough on, France."

      "utterance": "Yes, it really is also something to look back where we were a year ago. We had an administration that had reoriented our Middle East policy away from Iran and toward peaceful cooperation between Arab countries and Israel with these historic peace accords. We had seen the killing of Iran's top terrorist. We had seen NATO being encouraged to take a more active role in its security posture vis-a-vis Russia. We had seen the entire country reorient our focus away from the Middle East and more toward China. And then now here we are a year later, and everything seems to have gone poorly. The manner in which we withdrew from Afghanistan was a disaster, but Iran and Russia seem to be taking advantage of weakness. And President Biden has been touting his friendship with China but doesn't seem that we are doing what we need to do to really tackle what an economic and military powerhouse they are trying to become. And all in just in one year. It's just really amazing how far things have gone."

It's upside down, just like a number of over fronts, but 35 percent. \"The Wall Street Journal\" writes it this way, \"Biden administration's foreign policy initiatives hindered by domestic troubles. As the President Biden begins his second year in office, he is still grappling with many of the issues that consumed much of the first year trying to bring the pandemic under control, shore up the economy and foster unity in a deeply divided country,\" saying that that is also hindering his foreign policy, Juan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that's right. I think you have to look at us as the American people here. We were just talking about Afghanistan. I think it's pretty clear the American people wanted an end to the longest war in our history. And there were three presidents who didn't want to do it because there was such political risk in withdrawing forces. President Biden kept his word. He campaigned, saying he wanted to end the war in Afghanistan and he would do it. And he did it. So you can talk about the exit. And I think, sad to say, some people lost their lives. But you compare to exits by other countries from Afghanistan, there is no comparison. I think that the biggest issue here, if you want to somehow have a scorecard after one year, it's to simply say China and Russia loom as big problems on the horizon."

Mollie and others think it was right to get out of Afghanistan, but I'm kind of old school. You can do the right thing and still do it the right way. You don't have to leave your friends behind. You don't have to leave the military vulnerable, and you don't have to leave your equipment behind. And oh, by the way, you don't have to drone a carful of kids. So making the right decision is about half of it. Doing it the right way is the other half. So yes, we are not in war. I give him credit for that."
