She knows it. Joe Manchin knows it. The entire Democratic Party knows it. But it reminds me of when my 16-year-old daughter wants to go to Lululemon and buy some stuff. I'm like, how much does this stuff cost? And the Democrats are acting like my daughter. They want to pretend like it doesn't cost anything. And so, AOC and her squad cohorts are saying, let's not focus on the price tag. Let's not focus on how much this stuff cost. Like, yes, we absolutely are.

And I really hope that this steals Kyrsten Sinema's spine. I hope she takes this as some sort of inspiration to not bend to the loud mob because she shouldn't. She should be looking at the bottom line. She should be looking at the price tag and her constituents and what they and the American people can afford and they can't afford $3.5 trillion. She knows it. Joe Manchin knows it. The entire Democratic Party knows it. But it reminds me of when my 16-year-old daughter wants to go to Lululemon and buy some stuff. I'm like, how much does this stuff cost? And the Democrats are acting like my daughter. They want to pretend like it doesn't cost anything. And so, AOC and her squad cohorts are saying, let's not focus on the price tag. Let's not focus on how much this stuff cost. Like, yes, we absolutely are.

You got to kind of deal with it. Like Joe Manchin, that he's got a skill, humor. He got on the back of his bone. He's like, I'm with you guys. I'm just not with you on everything. Two, we have to remember, Biden beat Sanders in the primary. Democrats rejected Sanders. Now you may not Biden's plan but he beat Sanders and Sanders ran on, essentially the $6 trillion plan. Now, the -- I think the majority of the Democratic Party is with Biden and is with even Pelosi on this, and I should say, does not want to go down the path of perhaps AOC and Sanders want. Third thing is, I am -- the money side of this, I know we're going to talk about it later. Jen Psaki, I don't think what -- and we disagree on this.

He's out there really helping -- AOC is out there. Jayapal is out there. Where are the moderates? They are basically like, wow, it just got kicked in the face by the president.

Government does not create things that create revenue. They reach into your bank account and now they want to do with the IRS. Every expenditure you have over $600 the IRS wants banks to tell them what you're spending money on, every single purchase over $600. That is a taking. They are taking money.

There was an enormous amount of attendance technology that came from it. One of the reasons I think you have the private sector partnering with the public sector to send people to space is because there are going to be so many things that we learn, so many ways that our phones will work better. So many ways telecommunications, and for that matter all communications services will do better.
