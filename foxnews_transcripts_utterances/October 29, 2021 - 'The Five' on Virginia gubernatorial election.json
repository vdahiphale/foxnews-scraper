And I hope I'm wrong, but I do think they're going to get something passed within the next five days so they give Joe a win overseas so he can beat his chest to the world and they got to get something done under the wire before that election on Tuesday, too. So, the media is now going to write this story. This is the comeback kid. And that's just going to be an inside the beltway story though because for the rest of the American people, this two-headed monster of a bill is not going to affect them in a positive way especially in the short term. It does nothing for the border or inflation. It does nothing for the supply chain and does not create jobs. If anything, the Democrats are going to own inflation when they're spending trillions on top of what we already have right now. They already own the border crisis and they're slipping in this bill, I did read some of it, Greg. Amnesty for 10 million illegal immigrants. They are going to own high gas prices because they slipped in a little green new deal here. And they're going to own the weak recovery because they're going to raise taxes higher than it's ever been done before. In a couple years you may have government-run day care in a couple once they get that off the ground, but in the near term private day care is going to skyrocket because they're going to have to compete with this new program. And then what, maybe in one year they're going to have a few electric car charging stations, great. Only two percent of us own an electric vehicle so that's not really that great. Some of the spending is good. You know, you want Wi-Fi and nice railroads and less traffic, but a lot of this is just doubling down on the boondoggle of bankrupt programs like Medicaid and Medicare which aren't really doing that well right now. So, this country's going to sit around what, for the next couple days and watch a bunch of untalented politicians bad at arithmetic try to raise taxes so they can square the numbers to see if they can pay for stuff that no one wants or needs. That's basically what we're watching right now.",

And so even if they pass it and get it shoved down their throats, they're going to look at it next year maybe in 2024 and say we watched what you did, we didn't want it and you voted for it anyway depending on how these votes go down. Now, someone's going to have to blink here. It's either going to have to be Senator Sinema and Senator Manchin or these socialists, I will not call them progressive, socialists in the House who are holding this up because a deal was made this summer on infrastructure between Republicans and Democrats at the White House. The president promised they would not go together to be voted on. They're changing that now. It was interesting to watch Nancy Pelosi come out today kind of exacerbated saying I'm releasing the text so you can complain about it which is pretty funny. So, we'll see what they can do but Joe Biden's on the verge of being a lame duck president. He doesn't have much time to get anything done. And at this point, he can't get infrastructure done and he can't get the reconciliation package done and therefore he has nothing to show the first year in his presidency, which does not give him a lot of strength in negotiating power moving forward.",

I'm wondering if his brother, Chris Cuomo, who helped develop these statements, who actually was editing and approving statements going after these women on official government time for New York. He would write something or approve something that then showed up on the New York governor's website published as a press relief -- release, what he has to say about this now that it's reached criminal charges. So whether this will go through, you know, he's supposed to appear in court next week, whether he'll plead guilty or not is still a question, but we certainly moved from just allegations and reports from the attorney general of these types of things taking place into the arena of prosecutors obviously believe that they have enough to prove this or they wouldn't take it to a court of law.",

And I hope I'm wrong, but I do think they're going to get something passed within the next five days so they give Joe a win overseas so he can beat his chest to the world and they got to get something done under the wire before that election on Tuesday, too. So, the media is now going to write this story. This is the comeback kid. And that's just going to be an inside the beltway story though because for the rest of the American people, this two-headed monster of a bill is not going to affect them in a positive way especially in the short term. It does nothing for the border or inflation. It does nothing for the supply chain and does not create jobs. If anything, the Democrats are going to own inflation when they're spending trillions on top of what we already have right now. They already own the border crisis and they're slipping in this bill, I did read some of it, Greg. Amnesty for 10 million illegal immigrants. They are going to own high gas prices because they slipped in a little green new deal here. And they're going to own the weak recovery because they're going to raise taxes higher than it's ever been done before. In a couple years you may have government-run day care in a couple once they get that off the ground, but in the near term private day care is going to skyrocket because they're going to have to compete with this new program. And then what, maybe in one year they're going to have a few electric car charging stations, great. Only two percent of us own an electric vehicle so that's not really that great. Some of the spending is good. You know, you want Wi-Fi and nice railroads and less traffic, but a lot of this is just doubling down on the boondoggle of bankrupt programs like Medicaid and Medicare which aren't really doing that well right now. So, this country's going to sit around what, for the next couple days and watch a bunch of untalented politicians bad at arithmetic try to raise taxes so they can square the numbers to see if they can pay for stuff that no one wants or needs. That's basically what we're watching right now."

So they know that they're kind of throwing everything at the wall so they can say they've got to win, but big things that people expected and wanted in like Democrats have run for years on lowering prescription drug prices, it looks like now that's not going to be a part of the bill. A lot of things that people said we got to have it or we're not going to do it, that's in there.

And so even if they pass it and get it shoved down their throats, they're going to look at it next year maybe in 2024 and say we watched what you did, we didn't want it and you voted for it anyway depending on how these votes go down. Now, someone's going to have to blink here. It's either going to have to be Senator Sinema and Senator Manchin or these socialists, I will not call them progressive, socialists in the House who are holding this up because a deal was made this summer on infrastructure between Republicans and Democrats at the White House. The president promised they would not go together to be voted on. They're changing that now. It was interesting to watch Nancy Pelosi come out today kind of exacerbated saying I'm releasing the text so you can complain about it which is pretty funny. So, we'll see what they can do but Joe Biden's on the verge of being a lame duck president. He doesn't have much time to get anything done. And at this point, he can't get infrastructure done and he can't get the reconciliation package done and therefore he has nothing to show the first year in his presidency, which does not give him a lot of strength in negotiating power moving forward."

I'm wondering if his brother, Chris Cuomo, who helped develop these statements, who actually was editing and approving statements going after these women on official government time for New York. He would write something or approve something that then showed up on the New York governor's website published as a press relief -- release, what he has to say about this now that it's reached criminal charges. So whether this will go through, you know, he's supposed to appear in court next week, whether he'll plead guilty or not is still a question, but we certainly moved from just allegations and reports from the attorney general of these types of things taking place into the arena of prosecutors obviously believe that they have enough to prove this or they wouldn't take it to a court of law."

But there are a lot of people who are saying, listen, if he's facing criminal charges maybe they do that just to assure he cannot run again. So I think there are all kinds of calculations here, but what an amazing turnaround from a year ago. You think about that he -- it was rumored he was going to be the attorney general nominee for that. He could run for president. He got a huge book advance for the book \"American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.\" By the way, I just looked it up on Amazon, its 196,306th ranked.

Fairfax County paid Ibram X. Kendi who is a racist himself $20,000 to give a speech for an hour to school administrators and to teachers last summer. They backed that up when it came to light in public documents that they had paid that much money, saying it was essential to how they learned to teach children. It's not just the issue of critical race theory either. It's about pornographic books being in these libraries for young children. Parents reading them out loud and embarrassing school boards over it and they (inaudible). What do you think the parents are doing? They're -- Terry McAuliffe also keeps smearing parents by saying this is a racist dog whistle to bring up critical race theory. There are parents in Loudoun County, in Fairfax County from all different backgrounds including a woman who grew up in Mao's China who have come up to these meetings to say we don't want this in our schools. It is not just white parents who are living in suburbia going to these school board meetings. And finally I would say it is not a good look for the Loudoun County school board to be calling the sheriff's department and acting like these people are domestic terrorists asking for all these insane security measures simply to keep them out from speaking to them when they are taxpayer- funded.

They have all kinds of contracts for all kinds of wackos and institutions, one of whom got $2.4 million and that happened to be the son- in-law of Merrick Garland. And it's not just that. I've read all the texts in the language in that commonwealth of Virginia. It's talking about white students need to apologize and acknowledge their white privilege.

I used to think there's nothing more racist than a low bar, but the Dems introduced no bar. And that's what we're seeing right now. That's why there were so few prosecutions after all of these riots. Look, to them, the left, everything is racist except actual racism. You can blanket all whites as oppressive, and that's not racism, that's considered education. But if you call it out, McAuliffe calls you a racist. But I think -- well, I think it was your point, Jesse. I can't remember. I think it's over. Generally, it's over. They have killed the accusation of racism once and for all. You keep calling people racist, it doesn't mean anything anymore. They beat it to death. And people are not afraid -- people used to be afraid of being called racist because it is. It's like being called a pedophile. But they did it so much, it's like, you know what, I'm going to challenge you, I am not a racist. And that's what parents are doing. I think -- I think the left is in trouble.
