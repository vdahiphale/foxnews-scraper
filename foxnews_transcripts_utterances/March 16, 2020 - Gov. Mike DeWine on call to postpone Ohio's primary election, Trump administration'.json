And so that was something that we wanted to enable people to be able to do both. And so, we have asked the court to set the date of June 2nd. Everyone who has already voted. They've already voted. That's fine. They hold on to their votes. They're not counted. What we proposed to the court is that people will have the opportunity to - between now and June 2nd to do absentee ballots.

But also, if the drugs have a prophylactic effect, they can also be used to potentially stem the spread of the epidemic itself.

In a study we conducted in Southern China, it looked like around six or seven times more likely to get infected, if you were a household member of somebody who was infected, then if you were a different - another kind of close contact. So, you could envision if we had a drug that was widely available, didn't have many side effects of giving that to the family members of people who were infected to stop - help stop the spread.

We cannot conduct an election in Ohio with 50 or 10. Their thing is that we were hearing from a lot of people, we're hearing from people over the age of 65, people who - women who are pregnant, people who had compromised health and they were telling us look, this is a tough choice. Are we supposed to - you know on the one hand we're being told to stay home and take care of ourselves? And yet we want to exercise our constitutional rights. And so that was something that we wanted to enable people to be able to do both. And so, we have asked the court to set the date of June 2nd. Everyone who has already voted. They've already voted. That's fine. They hold on to their votes. They're not counted. What we proposed to the court is that people will have the opportunity to - between now and June 2nd to do absentee ballots. They give - they have the opportunity to do that for a long period of time. And then on June 2nd, if people - anybody who has not actually voted before then by absentee they'll have the opportunity to go to the polls. So, we think it makes sense. It preserves people's constitutional rights. We think it's consistent with the federal guidelines. It certainly is consistent you know when the President's talking about 10 people be in a room, that's consistent with that."

On the other hand, we're saying hey, it's OK, you need to go vote. And so, those conflicting signals, we need to speak in Ohio as one voice and I think look, the President's right. Every state has to look at where they are, what their situation is. I know other states are holding elections and that's fine. They judge what the facts are. You know governors, we had about an hour and a half conference with the President today on the phone and it was great. The President listens. The Vice President listened. We had the opportunity to say things and they conveyed a lot of information to us, so I thought it was a very, very helpful thing."

I mean I think a lot of people, especially older people are going to feel a lot more comfortable if they can fill out an absentee ballot at this point. It's a primary and obviously all those delegates have to be in, I think by June 20th. So, you need to get that process done. But I think that seems like an option that a lot of people are going to feel more comfortable with. This is the President today on another topic with regard to ventilators, because one of the biggest concerns obviously is whether or not we have enough equipment because we've seen what has happened in Italy and it's frightening to see people making choices over who can and who can't get a ventilator.

We asked for a waiver for example when we canceled school, when we basically said, school has to be remote, we didn't cancel it, but we said it has to be remote. But we had a question about how about those kids who rely on that for lunch and some for breakfast. And the White House within 24 hours gave us a waiver, so we could take that food out and schools can make their own decision. How they distribute it, some are doing it by literally taking it to houses. We got other schools that are putting in different locations where kids can come and get it. So, look, they've been very cooperative. Vice President has been super as well. So, it's a good relationship and so we appreciate that. Look, what we're trying to do and the decision we made today, we've made other days. And there's been tough, tough decisions, but we're trying to be to the point where we do not run out of the equipment and we don't run out of respirators. We don't want to be like Italy. So, we've got to spread this out, flatten that curve. We don't want to go straight up like that. What we're seeing on TV and what you all are reporting is just tragic and we're trying to avoid that.

And we said look, worry about yourself, worry about your family, but also worry about a stranger. Let's say, you go out, then you have dinner with your girlfriend, your girlfriend goes home.

We see a lot of recovery in the folks who are diagnosed with this and that is just really important I think to continue to point out here. Meanwhile, despite the unease that we are all experiencing as this thing spreads, there are some promising signs on the horizon when it comes to managing this pandemic. So far 15 states across the country have opened drive-through testing sites. This allows people to get tested without exposing themselves to a doctor's office or to anybody else who might have it. There's also an experimental vaccine that was given to the very first volunteer today, a brave woman in Washington State. So, here's the President talking about that earlier today. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "LESSLER",
      "utterance": "I mean well, one, kudos to her. The vaccine is certainly the thing that could change the game the most in this. We need to get up to a certain level of immunity in the population, to be protected from the virus over the long-term. All of these blunt measures now like lockdowns and shutdowns and school closures are very important for flattening the curve and keeping our number of cases under the capacity of the ICUs and the hospitals in general. But only through building up immunity do we truly beat this virus over the long-term and vaccines are the key to that. There's two ways to get immune, get infected or get vaccinated. And I think most of us would prefer to get vaccinated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "LESSLER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean it's a bold move. I think I understand why they're doing it. It is hopefully, ends up being the right move and gets us the vaccine sooner. But you know it carries with it a lot of risk. And I hope they're proceeding cautiously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. We all hope so. And again, we thank the people who have volunteered to be part of that trial. I think it's an amazing action on their part as everybody is sort of looking for something that they can do to be helpful here. The other thing that caught my eye is the use of potential malarial drugs, malaria drugs and also HIV drugs that has been discussed in some places in China and also in Australia where they're testing these and they claim in Australia that they have had some success with chloroquine which is an old anti-malarial drug I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. And then also an HIV suppression drug. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESSLER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean it's interesting that chloroquine is coming back. You know it was once the front-line treatment for malaria as you say and I think the drugs, if they work, have two advantages. The obvious one is people who are really sick, we can treat them, and we can hopefully speed their recovery, keep them out of the ICUs and keep them from dying most importantly. But also, if the drugs have a prophylactic effect, they can also be used to potentially stem the spread of the epidemic itself. You know when we did a lot of pandemic planning for influenza back in the mid-2000s, one of the things people focused on a lot was how you could use drugs prophylactically to stop spread. For instance, we know that for this virus and most viruses' households are a real epicenter of spread. In a study we conducted in Southern China, it looked like around six or seven times more likely to get infected, if you were a household member of somebody who was infected, then if you were a different - another kind of close contact. So, you could envision if we had a drug that was widely available, didn't have many side effects of giving that to the family members of people who were infected to stop - help stop the spread. So, it can both be a treatment but also be a tool to control the viral epidemic."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESSLER",
      "utterance": "I mean if they're proven to work, we should. I think it's too early to tell. You know most of the evidence I've seen thus far has been anecdotal. I know there are several more formal trials happening and I think it's really important to have the results of those because we all - well it's important to use something that works as quickly as possible, it's also important not to fool ourselves. We're having an effect that when we don't and use resources that could go to something that could have a real impact on something that is effectively snake oil. So, those early trials of the drug are incredibly important. And I really look forward to seeing the results of them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESSLER",

We see these kids going into bars which obviously has to stop, and I think they're basically shutting down across the country. But outside of that part of the population, I think people have been remarkably up for this you know remarkably understanding that OK we're all staying home. We're not getting together. This is what we're doing. I find the transition to be good so far. Do you think that it will work?"

We never let things get as bad here as they got there, or I hope we haven't in which case maybe we've avoided having to be in lockdown for that long or be doing major social distancing for that long.

China accounting for more than 3000 deaths out of 81,000 reported cases in that nation in a population of 1.4 billion. Now Italy has more than 2100 deaths now in a nation of 62 million. France, a lower rate with nearly 150 deaths with 67 million residents. Spain at more than 300 deaths out of some 50 million people. Now France's 15-day lockdown period, one of several imposed in Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron saying it's unprecedented in peace time. Other nations imposing these including Germany, Ireland and the Czech Republic. These new measures aimed at curtailing movement and social gatherings. Spain had already enacted measures. Now we should note the number of people recovering from the virus also increasing now above 78,000 so far mostly in China.

They haven't yet passed that bill so that the Senate can take out the corrected version. Sometimes, when you move too fast, you make mistakes. The House made mistakes on Friday, they acknowledged them over the weekend, they have yet to pass the bill that the Senate will take up. Better to get the bill done right out of the House. What would happen if the Senate had been there on Saturday and voted on it? It would have taken them until Sunday to vote given the rules, they would have then had to go back and pass the bill a second time because the House screwed up.

And here in New York, we were having a primary and we canceled it that day because of the great uncertainty over what was going on in the country. They were held two weeks later and they are overwhelming turnout. I think postponing elections is bad for the republic.

Yes, almost 3,000 points. President Trump acknowledged that this new norm could last into August and that the United States could be headed towards a recession due to this virus. Meanwhile, small businesses are having a very difficult time. Restaurants, bars, fitness facilities, retail stores in cities all across the country are going to be shut down for a period of time.

So, restaurants may be able to weather this a little better than -- but like a fitness place, you know, a gym or someplace that was doing fitness training where you really can't, there's no way to do that other than human contact. So, what's happening to American businesses right now, small businesses, it's really a tragedy. The government stepped up. President Trump stepped up with $50 billion in SBA loans, but SBA loans aren't easy to get historically. I'm hoping they'll eliminate a lot of the hassles of SBA loans. There's also things that individuals can do. Look, we shouldn't depend on government for all of this. I've got an article coming out in the next couple of days. It's been suggestion that we have a small business Saturday where we go out and we buy gift certificates online for the local businesses we want to support. The job creators' network is collecting suggestions from small businesses as to how they can be helpful the jobcreators.com.

The government needs to go all it can to bring this recession, potential recession to an end to bring this crisis to an end. But I think people now are generally just scared of the virus. Until we get some optimistic news either that the number of cases is going down, the number of new cases, that people are recovering, that we've got therapeutics that work, maybe that we've got a vaccine, until we get that kind of optimistic news I don't know that the financial engineer (Ph) is going to help as much as it would have, you know, two or three, four months ago --"

Fifteen minutes from now you will not be able to sit down in a any bar or restaurant in the city and order a drink or anything to eat. As you said, you can get takeout and you can get delivery but you cannot sit down in a restaurant in Manhattan and there are thousands of them, and order food or a drink. It is a remarkable set of circumstances here in Manhattan and it also will affect beyond, movie theaters, gyms, casinos, other so-called non-essential businesses will close.
