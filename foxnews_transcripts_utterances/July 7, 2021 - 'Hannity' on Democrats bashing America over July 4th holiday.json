And welcome to HANNITY. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, I hope all of you had a wonderful July 4th weekend, and we're one of the millions that actually celebrated Independence Day. Hopefully, had a cookout, a lot of fireworks, even a few drinks, maybe Tito's, wine, beer whatever your drink of choices. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Unfortunately, on the left, at the mob, the media -- well, they use the holiday as yet another excuse, the latest excuse to trash this country and the men and women who dedicated their lives to creating a more perfect union. We're going to show you the worst of the worst straight ahead. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, my message to the star athlete that was left off the U.S. Olympic team. I have a message for her, and others tonight. But, first, we begin with a very serious question. This isn't a joke. Who is in charge at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Look at this Trafalgar. That's Robert Cahaly and Convention of States poll, one of the most accurate posters in the country. A if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A majority of the American people believe that it is definitely not Joseph Biden. A whopping 57 percent think that Joe is not fully executing the duties of the office of president. In other words, Joe's not making the decisions. He's not in charge. I know at times on this program, I have joked about this, but honestly, starting tonight, this stops. That stops. Joke -- this is not a joking matter. America has a president that is now obviously, cognitively compromised and not only the country sees it, our enemies see it. And this cannot be good for anyone. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to this poll, look at these numbers, 58 percent of independents, they see it. Even 32 percent of Democrats understand Joe's not really the one in charge. That's right, a third of voters, Joe's own party, believe Joe's not capable of executing his duties in the office of president. And, of course, they see what we all see, and that is somebody that is weak and frail and a cognitive mess and a shell of his former self. And it only appears to be getting worse. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The main question now, okay, if he's not in charge and the polls show that most people don't think, he is who is in charge. Who knew about Joe's condition and what did they know and when did they know it? Over the weekend more struggles as Biden pulled out two note cards in an unsuccessful attempt to answer a pretty simple basic fundamental question. This is like a softball. You just knock it right out of the park. Not Joe he's got to refer to the cards. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Also vowing at any country that stands in China's way will, quote, have their heads bashed bloody against the great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people. Now, keep in mind, China is now also -- media is ignoring this -- they have teamed up with Russia and they're now supplying the mullahs in Iran with dangerous weapons that they're using in their proxy wars all over the Middle East. Now, European leaders, they're voicing grave concerns over Iran's nuclear program as the country will now soon again begin to produce enriched uranium and a massive violation of Obama's previous and precious nuclear deal.

Just like no one on fake news CNN, three broadcast channels. MSDNC, \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\", they won't dare ask questions about the mental capabilities or lack thereof of their dear leader.

Never in the history of mankind has there been a place like the United States that has accumulated more power and abused it less than this country. And I often add my words and there's no country that has done more to advance the human condition than this country. We get three vaccines. We're sharing hundreds of millions of doses for free, with the rest of the world. World War II, Nazism, fascism, Imperial Japan, communism, radical Islamic terrorism, America leads.

These rights are enshrined in our Constitution. That is the foundation of our rule of law. America, by far, no doubt, the greatest country in my view that God has ever given man. The evidence is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible. Are we a perfect country? No, we're not, but we're always striving to become a more perfect union, and we are and have and will continue to right wrongs and correct injustices. Well, people on the left, the media mob, they don't see it that way. We saw it over the weekend. (INAUDIBLE) elected Congresswoman Cori Bush stating: When they say that the fourth of July is about American freedom, remember this, the freedom they're referring to is for white people. Meanwhile, during a rambling, unhinged series of tweets, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, voicing a similar complaint claiming that only white men have rights. According to \"The New York Times\", the American flag is now apparently a partisan symbol. Quote: Today, flying the flag from the back of a pickup truck or over a lawn is increasingly seen as a clue albeit imperfect one to a person's political affiliation in a deeply divided nation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Not to be outdone, you helped pay for NPR -- well, they used the Fourth of July to trash our own Declaration of Independence, calling it, quote, a document with flaws and deeply ingrained hypocrisies. Keep in mind, you pay for it. This is the kind of self-hatred. This -- it's just sick. On the Fourth of July, we should be celebrating, our country, our people, our history. Not the imperfections but all of America's greatness to always get better. A vast majority of Americans are good people. They're decent human beings. They deplore racism. They deplore fascism. They fought against these evils. But for the United States, Nazism, fascism, communism, imperial Japan, what would the world look like if we didn't lead the war against radical Islamic terrorism? How do we reconcile ever with those that think America is fundamentally evil how do we as a country you know how do you negotiate and reconcile with those that want to fund the police versus defund and dismantle the police, teach critical race theory in school, abolish capitalism and individualism? You know, what do we say to those that think patriotism is a partisan act. Here with the full -- well, investigative report, FOX News contributor Sara Carter, our investigative reporter -- Sara.",

I know at times on this program, I have joked about this, but honestly, starting tonight, this stops. That stops. Joke -- this is not a joking matter. America has a president that is now obviously, cognitively compromised and not only the country sees it, our enemies see it. And this cannot be good for anyone. According to this poll, look at these numbers, 58 percent of independents, they see it. Even 32 percent of Democrats understand Joe's not really the one in charge. That's right, a third of voters, Joe's own party, believe Joe's not capable of executing his duties in the office of president. And, of course, they see what we all see, and that is somebody that is weak and frail and a cognitive mess and a shell of his former self. And it only appears to be getting worse. The main question now, okay, if he's not in charge and the polls show that most people don't think, he is who is in charge. Who knew about Joe's condition and what did they know and when did they know it? Over the weekend more struggles as Biden pulled out two note cards in an unsuccessful attempt to answer a pretty simple basic fundamental question. This is like a softball. You just knock it right out of the park. Not Joe he's got to refer to the cards. Take a look."

Every hostile actor, every hostile regime in the world, they're studying him every day, and they're also becoming more emboldened every day. Look at this report, Chinese state media, they're now publicly boasting about a three-part plan to invade Taiwan. In case you don't know, America's top ally in the region. In a long belligerent speech, China's -- well, hostile actor, dictator, Xi, actually said that he is committed to the hostile takeover of Taiwan. Also vowing at any country that stands in China's way will, quote, have their heads bashed bloody against the great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people. Now, keep in mind, China is now also -- media is ignoring this -- they have teamed up with Russia and they're now supplying the mullahs in Iran with dangerous weapons that they're using in their proxy wars all over the Middle East. Now, European leaders, they're voicing grave concerns over Iran's nuclear program as the country will now soon again begin to produce enriched uranium and a massive violation of Obama's previous and precious nuclear deal. You know, billions of dollars, cargo planes of cash and other currency. No word on how Biden plans to respond to any of these situations just like it appears there appears to be a plan of action against the Kremlin. What's Joe going to do after yet another likely Russian-based cyber attack? Up to 1,500 businesses were targeted this time. The Republican National Committee allegedly breached. So another serious question tonight -- Joe, what are you going to do? Or maybe the question doesn't go to Joe, whoever is actually making decisions at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, what are you planning to do? Maybe you'll divulge who you are publicly. And, of course, no one in the media mob is going to hold Biden accountable, ever ask a tough question. Just like no one on fake news CNN, three broadcast channels. MSDNC, \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\", they won't dare ask questions about the mental capabilities or lack thereof of their dear leader. Just like they denied riots for riots, just like they protected candidate Joe Biden in his basement bunker, now president Joe. And, remember, these were the same idiots who were the biggest proponents of all they wanted to talk about was -- oh the 25th Amendment and whether or not Donald Trump will get a cognitive test all throughout the Trump presidency. In fact, it wasn't that long ago that the armchair psychologist on the left and in the media had no problem diagnosing the president of the United States and demanding his removal from office for a variety of issues.

And he's failing miserably. And it really is, at this point, we've got to figure out what's going on. I feel -- I feel bad, Sean, because the White House has been transformed from a symbol of power and authority into what looks like at this particular point an assisted living facility.

Our adversaries are taking advantage of us. We draw a line in the sand, they crossed the line. He draws another line, they crossed the line. That did not happen in the Trump administration. When President Trump, drew a line in the sand, our enemies, our adversaries knew -- they knew -- they knew exactly what would happen if they crossed that line, and we don't have that anymore.

We see what they're outlining and plans for Taiwan. We've seen the crackdown in Hong Kong. We see that they've partnered with the Russians to arm the Iranians so they can fight their proxy wars in the Middle East. That's a dangerous trifecta in my mind.

And then you run that through a filter, which are the social media companies and it makes it easy to govern as long as you're doing it in the United States. So, you run a campaign, you hide in your basement, you don't answer any tough questions. The same thing happens here in the United States. He's been snapping at his own press people that they control, and that's even when they're giving him cards to try to tell him how to answer certain questions. But here's the problem, Putin knows exactly how this works. He's a former KGB guy. He runs his press in his country. The same with -- the same thing with President Xi, he does the same thing with the Chinese Communist Party propaganda that's all throughout the globe. So when he sits down with these people, they laugh at him because they know his cognitive decline. They're probably some of the only people that get to sit one-on-one with him like Putin got to for an hour or two. You know, very few members of Congress have even sat down with him for any length of time. So I guess the way I would explain it is, is that when you get out to the real world, where people will kill others, they will take over companies.

We're sharing hundreds of millions of doses for free, with the rest of the world. World War II, Nazism, fascism, Imperial Japan, communism, radical Islamic terrorism, America leads. We can and should always as a country strive to create a more perfect union, right wrongs, correct injustices. That was the beauty of our Framers and Founders. We believe in natural rights, God-given rights. Not government-given rights or not rights from -- you know, God, the thing, you know, the thing, God the creator of everything. These rights are enshrined in our Constitution. That is the foundation of our rule of law. America, by far, no doubt, the greatest country in my view that God has ever given man.

They hacked more companies in America, and what has Biden done? We watched China take on Hong Kong when they said they would not. We watched three million people in Hong Kong carry an American flag because they understood that America is more than a country, America is an idea. They understand what that flag stood for -- the freedom of speech. We watched it more than 32 years ago, a million college students in China go to Tiananmen Square and chant up to their tanks because they understood what America meant. But we watched them get crushed. And if that continues that you don't have the strength out of this White House, you will watch China take a move on Taiwan."

Where the protests for all these lives? Do you know the names of any of the people that were shot? This is our American treasure, our fellow Americans. Without real accountability, law and order, safety and security, there's no pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, the situation on the ground is only going to get worse because -- get this -- we're also learning tonight that the second teenage girl, remember this case that pled guilty in connection with the brutal death of that UberEATS driver in D.C. back in March? Yeah, sentenced to juvenile detention. That means she'll get out at the age of 21, the latest. Here with reaction, the host of \"Unfiltered\" right here on FOX Saturday night, Dan Bongino is with us. Dan, well, it was a weekend of carnage.

No, no, this weekend. No that's this weekend. And then they lie about it. So not all these liberal mayors and the liberal governors that run the states in many places like New York, not only have they decimated America's great cities and descended this country into crime chaos, then they lie to your face about it. I'm glad you're scrolling these names again, because yeah, when do they get some recognition. Does anybody know? Again, Juanita Holliman, everybody ignores that story, right? But what happens here? Then they lie about it. You had Mayor Lightfoot from Chicago say in a press conference, oh, crime is trending down. That's totally ridiculous. There's a record number of shootings and killings this weekend. Then they lie and they blame it on the guns, Sean. But they make conservative arguments while lying. They say things like, oh, people are going to states with less restrictive gun laws, buying their guns, and then coming here. Yeah, you're making our point, not yours. So you're telling me where you have these really restrictive gun laws where people can't get guns to defend themselves, criminals would rather go and buy guns out of state and then commit crimes where the gun laws are really restrictive? Because no one else can protect themselves, and yet liberals still think they're making an argument for gun control there. It's the most dishonest --"

The problem here is that she made, Sean, the mistake of apologizing and those who run ESPN, which is now the worldwide leader in woke -- no longer sports, but in woke, saw it as a sign of weakness instead of simply forgiving her for these comments that again were caught on a hot mike and I don't think they were all that offensive in the first place in terms of what she was saying. So, now, they had to make an example of Rachel Nichols who has not sniff -- I've covered this, no controversy ever in her career. And, look, hopefully, her career at ESPN will continue instead of another pointless cancellation. We see how this works now. She's not on the NBA finals. Before you know it, she won't be covering much at ESPN for what? Because she was caught on tape saying that she was very much lamenting the fact that one woman was pitted against another and maybe it came down to race in terms of that decision. I think it's just unfair to her and now what's going to happen to Rachel Nichols?
