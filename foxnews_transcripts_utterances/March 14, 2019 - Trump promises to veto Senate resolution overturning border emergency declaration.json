      "sentences": "Well, before this vote on this resolution about the national emergency along the border, the president tweeted out \"A vote for today's resolution by Republican senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, crime, and the open border Democrats.\" Well, there were 12 senators on the GOP side who voted on the Trump emergency declaration, to block it. There you see them there. Two of them caught people's eyes. Thom Tillis voted for this resolution. He said he was going to vote against it. And Ben Sasse. Both are up for reelection. After the vote that was 59-41, the president tweeted out \"Veto,\" and then he said he looks \"forward to vetoing the just past Democrat inspired resolution which would open borders, increase crime, drugs, and trafficking in our country. I thank all the strong Republicans who voted to support border security and our desperately needed wall.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With that, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" This is an exercise, it seems, in that they are not going to have the votes to override a veto, at least not yet. Just doing the head counts. But it sends a message to the court, I guess. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": The White House feels very confident that they are going to win this, that the president's veto will not be overturned. But beyond that you can really look at this in a couple of ways. As a matter of principle, we have had 12 Republican senators reject the president's position, saying he's overreaching his executive authority. That's, I think, the biggest rejection, Republican rejection we have seen of the president so far in this presidency. So that is a big deal even if the veto can't be overturned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as a practical matter, as far as the border barrier is concerned, it can go ahead. The president proposed to take money from three sources what Congress had already appropriated for the wall, a Treasury forfeiture fund and a military fund, all of which do not require an emergency declaration. So he can go ahead and use that. There was a fourth source of money that even if the Congress forbade him to use it, he could still go ahead with the other three. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

When I said Thom Tillis and Ben Sasse, these are people who spoke out against the national emergency declaration but voted against this resolution today. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Thom Tillis didn't just speak out against it. He wrote an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" that said it would be intellectually dishonest not to vote against the president's declaration because he had opposed similar actions by President Obama when he was in the White House as an overreach of presidential authority. And, yet, he flipped on this. It's interesting, 12 Republican senators voted against the president on this. But of the 10 Republican senators who are up for reelection next year, nine of them voted for the president. The only Republican senator up for reelection next year who defied the president on this was Susan Collins of Maine. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\": Right, it's a double abdication because not only has Congress not done anything about the crisis on the border, it also delegated the authority with the National Emergencies Act 40 years ago to the president to create these sorts of -- or declare these sorts of emergencies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think there are two issues. The first issue is, 'at is happening on the border? Is it an emergency? I think so. We have had a change in the nature of immigration from single males looking for jobs to family units showing up on the border en masse and asking for asylum, and the system is broken. \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" both say so. There is a second issue, which is a constitutional issue, which is, does the president have the authority to repurpose this money that Congress has not specifically appropriated for the wall? And there, I think, reasonable people can disagree. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What I don't understand are the Democrats who deny the existence of a crisis on the border, and at the same time, hope that the courts uphold Trump's effort to declare an emergency because they want to use the powers themselves for climate change or gun control.

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER",
      "utterance": "The president is operating within existing law, and the crisis on our border is all too real."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRET BAIER, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, before this vote on this resolution about the national emergency along the border, the president tweeted out \"A vote for today's resolution by Republican senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, crime, and the open border Democrats.\" Well, there were 12 senators on the GOP side who voted on the Trump emergency declaration, to block it. There you see them there. Two of them caught people's eyes. Thom Tillis voted for this resolution. He said he was going to vote against it. And Ben Sasse. Both are up for reelection. After the vote that was 59-41, the president tweeted out \"Veto,\" and then he said he looks \"forward to vetoing the just past Democrat inspired resolution which would open borders, increase crime, drugs, and trafficking in our country. I thank all the strong Republicans who voted to support border security and our desperately needed wall.\" With that, let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" This is an exercise, it seems, in that they are not going to have the votes to override a veto, at least not yet. Just doing the head counts. But it sends a message to the court, I guess. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": The White House feels very confident that they are going to win this, that the president's veto will not be overturned. But beyond that you can really look at this in a couple of ways. As a matter of principle, we have had 12 Republican senators reject the president's position, saying he's overreaching his executive authority. That's, I think, the biggest rejection, Republican rejection we have seen of the president so far in this presidency. So that is a big deal even if the veto can't be overturned. But as a practical matter, as far as the border barrier is concerned, it can go ahead. The president proposed to take money from three sources what Congress had already appropriated for the wall, a Treasury forfeiture fund and a military fund, all of which do not require an emergency declaration. So he can go ahead and use that. There was a fourth source of money that even if the Congress forbade him to use it, he could still go ahead with the other three."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So just so we're clear, the resolution blocks the national emergency declaration. When I said Thom Tillis and Ben Sasse, these are people who spoke out against the national emergency declaration but voted against this resolution today. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Thom Tillis didn't just speak out against it. He wrote an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" that said it would be intellectually dishonest not to vote against the president's declaration because he had opposed similar actions by President Obama when he was in the White House as an overreach of presidential authority. And, yet, he flipped on this. It's interesting, 12 Republican senators voted against the president on this. But of the 10 Republican senators who are up for reelection next year, nine of them voted for the president. The only Republican senator up for reelection next year who defied the president on this was Susan Collins of Maine."

      "speaker": "KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "I really fear for our democracy when the body who creates the laws is telling the body who enforces the law, just don't enforce the law. If they don't like the law, they should change it. But the men and women at the Department of Homeland Security have sworn an oath to protect communities, to secure homeland, and to enforce the law that Congress passed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So it seems like we are going to have this battle back and forth about policy. MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\": Right, it's a double abdication because not only has Congress not done anything about the crisis on the border, it also delegated the authority with the National Emergencies Act 40 years ago to the president to create these sorts of -- or declare these sorts of emergencies. I think there are two issues. The first issue is, 'at is happening on the border? Is it an emergency? I think so. We have had a change in the nature of immigration from single males looking for jobs to family units showing up on the border en masse and asking for asylum, and the system is broken. \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" both say so. There is a second issue, which is a constitutional issue, which is, does the president have the authority to repurpose this money that Congress has not specifically appropriated for the wall? And there, I think, reasonable people can disagree. What I don't understand are the Democrats who deny the existence of a crisis on the border, and at the same time, hope that the courts uphold Trump's effort to declare an emergency because they want to use the powers themselves for climate change or gun control. That is being intellectually dishonest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And some of the same Democrats who talked about a barrier or a wall like Chuck Schumer back in 2006. I want to turn briefly to this other as we're waiting for the Mueller report to come forward, whenever that is, as Washington is on pins and needles here. The House votes 420-0 to force this report out into the public to be released. It is currently be blocked by Senator Lindsey Graham. We are not sure exactly why. What about this and whether it's going to come out?"

      "utterance": "One way or another."

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Of course, after everything that has happened, is Mueller going to be able to write a report and give it to the Justice Department and they say we're sorry, you can't see this? That will simply not fly. So it will come out. And as a matter of fact, I think there will be a push for not only whatever his report is but for his actual underlying information is as well, like testimony."

      "utterance": "I will not be a candidate for president in 2020. That's I think as definitive as I think those sentences get. I'm running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America. This is going to be a positive campaign."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "The president weighing in on Beto O'Rourke, who is now a presidential candidate. I will say President Trump has a few hand movements of his own, but he is right that O'Rourke is really animated with his hands, also animated in talking to \"Vanity Fair\" with a quote, \"I want to be in it. Man, I'm just born to be in it,\" about the presidential race. And Jennifer Granholm, former Michigan governor, said \"Hmmm. Not sure this Vanity Fair piece will help Beto's campaign. Beto O'Rourke's as he comes to grips with the presidential run \"I'm just born to do this.\" We are back with the panel. It seems like Beto-mania has set. Susan, what about this?"

And the bad news for him is he has excited all this attention and he is going to get a lot of scrutiny he has never gotten before. And that's going to be scrutiny not only about his charisma, because we know he has charisma. It's going to be about does he have policy answers that we expect of presidential candidates, and that's something we're going to find out as this campaign --"

So yes, let's find a way to do this."

      "utterance": "Really weak on policy. As a matter of fact, had a \"Washington Post\" article that he cooperated with and now regrets where he basically couldn't tell them anything about anything, any policy. But I am in the take-Beto-seriously mood right now. This man almost became the Democratic senator from Texas, performed very well, won 59 percent of voters who were 44 years and younger, 69 percent of nonwhite voters, raised $80 million around the country. It was almost like a quasi-national race. So I do think we make mistakes if we don't take people seriously. A lot of commentators made that mistake about Donald Trump in 2015 and even into 2016. So he has proven -- he has a proven ability to excite Democratic voters. And this was not a very flashy rollout, but he has already proved his ability to do this."
