This effort here by this young man whom I don't know, I don't know why he did it, what would make him do it but it certainly it besmirches and makes -- it cast doubt even more so on some people who may not be inclined to believe that hate crimes actually take place. So, this made at, you know, at some level I think at his core he probably wants to try to advance the quality and then help the country move forward on race and gender issues and sexual orientation issues, but he shoved us back here.

We are talking about, we're not talking about like, you know, saying that if this act is true, it's bad. It's that the pressure to silence any dissent or skepticism as the crime unfolds. So, everybody is terrified, like when you see -- when you hear about this crime, it's so absurd, so on the nose, so comical that you burst out laughing about all the -- all the elements. It's like a perverse Christmas tree of twisted ornaments. None of it makes any sense. But if you said that during that week you could be called a racist. And like Dagen was saying. You know, this was a volatile climate at the time of the hoax. So, what he was basically saying was that he happy to cause injury, perhaps property damage, riots, whatever because in order to do this story. He had to have known that this could have some serious consequences for a lot of communities. And you've got to remember like what the, you know, in the three weeks that this happened, I mean, the three weeks from the start which I think was January 29th to February 27th, 18 people were killed in Chicago including a one-year-old and you have to wonder how many cops could have been dealing with that in saving lives instead of devoting all this time chasing down these imaginary attackers because they were supposed to. I don't care about Smollett. I care about the media. They are just as guilty because they primed, they primed their peers, their friends in the media and activists to believe that this was actually possible. That like, yes, there are these MAGA -- MAGA -- Trump supporters yelling MAGA country at one a.m. No one would believe that unless they were psychologically primed. And we spend five to six years being primed generally from CNN who has been creating this atmosphere that was anti- police, that the country was systemically racist. So, you need two things to create this gullibility. Primed them, and you want the story to be true. That's what, that's what happened here.

Obviously, he's a hard-core left D.A. who's let out a lot of people who have ended up hurting other people and he's also like a lot of people in the media walled off from crime.

You'll never know the difference because it's not in your neighborhood. And so that's what you are seeing, is you're seeing a lot of people disengage from real life, either behind the gated communities sucking on the teeth of CNN believing that there is no crime or if there is crime it's done by white supremacists. And then you have the media who cannot acknowledge a crime wave because they were embracing the policies like no cash bail and emptying jails which help causes. So, the media can't cover it, the politicians can't admit to it because they are guilty. And so, all you have left is this mere state of denial. It just -- and then it shows you how absurd it is when somebody can burn down a tree and he's back on the street outside -- out in front of the building because the city, New York City, again, $1 billion sent to De Blasio's wife to deal with the mentally ill.

They care about police misconduct. They care about January 6th. Those are the types of things they are focused on and then I went to the FBI web site, I figure out, what's the priority of the FBI and the Joe Biden administration? You know what's on the front page of the FBI web site has right now? Encouraging the public to report hate crimes, seeking information about violence at the capitol. Pay attention to holiday scams, pay attention to vaccine scams. And then they have a podcast. The FBI has a podcast. Podcast on this episode of inside the FBI we uncover the truth about some other noteworthy cases involving UFOs. Why are you doing a podcast on UFOs when there's a murder record right now? Thirty-year murder record smashed, 12 cities smashing homicide records, smash and grab everywhere and they are focused on January 6th. They are focused on hate crime hoaxes. Their holiday scams. It's because they don't care about things that they can't take advantage of politically.

I think even on one of our other shows earlier in the day I think there is some dispute between the mayor and the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement here in New York City. I hope the mayor prevails because we need not only more police on the streets but mental health initiatives here in New York. I can't answer for the DOJ and the FBI on all those things but what I do know is that the numbers are up. The things you don't want up in crime are up and the things that you want down are not down.

This effort here by this young man whom I don't know, I don't know why he did it, what would make him do it but it certainly it besmirches and makes -- it cast doubt even more so on some people who may not be inclined to believe that hate crimes actually take place. So, this made at, you know, at some level I think at his core he probably wants to try to advance the quality and then help the country move forward on race and gender issues and sexual orientation issues, but he shoved us back here. Anyone who doesn't say this was wrong and the jury spoke and he'll face the consequences is not doing right by those in this country who want to ensure that people of color, people who have a different sexual orientation are protected."

We are talking about, we're not talking about like, you know, saying that if this act is true, it's bad. It's that the pressure to silence any dissent or skepticism as the crime unfolds. So, everybody is terrified, like when you see -- when you hear about this crime, it's so absurd, so on the nose, so comical that you burst out laughing about all the -- all the elements. It's like a perverse Christmas tree of twisted ornaments. None of it makes any sense. But if you said that during that week you could be called a racist. And like Dagen was saying. You know, this was a volatile climate at the time of the hoax. So, what he was basically saying was that he happy to cause injury, perhaps property damage, riots, whatever because in order to do this story. He had to have known that this could have some serious consequences for a lot of communities. And you've got to remember like what the, you know, in the three weeks that this happened, I mean, the three weeks from the start which I think was January 29th to February 27th, 18 people were killed in Chicago including a one-year-old and you have to wonder how many cops could have been dealing with that in saving lives instead of devoting all this time chasing down these imaginary attackers because they were supposed to. I don't care about Smollett. I care about the media. They are just as guilty because they primed, they primed their peers, their friends in the media and activists to believe that this was actually possible. That like, yes, there are these MAGA -- MAGA -- Trump supporters yelling MAGA country at one a.m. No one would believe that unless they were psychologically primed. And we spend five to six years being primed generally from CNN who has been creating this atmosphere that was anti- police, that the country was systemically racist. So, you need two things to create this gullibility. Primed them, and you want the story to be true. That's what, that's what happened here. And there's -- and you have to -- one last point, it's only one way. The traffic towards these folks --"

The only, I think the reason why is dismissing crime is that he's culpable. Obviously, he's a hard-core left D.A. who's let out a lot of people who have ended up hurting other people and he's also like a lot of people in the media walled off from crime. It's kind, I was thinking about this. You know that if there was this -- if we were in a relatively safe period and a relatively dangerous period you might never know the difference. You'll never know the difference because it's not in your neighborhood. And so that's what you are seeing, is you're seeing a lot of people disengage from real life, either behind the gated communities sucking on the teeth of CNN believing that there is no crime or if there is crime it's done by white supremacists. And then you have the media who cannot acknowledge a crime wave because they were embracing the policies like no cash bail and emptying jails which help causes. So, the media can't cover it, the politicians can't admit to it because they are guilty. And so, all you have left is this mere state of denial. It just -- and then it shows you how absurd it is when somebody can burn down a tree and he's back on the street outside -- out in front of the building because the city, New York City, again, $1 billion sent to De Blasio's wife to deal with the mentally ill.

They want to federalize elections, health care, guns, obviously the border but for some reason they don't want federal involvement with the sheriff's, with the crime thing. And then I got to thinking because I think so much, I got to thinking, what crimes do the Democrats really care about? And it seems to me they only care about the crimes that get big headlines and that they can exploit for power. They care about hate crimes. They care about COVID crimes. They care about police misconduct. They care about January 6th. Those are the types of things they are focused on and then I went to the FBI web site, I figure out, what's the priority of the FBI and the Joe Biden administration? You know what's on the front page of the FBI web site has right now? Encouraging the public to report hate crimes, seeking information about violence at the capitol. Pay attention to holiday scams, pay attention to vaccine scams. And then they have a podcast. The FBI has a podcast. Podcast on this episode of inside the FBI we uncover the truth about some other noteworthy cases involving UFOs. Why are you doing a podcast on UFOs when there's a murder record right now? Thirty-year murder record smashed, 12 cities smashing homicide records, smash and grab everywhere and they are focused on January 6th. They are focused on hate crime hoaxes. Their holiday scams. It's because they don't care about things that they can't take advantage of politically. They don't care about black-on-black crime, if an illegal alien killed someone, they don't care about that, that's not a priority to them. Their priority is political crimes, that's it."

I think the model for Democrats and Republicans when we think about what's happening in our cities, because I think that's where the key concern is what we have done here in New York. We elected a mayor who will take office in a little less than a month who is battling publicly with some forces that want to see him not re-empower the police to do things, not see them deploy street units to go out and help communities all across the city. I think even on one of our other shows earlier in the day I think there is some dispute between the mayor and the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement here in New York City. I hope the mayor prevails because we need not only more police on the streets but mental health initiatives here in New York. I can't answer for the DOJ and the FBI on all those things but what I do know is that the numbers are up. The things you don't want up in crime are up and the things that you want down are not down. That's where the focus should be. Mental health and putting more police on the street, reforming bail reform and standing up to those, be they Democrat or Republican that want to stand in your way.
