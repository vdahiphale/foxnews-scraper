It's 5 o'clock in our nation's capital, and this is \"The Five.\" It's four hours away from the big annual show on Capitol Hill, the State of the Union address live at 9 p.m. Eastern. The bells are ringing. It's amazing. Greg Gutfeld is singing. It will be President Trump first, though he did addressed a joint session of congress last February soon after his inauguration. We're expecting to get excerpts soon. We'll bring those to you when they come in. The White House says the tone of the speech will be bright and optimistic. The president will speak bipartisanship on a number of issues, jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. It's been a contentious year between Republicans and Democrats. Will there be more compromise ahead, more unity and less divisiveness? Let's go to the one who is so optimistic, bright and sunny.

So, you know, all of these may be noble causes, but I really don't think the Democrats are connecting with mainstream Americans.

It's 5 o'clock in our nation's capital, and this is \"The Five.\" It's four hours away from the big annual show on Capitol Hill, the State of the Union address live at 9 p.m. Eastern. The bells are ringing. It's amazing. Greg Gutfeld is singing. It will be President Trump first, though he did addressed a joint session of congress last February soon after his inauguration. We're expecting to get excerpts soon. We'll bring those to you when they come in. The White House says the tone of the speech will be bright and optimistic. The president will speak bipartisanship on a number of issues, jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. It's been a contentious year between Republicans and Democrats. Will there be more compromise ahead, more unity and less divisiveness? Let's go to the one who is so optimistic, bright and sunny. Greg, what do you say?"

It would be much better if he got out there and he said, you know what, you don't need this. I tweet every day. You don't need the State of the Union. All you've got to do is follow me on twitter. I tell you everything that's on my mind. This is the first and last State of the Union I'm ever going to do. Take your family out to dinner on those bonuses. I'm going home.

At one point the camera will go to a very old senator and that senator will be dozing off and those of the best moments. Also interesting to see who people bring, it turns outs the Democrats are bringing illegal aliens. A lot of people are saying they should bring ICE agents to just round them up right there. Other people are bringing transgender military members. And I'm hearing the congressional black caucus might do a black power fist and walk out. So, you know, all of these may be noble causes, but I really don't think the Democrats are connecting with mainstream Americans. The president is going to be on teleprompter, and a lot of people who support President Trump love teleprompter Trump. They used to make fun of Barack Obama when he was on the teleprompter, but we love President Trump when he's on the teleprompter because he fixed the script. It's going to be a lot of recounting all of the winning, which could take a very long time, Juan, especially with all the applause. And then he's going to be looking forward to the next year and try to bring unity and find some items like infrastructure, immigration and trade that the Democrats might be able to get on board with."

And I think from what we hear, Gary Cohn, who did so well for the president in Davos is really in charge of this speech along with Stephen Miller. Now, Stephen miller is kind of a fire and brimstone guy, and I think they're going to try to bring a little bit of that. You look at the guest list and you're going to have people there whose children were killed by MS-13. I think they're going to go back hard on the immigration side of it, and that's going to come from Miller. But I think from Cohn, you'll hear a lot of talk about the benefits of economics and the tax cut and the hope that -- while he talked about America first, he's not saying -- I'm just repeating a line that he said at Davos. It's not America alone. And so, in that sense, it really does speak to something I hope he does, which is reach out to the American people and say that there is a possibility. But my fear is that's not Donald Trump. And so, I just -- you know, I can dream about it."

He has a lot of material to work with in terms of the accomplishments, with the economy, infrastructure, tax reform, immigration, all of the above. So I think there's a lot of checkpoints that he can make in terms of saying, hey, this is what I promised the American people, the working class men and women across this country that felt forgotten. I'm honoring my promises that I made during the campaign, fulfilling them during my presidency. And the whole theme of a safe and strong America is one that resonates. There can't be anybody who's against a safe and strong, prosperous country. And that's what he's going to hit tonight."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

So, if jobs are back and the American people feel like the economy is better and they have confidence and you can deal with other things. So, he's expected to talk tonight about infrastructure and opiate addiction in addition to immigration."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I don't want him to talk about anything. I have to reiterate this that I don't want to hear what he can make government do more of. You should just do a little punch list. Here's the jobs numbers. Here's the economy. Here's how many ISIS fighters we've killed. OK. That's what happened this year. I'm going to try and do some other things this year. Another little punch list, like three little things, and then just be done with it. This is for the rest of America, not for the left of America. He shouldn't care about impressing people that want more government. He should just do it. You know what he is. The reason why he's so different and the reason why everybody has problems with him is that he's running a country like it's a business. He's like a boss and you can't shake it. So, he should just treat it like a meeting -- like he comes in and goes OK, so we did this. We did this. We did this. That's all right. We've got to do this. And if we don't do this, you're in trouble. I'm firing this guy. That's how he talks. He should just do that because the way it used to go before, let's face it, didn't matter who's doing the State of the Union, it was pompous and choreographed and we pretended to be interested. Let's just let it go."

The Democrats on the other hand have I think six different responses to the State of the Union, so they're totally fractured. And who knows what they're going to say. Bernie is doing his thing. I believe Kamala Harris is doing her thing. Who knows what the Democratic Party stands for anymore. So, I think Trump will receive a big bump after tonight."

One of the interesting things about Trump's poor poll numbers is that if you ask the American people about the economy, they say the economy is good, economic confidence, consumer confidence up. But they don't necessarily connect that to Donald Trump. They give lots of credit -- I think more credit to Barack Obama."

I think, by the way, in response to Greg's terrible attitude about our wonderful State of the Union address, you get - - you're going to have some reality TV.

The State of the Union is supposed to be just a letter, really, or just a notification that everything is fine. Don't worry about stuff. But it has grown so much. But the visualization of who you bring, it's almost become more important than the actual words of the speech.

And also, maybe, some of the points that you want to make that you need to improve upon. So, OK, I have the support from this community or that community. But I do think that President Trump, besides having a visual presentation of who shows up for him, it's also really going to be strong in terms of the rhetoric and mirroring some of the themes that he laid out in Davos as well, because he does have quite a bit to work with. And for President Trump, I don't think he's going to miss the opportunity to capture the moment for the American people because there's a lot more that he wants to accomplish, and this is the way and the vehicle by which that he can really garner that support moving forward for some of the legislative policies and things that he like to accomplish."

The People's State of the Union may not be about people at all but division and emotional actors who celebrity provides cover for their unpopular radical beliefs.

The phrase, quote, \"First he came for Comey,\" end quote, for example, was reworked from an anti-Nazi pastor whose poem criticized Germans for not speaking against Adolf Hitler.
