Finally, the special counsel got Flynn to admit that he made, quote, \"materially false statements and omissions on federal disclosure forms about his work as a lobbyist on behalf of Turkish interests.\" And those admissions paradoxically could work against the special prosecutors if they seek to place Flynn on the witness stand against more senior figures like the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Because as Ty Cobb's statement shows any defense counsel will seek to impugn Flynn's credibility on the grounds that he has already admitted lying in the past to federal agents on federal forms.

And with that in mind, the lawyer for the president has already begun painting Flynn as unreliable witness noting that he only served 24 days as White House national security advisor and describing him as, quote, \"An Obama administration official.\" The false statements involved said Presidential Attorney Ty Cobb in a statement \"Mirror the false statements to White House officials, which resulted in Flynn's resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn.\" And Cobb added, \"The conclusion of this phase of the special council's work demonstrates again that the special counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion. Flynn now admits he falsely told FBI agents in January that in his phone calls with the Russian ambassador the month before during the transition period he never asked Sergey Kislyak to refrain from escalation in a diplomatic skirmish with the U.S. at that time. Flynn also falsely claim not to remember subsequent call in which Kislyak (inaudible) that the Russian federation had indeed refrained from escalation as Flynn has requested. Flynn also admitted having falsely told agents he never asked the Russian ambassador on a separate occasion to vote against a pending U.N. Security Council resolution that was targeting Israeli settlements. And Flynn falsely told the agents that he never received from Kislyak any indication of Russia's response to that request. Finally, the special counsel got Flynn to admit that he made, quote, \"materially false statements and omissions on federal disclosure forms about his work as a lobbyist on behalf of Turkish interests.\" And those admissions paradoxically could work against the special prosecutors if they seek to place Flynn on the witness stand against more senior figures like the president. Because as Ty Cobb's statement shows any defense counsel will seek to impugn Flynn's credibility on the grounds that he has already admitted lying in the past to federal agents on federal forms. So how should jurors feel comfortable believing him when he is on the witness stand -- Laura."

You're hearing a lot about the Logan Act. As you know, the Logan Act has never been successfully used against anyone. And the last time anyone was even indicted under it was 1852. So, if Mueller is thinking of indicting anybody under the Logan Act, to me and I have been a defender of Mueller, I think he is an honorable guy.

This is very striking to me. The plea agreement says that Flynn is only protected from future prosecution based on items that are in the statement of offense. That's the key document. There is nothing in the statement of offense about collusion during the campaign. Nothing. So, unless there is a completely separately sealed, completely standalone plea agreement for Flynn that is sealed, which would be almost unheard of. I think Joe will agree with me.

But I think businesses need consumers. They need customers. So why penalize a business that just happens to be owned in whole or part by a white person, maybe that white person or Indian person or Asian person, maybe pulled himself or herself by the boot straps, came from nothing, and started a business in a minority community. Don't we want to encourage white and Asian and all sorts of people to come into black communities to bring more dollars and investment?

Then we have got James Comey sucking this up to headquarters and keeping the investigators in the Washington, D.C. office away from the Clinton investigation. And then he drafts the exoneration statement before even conducting the interview.

And so time and again, we see from the Obama era that they were determining the outcomes before actually conducting the investigation.

And if you just look at what Inspector General McCullough said in his interview recently with Catherine Herridge, she said, well, if anybody else would have done this, if you would have done this, where would you be? And he said Leavenworth. So a lot of FBI agents who were working at the time beating, you know, on the ground, collecting information, not the top dog, not Director Comey, not McCabe, they said that they felt that the rug had been pulled out from under them, that she was treated differently.

With Congressman Gaetz talking about something that's almost irrelevant now, going over the same information that's been gone over many times.

Comey wasn't even there during her questioning. If it's a really major investigation of a major American political figure, don't you think Comey would have been there, present. Why wasn't he present?

I miss them because I don't go on with them anymore on Tuesdays because I'm too tired. And my former boss Ronald Reagan, I got a little emotional under that one. And there is Raymond Arroyo and a lamb chop. There were several lamb chops, several lamb chops. I only got one there. But it was good spread. It was pretty fun. Some people said it was funereal at the White House Christmas party, but it was not. We had a blast. And finally, Sean Hannity challenged me to allow you to pick my Christmas card photo this year. He's on the cover of the \"New York Times\" Magazine this week. Check him out, very angry, Sean. He offered that cover and an old family photo. Now, check mine out. You can help me vote tonight on Facebook and Twitter. There's me on the left, 1995, and there's me on the right in 1960 something. Pick at Twitter and Facebook.
