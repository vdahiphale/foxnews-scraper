As we learn that Republicans reportedly do not have the votes that they need to block witnesses. Senator Lindsey Graham is here exclusively tonight in moments. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in Washington. And this is THE STORY tonight. President Trump about to take the stage in Wildwood, New Jersey for a rally. New Jersey is a state that he lost by 14 points to Hillary Clinton back in 2016. But that and the drama unfolding in the nation's capital has not stopped a very large crowd from flooding into the New Jersey shore town. Look at these aerial shots here. One group of women telling Fox that they waited outside for 36 hours. Others lined up since yesterday braving the cold and sleeping overnight to get inside. There is a video of all of that. This part of New Jersey is more conservative. It's further down the coast away from Manhattan. This area - to the area to the west is real farm country for those of you who think New Jersey is just one big highway. We will take you there live as soon as the President gets underway to hear what he has to say about the trial today. The President's team made their case in Washington calling for a rejection of the impeachment articles and taking on the Bolton leaks directly.

That's exactly what this is about. If we don't hold this President accountable, we will be telling this President and future president.

I however personally speaking, I have no problem with witnesses as long as you're going to bring in all the witnesses because what you will find at the end of it will be another hoax. And that's really what you have here. Once you find out, once Adam Schiff has to testify, once you have the whistleblower that has to come in and testify, what you're going to find out is, they fully coordinated. Remember, the ICIG number one that testimony is the only testimony that the Democrats haven't released. Number two, the ICIG still continues to respond to our investigation of him and his office. So, those people do need to be brought forward. You know maybe Lindsey Graham who is going to be on later, maybe he's right. Maybe it needs to be done outside of the impeachment process, but I'm not afraid of the facts here. I think the confusion here is that the Democrats are really trampling all over the constitution. It's almost like they think they're in a parliamentary system like we're in the United Kingdom where one party gets elected to the House and then they get to throw out the executive branch.

I want to call Joe Biden and say, why didn't you follow-up when you were told about your son's conflict of interest. I want to call the Chief of Staff of John Kerry who was told by a business partner of Hunter Biden, he's joining this board. I just want to let you know did you ever call Joe Biden and tell him your son is about to do something terrible, the most corrupt company in the Ukraine, your son is getting a million bucks a year. I want to call the whistleblower. I want to find out if Lieutenant Colonel Vindman actually talked to the whistleblower after he was on the phone call. There are so many things I want to find out. I want to find out did anybody on Schiff staff work with the whistleblower. Were there friends of the whistleblower. So, to my colleagues, if you think you're going to call one witness, you're crazy.

Somebody leaked this excerpt to the New York Times that hates Trump. Now, a lot of people in our government apparently hate the Trump, hate President Trump or somebody is trying to make money. Somebody is trying to increase book sales. The Wall Street Journal told to John Bolton, why don't you just tell us what you know and what's on your mind. So, John, you've kind of thrown the country into a ditch here. Just come forward and say what's on your mind. Hold a news conference and we'll consider what you've got to say if you think it's that important. But from my point of view, I've got all the evidence I need. The only reason we're in this box is because the House chose not to pursue John Bolton testimony because that means they couldn't impeach the President before the election or before Christmas. So, I just think this to me, needs to end. It needs to end now. But if it goes beyond this week, it's going to go for a long time. And Joe Biden and Hunter Biden are going to be asked questions. They were not allowed to be talked to in the House. They couldn't call Hunter Biden. They told us there's no there-there. Folks, there is a big there-there, when it comes to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.

I'm Martha MacCallum in Washington. And this is THE STORY tonight. President Trump about to take the stage in Wildwood, New Jersey for a rally. New Jersey is a state that he lost by 14 points to Hillary Clinton back in 2016. But that and the drama unfolding in the nation's capital has not stopped a very large crowd from flooding into the New Jersey shore town. Look at these aerial shots here. One group of women telling Fox that they waited outside for 36 hours. Others lined up since yesterday braving the cold and sleeping overnight to get inside. There is a video of all of that. This part of New Jersey is more conservative. It's further down the coast away from Manhattan. This area - to the area to the west is real farm country for those of you who think New Jersey is just one big highway. We will take you there live as soon as the President gets underway to hear what he has to say about the trial today.

So, look, our framers put articles of impeachment in the Constitution for exactly this reason. They spoke about it during the debate that a President would have such unique powers, to be so powerful that he might use the powers of his office to advance his own personal political or financial, it's not the public good. That's exactly what this is about. If we don't hold this President accountable, we will be telling this President and future president.

And I just don't think that the senators want to go through that. The American people don't need to go through that. I however personally speaking, I have no problem with witnesses as long as you're going to bring in all the witnesses because what you will find at the end of it will be another hoax. And that's really what you have here. Once you find out, once Adam Schiff has to testify, once you have the whistleblower that has to come in and testify, what you're going to find out is, they fully coordinated. Remember, the ICIG number one that testimony is the only testimony that the Democrats haven't released. Number two, the ICIG still continues to respond to our investigation of him and his office. So, those people do need to be brought forward. You know maybe Lindsey Graham who is going to be on later, maybe he's right. Maybe it needs to be done outside of the impeachment process, but I'm not afraid of the facts here. I think the confusion here is that the Democrats are really trampling all over the constitution. It's almost like they think they're in a parliamentary system like we're in the United Kingdom where one party gets elected to the House and then they get to throw out the executive branch. So, they've just never accepted this election. But I'm not afraid of the facts. The facts will show very clearly that there is nothing here."

The President had every reason to want to look at the Biden's. The House managers told us there is not a scintilla of evidence that the Biden's did anything wrong. This has been completely debunked, thoroughly investigated. That's a complete lie. The defense team destroyed the House's case. If after listening to Pam Bondi, you're OK with how Hunter Biden conducted himself in the Ukraine and you're OK with Joe Biden not having a clue what was going on. That's more about you than it is anything else. There is a mountain of evidence that the Biden's were involved in corruption.

They want to impeach the President before the election, not to remove him from office through impeachment, but try to hurt him politically. This is the weakest case you'll ever see in the history of the country in terms of impeachment. It was a partisan vote in the House and what's happened. The President will be acquitted.

Now, I want to prove to the country that there was ample reason to believe that Hunter Biden was corrupt and what he did in the Ukraine was against America's interests. I want to call Joe Biden and say, why didn't you follow-up when you were told about your son's conflict of interest. I want to call the Chief of Staff of John Kerry who was told by a business partner of Hunter Biden, he's joining this board. I just want to let you know did you ever call Joe Biden and tell him your son is about to do something terrible, the most corrupt company in the Ukraine, your son is getting a million bucks a year.

I want to find out did anybody on Schiff staff work with the whistleblower. Were there friends of the whistleblower. So, to my colleagues, if you think you're going to call one witness, you're crazy.

All this is about is trying to accuse a handful Republicans of being unfair and what are you accusing them of, they're unfair if they don't call a witness the House chose not to call, assume for a moment that John Bolton would say, listen the New York Times article, you can still acquit the President. Dershowitz says, you can assume all the facts most favorable to the government to the House managers and it falls well short of impeachment. This is not going to change the dynamic. This is just trying to make it tough on a handful Republicans and what I heard in that conference today, I heard Republicans who were in a tough spot politically say, I love this country. I'm not going to throw the country into chaos. I'm going to stand by the idea that I've been more than fair and I'm not going to let the House create a sham process and expect me to fix it in the Senate because we don't reward houses in the future to refuse to call witnesses come to the Senate and ask us to do their work and deal with privileges outside of court.

      "utterance": "I keep telling you, I'm increasingly optimistic that we're going to get this case done. Final verdict before the State of the Union which is next Tuesday. Because we've been more than fair into John Bolton. I've known you for 20 years. I recommended you to the President. We have a very shared world view. Somebody leaked this excerpt to the New York Times that hates Trump. Now, a lot of people in our government apparently hate the Trump, hate President Trump or somebody is trying to make money. Somebody is trying to increase book sales. The Wall Street Journal told to John Bolton, why don't you just tell us what you know and what's on your mind. So, John, you've kind of thrown the country into a ditch here. Just come forward and say what's on your mind. Hold a news conference and we'll consider what you've got to say if you think it's that important. But from my point of view, I've got all the evidence I need. The only reason we're in this box is because the House chose not to pursue John Bolton testimony because that means they couldn't impeach the President before the election or before Christmas. So, I just think this to me, needs to end. It needs to end now. But if it goes beyond this week, it's going to go for a long time. And Joe Biden and Hunter Biden are going to be asked questions. They were not allowed to be talked to in the House. They couldn't call Hunter Biden. They told us there's no there-there. Folks, there is a big there-there, when it comes to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. And to the whistleblower, we're going to find out who you are and who you talk to and what you did, because if we're going to find the truth as they call it, we're going to find the whole truth. But here's what we know. The record in the House is insufficient by any legal standard in the history of the country to impeach this President as a partisan political exercise that needs to die this week. And I hope they lose the majority in the House, the Democrats, so the next partisan group will remember, when the Democrats did this to President Trump, they got beat."

Take a look at that number. 30 percent to Biden's 21 percent. But that might not tell the story of the moderates in that state. Reluctant to support the self-proclaimed democratic socialist and torn on which candidate to back. The New York Times writes this, as Mr. Sanders tightens his grip on the party's young and Left-wing voters in Iowa, more traditional Democrats, the ones who happily sit through a marathon banquet dinners and hear the candidates and their representatives remain split between his four leading competitors or remain unsure altogether about whom to rally behind. And of course, that's the way it all works in Iowa. Joining me now is Brit Hume, Fox News Senior Political Analyst and host of proving grounds Iowa on Fox Nation. Brit, always good to see you. Thank you for being here tonight. You brought up this Iowa. We're going take a look at this RCP Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses poll over the last six months.

So, we now are in a situation where you have as you pointed out, you've got Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa, Bernie Sanders leading also in New Hampshire in the polling averages which as you point out does certainly strike fear into the hearts of at least a lot of mainstream Democrats who think that Bernie Sanders couldn't possibly be elected. So, there we are. And of course, in the race is on to see who would be the alternative to him assuming he does as well as he seems poised to do, now in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire and perhaps beyond. Then you've got a real race on. Does Joe Biden survive that? Does he remain the key alternative or does someone else emerge? Does possibly Mike Bloomberg emerge? He's up ahead now in national polling averages. He's now ahead of Pete Buttigieg. That's only an 8 percent. But considering it wasn't very long ago that he went anywhere near that. So, we still have a wide-open unpredictable race here."

But if you do have this much dissatisfaction with what's going on and you see some of these races split maybe Biden wins Iowa, maybe Biden wins New Hampshire. I'm sorry Sanders and then Biden wins in South Carolina. You may leave a lot of those voters, those moderate voters wondering if there is another alternative out there."

But Rudy Giuliani nor anyone else has ever had the kind of money that Mike Bloomberg brings to bear on this race. We are talking about money, orders of magnitude greater than anything we have ever seen. And it might all be for naught, but we don't know that. So, he really is a wild card in the deck. In addition, of course there is this Martha which has to worry Democrats and that is they don't - mainstream Democrats I don't think want Bernie Sanders to be their nominee, but they certainly want his voters. And if the way this is handled by them eventually he gets aced out is the way this is handled is such that they feel that their man was cheated as they felt last time and they don't come out to vote for whoever the nominee is. That's a big problem for Democrats. They need those voters in what is expected to be a close election. So, this is really kind of - this is pretty interesting at this point."

And I have to tell you, more people, almost 160 million are working right now in the United States. That's the highest level of employment in the history of our country. And a lot of countries aren't doing so well just so you understand. Tomorrow, we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history with the incredible brand-new U.S. Mexico Canada agreement, the USMCA, a massive win for New Jersey workers, New Jersey farmers, New Jersey union people, New Jersey manufacturers and everybody. And weeks ago, we also signed a fantastic new trade agreement with China that will boost New Jersey exports and defend New Jersey jobs. $250 billion coming in, now that's going to be so nice. And we're restoring America's industrial might like never before. They're all coming back. They want to be where the action is. After years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States military. And thanks to the incredible courage of our warriors, the greatest water is in the world, the ISIS caliphate has been totally destroyed and its savage founder and leader, Al Baghdadi is dead. Weeks ago, at my direction, the U.S. military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani. And Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and actively planning new attacks, but we stopped him cold. Yet Washington Democrats like crazy Bernie Sanders and nervous Nancy Pelosi. They opposed our action to save American lives. They oppose it. They opposed it. They opposed it. You know the roadside bombs that you see hurting our people and lots of other people so badly? The legs, the arms wiped out, no legs, no arms, Soleimani loved that. That was his weapon of choice.

Environmentally sound. To lift up the forgotten communities that need investment the most. These are the communities that really have suffered.

Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob our factories, steel our farms, ransack our communities. Not anymore.

During the 16 years of the two prior administrations.

Just quickly, Richard, what goes through your mind when you see Jeff Van Drew up there talking about keeping America great again, a former Democrat until a few weeks ago."

So, if it was that effective, I don't think we would've seen that outcome. And as you saw in the Fox News poll just yesterday, Biden is up 50 to 41 over him. So, it sounds great.

They wanted to tarnish him. They wanted to sink his numbers and they wanted to get bipartisan support for removing him. Instead in the House, you had three Democrats not vote with Democrats. And so, you had bipartisan opposition to the impeachment and now heading into the Senate or with the Senate, you're also not going to be -- you might see bipartisan opposition. And more than anything, you have President Trump's approval ratings the highest they've been in three years. So, when you look at it that way, this has not gone the way that Democrats certainly hope for."

I mean, at this point you look at all of it and you see these crowds, as the president points out enormous support, the fund-raising is enormous for the Trump campaign. Small donors, everything. It's pretty, you know, impressive from a campaign perspective, Richard. On the Senate side, as Mollie just suggested, you've got Doug Jones, Kyrsten Sinema, and Joe Manchin all signaling that they could potentially vote to acquit or dismiss or end this impeachment process."

      "speaker": "GOLDSTEIN",

And like Jones in Alabama and Sinema in Arizona, these are three senators who it's not clear that any other Democrat could win in those states. So, on one hand, they alienate the Democratic base big time which overwhelmingly thinks Donald Trump should be convicted. But Democrats have to keep in mind, OK, let's say that we turn on Kyrsten Sinema who -- what Democrat are we going to elect in Arizona instead of her? Although Mark Kelly is doing quite well right now against Martha McSally. So, I think that's a calculus they have to make."
