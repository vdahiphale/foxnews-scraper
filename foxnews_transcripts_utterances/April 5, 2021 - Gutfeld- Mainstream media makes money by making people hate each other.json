It's not about guns, but gun owners. It's not just about destroying statues. It's anyone who thinks math is real. It's not the issue, it's the easy targets, meaning you. Me, I like bashing creeps in power. Those stupid talking pinatas in politics, entertainment, and especially the news media, because they're all the same people or in Zuckerberg's case, things that look like people. And also because the only way they make money is by making people hate each other. It's not enough to say respectful disagreement makes less money. You have to say it's racist. That's why to them Twitter is a news source. It created cancel culture, a crowdsource version of a hit piece, a GoFundMe page for character assassination. The press used to write these eight pieces themselves. Now the encouraged steel cage matches so they can sell ads and ratings, repurposing tweets into clickbait because it's profitable. Cancel culture is to the media when an ATM in the lobby of a casino is to an addicted gambler.

Your stupid exhibition game is about as entertaining as a matchup corn hole on ESPN at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and screw Delta and screw Coke. In fact, screw all corporations, you stupid execs are cowards and bad golfers, you cheat on your taxes and you cheat on each other.

As for those late night shows were supposed to compete against -- why bother? Who do they offend? The only time Stephen Colbert ruffles feathers is in a pillow fight. The definition of risk to Kimmel is dehydration from crying too much. Fallon, that guy funs more than a herd of deer. And I heard Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah ran off to be obscure together. So let him be. They got the market cornered and calling Americans stupid. To them it was never about Trump, it's Trump voters. It's not about guns, but gun owners. It's not just about destroying statues. It's anyone who thinks math is real. It's not the issue, it's the easy targets, meaning you. Me, I like bashing creeps in power. Those stupid talking pinatas in politics, entertainment, and especially the news media, because they're all the same people or in Zuckerberg's case, things that look like people. And also because the only way they make money is by making people hate each other. It's not enough to say respectful disagreement makes less money. You have to say it's racist. That's why to them Twitter is a news source. It created cancel culture, a crowdsource version of a hit piece, a GoFundMe page for character assassination. The press used to write these eight pieces themselves. Now the encouraged steel cage matches so they can sell ads and ratings, repurposing tweets into clickbait because it's profitable. Cancel culture is to the media when an ATM in the lobby of a casino is to an addicted gambler. It's democratized media destruction, putting a joker mask on reality declaring everything is not debatable. But their power is an illusion. Their numbers are small. It's just that they're constant noise scares the hell out of corporations. Look what's happening to Delta. They're more scared of tweets than of birds flying into their engines. Which leads us to."

The MLB commissioner said that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's all-star game and the draft. Demonstrate our values as a sport. What's that mean in a sport where stealing basis is a virtue? The sport that was racially segregated for 70 years where they pretended no players were on steroids even as their ballooning heads gave the Goodyear a blimp a complex. At least their heads swelled from growth hormone not a sense of self- importance. Clearly these cowards got spooked by activists manipulating the media. Because how is voter I.D. immoral? Try picking up nail polish remover in West Virginia without one. Don't ask me how I know. And remember, the all-star voting process allows fans to vote five times over a 24-hour period. That's ballot stuffing or in Chicago Election Day. MLB lecturing us on values. It's like me lecturing you on height. Meanwhile, the President -- the President calls the bill Jim Crow on steroids. Yes, the so called great unifier now flinging racial discord like frisbees at a fish show. So, screw you, MLB. Your stupid exhibition game is about as entertaining as a matchup corn hole on ESPN at 3:00 a.m. in the morning and screw Delta and screw Coke. In fact, screw all corporations, you stupid execs are cowards and bad golfers, you cheat on your taxes and you cheat on each other. I hope Dems raise the corporate tax to 99 percent except on Fox which should be tax exempt. Maybe I'm turning socialists but after years of proclaiming corporations as engines of free markets, I realized their locomotives run by methods who do anything to save their own hides. Its profit over people, no matter how many inclusion coordinators they hire, they'll turn a blind eye to China's slave labor. Knowing that adding a diversity fund run to whatever history month currently celebrated will stoke the work in human resources. It's not a principled stand. It's their way of doing business. It's no different than a bodega putting up a BLM sign. So, maybe their store will survive the demonstration because they're scared. Well, it's time to return the favor. That's our job to scare the people who delight and scaring you. Sort of like an enforcer on a hockey team but cuter. It's time to turn this one-way road into a two-way street. Think of it as part of Biden's infrastructure package. Except it's real and it costs several trillion dollars less. Let's welcome tonight's guests. She's destroyed so many pundits that she had to become one herself. Starting tomorrow she's one of the co-hosts of \"OUTNUMBERED\". Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

Turns out, he did. Top Aide, Melissa Derosa reportedly attended meetings with publishers and edited early versions of the book. If true, he like, likely violated state ethics rules, which would come as a shock to thousands of nursing home residents, if they weren't already dead. Anyway, he could face a hefty fine plus lose the four million bucks which could buy a lot of prop-size q-tips. For more, let's go live to Andrew Cuomo.

There's one thing I noticed about late night television is they don't criticize each other anymore. Colbert goes on each other's show. They go and host each other award shows. And within three minutes, you alienated Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, the guy from \"The Daily Show\" I forgot his name. Then you went alienated Delta, Coke baseball, Brian Williams, CNN. So, every late night host. You're supposed to be the unifier of bring America together. I see an A-plus panel. I see a very handsome audience. You're right, a legitimate audience, no legitimate left track. And then, I see you Greg, and I'm saying to myself, is there going to be a guest host, let's say you get injured or you run a fever, because everything's there, the set is there, I just don't hear the questions.

Can't believe I'm saying peed all the time. So, Amazon walked back the tweet saying it was focused on the warehouses, not the drivers.
