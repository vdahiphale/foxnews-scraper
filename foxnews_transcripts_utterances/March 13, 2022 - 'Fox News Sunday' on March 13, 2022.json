Yesterday, Russia said that arms shipments will be targeted and aid and thought this attack was an attempt to cut off that supply weapons.

In some of the smaller cities and towns that Russia does control, now they're trying to put in place a civil governance of their own, kidnapping one mayor and replacing him with errors while also pushing to set up breakaway states in the south. But even there, they are facing resistance, hundreds of people coming out and protesting the new occupation, a reminder that they will never tolerate Russian rule. Meanwhile, the siege of major cities like Mariupol and Kharkiv continue with hundreds of thousands still stuck without water, food, heating, medicine. The mayor of Mariupol says over 1,500 people have died in that city alone, while other smaller towns and cities to resist have been totally destroyed. On the diplomatic front, the Foreign Minister Kuleba says that they are willing to negotiate but they will not surrender.

So I understand the frustration. And one of the things I think has been really terrific in this horrifying situation is there has been bipartisan support for Ukraine. I'm really grateful that Congress recently passed the legislation to provide an additional $200 million in drawdown that Secretary Antony Blinken signed out yesterday. So this is a bipartisan effort. At the Munich Security Conference, there was a strong bipartisan delegation in support of Ukraine, and there is that kind of support on Capitol Hill, which I think sends an important signal not only to Ukraine, but to Putin, that he can't divide America. He can't divide NATO. He can't divide Europe. He can't divide the world. A hundred forty-one countries signed up to a resolution at the U.N. General Assembly denouncing what Vladimir Putin is doing.

You're looking live at Lviv, in western Ukraine, where Russian forces have escalated attacks, striking a military base near the Polish border and bringing the war closer to NATO's doorstep, where the U.S. has dispatched soldiers and refugees have fled harm's way. Russia had warned it sees U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine as a, quote, \"legitimate target,\" but the White House is sending another $200 million in military aid after three weeks of brutal attacks. In a moment, we'll speak with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. But we begin with FOX team coverage. Mike Tobin in Lviv, where the refugee crisis shows no signs of slowing.

In a very significant strike this morning by Russian forces, just 12 miles from the Polish border, they were striking at a large Ukrainian military facility and they have 35 people dead. That is the largest, biggest loss of life since this conflict began in a single strike. The target had been a former NATO training facility, which housed U.S. troops until just a few weeks ago. Yesterday, Russia said that arms shipments will be targeted and aid and thought this attack was an attempt to cut off that supply weapons. Meanwhile, there has been repeated shelling overnight on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv -- still though no major push to put into the city itself. The concern now though is with other cities where grounding patience are faltered, the Russians will resort to indiscriminate shelling. President Zelenskyy earlier warning them against it."

Its equipment is old. It's tactics outdated. Instead, they have been relying on overwhelming force. In some of the smaller cities and towns that Russia does control, now they're trying to put in place a civil governance of their own, kidnapping one mayor and replacing him with errors while also pushing to set up breakaway states in the south. But even there, they are facing resistance, hundreds of people coming out and protesting the new occupation, a reminder that they will never tolerate Russian rule. Meanwhile, the siege of major cities like Mariupol and Kharkiv continue with hundreds of thousands still stuck without water, food, heating, medicine. The mayor of Mariupol says over 1,500 people have died in that city alone, while other smaller towns and cities to resist have been totally destroyed. On the diplomatic front, the Foreign Minister Kuleba says that they are willing to negotiate but they will not surrender. President Macron of France and Chancellor Scholz of Germany spoke with President Putin yesterday, seeking just a 24-hour cease-fire, they couldn't get even that. Now, President Zelensky saying he hopes Israel might be able to mediate between the two countries, possibly hosting talks in Jerusalem -- Bret."

And this is about taking control of this area eventually. But they're starting with an aerial bombardment campaign, certainly very close to the Polish border here. It's well-established that a lot of our re-supplies for the Ukrainians are coming through Poland and also through Romania. Eventually, they're going to interdict those supplies that are coming in here."

The purpose of that is on the northwest side in the northeast side of the city, the purpose is really to encircle the city, to go around the city as the circle would indicate, and they're bringing their artillery forward. And once they get that artillery in position around the city, they'll begin to hammer it. As soon as it's in range, they'll start to hammer it, but it will be consistent and persistent once they encircle the city. And this is the Russian way of war. Their intent here is to rubble as much of that city as they can, slaughter the people that are inside of it, and get a capitulation out of Zelenskyy --"

Here's an indication of that malign behavior. And it doesn't cover the prohibition on ballistic missiles. Why are they firing his missiles here? Because they want the United States out of Iraq and they want to put -- they want to create a violent situation where the legislature and the government at some point makes a decision to ask the Americans to leave. The Iranians have confidence about this. Why? Because we gave up seven military bases and three CIA bases east of Iran in Afghanistan, and they want us out west of Iran."

Just in the past few minutes, Iran is now claiming responsibility for that attack. What is the reaction to that, and is there going to be a response?"

We are very glad that our facilities are secure, that everybody is accounted for, that no one has been hurt or killed. But all of that said, this is great concern. There will indeed be a statement I'm sure coming out shortly, as well as calls in. This was an attack on Iraq's sovereignty, among other things, and of great concern to all of us. We will be following this closely."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's close and we would like all of the parties, including Russia, which has indicated its got some concerns, to bring this to a close. You know, we are very concerned about what Iran is doing but imagine these Iranians with a nuclear weapon. We need to get that off the table so we can address their malign behavior in the Middle East, and we will do all of the above. But first, we've got to get this deal and it is not yet closed."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Madam Secretary, you can understand the disconnect for the average American watching this happening as we're sitting at a table not only with the Iranians, but the Russians in Vienna, we're getting fired upon by Iran. You're saying the target wasn't the U.S. consulate, but that's where it ended up. Help people get -- square this circle, because it doesn't seem like a lot of people think that we should be doing that."

      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "It's hard to understand. I appreciate that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But here's the deal",
      "utterance": "If Iran has a nuclear weapon, its ability to project power into the Middle East and to deter us, our allies, and partners, is enormous. So, President Biden believes very strongly, as does Secretary Blinken, as do I, that we need to make sure that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and then we also need to deal with their malign behavior in the region. But, first, we've got to make sure that they cannot obtain a nuclear weapon."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "I think we don't know yet. It is not closed. It is not finished. We are urging all parties to do what they need to, and there's a lot of onus on Iran to decide whether in fact it wants to move forward or not, come into compliance and ensure that Iran never has a nuclear weapon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right. And regardless of whether the deal is reached or not, is there a plan to deal with Iran's regional behavior, proxies, terrorism, fighting these missile, drones? Whether there's a deal with removing sanctions or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",

And this is the \"Washington Examiner\" reporting that the department possesses indictable evidence against the Iranians. But the Biden demonstration resisting publicly indicting the men for fear that it could derail their drive for the nuclear deal with Iran, currently nearing completion in Vienna. Do you know that to be true?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, right now, it looks like it ends very badly already for the Ukrainian people. I think we all spend every day just horrified at the suffering of the American people, as your reporter on the ground discussed. It is just awful, particularly in Mariupol, where people are either going to starve to death or freeze to death or die because they don't have their medicine. It is truly horrifying. There are two objectives that we have. One is to support Ukraine in every way we can and indeed since the Biden the administration began, we have put $1.2 billion forward in security assistance to help Ukraine defend itself against this horrible attack. And the second is to put enormous pressure on Vladimir Putin to try to change his calculus, to end this war, to get a cease-fire in the first instance, to get humanitarian corridors, and to end this invasion. That pressure is beginning to have some effect. We are seeing some signs of a willingness to have real serious negotiations, but I have to say, as your reporter said, so far, it appears that Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine. We need to help Ukrainians in every way we can."

      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "I think we've already started to flip that script, Bret. I think that $1.2 billion in security assistance, antitank, anti-armor, antiaircraft, is really helping Ukraine to resist the onslaught of what your reporter said is a army of Russia where Putin very badly miscalculated how this war would go. It is nonetheless horrifying for the Ukrainian people, and so, we want to support them in every way we possibly can, and we want to support everyone's efforts, coordinated with United States, to try to mediate and end this terrible, terrible situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "You're saying you support them in every way but the MiG-29 situation, these jets from Poland, really seem to be a mixed message. Republicans are now talking about that openly, criticizing the administration. Here is Senator Tom Cotton. Take a listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR)",
      "utterance": "They're saying on the one hand, Ukraine is on effectively using its current aircraft and can't effectively use this aircraft. So the gains would be very small. But on the other hand, Vladimir Putin is going to you view this as such an escalation that he might strike United States or strike NATO. Both of those things can't be true."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "So, look, if I were President Zelenskyy, I would want everything and anything I could possibly get, so I understand this. The Pentagon, however, made an assessment that trying to move these planes was very complicated, that backfilling them was virtually impossible, that what Ukrainians really needed were antiaircraft, antitank, and anti-armor weapons, which is what we are supplying them in great measure and coordinating with other countries to do the same. So I understand the frustration. And one of the things I think has been really terrific in this horrifying situation is there has been bipartisan support for Ukraine. I'm really grateful that Congress recently passed the legislation to provide an additional $200 million in drawdown that Secretary Antony Blinken signed out yesterday. So this is a bipartisan effort. At the Munich Security Conference, there was a strong bipartisan delegation in support of Ukraine, and there is that kind of support on Capitol Hill, which I think sends an important signal not only to Ukraine, but to Putin, that he can't divide America. He can't divide NATO. He can't divide Europe. He can't divide the world. A hundred forty-one countries signed up to a resolution at the U.N. General Assembly denouncing what Vladimir Putin is doing. This is one man's choice to wage a premeditated, unjust, unprovoked war against a sovereign country. We can't let it stand."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "I think that's an open question yet, Bret, to be perfectly honest. We saw Russia and China come closer together, certainly before the Olympics, putting out a long manifesto about their partnership and how they were going to move forward together. And at the same time, we'd seen China pretty uncomfortable with an invasion of a sovereign country. China has -- the People's Republic of China has often said that sovereignty is key, territorial integrity is key, that countries should decide their own political future. We agree with those principles. We hope that China does as well. You know, in two weeks, in two weeks, Vladimir Putin undid 30 years of economic development. There was an international order that China and Russia both subscribe that helped both countries developed. For Russia, that is now gone. We're seeing them be taken out of every organization. The president is going to move forward with the Congress on removing them from most favored nation status at the WTO, the World Trade Organization. I think the PRC watching very closely, has to make some tough decisions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. But yet, they're sounding very bold, Madam Secretary. Just yesterday, China warned that any country supporting Taiwan militarily would face, quote, the worst consequences, adding no one, no force, would be able to stop the Communist Party if it attacks Taiwan. That does not sound positive. So, the last question I have for you, has Russia's invasion changed China's calculus when it comes to Taiwan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "I hope that China is looking very carefully at what's happening. We have a united world with very grave and very consequential sanctions on Russia. We understand and support a One-China policy, but we don't believe that China, PRC, ought to take Taiwan by force, and we will do everything we can to deter that effort by the PRC, and I think they're watching very closely. In fact, I think they made that statement, Bret, because they've seen what's happened and they're trying to go on the offense, knowing that they ought to be on the defense."

They fired seven missiles out of Iran into Iraq that hit near where -- where our -- a new construction that they're doing on an embassy there. I mean this is -- this is nonsense. And then it sounds like it had exactly the effect that the Iranians wanted. They -- they hit the -- they fired these missiles at a U.S. installation and now Wendy is saying, oh, well, we need to get signed as quick as possible.

There's -- it'd be nice if they would brief us. But this was an awful deal when it was made the first time around. What we're hearing, and we're getting only leakage, it's going to be worse this time than what it was. Now, you've got to remember what's happening here. You got a room that the Iranians are sitting at the table, the Russians and the Chinese are in there, they don't even let the U.S. delegation in that room. They're sitting at the kids table out in the hall peeking through the keyhole to see what's going on. So, you've got the Iranians and the Russians negotiating a deal for us.

If indeed it was submitted as a treaty and we voted on it, there would be ideal. There is no deal. Even if the Biden administration signs, they have what's called an executive agreement with Iran. It will not last past the next Republican president that's elected, just as the last deal didn't last the minute that the Republicans took over.

I think if -- if the thing did get away there, I think it would end pretty quickly because with the conventional forces that he's had there, you know, we haven't seen this kind of ineptness in a long, long time. So, I'm not as concerned about that. I think you always have to -- you always have to be wary of that. But, look, the administration has projected weakness throughout this. It's been too little, too late from the beginning. Remember, everything that we've tried to do they said, no, and then eventually they say yes. And that started with the sanctions. It started with giving them stinger missiles. They said, no. Then when our allies stepped up and gave stingers, then they said OK. The same thing with the javelin antitank weapons. They said no. Then when our allies stepped up they said yes. They're just dragging their feet. Look, when you're dealing with these people, if you project weakness, you're going to have a real problem. And that's going on with both Iran and with Russia right now and it is a serious situation. We need them to project some strength."

But the sanctions are usually not broad blanketed. They have what are called waivers in them where you can put them on surgically. But, you always have to be concerned about that when you're -- when you're putting on sanctions, that you're not shooting yourself in the foot when you do it. This is a -- a delicate operation and it's watched very carefully. It is -- it is not painting with a broad brush. It's not shooting with a shotgun. It is very targeted, very much shot with a rifle and not a shotgun."

Is that feasible or is that too dangerous and crosses the line where you're going to have confrontation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RISCH",
      "utterance": "Well, it's feasible, but there are it -- there are dangers involved with that. Look, this is another thing that we've been pushing the administration on for some time. The Ukrainians can pretty much put up their own no-fly zone if we supply them with the SAM missiles that -- that we have, that the allies have, the surface-to-air missiles. Look, remember, the -- the Russians do this. They supplied it to the eastern Ukrainian breakaways. And they brought down an airliner with it, as you remember. They brought down a Malaysian airliner some time ago. And the stingers are too light. They only go to about 15,000 feet. They're not quite fast enough. They do some -- they do some good. The patriots are too big. They're, you know, the launch system's about 5 billion. Each shot's about a million. But you -- there's a lot of stuff in between that are intermediate that the Ukrainians could use to inflect their own no-fly zone, particularly -- particularly in the west part of the country."

But the other pork that they had in there, the -- the numerous other things. For instance, there's a piece in there that most Americans don't realize, it brings back earmarks, for crying out loud. We fought for years to get rid of those earmarks. In addition to that, the -- there were -- there was some gun legislation that was included in that, that a couple of the -- of the gun lobbies were very much against. There were some provisions in there that a number of the pro-life groups we are against. Whenever we have these doggone big bills, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't, whether you vote yes or no.

They put us in an armored vehicle, drive us in, you pop out, you look around, it looks like the moon. Kyiv could look like the moon in six months. I don't see what's going to stop it.

SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": You know, first, I think we should recognize what an incredible job the Ukrainian people have done. You know the -- in prediction beforehand were that Kyiv would fall in one to five days. We're into week three of this war. But there is no expectation among U.S. officials that Russia will not prevail in terms of taking control of a great part of Ukraine. And that's going to open a different kind of conflict there. We're going to have a different role. The Ukrainians, we assume, will move to an insurgency. We'll have questions about the government we recognize and where they'll be.

I think this will have an incredible impact on his people, maybe on government officials, on people like oligarchs who have some power or some leverage with Putin. That's the goal. But that's not an immediate solution. And so the challenge is to find ways we can support them militarily that don't escalate, that don't get to a World War III or a direct -- even a direct confrontation with Russia. There's no magic bullet. There's no, you know, one plane or weapon we could give them that would do that. And I think this is a real inflection point, Bret, for NATO.

So, I don't think we should assume that about China. And we should have, right now, an intense diplomatic effort to try and bring China away from Moscow. There's other countries we have to work on too, the gulf states, the UAE, Israel has had a closer relationship with Russia, India.

I talked to my brother yesterday about -- he said he filled his tank in Tennessee, in Knoxville, $90 for his truck. So I said, for Ukraine, or gas prices. He said, heck with Ukraine. So, the longer this goes on, the higher prices go, support will change."

      "utterance": "Our agenda is extremely popular. And the question is, is if they agree with us, why don't they like us more? And -- and we spent a bunch of time talking but attributes in addition to issues. That we need to address the most urgent needs of the American people. They need to know we're doing it. And we need to be fighting like hell every day for the things that matter in people's lives. And we need to talk like real people."

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "And, you know, Democrats have been looking for a reset. There were looking for a reset during the State of the Union Address that was just two weeks ago. I think that did not succeed in resetting some of President Biden's problems. You saw at the -- at the meeting with House Democrats in Philadelphia that Biden addressed them but did not outline what they should be trying to do in a united way this year to try to pass more legislation on The Hill that will deliver results for people. You really get the sense that they are braced for the worst possible outcome in November. Things sometimes change. We're still nine months away. But it is a tough time for Democrats looking at November."

      "speaker": "BILL BARR FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "And I would also say that the Make America Great Again movement has to mature. People were very angry in 2016. They didn't like the smug elite and -- and -- and the excess of the -- of the media and -- and of the progressives. And, in some ways, Trump was there wrecking -- you know, a wrecking ball. We're going to take a wrecking ball to these people. And he did disrupt the momentum of the left. And I give him credit for that. But to make America great again requires more than that. And it requires a more decisive victory."
