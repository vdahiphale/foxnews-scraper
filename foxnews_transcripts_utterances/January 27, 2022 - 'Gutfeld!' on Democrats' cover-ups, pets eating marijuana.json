      "sentences": "Yes. Yes. I'll show you who's boss. Yes. All right. Clap. Clap, you stupid people. Happy glorious Thursday. What an amazing show we have for you today. Dana Perino is here. Doesn't she look lovely? But wait, is that really Dana? I mean, it could be, or it could be a blood sucking demon. But I guess you'll have to trust me that it's Dana. Fact is you can't tell because like the reoccurring zit on my neck, it's covered up. Maybe it's Dana. Maybe it isn't. We'll have to see if she tests positive for sugar and spice. You see, I'm being the opposite of transparent to remind you of our current government. Have you noticed that everything they do these days that turns out bad, illegal or just infuriating always begins with a cover up? Whether you were the victim of your boss's unwanted advances at your job in Albany or had relatives die in a New York nursing home because of horrible decisions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Your suspicions are either denied or mocked by the people in power. You might even be called a stupid son of a bitch by a guy who complete sentences as often as I dunk basketballs. The list of deliberate non transparency is endless, as is my hate for it. The origins of Wuhan, while they mock the lab league theory, even though the place was breeding more disease than the Playboy Mansion grotto. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Gain of function? Never happened. Well, actually it did. And yes, it was funded by whom? Long story. A reoccurring character named Anthony Fauci was involved. How about your risk of dying from COVID? I bet you don't even know your specific risk even after 2-1/2 half years. And what happened to the rapid testing? How about a rapid answer? No chance. It's like asking a waitress where your drinks are after 20 minutes in a crowded restaurant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yes. I know you'll find out and circle back. Did the supply chain ever get fixed? Hell even the looters in L.A. are complaining that the trains are late. And where's Mayor Pete? Is he still lactating? What's Kamala doing? Hell, what's Joe even doing besides napping? So how are we dealing with China? Well, there's COVID, fentanyl, the Uyghurs. Do we know anything? What was in that letter to Putin? A stern warning a mysterious white powder. 30 bucks for a new shirt? What about crime? Remember, when those hate crime stats were everywhere, then they weren't? Remember when mug shots mattered. Now they're gone? That as murders spike, bureaucrats combined violent and non-violent crimes into a lump sum to hide the rise in murder. As if people attacked on subway platforms were thinking, hey, at least this isn't mail fraud. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's more sleight of hand from the people who have blood on theirs. There's Hunter's laptop, of course, something so obviously real but buried like a murder victim in a crawl space. And if you brought it up, you were the one who couldn't tweet. Joe Biden's business dealings harder to find than a clean meth pipe in Hunter's car at 2:00 a.m. And what was Joe's entire election strategy? Not being there. A human embodiment of opaqueness. The less you see of him, the better because what you see is what you get and what you get stinks. Figuratively, probably literally. How about voter I.D. tell you who's voting. What's wrong with that? Definitely makes an election less transparent, but the left calls it voter suppression. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yet, I've never met someone who doesn't have an I.D. Well, if you don't include the 230 illegals who just moved into my town in the middle of the night. Speaking of, check out this new leaked video that shows what we already knew. That in darkness the Fed secretly flew illegal immigrants from the border to communities also kept in the dark about these trips. The tape shows local police confused and surprised by flights landing after the airport closed in breach of security. They're both literally and figuratively being kept in the dark. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Meanwhile, the rest of us get masked and groped like rat a Halloween sex party. Not that I mind. It's been a while. And then suddenly the flight stopped when the public found out. So what are these examples have in common? Well, they are deliberately murky. It's not that they're just lying, they're simply making it harder to see what's going on. It's like the dirty lens on my balcony telescope. You know, when I'm looking into the apartments across the way, hoping to see a hot couple, making a panini naked. It sucks.

But to the Biden administration, sunlight has the same effect as it does on vampires. They don't take cover from it quickly. They will die. Biden's opaqueness preserves him as an empty vessel ready for filling the contents provided by activists bent on the radical remake. And so everything has to be done out of sight. It's the opposite of magic. It's not now you see it now you don't. If you don't see it, now you do and there's nothing you can do about it. Now watch me pull these illegals out of a van.

      "utterance": "Yes. Yes. I'll show you who's boss. Yes. All right. Clap. Clap, you stupid people. Happy glorious Thursday. What an amazing show we have for you today. Dana Perino is here. Doesn't she look lovely? But wait, is that really Dana? I mean, it could be, or it could be a blood sucking demon. But I guess you'll have to trust me that it's Dana. Fact is you can't tell because like the reoccurring zit on my neck, it's covered up. Maybe it's Dana. Maybe it isn't. We'll have to see if she tests positive for sugar and spice. You see, I'm being the opposite of transparent to remind you of our current government. Have you noticed that everything they do these days that turns out bad, illegal or just infuriating always begins with a cover up? Whether you were the victim of your boss's unwanted advances at your job in Albany or had relatives die in a New York nursing home because of horrible decisions. Your suspicions are either denied or mocked by the people in power. You might even be called a stupid son of a bitch by a guy who complete sentences as often as I dunk basketballs. The list of deliberate non transparency is endless, as is my hate for it. The origins of Wuhan, while they mock the lab league theory, even though the place was breeding more disease than the Playboy Mansion grotto. Gain of function? Never happened. Well, actually it did. And yes, it was funded by whom? Long story. A reoccurring character named Anthony Fauci was involved. How about your risk of dying from COVID? I bet you don't even know your specific risk even after 2-1/2 half years. And what happened to the rapid testing? How about a rapid answer? No chance. It's like asking a waitress where your drinks are after 20 minutes in a crowded restaurant. Yes. I know you'll find out and circle back. Did the supply chain ever get fixed? Hell even the looters in L.A. are complaining that the trains are late. And where's Mayor Pete? Is he still lactating? What's Kamala doing? Hell, what's Joe even doing besides napping? So how are we dealing with China? Well, there's COVID, fentanyl, the Uyghurs. Do we know anything? What was in that letter to Putin? A stern warning a mysterious white powder. 30 bucks for a new shirt? What about crime? Remember, when those hate crime stats were everywhere, then they weren't? Remember when mug shots mattered. Now they're gone? That as murders spike, bureaucrats combined violent and non-violent crimes into a lump sum to hide the rise in murder. As if people attacked on subway platforms were thinking, hey, at least this isn't mail fraud. It's more sleight of hand from the people who have blood on theirs. There's Hunter's laptop, of course, something so obviously real but buried like a murder victim in a crawl space. And if you brought it up, you were the one who couldn't tweet. Joe Biden's business dealings harder to find than a clean meth pipe in Hunter's car at 2:00 a.m. And what was Joe's entire election strategy? Not being there. A human embodiment of opaqueness. The less you see of him, the better because what you see is what you get and what you get stinks. Figuratively, probably literally. How about voter I.D. tell you who's voting. What's wrong with that? Definitely makes an election less transparent, but the left calls it voter suppression. Yet, I've never met someone who doesn't have an I.D. Well, if you don't include the 230 illegals who just moved into my town in the middle of the night. Speaking of, check out this new leaked video that shows what we already knew. That in darkness the Fed secretly flew illegal immigrants from the border to communities also kept in the dark about these trips. The tape shows local police confused and surprised by flights landing after the airport closed in breach of security. They're both literally and figuratively being kept in the dark."

Meanwhile, the rest of us get masked and groped like rat a Halloween sex party. Not that I mind. It's been a while. And then suddenly the flight stopped when the public found out. So what are these examples have in common? Well, they are deliberately murky. It's not that they're just lying, they're simply making it harder to see what's going on. It's like the dirty lens on my balcony telescope. You know, when I'm looking into the apartments across the way, hoping to see a hot couple, making a panini naked. It sucks. Every single thing mentioned remains cloudy in order to hide corruption, incompetence and worse, hard-left ideology. In politics they say sunlight is the best disinfectant. But to the Biden administration, sunlight has the same effect as it does on vampires. They don't take cover from it quickly. They will die. Biden's opaqueness preserves him as an empty vessel ready for filling the contents provided by activists bent on the radical remake. And so everything has to be done out of sight. It's the opposite of magic. It's not now you see it now you don't. If you don't see it, now you do and there's nothing you can do about it. Now watch me pull these illegals out of a van. You can't just wave a wand however, and make problems disappear. Or can you?"

Or two, they think the American people are too stupid or three, that the media is going to cover up for them. And quite frankly, all three have been happening for so much of our lifetime. And as a result, we're in the situation that we're in, and it's not good. Why -- to your point, Dana, why is nobody else talking about this? This is a really big deal.

God knows they need it. It'll be installed on the computers of 1.7 million teachers and tens of millions of kids they teach. Union president, Randi, Macho Man, Weingarten -- that's Randi -- yes. I appreciate you guys, thanks. It says, it'll help students separate fact from fiction and develop their critical thinking and analytical skills. Right, by telling kids that anything the union dislikes is misinformation. Because after all, you know, they're going to be equally critical, both left and right, right? Well, not so fast gullible Gary. An analysis of this fact checking system by the Media Research Center found it's about as balanced as, Kat, when her prescriptions aren't filled. Nine out of 10 sites flagged for misinformation featured conservative or pro-life politics. Plus, News Guard's own founder, Steven Brill, called the Hunter Biden laptop story a hoax, then his pants spontaneously combusted. Turns out the so-called Fact Checker only checks the facts in one direction with misinformation, meaning facts they don't like. And I'm sure this will all go over well with parents across the country who've already been called domestic terrorists for daring to question woke ideologies creeping into their brat's classrooms.

Last week, Dana's dog, Percy, had to go to the hospital after he accidentally ate some edibles marijuana off the ground in Central Park. Terrible. In unrelated story, Kat, lost her purse in Central Park. Oh. Dana rushed Percy to the vet after getting this video from the doggy daycare. Man, poor kid. All jokes aside, especially that joke of a story about how the edible must come from the park and not the disgusting drug den that Dana lives in. But weed can make dogs pretty sick. The Animal Poison Control Center claims that calls about pets eating weed are up 765 percent since 2019, although it's rarely fatal, that say can cause symptoms like difficulty walking, wobbling while sitting still, shaking, vomited, dilated pupils and incompetence, or as Julie Banderas calls it Monday morning. Dana, I know we're making light of this, but I feel terrible for the dogs. The dog doesn't know what's happening."

So, when the cannabis goes into their brains, that makes them very crazy down. So, he had to spend a night in the hospital and have an IV to flush it all out. And what was interesting is as soon as I posted about it and said I wanted to do a segment I got so many notes and one of them was very supportive one from, Kat, and you know, people that this happened to."

A brand new totally scientific study has settled it. Playing hard to get does work after all. I guess that's why women love Scott Peterson. Yes, apparently faking disinterest really does attract mates. And it's much better than my strategy of faking a seizure. So, there's a chance of mouth to mouth. And an attempt to answer why they're still single, the researchers at the University of Rochester conclude it's all about the thrill of the chase and your suitor being unsure the affection will be reciprocated. Wow, that's some great research. You could have called my grandmother; she would have told you the same thing if she weren't dead. And as I stressed before, it wasn't my fault. Says one researcher, playing hard to get makes it seem as if you're more in demand. We call that having higher mate value, adds another people who are too easy to attract maybe perceived as more desperate. But does this work better than the direct approach?
