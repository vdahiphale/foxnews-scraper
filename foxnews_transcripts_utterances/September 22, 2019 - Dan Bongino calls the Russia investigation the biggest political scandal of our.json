President Trump admits he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in a call with Ukraine's leader in July. Both Republicans and Democrats are calling for investigations. Democrats want to know if President Trump tried to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival in exchange for military aid. While Republicans want to know if Biden had anything to do with the firing of the country's Prosecutor General who was investigating a gas company where Biden's son worked. Meantime Pittsburgh police say three people are dead, four others hospitalized in an apparent mass drug overdose.

It's a fabricated fairy tale, the dossier about Donald Trump and these sexual episodes, these gross stories, it's all -- Mark, it's all made up. Where does Steele fit into this puzzle and why do they need Steele? I believe calling it the Steele dossier is a huge mistake that plays into the hands of the left. And there's a reason they call it the Steele dossier. It's not the Steele dossier. It's the Simpsons-Jacoby-Fusion GPS-Steele dossier. They need to put someone's name on it, this fake movie script story they have to sell it to the FBI It can't be Glenn Simpson's name. He was a reporter who is being paid by Hillary Clinton. So they must be sitting around a room and saying, okay, well, if Glenn Simpson walks us into the FBI, someone is going to see right through this and say, well, let me get this straight, a former journalist working for Hillary produces this movie script about Donald Trump and this evil colluding with Putin. I don't believe it. Someone says, light bulb moment, eureka, I've got an idea. We used to work with this credible source because he had been credible in the past, Steele. We do facts here. He had produced information for the FBI in the FIFA case, the soccer scandal. And it was credible. Now as you know, being a lawyer yourself, having worked in the Department of Justice, me having been an agent, there's nothing more valuable than a source that's appeared in court before. Whereas his information has been used credibly. He doesn't have to go through the exact same verification as a new source. Someone probably said, hey, you know what, this guy, Steele, would be great. He worked for us before. What if we slap the movie script information on a dossier, put Steele's name on it, hey, look, look what I've got. And then we give it to the FBI and they all say, oh, this guy, Steele, is wonderful. What's interesting about that, too, is there were some reports about Glenn Simpson's wife, Mary Jacoby, who wrote a Facebook post -- again, this is in the book -- that got taken down, where it seems she was upset that Steele was getting credit for the movie script fairy tale dossier --",

So what happens? Well, Mueller is appointed in May of 2017. About two months later, and the timeline is a little bit up in the air. We don't know when exactly he sees that, but he gets the infamous texts from the FBI cabal, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and others. Mueller gets that file from the Inspector General, essentially the Internal Affairs officer for the government, who says, hey, Bob, you need to look at this.

They tried unmasking, basically, wiretapping, in normal parlance. They tried to listen in on the Trump team's phone calls and others. What did they get? Nothing. Zip. Zero. So then when that didn't work, they moved on to Plan B, using the FISA Courts to formalize the spying process through our courts designed to get our terrorists and enemies of the United States. When that didn't work out? Then what do they do? They go to the media, and they tried to use the media to build public support for a Special Counsel with the assistance of James Comey -- excuse me, and upper level people in the FBI and what do they do? They get their wish, and Bob Mueller doubles down. And now we've seen Phase 4 of this, I should have added an appendix, Plan D. Now we have Jerry Nadler and the ridiculous impeachment, which is just again, a continuous polluted river where they just will not let it go. But that's what I did in this book.

In other words, Mark, why did the Obama administration jump to spying and the FISA Courts and unmasking while in 2007, that McCain race roughly in that time period, why did it stop with McCain, which was immediately? McCain and the Russians, you know? Well, because George W. Bush was President, and he wasn't going to allow the Intelligence Community to be weaponized to spy on John McCain. It's very simple at that point. But yes, that's another revelation in the book, not just that they pulled this movie script out and inserted Trump's name into it to make him the bad guy the antagonist. But that they'd already tried this same thing against McCain. Mark, none of this is new. And when you read it, and you read the allegations against McCain, if I took McCain's name out, put Trump in there, you'd say, this is -- they've already tried the same thing. None of this is new.

It's a fabricated fairy tale, the dossier about Donald Trump and these sexual episodes, these gross stories, it's all -- Mark, it's all made up. Where does Steele fit into this puzzle and why do they need Steele? I believe calling it the Steele dossier is a huge mistake that plays into the hands of the left. And there's a reason they call it the Steele dossier. It's not the Steele dossier. It's the Simpsons-Jacoby-Fusion GPS-Steele dossier. They need to put someone's name on it, this fake movie script story they have to sell it to the FBI It can't be Glenn Simpson's name. He was a reporter who is being paid by Hillary Clinton. So they must be sitting around a room and saying, okay, well, if Glenn Simpson walks us into the FBI, someone is going to see right through this and say, well, let me get this straight, a former journalist working for Hillary produces this movie script about Donald Trump and this evil colluding with Putin. I don't believe it. Someone says, light bulb moment, eureka, I've got an idea. We used to work with this credible source because he had been credible in the past, Steele. We do facts here. He had produced information for the FBI in the FIFA case, the soccer scandal. And it was credible. Now as you know, being a lawyer yourself, having worked in the Department of Justice, me having been an agent, there's nothing more valuable than a source that's appeared in court before. Whereas his information has been used credibly. He doesn't have to go through the exact same verification as a new source. Someone probably said, hey, you know what, this guy, Steele, would be great. He worked for us before. What if we slap the movie script information on a dossier, put Steele's name on it, hey, look, look what I've got. And then we give it to the FBI and they all say, oh, this guy, Steele, is wonderful. What's interesting about that, too, is there were some reports about Glenn Simpson's wife, Mary Jacoby, who wrote a Facebook post -- again, this is in the book -- that got taken down, where it seems she was upset that Steele was getting credit for the movie script fairy tale dossier --"

How does it tie into the book, the exonerated case and the Mueller story? Mark, Ukrainians -- key Ukrainian political officials were feeding information to Democratic operatives about Trump players, notably Paul Manafort. Again, this is all out there. We know that. And you may say, well, what's the big deal? Well, what's the big deal? You've just told us for two years in the media that foreign collusion during elections was a big deal. We know that Alexandra Chalupa, who left the DNC was working with key Ukrainians and others and the media to flush out and pump out stories about Manafort and others. Which again, you just told us, foreign collusion was this awful terrible thing, which it is, but why when it's the Ukrainians and Democrats, it is like, oh -- and one more point in this Bruce Ohr who is the upper level Justice Department official."

Mark, you know, listen, are we dealing with principles here? Are we dealing with phony frauds? I thought foreign collusion was bad. If foreign collusion is a bad thing, which I agree then why is the Ukrainian collusion with Nelly Ohr, Bruce's wife and Alexandra Chalupa at the D.N.C., why isn't Jerry Nadler having hearings about that?"

And even worse, we have the texts of Mark Warner, the Democrat from Virginia, the text -- him texting a lawyer working for Oleg Deripaska. Who is Oleg Deripaska? Tie it back to the beginning of the show. He appears in the 2007 movie script article in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and is a key ally of Vladimir Putin. So let me get this straight. A key Democratic senator on the Senate Intel Committee investigating foreign collusion is texting a lawyer working for a Russian connected the Putin about foreign collusion?

That is where the true victims is treated as the perpetrator, and the perpetrators are treated as the patriots. We don't want involvement by the Russians. Oh, yes, you do. I don't know. We don't want collusion with the Russians. No, actually, you do. Because the end justifies the means and anything to win, and so when Mr. Warner gave his speech on one of the hearings on TV and said, this is America, we don't support intrusion in our elections of foreign powers. To your point, he forgot to mention Ukraine. But even worse than Ukraine and Russia, was Obama. He and his administration interfering in the election. That is what cannot be accepted.

They are weaponizing the government to spy on Trump, and then they weaponize the government to get an appointment of a Special Counsel because they can't prosecute Trump and they have to bury this case. So what happens? Well, Mueller is appointed in May of 2017. About two months later, and the timeline is a little bit up in the air. We don't know when exactly he sees that, but he gets the infamous texts from the FBI cabal, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and others. Mueller gets that file from the Inspector General, essentially the Internal Affairs officer for the government, who says, hey, Bob, you need to look at this. Those are the infamous smelly Walmart people text, where they start talking about this entire setup, the London connections, and basically --"

Now, what would any ethical reasonable person, especially a lawyer like Mueller, who knows the system do? Mark, they would shut it down, if not seek prosecution against the people who did this if crimes were committed? That's not what happens. What happens is unbelievable, and I haven't seen anyone else reporting this connection. Remember, July of 2017, some key events happened. That's the quickie raid on Paul Manafort's house in the early morning, right around July of 2017. So let me get this straight, Bob Mueller is reading about these texts and how this is set, how these cases a train wreck, how the investigators are corrupted? And instead of turning around and dumping the case and going up in front of the American people and saying, we screwed up. They do an early morning raid on Paul Manafort."

Does Durham know who did that? I have my suspicions. I'm not going to put it out here now, but I have my suspicions of who that was. We have additional crimes as well. Andrew McCabe, the Deputy Director of the FBI, you know, we know at this point that he lied to Federal agents, you know, he can talk about his motive all he wants. But that happened. The only open question is, has Durham nailed down who exactly did this? And I think it's important we understand because I get -- even on my show, I kind of get this back and forth with a lot of the listeners, they get upset when only administrative things happen to people, like when all these people had to resign at the top of the FBI But as you know, being a lawyer, there's a difference between a crime and an administrative screw up. I do think there's going to be handcuffs on some people, sadly, some are just going to get away with firing, termination and ruined reputations. I wish I could say different."

And I hope he gets to the bottom what was taking place in the Oval Office and around the Oval Office because so far, nobody has been interested in that. Nobody has investigated that. Not a Committee of Congress, not a criminal investigator, and really not the so-called mainstream media. And Obama gets a pass. And Harry Truman used to say, the buck stops here. Well, that works with Netflix. And it doesn't seem to be working with him as President of the United States. You know what? This has been so edifying and so enjoyable. Dan Bongino, God bless you."
