Workers discovered suspicious package addressed to Congressman Maxine Waters. KTTV Fox Los Angeles Bill Melugin joins us from outside that complex. Bill, what do you know? BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX 11 LOS ANGELES: Yes, Tucker, good evening. What we know is very limited so far, but what I can tell you is that earlier this afternoon, our newsroom got some phone calls from employees here at this postal facility telling us they were being evacuated because of a suspicious package that was found here that was addressed to Maxine Waters. Now, let me give you a live look at the scene right here. LAPD's bomb squad is on scene right here. We understand they have the robot out, and from people watching our chopper cam, I understand some of the bomb technicians have gone inside to take X-rays of this device, which is still inside of the building. Now, we've been talking to some of these employees leaving the facility. Some of them are very confused about what's going on here. Some of them are telling us they weren't evacuated. Others telling us they were. But they all know that this package did in fact have Maxine Waters name on it. One telling us that she believes that the package had very similar markings and ID stuff on it, just like the other packages that were found throughout the day. Now, this would be the second package found today addressed to Maxine Waters. This would be, if it's confirmed that it is some sort of explosive device, this would be I believe the seventh bomb. So right now, LAPD's bomb tech's on scene here investigating. Again, a second package addressed to Maxine Waters here in South LA. We will send it back to you guys.",

That news spiked a massive investigation that news sparked a massive investigation to the obvious question, who sent these explosives, and why? None of the devices exploded or harmed anyone. Details remain sparse but Fox's Trace Gallagher has been covering this story from the very beginning and joins us with the very latest. Trace."

      "utterance": "And Tucker, a law enforcement source tells us, the choice of pipe bombs and packages is unusual because there's no easy or obvious method of detonation but authorities also say that while these pipe bombs were rudimentary, they appear to be functional and at least one contained projectiles including shards of glass to inflict as much damage as possible. The FBI says, the packages were mailed in manila envelopes with computer printed address labels and they all had six forever stamps on them, those are stamps that can be used any time regardless of price changes. And all of the devices had a return address of Florida Congresswoman and former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Sources also tell us there is strong evidence that these attempted attacks are the work of one group or individual. Over the past two days there have been ten reports of suspicious packages, four have been ruled out, one is still being investigated and five have now been confirmed including to the Clintons, the Obamas, billionaire liberal donor George Soros, Former Attorney General Eric Holder and Former CIA Director John Brennan. Brennan's envelope was delivered to CNN and New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill says, investigators are reviewing security video to see if they can identify the courier who delivered the CNN package. Today President Trump condemned what he called acts of political violence but Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer said, \"President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence.\" Of course, the GOP has blamed Democrats for inciting numerous acts of violence against Republicans. The FBI, by the way, warns more packages could be out there, Tucker."

In response to the pipe bomb mailings today he tweeted this quote, \"These attempted attacks that have been made are beyond criminal, they are acts of pure terror.

When a Republican or Democrat is under attack, first of all we don't even know who did it, we should be trying to find out who did it but we should be criticizing the act, whether it's a Republican or Democrat.

But the difference is, we all have you know our disagreements, you shouldn't ever make those personal and you should never think that violence is a way to settle our political differences. We settle them at the ballot box, we have an election in 13 days, that's where we settle our differences. Violence is never an answer to somebody's political disagreement with somebody else."

You saw it after September 11th when our very way of life was under attack by people who had a totally different viewpoint of America and what it stands for and we came together as a country and we said, we're not going to back down. We're not going to change who we are and we shouldn't do it here either but we should be equally vigilant, Republican and Democrat, no matter who is under attack, that it's wrong for whoever did the attack. Let's find out the details, don't try to deflect blame and try to blame somebody else who had nothing to do with this, let's actually go after the people who did it, that's what we should do and coming together as Americans and again, I mean, it's not about philosophy. I'm a conservative. I have liberal friends, I have disagreements with them but I don't make it personal and none of us should make it personal, we should want to find out who did it, let's get the facts.

Once they arrived in Texas cross the Rio Grande River, the group will inevitably be met by Left-wing lawyers who specialized in manipulating our dysfunctional immigration system and they're all but ensured permanent residency in this country if history is any guide and that of course, is the main reason so many of them are coming now.

They do not face persecution by the government in their home countries which is the essence of asylum but because they under our laws, at least get a hearing, a credible fear hearing and we don't have enough detention beds to detain 14,000 people while they get those hearings, many of them probably will be let go with a slip saying please come back on such-and- such a day.

Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform Act which is all about enforcement. Then in the 2000s, they were like OK, now we want amnesty, we're not for enforcing the law, we want amnesty. But now in 2018 they're going beyond that and they're saying we want to bring in more illegal aliens, we're not content with the millions here already. We're for bringing people in from outside of the country who have no basis for coming to the United States."

They don't want Sanctuary cities. We have been rewarding illegal immigration against the will of the American people for too long. This is a problem, we can solve. If you want to stop illegal immigration, stop rewarding illegal immigration, that's one of the most important reasons why I'm running for Governor in Kansas.

What does the caravan mean if anything for the 2018 midterms, thirteen days from now? Dana Perino hosts the Daily Briefing, she served as press Secretary for President George W. Bush. She's seen this topic emerge and evolve and she thinks deeply about all this stuff, all the time and she joins us now. So does this Dana, I mean, I can't exactly tell where this is going or maybe Republicans are overstating its effect or understating, I mean, what effect is this going to have, do you think?"

      "utterance": "Well, it's possible that Republicans are overstating this issue and understating health care but the truth, that could also be said for Democrats. That they're overstating healthcare and under reporting on immigration. Look, I think for - if you just look at the Senate, the red state Democrats that are running for a re-election, this is not good news for them. Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly in particular, Missouri in Indiana, these are states that President Trump won by over 20 points. Immigration was one of their number one issues for those voters so this issue being talked about in the last two weeks before the midterm election, which is very close anyway, that's probably not good news for them. Conventional wisdom in Washington DC would say that it's not good for Republicans to talk about immigration in the way that you and Kris Kobach were just talking about. However, look at some of the purple states, Dean Heller in Nevada, the incumbent there, the most vulnerable Senate Republican running for re- election, he has opened up a six-point lead in Nevada. Martha McSally in Arizona now has a lead over her opponent there. So the Democrats really want to focus on and talk about health care and they could be right. On election night, I think that could be the main reason that people come out to vote but this immigration issue with all of these visuals, it's not like it isn't happening. Getting the word out, Republicans getting the word out could have a difference in these - some of these coin-flip districts as well."

But if you're taking that position which is the Democratic position, how do you square that with your immigration views? Letting in tens of millions or more people who also get that healthcare, doesn't that dilute the promise of the government, I mean how could you make that?"

I was also thinking about in another way because you talked about reasonable people on immigration, I'd like to say that you know, I would - most people will say, she's probably one of them. I have a real soft spot for refugees, the refugees who are being persecuted by their governments, hounded by their governments. Basically treated terribly, sometimes kidnapped, sometimes targeted for murder, for their political beliefs, that is not what's happening here."

We saw that happen when Clinton, Bill Clinton was impeached, it turned a very negative on the Republicans. And I think, even those who participated in the impeachment now regret that and I think that the Democrats should learn the lesson. If they are fortunate enough to regain the House, they should use that as a way of checking and balancing and exercising their constitutional authority. Trying to work with the Republicans and come up with some compromise programs that won't satisfy anybody 100% but that's the nature of a divided government. You come up with compromises. Think back to the days you know, when Ted Kennedy would work so closely with McCain and others. I think we need to see that happening again and if the Democrats regain control and they're smart, they will try to reach out to moderate Republicans and try to come up with some programs that help the American public rather than just achieve short-term partisan results."

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",

It's not easy to impeach constitutionally but the House can act unconstitutionally. Maxine Waters has already said the criteria for impeachment is anything the House wants, she wants to impeach not only President Trump but Vice President Pence as well. It would just be a show trial and they might get enough votes, I don't think they will. I think there'd be enough sensible Democrats to understand that this would not be a positive thing for the Democratic Party. Certainly the leading up to 2020 and as soon as the midterms are over, 2020 begins and I think it would be a way of frittering away the advantage the Democrats have gotten by taking over the House. And also even the talk of it now hurts their chances of winning the House. I don't think Americans want to vote for an impeachment, I don't think they want to vote for more investigations of Russia.

I think most Americans are centrists and the movement to the Left of the Democratic Party does not represent the mainstream of the Democratic Party and I would hope the leaders would recognize that. The same thing is true of Republicans. The extreme, extreme Right wing which is winning in a few places doesn't represent the core of the Republican Party. I think the Americans benefit when both parties move to the middle, when there are great debates between conservatives and liberals, that's the where the debate should happen, instead of screaming matches between the radicals on the Left and the radicals on the Right.

Two prominent Democrats, both accused of those things that are still polling at the same level or better than they were previously. That's because identity politics has shifted the burden for politicians rather than campaigning on results and substance and issues and ideas, they seem to make appeals to what you look like, who your ancestors were. That's a topic that's addressed in great detail in a new book called Ship of fools available for purchase on tuckercarlson.com. A California court orders the eviction of Michael Avenatti's law firm from its offices for skipping four months of rent."

      "utterance": "Well, the creepy porn lawyer certainly has lived a glamorous life it turns out. During the few waking moments, he hasn't spent on cable television, he has raced cars with a Saudi prince, he's flown private to visit 5-star hotels in the French Riviera. He once owned a seven-million-dollar home in Southern California. It's good being the creepy porn lawyer but with a first name like Creepy, it's no surprise that Mr. Porn lawyer financed that lifestyle in part by simply refusing to pay the money he owed other people. According to an extensive and fascinating report in The Daily Beast, CPL and his businesses have millions of dollars in unpaid state and federal taxes. Earlier this year creepy porn lawyer's law firm was ordered to pay $10 million dollars to a former partner whom he apparently stiffed on profits from the firm. The firm did not pay up so today the creepy porn lawyer was hit with the personal judgment of $4.8 million dollars. Not even the creepy porn lawyer's landlords are getting a cut of that though. In a court in Santa Ana California convicted his law firm, evicted rather the law firm from its offices for simply skipping four months of rent. Nobody from the firm even bothered to show up at the hearing, maybe that would have been different if the hearing had been held inside a CNN news studio. Well, rising stars of the Democratic Party have been the subject of seemingly endless fawning media coverage. When we say fawning we mean fawning treacly. Now two candidates running in competitive races in Florida and in Georgia are consumed with pretty serious scandals, that's something you probably didn't read about in the latest gushing magazine profile of them. We'll bring you up to date anyway. Consider first, the case of Andrew Gilliam, he's the socialist Democrat running for Governor of Florida. He was the mayor of Tallahassee. He was confronted about free gifts he received while he was Mayor during a debate, last night in Florida. Watch this."

And that's what these documents demonstrate is that he did knowingly take this ticket from a guy named Mike Miller who was the undercover agent, who he thought was you know, a business guy who was looking to do a deal with his city, when he was Mayor.

You have people like Keith Ellison walking around with shirts saying that he supports open borders so it would not be a surprise that this is sort of the you know - would not be a surprise that Stacey Abrams would be trying to say something like this."

And they cry and we laugh and then I go to the next place and it's the feel-good hit of the summer. It's got 300 million views and it's so - it's warped me so badly and turned me into such an absurd Pollyanna that I literally have to come home and put on cable news in order to feel regular again.

But work you know, the work that we do, the stuff we do for money, you know Dirty Jobs is still on it's been out 15 years, never once do you hear the words Republican, Democrat, ISIS, riot. You might hear hurricane if we're down doing a clean-up or something but nobody talks about any of that stuff in real life and on 'Returning the Favor,' it's the same thing. Oh my God, that's my baby picture, that's so weird. We essentially highlight decency the same way we used to highlight work. It was really just an experiment. We wanted to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the country still was full of people who woke up and went out to make their community a better place. And now my newsfeed, I'm not kidding it is literally overrun with people saying you got to meet my brother, my uncle, my cousin, my sister, my mom, you got to meet my neighbor, wait till you see what they do. So look, for what it's worth, we're going to be OK and if we had social media back in the day, I mean pick your favorite century. If we were reporting on the state of things today, the way they existed once upon a time, it'd be enough to depress a hyena. Are you kidding me? We're living - this is the absolute best time to be alive ever. Any food you want can be delivered to your door, you can fly across the country in a steel tube, any song you want, all the information in the world is right here, it's accessible.

Fundamentally, fundamentally, I don't think - I think we're the same basic species, we've always been. Look, just 20 minutes ago, I narrated the foreword to my mom's book, my mom at 80 years of age has written a book about optimism and it's literally flying off the shelves.

Workers discovered suspicious package addressed to Congressman Maxine Waters. KTTV Fox Los Angeles Bill Melugin joins us from outside that complex. Bill, what do you know? BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX 11 LOS ANGELES: Yes, Tucker, good evening. What we know is very limited so far, but what I can tell you is that earlier this afternoon, our newsroom got some phone calls from employees here at this postal facility telling us they were being evacuated because of a suspicious package that was found here that was addressed to Maxine Waters. Now, let me give you a live look at the scene right here. LAPD's bomb squad is on scene right here. We understand they have the robot out, and from people watching our chopper cam, I understand some of the bomb technicians have gone inside to take X-rays of this device, which is still inside of the building. Now, we've been talking to some of these employees leaving the facility. Some of them are very confused about what's going on here. Some of them are telling us they weren't evacuated. Others telling us they were. But they all know that this package did in fact have Maxine Waters name on it. One telling us that she believes that the package had very similar markings and ID stuff on it, just like the other packages that were found throughout the day. Now, this would be the second package found today addressed to Maxine Waters. This would be, if it's confirmed that it is some sort of explosive device, this would be I believe the seventh bomb. So right now, LAPD's bomb tech's on scene here investigating. Again, a second package addressed to Maxine Waters here in South LA. We will send it back to you guys."
