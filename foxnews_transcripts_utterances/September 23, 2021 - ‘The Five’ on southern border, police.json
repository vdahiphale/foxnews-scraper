If the Biden White House is willing to change a policy like this and put border patrol agents in even more detrimental situations and set them up to fail more than they were previously, based on a lie, what else are they capable of doing? You know, this was an emotional decision that was driven by hysteria and false narratives on Twitter. That's what happened. And Democrats are constantly turning the good guys, in this case, border patrol, they've done it with the police, into bad guys to satisfy this emotional political agenda that they have. And it's very obvious to see where they're going because they need a distraction from this real crisis, catastrophe. Right? Al Sharpton was at the border today.

And it was named after four- year-old LeGend Taliferro who was killed by a stray bullet while he's sleeping in his bed. And his mother spoke at the White House to talk about how his murder had gone unsolved. So, when you have a rise in murders, you also have a rise in injustice after of course the murder because that needs police resources to track these criminals down, to prosecute them and to find them. They found the suspect who they believe killed him. But in Cleveland for example, there was a police officer working on Operation LeGend and he was killed as a result of trying to track down two teenagers who were involved in a shooting. And when you see people like Joy Reid who have complained about Gabby Petito and people wanting to know what happened with her and her murder, and saying it's an issue of missing white woman syndrome. Well, last year when crime and murders were going up in the community where she was saying the police should be defunded, she was ignoring the fact that mothers were dealing with their 4-year-old children who were not white getting shot in their beds. And so, you know, their priorities are very clear when it comes to what they say they care about and the actions that they actually take.",

If the Biden White House is willing to change a policy like this and put border patrol agents in even more detrimental situations and set them up to fail more than they were previously, based on a lie, what else are they capable of doing? You know, this was an emotional decision that was driven by hysteria and false narratives on Twitter. That's what happened. And Democrats are constantly turning the good guys, in this case, border patrol, they've done it with the police, into bad guys to satisfy this emotional political agenda that they have. And it's very obvious to see where they're going because they need a distraction from this real crisis, catastrophe. Right? Al Sharpton was at the border today.

So, the question is maybe the goal is not to reduce homicides. Maybe there's a different goal, Dana. And follow me here. Because if all these leaders in these cities are Democrats, why aren't they talking about keeping mothers and fathers together? Why aren't they fixing schools? Why aren't they fighting to keep the jobs from being sent overseas? They're not doing any of that. Instead, what are they're doing? They're making people dependent on government. They're dividing us by race. And through these perverse incentives and all this cash they're handing out, they're keeping everybody on the doll, right? And so, they want more.

They announced this big initiative. They're going to track illegal guns. The Trump administration did Operation LeGend. And it was named after four- year-old LeGend Taliferro who was killed by a stray bullet while he's sleeping in his bed. And his mother spoke at the White House to talk about how his murder had gone unsolved. So, when you have a rise in murders, you also have a rise in injustice after of course the murder because that needs police resources to track these criminals down, to prosecute them and to find them. They found the suspect who they believe killed him. But in Cleveland for example, there was a police officer working on Operation LeGend and he was killed as a result of trying to track down two teenagers who were involved in a shooting. And when you see people like Joy Reid who have complained about Gabby Petito and people wanting to know what happened with her and her murder, and saying it's an issue of missing white woman syndrome. Well, last year when crime and murders were going up in the community where she was saying the police should be defunded, she was ignoring the fact that mothers were dealing with their 4-year-old children who were not white getting shot in their beds. And so, you know, their priorities are very clear when it comes to what they say they care about and the actions that they actually take."

Not only that, if you look back at that time, I was on Capitol Hill, and I thought, wait, where are the women's groups? Why aren't they sticking up for her? I don't understand. And it was so eye-opening as to what they were all really about. And they continue to play sort of dirty tricks as we're seeing in this whole indictment of Michael Sussman. But -- and I trace it all back to sort of that whole moment, that decision to trash Monica Lewinsky. She's never been allowed even to make a living. This show that she's doing is like one of the first paying jobs, regular job that she's been able to get. They completely ruined her life. And for what?

And even Rose McGowan like, last week was saying she's still getting threatened innuendo about what she did with Weinstein and I don't know. Bill Clinton's right-hand man just came out and said oh, yes, Bubba was at Pedophile Island with Epstein, and no one even blinked an eye. So, MeToo is over. If she had said that in the high of MeToo, Joy might had some trouble. But now, it's coming full circle. You can trash Lewinsky now. It's fair game. But I agree.
