      "sentences": "Apparently, no matter what befalls the Big Apple, NYC remains the media capital of the world. It's weird. It's like declaring Afghanistan the best place to open a gay-friendly bed in breakfast. I've tried. Sure, in New York City, you could be pushed in front of a subway train by a guy wearing nothing but a smile and a hospital bracelet. But really, the Broadway shows are to die for. Nothing makes you forget about your grandma getting mugged for her false teeth than a matinee showing of Hello, Dolly! Have you tried our New York famous bagels? Try a local deli. Just follow the police chalk outlines on the sidewalk. And be sure to step over the body is to get to it. The good news is every homicide comes with a free pickle and a bag of chips. So, I want to get out in New York, but I have to convince more than my wife. You know, there's my mistress and her kids. Three separate states. But also I have to convince Fox. How do I do that without threatening to go public with those pictures of Steve Doocy like you've never seen him before? They are disgusting. We can only show you the upper half. We know that the bosses are watching this show right now. That's because people haven't seen a hit this big since the last video of Hunter Biden puffing on his crack pipe. Thoughts and prayers. So, maybe I should compare and contrast both cities. Today, we went all over Nashville and looked at what makes a good city? Real estate, civility, cleanliness of the massage parlors. They love -- they love their massage parlors. So does Brian Kilmeade. I kid, you thinks a happy ending is when someone makes it to the end of one of his books. So, here goes the comparisons. First, let's check out Nashville's food. How great is this look? I love the barbecue here. It's so good. It has PETA asking for seconds. Now, let's show New York City. Yes. That is a rat enjoying a slice of pizza. Yes. When we -- when we get a pizza with everything on it, we mean it. So, how about fashion all over Nashville? Great, great looks. Hats, boots. Now, may not be your cup of tea. But who doesn't want to see Tyrus in Chaps and a Polo Tie? Yes. Yes, we do -- we do love our cowboys except for Kat. She thinks high noon, it means her lunchtime bong hits.",

Politicians keep saying we're all in this together. But then they're the only ones that don't have to follow the lockdown rules. I don't think it's right to say the word \"we\" when it doesn't include everyone. It reminds me back when they killed Osama bin Laden. People kept coming up to me in Times Square saying we got Bin Laden. We got Bin Laden. And I'm like, honestly, guys, I had nothing to do with any of that. I found out later, I was not on SEAL Team Six. In fact, I don't think I would meet any of their requirements. Unless they're looking for a slow runner that pees when he's afraid. I think the only thing I'll miss after COVID is finally behind us is going into a business and seeing a note that tells me they clean something that I've assumed my entire life they'd always clean. I don't think I'm going back to that diner. They brag about washing forks. Mental, mental illnesses come to the forefront during the lockdowns. A friend confide to a buddy of myself that he was feeling kind of depressed. So, my, my buddy blurted out, why don't you just try to be happier? And I said that's pretty bad. You just told the person with mental illness uses brain to not have mental illness. That was the whole problem area to start. That's like telling a person with Schizophrenia why you just try to see the people that are there? That's not fair. That's the thing they're the worst at. I don't even like it when they call them paranoid schizophrenics because if you don't know if the guy behind you is real. I say you've earned the right to be paranoid. I've cheered myself up recently. I, I know it's not ethical, but I hooked up an electric motor to my peloton. My physical health not improving, but my mental health is doing great. Now, that I beat all those exercise nerds while I'm eating a sandwich. Yes, the things have been going rough these past 18 months or so. It was March 16th, 2020. And they said don't leave your place unless it's an emergency. That afternoon I saw a mouse so I, I purchased some glue traps. I like to spend the next couple of minutes explaining why those are a terrible idea. Because here's what will happen when they work. A mouse will walk over the glue trap and become permanently stuck, then that's it. There's not even any poison on that glue trap, which to me seems like a glaring oversight by the manufacturer. Now, you're left with a situation where a mouse is permanently stuck to cardboard in your kitchen. And he's alive. That creates its own dilemma. Now, I have to decide whether or not I'm going to execute that mouse like some sort of young would-be serial killer or do I have to start feeding that guy? So, I've been feeding them and it's stunning turn of events, I'm feeding the mouse I was just trying to kill. I've been giving him mostly simple sugars so he'll get diabetes sooner or later.

Nothing makes you forget about your grandma getting mugged for her false teeth than a matinee showing of Hello, Dolly! Have you tried our New York famous bagels? Try a local deli. Just follow the police chalk outlines on the sidewalk. And be sure to step over the body is to get to it. The good news is every homicide comes with a free pickle and a bag of chips. So, I want to get out in New York, but I have to convince more than my wife. You know, there's my mistress and her kids. Three separate states. But also I have to convince Fox. How do I do that without threatening to go public with those pictures of Steve Doocy like you've never seen him before? They are disgusting. We can only show you the upper half. We know that the bosses are watching this show right now. That's because people haven't seen a hit this big since the last video of Hunter Biden puffing on his crack pipe. Thoughts and prayers. So, maybe I should compare and contrast both cities. Today, we went all over Nashville and looked at what makes a good city? Real estate, civility, cleanliness of the massage parlors. They love -- they love their massage parlors. So does Brian Kilmeade. I kid, you thinks a happy ending is when someone makes it to the end of one of his books. So, here goes the comparisons. First, let's check out Nashville's food. How great is this look? I love the barbecue here. It's so good. It has PETA asking for seconds. Now, let's show New York City. Yes. That is a rat enjoying a slice of pizza. Yes. When we -- when we get a pizza with everything on it, we mean it. So, how about fashion all over Nashville? Great, great looks. Hats, boots.

A 33-year-old man, woman, aren't they all? Allegedly made to bomb threats to her boyfriend's work so she could spend more time with him. It's a little strange and concerning that it took more than one. It's like they had, they had a bomb threat. No, we'll wait for the second one. Puritan Medical Products actually had to close because of the threats. Cops were able to trace the call so the woman who admitted to making them but said she didn't have any bombs. Turns out she was all talk. Just like a woman. Am I right? Is something -- that's something is sexist would say? Not me. She was charged with felony terrorizing and lying. We actually have her on the show. We go to her for comment. Why did you do it?"

I'm traveling alone for like the first time in a while without my husband, and I used to pride myself on being like a strong, independent woman. But that's just because I didn't know any better. It's way better this way. Today, I had to make my own coffee. Before you say that's not hard. I did it wrong. I did it wrong. I'd wait very, very hot, brown-ish water. And I thought that I didn't drink at all because I was like, OK, that's to get all the caffeine. So, yes, I understand, you know, when they work, they can't pay attention to you."

No, but I'm looking at this gal and I'm going, OK, anybody that wants her man so bad that she's going to send in a bomb threat, I would go home and see what's waiting. I mean, this is going to count, this is going to count when you get home, right?"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

He finally gets in his car, I just got to get to work. And then, and then his boy calls him and says, someone just called in a bomb threat. He's going, I know who it is. Then he's got to go home. Then walk in the door and she was like, now we can spend more time together. And as he plots killing her, and trying to find a way to get rid of the body, like how do I get rid of this woman, and still make it to work and still be convenient? So, they tried to leave again, because he decided not to killer. He escapes out the back. He's driving and what does she do? She calls in another bomb threat. So, he's got to home again. This is the tragic story of when the only way out is murder. You can't, so you got to go to work. So, I've heard."

But frankly, I'm hung over from my first night in Nashville, and it's a miracle that I've made it this far. But one of the best things about this show is discovering great new young talent and watching them take off. But then there's this guy, please welcome comedian Joe Machi."

      "speaker": "JOE MACHI, COMEDIAN",
      "utterance": "Hey, everybody. Wow! Wow! It is great. I'm sorry? It is great to be here with all the bachelorettes. Hey, it is weird times we're living in now, gang. Politicians keep saying we're all in this together. But then they're the only ones that don't have to follow the lockdown rules. I don't think it's right to say the word \"we\" when it doesn't include everyone. It reminds me back when they killed Osama bin Laden. People kept coming up to me in Times Square saying we got Bin Laden. We got Bin Laden. And I'm like, honestly, guys, I had nothing to do with any of that. I found out later, I was not on SEAL Team Six. In fact, I don't think I would meet any of their requirements. Unless they're looking for a slow runner that pees when he's afraid. I think the only thing I'll miss after COVID is finally behind us is going into a business and seeing a note that tells me they clean something that I've assumed my entire life they'd always clean. I don't think I'm going back to that diner. They brag about washing forks. Mental, mental illnesses come to the forefront during the lockdowns. A friend confide to a buddy of myself that he was feeling kind of depressed. So, my, my buddy blurted out, why don't you just try to be happier? And I said that's pretty bad. You just told the person with mental illness uses brain to not have mental illness. That was the whole problem area to start. That's like telling a person with Schizophrenia why you just try to see the people that are there? That's not fair. That's the thing they're the worst at. I don't even like it when they call them paranoid schizophrenics because if you don't know if the guy behind you is real. I say you've earned the right to be paranoid. I've cheered myself up recently. I, I know it's not ethical, but I hooked up an electric motor to my peloton. My physical health not improving, but my mental health is doing great. Now, that I beat all those exercise nerds while I'm eating a sandwich. Yes, the things have been going rough these past 18 months or so. It was March 16th, 2020. And they said don't leave your place unless it's an emergency. That afternoon I saw a mouse so I, I purchased some glue traps. I like to spend the next couple of minutes explaining why those are a terrible idea. Because here's what will happen when they work. A mouse will walk over the glue trap and become permanently stuck, then that's it. There's not even any poison on that glue trap, which to me seems like a glaring oversight by the manufacturer. Now, you're left with a situation where a mouse is permanently stuck to cardboard in your kitchen. And he's alive. That creates its own dilemma. Now, I have to decide whether or not I'm going to execute that mouse like some sort of young would-be serial killer or do I have to start feeding that guy? So, I've been feeding them and it's stunning turn of events, I'm feeding the mouse I was just trying to kill. I've been giving him mostly simple sugars so he'll get diabetes sooner or later. Hey, thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you everybody. Thank you."
