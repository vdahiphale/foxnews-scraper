Of course, unforeseen events can always change things, but right now let's look at Larry Sabato's predictions for the fall elections.

Charles, what do you make of this?

      "sentences": "That is from an analysis of seat-by-seat and state-by-state. I think the number that sort of explains it overall is what is called the generic ballot, where you ask someone if you vote Republican or Democratic in November? And it is at the largest spread, a 10-point Republican lead, in the 68 years of Gallup, which means it's -- at a time when Reagan was still a Democrat. This is a very long time.

A wave election is like Johnson in '64. Like Reagan in '80, Gingrich in the mid-'90s, and now -- curiously, every 15 years or so. And if that number holds, that generic spread of 10, then you get this kind of wave. I think you do get the House clearly will fall to the Republicans and the Senate will be close. I think Sabato is probably right. The Republicans have to pull an inside straight in order to get control. They'll probably only have a flush, and I'd say they will end up minus one.",

What we just heard from Larry Sabato is he thinks it's turned out to be -- as the summer evolved -- an anti-Democratic year. I think, as I look forward, I think -- over the same data that Larry, that he's looking at, I think it's become anti-Obama year. I think Obama has become the repository of all the anger at government and at taxes and the failure to get the economy going. So now I think Republicans are saying, you know what? It's going to be a wave year for us. But I just think wait a second, it's just Labor Day. And so the campaign may yet turn. When you think about how could it turn to benefit Democrats, two things stand out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One is the Democrats could make the case that the Republicans don't have any great ideas for what they will do if they take over, except look back. And two, what Susan Estrich said in the package, which was a number of the events of the summer have been about intramural feuds among Republicans that resulted in some candidates that could be painted by Democrats as extremists. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

In fact, I think it's been clear for a long time it's been anti-Democratic, anti-big government for a long time. And I think you can trace the roots of this back to the stimulus plan. When the Obama administration decided to pursue a stimulus plan that was largely a giveaway to Democratic interest groups, was not the kind of stimulus plan that many economists, middle of the road economists were predicting, and did so without bringing Republicans on board so Republicans had some ownership of the economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They didn't do this.

And you've got Democrats defending a left-leaning president in a country that's center-right country.",

But it was ignored. And after it happened, and Democrats shoved the health care proposal down the throats of the Congress and the people even though it was unpopular, even though the Brown election of Massachusetts largely hinged on that and was a message about it. It was a demonstration of we have an ideology; we won the election in '08; we're going to do it and we don't care. And that I think is what stokes the anger of the electorate and the energy of Republicans, so in the context of a bad economy and with the anger and the energy, it looks like a wave. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This is not about interim, temporary agreements like Oslo was. That was a disaster. It ends up with Israeli concessions and the Palestinians, as happened a decade ago, starting a war if the concessions weren't enough. This is about final status, end of the conflict.

Israel will give concessions on Jerusalem, if the Palestinians will give a concession on the idea of the right of return. That has to be what the negotiations are about: the large concessions.

The key for me so far has been to watch the idea that you just heard from Secretary of State Clinton that this is a one-year deal, that there is a time limit. There is a clear framework there.

      "utterance": "OK, more and more information coming in about the likely outcome of November's elections. Of course, unforeseen events can always change things, but right now let's look at Larry Sabato's predictions for the fall elections. He says that -- or predicts, rather -- a net gain of 47 seats for the Republicans in the House, which would give them a majority, and eight to nine in the Senate, putting one seat short of taking over both Houses of congress. Now, let's bring in the panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for The Weekly Standard, Juan Williams, news analyst for National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles, what do you make of this? This is the second report we had this week to suggest pretty big gains, significant gains for Republican in Congress."

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "That is from an analysis of seat-by-seat and state-by-state. I think the number that sort of explains it overall is what is called the generic ballot, where you ask someone if you vote Republican or Democratic in November? And it is at the largest spread, a 10-point Republican lead, in the 68 years of Gallup, which means it's -- at a time when Reagan was still a Democrat. This is a very long time. This is totally unprecedented. And that portends a wave election. A wave election is like Johnson in '64. Like Reagan in '80, Gingrich in the mid-'90s, and now -- curiously, every 15 years or so. And if that number holds, that generic spread of 10, then you get this kind of wave. I think you do get the House clearly will fall to the Republicans and the Senate will be close. I think Sabato is probably right. The Republicans have to pull an inside straight in order to get control. They'll probably only have a flush, and I'd say they will end up minus one."

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, NEWS ANALYST, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we have come to the end of the summer. I think Labor Day awaits us and we can now draw some conclusions. First of all, everyone was saying going in the summer this was an anti-incumbent year. What we just heard from Larry Sabato is he thinks it's turned out to be -- as the summer evolved -- an anti-Democratic year. I think, as I look forward, I think -- over the same data that Larry, that he's looking at, I think it's become anti-Obama year. I think Obama has become the repository of all the anger at government and at taxes and the failure to get the economy going. So now I think Republicans are saying, you know what? It's going to be a wave year for us. But I just think wait a second, it's just Labor Day. And so the campaign may yet turn. When you think about how could it turn to benefit Democrats, two things stand out. One is the Democrats could make the case that the Republicans don't have any great ideas for what they will do if they take over, except look back. And two, what Susan Estrich said in the package, which was a number of the events of the summer have been about intramural feuds among Republicans that resulted in some candidates that could be painted by Democrats as extremists."

    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD",
      "utterance": "Nothing. Juan, that was a valiant effort. Those were two good things that I think Democrats -- It doesn't -- it doesn't work. Not all of us -- I just want to correct one thing -- not all of us had been saying that this was largely an anti-incumbent mood before the summer. In fact, I think it's been clear for a long time it's been anti-Democratic, anti-big government for a long time. And I think you can trace the roots of this back to the stimulus plan. When the Obama administration decided to pursue a stimulus plan that was largely a giveaway to Democratic interest groups, was not the kind of stimulus plan that many economists, middle of the road economists were predicting, and did so without bringing Republicans on board so Republicans had some ownership of the economy. They didn't do this. That was the beginning of what we've seen as a progression of big government steps. And so I think now, looking at November, we have an election that's largely about the size and scope of government. And you've got Democrats defending a left-leaning president in a country that's center-right country."

    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "But I'm not sure it's just Obama, because he's not on the ballot. I think it's about Democrats. Democrats -- Pelosi and Reid are not very well-liked. The House, the Senate are held in low regard in any of the polls. The fact, the way it acted, it's not just that we have a bad economy. That obviously is a framework and context. It's not just that they spent all the money on the stimulus and it hasn't helped. I think it's the kind of arrogance and contempt that was shown by the Democrats. Look, when you had the election in Massachusetts where a Republican wins a Senate seat held by the Kennedys since 1952, it means something. But it was ignored. And after it happened, and Democrats shoved the health care proposal down the throats of the Congress and the people even though it was unpopular, even though the Brown election of Massachusetts largely hinged on that and was a message about it. It was a demonstration of we have an ideology; we won the election in '08; we're going to do it and we don't care. And that I think is what stokes the anger of the electorate and the energy of Republicans, so in the context of a bad economy and with the anger and the energy, it looks like a wave."

His health care plan failed. So President Obama is going to have to defend this again and again and again and he is going to have to answer for an economy that's continuing to teeter on a non-recovery. So I think those two things combined, he may be able to maneuver to get to the point he can make that argument, but I think it will be tough."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think for the president, it's important. He has wanted to from the beginning, but he stumbled for the first year-and-a-half. But I think the most important element here is you have an Israeli leader who is said to be a right wing, but leads a national coalition -- left and right and center coalition -- who wants a final settlement. That is what is remarkable. And who can deliver. It's usually only a Nixon in who ends up in China, a Begin who gives you a deal with Egypt and who wants to. That's what's new. And I'm encouraged by the fact that the administration structured the talks in the right way. This is not about interim, temporary agreements like Oslo was. That was a disaster. It ends up with Israeli concessions and the Palestinians, as happened a decade ago, starting a war if the concessions weren't enough. This is about final status, end of the conflict. It was said that, Mitchell said today it's about ending the conflict. No demands after that, which is what the Israelis need and want. It's also not about a partial agreement -- Jerusalem here, settlements here, no. It's about everything in a framework, meaning, Israelis will make huge concessions on territory in return for, if the Palestinian will give concessions on security. Israel will give concessions on Jerusalem, if the Palestinians will give a concession on the idea of the right of return."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "That has to be what the negotiations are about",
      "utterance": "the large concessions. Once you have the framework, and it happened in the Israeli-Egyptian negotiation, you had a framework. Afterwards you worked out language of a treaty. If that is the objective, at least the idea of this is right. Whether it will happen, I'm not sure. The Palestinian leadership appears unwilling for a final settlement and that, I think, in the end is the stumbling block."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANGLE",
      "utterance": "What do you think, Juan? The administration is taking this in a deliberate fashion -- getting them together, having them meet separately with the president, meet together. Not pushing a lot in public, but trying to get people to sit down. And it seemed reasonably cordial on the first day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a lot of that is PR, window dressing. I think we're accustomed to that. The question is in my mind -- the big question is whether or not you have Prime Minister Netanyahu actually determined that he is going to engage in settlement. Does he have the will in his heart or is he putting on a good face to maintain relationship with the United States, given that the administration has been very clear they expect Israel to step up to the plate given U.S. involvement in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan. The key for me so far has been to watch the idea that you just heard from Secretary of State Clinton that this is a one-year deal, that there is a time limit. There is a clear framework there. But that this goes beyond simple declaration of principles is what George Mitchell, the special envoy, said today. It goes beyond the principles to the idea that here is exactly what we're trying to accomplish and that's why they detailed the supposed framework. We haven't seen the framework, but they say there's a framework that lists what Charles was talking about, settling all these issues, getting violence off the table, putting everything in place. That's what's different here. Mitchell said today when you look back at Annapolis and these other recent efforts, the big problem has been time ran out. And in this case, because President Obama has done it from the very beginning of his time in office, potentially time is not going to be an issue."
