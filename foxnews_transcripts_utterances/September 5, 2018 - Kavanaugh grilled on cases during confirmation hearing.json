I want to move on to some examples of real-world impacts on real people. And taking that as a factor as you've articulated it in the decisions that you've made. I want to talk about Jane Doe in Garza v. Hargan. As you know, she was a 17-year-old unaccompanied minor who came across this border, having escaped serious threatening, horrific physical violence in her family, in her homelands. She braved horrific threats of rape and sexual exploitation as she crossed the border. She was eight weeks pregnant. Under Texas law, she received an order that entitled her to an abortion, and she also went through mandatory counseling, as required by Texas law. She was eligible for an abortion under that law. The Trump administration blocked her. The Office of Refugee Resettlement forced her to go to a crisis pregnancy center, where she was subjected to medically unnecessary procedures. She was punished by her continued request to terminate her pregnancy, by being isolated from the rest of the residents. She was also forced to notify her parents, which Texas law did not require. And the -- the pregnancy, which was eight weeks, was four weeks further when you participated on a panel that upheld the Trump administration in blocking her efforts to terminate her pregnancy. The decision of that panel was overruled by a full court of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It reversed that panel, and the decision and opinion in that case commented, quote, \"The flat barrier that the government has interposed to her knowing and informed decision to end the pregnancy defies controlling Supreme Court precedent.\" And it said further, \"The government's insistence that it must not even stand back and permit abortion to go forward for someone in some form of custody is freakishly erratic.\" In addition to being erratic, it also threatened her health, because she was unable to terminate her pregnancy for weeks that further increase the risk of the procedure -- one study said 38 percent every week. Her health was threatened. She was going through emotional turmoil. And yet in your dissent, you would have further blocked and delayed that termination of pregnancy. All of what I've said is correct, as to the facts here, correct?",

It's what they believed to be the underlying political belief of that person. So, I say, I thought he answered it fine because he answered it just as the other nominees had done. I really think he was untouchable on substance today. At the beginning when he started quoting Federalist 69, Hamilton, and then this could go through all the cases.

There were some lighter moments, but that was with the more senior members of the committee on the Democratic side. Even Senator Feinstein at the end of her questioning said thank you for being so forthcoming. There was a funny moment when he was asked what he wanted to be remembered for, and he said I want to be remembered as a good dad and he moved on, and Feinstein whispers, and good husband. And there's laughter. And so, it's like, even if these Democrats don't like President Trump, it's hard for them not to like Brett Kavanaugh when he's there answering all of their questions. Interestingly to me, I believe that the Democrats had started to pivot from trying to block his nomination to trying to influence him. And I would point specifically to Senator Whitehouse, the Democrat who said he was concerned about amicus briefs and who -- and these outside groups who are funding them and wasting the court time and this was bad, it could -- basically it was like when you get on the bench, could you check into this?

So I have a solution, they should record these hearings but don't air it live, and then a week later air it but it's we fast-forward through it. So we sit here and we can boil this down. Four days into like 40 minutes to the vote. So we don't have to suffer through this. So, we've already have it like a move. And so we all sit there we just fast -- OK, this is good. And then we skip this part because, frankly, it is interminable. And the protesters, I think they're giving protests a bad name. I'm very, very, pro, pro-protest.

Liberals are going to nominate liberals. And he said, but I'm so sorry that you won't be able to say to your kids, your family, that you got 90-plus votes in support, which is what, for example, Scalia got.

New employment claims recently hit a -- think of that, the unemployment picture in the country is the best has been in 49 years. African-American unemployment, lowest in the history of our country. Asian-American unemployment, lowest in the history of our country. Hispanic-American unemployment, lowest in the history of our country. I mean, I'm just looking at these just point after point. Under my administration, veteran's unemployment reached its lowest in many, many years. The -- let's say almost 3.9 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps just since my election.

It's about open borders. It's about letting people flee into our country. It's about a disaster and crime for our country. So they don't like Donald Trump, and I don't like them because they're very dishonest people. Remember this also about the New York Times, when I won, they were forced to apologize to their subscribers. They wrote a letter of apology.

She seems shocked by it. Then he yelled at the producers about a segment. Then he demanded a cough drop from the floor director, and then he started talking to himself and singing about food. I have described my afternoon. But the thing is because somebody like Woodward and the New York Times take these things literal and not in context about how a person is, how a boss is, they're completely clueless.

I want to move on to some examples of real-world impacts on real people. And taking that as a factor as you've articulated it in the decisions that you've made. I want to talk about Jane Doe in Garza v. Hargan. As you know, she was a 17-year-old unaccompanied minor who came across this border, having escaped serious threatening, horrific physical violence in her family, in her homelands. She braved horrific threats of rape and sexual exploitation as she crossed the border. She was eight weeks pregnant. Under Texas law, she received an order that entitled her to an abortion, and she also went through mandatory counseling, as required by Texas law. She was eligible for an abortion under that law. The Trump administration blocked her. The Office of Refugee Resettlement forced her to go to a crisis pregnancy center, where she was subjected to medically unnecessary procedures. She was punished by her continued request to terminate her pregnancy, by being isolated from the rest of the residents. She was also forced to notify her parents, which Texas law did not require. And the -- the pregnancy, which was eight weeks, was four weeks further when you participated on a panel that upheld the Trump administration in blocking her efforts to terminate her pregnancy. The decision of that panel was overruled by a full court of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It reversed that panel, and the decision and opinion in that case commented, quote, \"The flat barrier that the government has interposed to her knowing and informed decision to end the pregnancy defies controlling Supreme Court precedent.\" And it said further, \"The government's insistence that it must not even stand back and permit abortion to go forward for someone in some form of custody is freakishly erratic.\" In addition to being erratic, it also threatened her health, because she was unable to terminate her pregnancy for weeks that further increase the risk of the procedure -- one study said 38 percent every week. Her health was threatened. She was going through emotional turmoil. And yet in your dissent, you would have further blocked and delayed that termination of pregnancy. All of what I've said is correct, as to the facts here, correct?"
