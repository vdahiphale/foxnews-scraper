Now accused ringleader William Singer saying he helped more than 750 families. And while Hollywood stars Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are getting the headlines, there are a lot more shocking examples of rich and powerful people allegedly involved in this awful scheme.

It's about the parents and the parents using this as a status symbol for themselves, because obviously, they're so desperate.

And I'm sick and tired of being lectured by these hypocritical Hollywood liberals. Look at what they did. They're defrauding universities and bribing people. Their friends are slashing Donald Trump's throat. Their limousines and their jets are smogging up L.A. They're perpetrating rape hoaxes, racial hoaxes, and there's literally dead prostitutes pilling up in the apartments of Democrat donors in West Hollywood. That's Ed Buck. And they have the nerve to turn around and point their fingers at conservative America and say, you guys are bad people. We're the good people. Meanwhile, everything that they say that they believe in, they say they believe in affirmative action, they believe in, you know, minority ownership. They're the ones that took away scholarships from well- qualified minorities. They said that they believe in the rich paying more. They scammed this thing so they'd pay the charity so they could deduct it away from their income. So I don't want to hear any more about income inequality or white privilege or any of this stuff anywhere, because they use all that stuff to leverage the scam to help out their own kid because they didn't value education enough to make this kid study and to make this kid value education."

I don't know. Obviously, better safe than sorry, probably the most obvious thing to say. But my feeling is that -- it's probably human error but not a human's fault, meaning that technology is ahead of our own human behavior and we see that with texting, causing accidents and death, social media leading to mob. Automation, I mean, we look at people terrified of, you know, self- driving cars. And we're seeing little accidents. I think we are -- because technology outpaces us, we're not fully trained to deal with it. And I would say that that -- that's why I say it might be human error but not human fault. The pilots might not just be ready to deal with that kind of technology."

But there are reports of U.S. pilots complaining and reporting problems with this plane. They're similar to what happened with these flights that went down. Now, you have to ask the question about standards of training. Are the pilots in the United States getting the same training on Boeing as the pilots overseas, and that might not be the case. There could be different standards of training that are not being upheld. So we'll just have to wait and see what happens. But I will say, you know, to give President Trump some credit, everyone is like, oh, what does he know about planes. The guy has owned planes his entire life. And, you know, when you own a private plane, you know about the way it functions. So, I think --"

And Steny Hoyer is also not afraid to tell these three freshmen congresswomen, you know, there are more people -- more freshmen members of the Democratic caucus than just you. There're 62 members and, you know, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her justice Democrats who possibly had money funneled from a Super Pac to an LLC, she has been threatening to primary any Democrats who vote with Republicans.

They would - she'd be accused of just being a separate wife, right? And just doing whatever a President Trump wanted her to do, because she doesn't have a brain and can't function on her own. She goes out on her own and proves that she's her own person. She's done all these trips. She's gone overseas. She's capable of talking and speaking and pushing the things that she wants to talk about, and then they still criticize her. So I think it's just petty. There are other things that they could be talking about.

Look what happened here in Tennessee. So these guys just congregating around - snatch a bunch of guns, run out. Well, everybody in the gun store is armed. They chase them outside and they try to make it to the vehicle. And everybody just draws on the vehicle and they can't even pull out of the parking lot. And now they're all charged with theft and probably going to spend some time in jail."

The earliest record of canines being used in combat was in 600 BC. But the United States adopted the practice in 1942 with the War Dog Program, which is awesome, and modern war dogs are trained to sniff out bombs drugs and to track people and attack when necessary. So happy Veterans Day to our canine friends."

This is a great story, because you've heard about the measles outbreak at LAX and all sorts of families were having problems, because children are not inoculated and they're getting horrible diseases. Well, a pair of teens in Pennsylvania went and bought their mom an ice cream cake - a DQ Dairy Queen and that had thanks for vaccinating us mom. They had gone up to pick up their vaccination records from the doctor and realized that their mom had been responsible for years and years - they are anti-vaxxers and they're showing mom how sweet it is to be a responsible parent. So they don't get that horrific measles."
