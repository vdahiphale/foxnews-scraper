He is calling the shots and pushing back aggressively on their unfounded claims that he is part of the cover- up. This is now the third letter from him in the span of one week. Starting with last Friday evening. He revealed, he finally had Robert Mueller's report and would have primary conclusions by that weekend. Then, came a letter Sunday. Declaring Mueller had found no collusion or conspiracy between Russia and any American, President Trump, or anyone associated with his campaign. The president and his allies quickly saw that as exoneration. That second letter from Barr, importantly declare there was buy-in from Rod Rosenstein. Seen potentially as a Trump critic, support from Rosenstein on the conclusion, there was not enough evidence to prove obstruction. Now, comes the third letter, showing again, Barr is in charge but not acting alone. He wrote Mueller is assisting him in justifiable redactions of grand jury information in sensitive intelligence information. It has shown us independence, Barr adding, \"Although the president would have a right to a assert privilege over certain parts of the report, he has stated publicly, he intends to differ to me. And accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review,\" before, of course, it goes public.

In fact, he says it was a summary of Mueller's own bottom line about no collusion. Some critics have wondered how Barr last Friday told the world he had the 400-page report. Then, two days later, bolted down to a four-page letter, saying the president is larger than the clear. What people are missing is that we know through the great reporting of our producer Jay Gibson that back on March 5th, the Justice Department actually snuck Mueller into their building, and he gave Barr and Rosenstein an advance briefing, saying no collusion and not enough evidence on obstruction.

Look, bill Barr has operated at lightning speed. And it's also inconceivable, Martha, that the two-time attorney general of the United States would mischaracterize the conclusions of the Mueller report. And then risk his entire legal career and his credibility forever. Of course, if he was mischaracterizing these conclusions, Mueller or Andrew Weissmann, or Jeannie Rhee, who worked for the Clinton Foundation would be -- would be doing everything they could to discredit that.

There's no effort to cover anything up. If anything, Democrats are trying to cover up the fact that they were wrong. They have to -- they have to say something that conclusions are the president didn't conclude -- didn't collude with Russia. And so, this is a Democratic Party that is in a really disarray with the absence of a narrative about Russia because they lied to the country for 22 months. The greater harm here is not a cover-up, the greater harm is that Adam Schiff gets to continue as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, while the country and the intelligence community, and our foreign partners can't trust somebody who lied for 22 months to the American people."

But the story of America is that the foundational philosophy of the country is inherently good and rooted in human nature and natural law and God's creation. And that's what American philosophy is about. And again it's a job of trying to expand that promise to all Americans. And then there's the view of Eric Holder which that America was founded on racial hierarchy and that all of these ideas of Western civilization are essentially a facade in favor of perpetuating this evil power hierarchy. Well, if you feel that way, you have to rip up American civilization at its roots. I don't think most Americans believe that. I think most Americans do believe that America has been great in the past. There's no point at which America was \"better across the board for everyone\" but there are certainly moments in American history that we can point to. Was American not great when we liberated Europe? Was America not great when Martin Luther King was speaking on the mall in Washington? Was America not great when we were defeating the Soviet Union in the Cold War or when we were creating such prosperity the 80 percent of the world's population was lifted out of abject poverty since 1980?

I was mortified,\" she writes, \"he proceeded to plant a big, slow kiss on the back of my head.\" Now Bill Russo, a spokesman for Joe Biden responded with a statement that reads in part. \"Neither then, nor near in the years since did he or the staff with him at the time have any inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor they do they recall what she describes, but Vice President Biden believes that Ms. Flores has every right to share her own recollection and reflections and that it is a change for the better on our society that she has the opportunity to do so.\" Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor.

He gave a speech earlier that where he was talking about apologizing, but not really apologizing, for the treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings a generation ago when he was chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, and she was horribly treated as she came forward to make her accusations. He came out with a very lame explanation and apology for it, and he got the wrath of feminist activist, liberal Democrats, and others. Now, we have another accusation that fits within a pattern for Joe Biden that we have seen throughout his career of overdoing it with physical contact with women. Strangers, women he meets, women who are there -- there was a teenage girl who was present with her family when her father or relative was being sworn into Congress, we have the story of the deputy defense secretary's wife. We've heard the stories before about women who Joe Biden made feel uncomfortable. Now we have another one. That his campaign, or as you say campaign in waiting doesn't know better than to say, well, we think it's super for her that gals now have a chance to talk about this stuff, but she didn't say anything at the time, so too bad."

They are going to come back with this, Chris. She tweeted after that campaign event, \"Great to be in Nevada with Vice President Biden and Lucy Flores, don't forget to vote -- to vote.\" This is a, I think she passed this along from Eva Longoria, who was also there, on Tuesday, November 4th."

There is really no push to actually stop pedophilia in the Catholic Church, and certainly not from the Catholic from the pope on down, and certainly it doesn't seem that law enforcement or politicians really have the stomach for it."
