Buttigieg leads with 26.9 percent. Sanders is next at 25.1. Elizabeth Warren is third at 18.3. Joe Biden is fourth 15.6 and Amy Klobuchar sits in fifth place. The results coming with an apology from the state Democratic chair after confusion and embarrassment over what they called a coding issue at last night's Iowa caucuses that kept them from reporting results until just about an hour ago and those obviously are not complete. This comes as President Trump puts the finishing touches on his third State of the Union address beginning in three hours, which occurs hours before an expected acquittal tomorrow in his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.

At the same time, I'll tell you something fairly interesting that the Sanders people are right that about the first and second wave, the -- as first and final alignments, which is that Sanders actually did very well in the first alignment and in the final alignment as -- less well, in the final alignment as the conventional wisdom it always been that the liberal -- more liberal candidates were able to get out the vote. And in fact, there is some argument that in the first alignment, Warren might actually be able to almost edge Buttigieg. But what that's a function of it to a great extent is, the more liberal candidates able to get vote out in the sort of college areas and alike, but when it comes to calculating state delegate equivalents, much like when it comes to calculating the Electoral College and the presidential election, the more moderate candidate or one of the more moderate candidates, Buttigieg was able to pull out and appears to be in the lead right now.

And to a certain extent, this story is not going to be as widely covered as it would have been had the data come out yesterday. We're only going to -- we're going to see whether or not Biden continues to be able to raise the kind of money that's going to be required to mount the kind of campaign he wants to mount, and what the implications are going to be in New Hampshire.

Whitmer has said, Democrats should focus on fundamentals people care about, like fixing roads and training people for better jobs.

But the results do tell us that somebody has probably won the raw vote total, Bernie Sanders. But Pete Buttigieg is probably going to come in with the biggest percentage of delegates. And in the past, what the big Iowa prizes momentum. In other words, it doesn't have a lot of delegates to give you, there's only 41 there. But it gives you a boost to go off to the next state.

First of all, only 62 percent of the vote is in. So, it could be misleading. We really need all of the results. That's a lot of the pollsters are saying. We just wait and see what happens. But say, Buttigieg is the winner, where does he go from here? He's probably not going to win New Hampshire. Then, he drops into single digits as we move into the next states. So, where does he go, even if he is the Iowa winner? And then, no one gets momentum really out of this Biden, he may lose New Hampshire, but he's got his super Tuesday Southern firewall, which will give him an opportunity to show that he has a coalition of Democratic voters who support him.

That's at such a reflective thing when people vote. And economy is doing so well. He's taking away anything for Democrats to really run against and run against each other, but they don't have a good theme to connect with voters on this. We're going to help you.

The app's developer said the issue did not impact the underlying caucus data and apologized for the delay in the reporting of the results in the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates and Democratic caucus goers, worry bubbling up today on both sides of the aisle in Washington."

John Roberts is reporting tonight that the president will announce that he is awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh during tonight's State of the Union speech. We also understand that Rush Limbaugh may be in attendance tonight. The radio talk show host, of course, announcing this week that he is fighting advanced lung cancer. That's one of the elements of this speech. What else are we looking for? Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti again, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Susan? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": That's pretty big news to have Rush Limbaugh come. The announcement that he had cancer was just so devastating for tens of millions of people who are his fans and have been following him for decades. And he kind of defined the conservative movement after Ronald Reagan, so he is just a big figure in the conservative movement. So the president will really be reaching a lot of his base by making this announcement so soon after we heard this terrible news about Rush Limbaugh. I think that's --"

      "utterance": "That's right. Not everybody has supported the president, but amongst the conservatives, because we know we have the never-Trump movement, he pretty much stayed on board with him even while he was running and there were under candidates in the race until now. He's been a staunch supporter and a defender of him during this whole impeachment process."

      "utterance": "Mara, the other thing that usually State of the Unions are, are a laundry list of things to do. Last year this speech was structured a little differently. It wove a lot of stories in there. The president I think will use it to tout accomplishments that he sees ahead of this election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO",
      "utterance": "This is a curtain-raiser for his reelection campaign. It is not a rally. He says it's going to be very low-key and it's going to be very long, too. That's a very un-Trumpian recipe. He likes to be really entertaining. But this is a chance, the biggest audience he is going to get all year to tout his accomplishments, to talk about the economy, to talk about black and Hispanic unemployment rates being low, to talk about all the things he has gotten done. I don't think this is a president who has a tremendously long legislative agenda. He'll talk about things he'll do if he gets reelected, maybe middle-class tax cuts, I think he wants to tout his accomplishments. He wants to tell until the positive story of his tenure."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But Matthew, the image here of a president who has been impeached, the trial is not over -- the acquittal likely is going to come tomorrow -- standing in the well of the House with lawmakers, some of them who will be voting on his acquittal or conviction the next day. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": That's right. But I think in the minds of many in Washington and probably the public at large, impeachment is receding fast in the rearview mirror. This is Trump's morning in America moment. The State of the Union is the beginning of a campaign, you're always big campaign speeches to frame the debate. I'm sure you will hear talk about how America will never be a socialist country, the economy booming, Trump acquitted tomorrow. The wind is at his back at precisely the moment he needs it to be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We talk a little bit about the Gallup poll, but that really did open some eyes in Washington, at 49 approval, and Republicans at 53 percent. But if you look at the RCP average, this is across the board, recent polls, approval 45, roughly, and the economy, this is really where all of the polls match up, is kind of touting the success that the administration has had on this front."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "And it's the people who Democrats might want to target most in this upcoming election, the low wage earners, their wages are growing faster than anybody's. And these are people who we always hear the Democrats saying, the booming economy is not reaching these people. Well, it is. It's also reaching minorities. And they are running out of room to target Trump. So he can really tout that tonight in his speech. This can really be a victory lap for him."

      "utterance": "Right, and criminal justice reform. But that wasn't aimed at African-Americans. That was also aimed at suburban women in particular who don't like some of the racially tinged attacks that he has made. That ad was to create a permission structure, just like the ad in the World Series that said you might not like him, you might even hate him, he's not Mr. Nice Guy, I think was the tagline for that ad, but look what he has done for you. You are better off than you were four years ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "Trump has an opportunity to expand his base, and the way to do that is by targeting black and Hispanic men, which I think that ad also helped with."
