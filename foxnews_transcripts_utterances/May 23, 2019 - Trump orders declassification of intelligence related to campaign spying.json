It was an awful crime, but the details are even worse. Both the teenagers were members of MS-13. Both were here illegally. Both could have been kicked out of America long ago, but weren't. A living picture of our failure to enforce our immigration laws. Trace Gallagher has the details on exactly what happened tonight -- Trace.",

Prosecutors say 16-year- old Josue Fuentes-Ponce and 17-year-old Joel Escobar, both suspected of being MS-13 members were so afraid that a 14-year-old girl would rat them out for a recent burglary. They made the girl take off her clothes and attacked her with a machete. Her mutilated body was found this month in a creek bed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But last year, Prince George's County, Maryland had both Fuentes-Ponce and Escobar in custody for attempted murder in a separate case. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or I.C.E. issued an immigration detainer, but because of the county's sanctuary policy, it defied the request. I.C.E. says quote, \"These individuals had demonstrated violent criminal behavior before and because they were released in spite of the lawful detainer, they were afforded an opportunity to take a life.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Authorities from Prince George's County are trying to pass the buck saying they transferred the suspects to a state youth detention center.

Fuentes-Ponce came with a surge of families in 2015. None of this is news to you, Tucker, because you were in El Salvador in 2017, and saw firsthand how dangerous and ruthless MS-13 can be. Last week after being diagnosed with the flu, a 16-year-old migrant died in Border Patrol custody, the case got a lot of media attention and those who want stricter immigration controls wonder if the brutal killing of the 14- year-old will get as much attention.

It could also potentially involve the FISA warrants against Carter Page or what justifications were given to launch the Russia investigation.

I want to bring up another issue that is extremely important to the American people right now. And that is something that that should concern all of us, which is the fact that we're at the brink of a war with Iran. And I can tell you, as a soldier, I've served over 16 years in the Army National Guard. I've deployed twice to the Middle East. I know very well, both the Middle East, as well as the cost of war. And as a Member of Congress on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees for over six years, I know where this path leads us. And I'm concerned, because the American people don't seem to be prepared for how devastating and costly such a war would be. It would undermine our national security, because right now, we have troops that are deployed to Iraq, for example. And right now, they're working with both Iraqi soldiers, as well as the Shia militia on the ground. And their mission is to defeat ISIS, to try to make sure that ISIS doesn't reconstitute itself and re-emerge there in Iraq. If we go to war with Iran, all of that changes, because then the United States, our troops, my brothers and sisters in uniform are fighting against the Shia militia, who knows what the Iraqi military is going to do. Maybe some go with us and fight alongside our troops, may be some fight against us and fight alongside the Shia militia. And so what we're facing is essentially a war that has no front lines, total chaos engulfs the whole region, it is not contained within Iran or Iraq, but would extend to Syria and Lebanon and Israel across the region, setting us up in a situation where in Iraq, we lost over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniform. A war with Iran would take far more American lives. It would cost more civilian lives across the region. It would worsen the refugee crisis with millions of people fleeing into Europe, further destabilizing there. To speak of the fact that this would cost trillions of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayer dollars coming out of our pockets to go and pay for this endless war that begs the question, especially as a soldier, what are we fighting for? What does victory look like? What is the mission?",

They have stated their intent and made their objective very clear. Your question is the most essential one, how does a war with Iran serve the best interest of the American people in the United States? And the fact is, it does not. It better serves the interests of people like Bibi Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia, who are trying to push us into this war with Iran; again, a war that would undermine our national security in the ways that I talked about. It would strengthen terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda. It would carry a heavy human cost and it would cost us, taxpayers, trillions of dollars.

It was an awful crime, but the details are even worse. Both the teenagers were members of MS-13. Both were here illegally. Both could have been kicked out of America long ago, but weren't. A living picture of our failure to enforce our immigration laws. Trace Gallagher has the details on exactly what happened tonight -- Trace."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Tucker, the evidence shows this murder could have been prevented numerous times. Prosecutors say 16-year- old Josue Fuentes-Ponce and 17-year-old Joel Escobar, both suspected of being MS-13 members were so afraid that a 14-year-old girl would rat them out for a recent burglary. They made the girl take off her clothes and attacked her with a machete. Her mutilated body was found this month in a creek bed. But last year, Prince George's County, Maryland had both Fuentes-Ponce and Escobar in custody for attempted murder in a separate case. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or I.C.E. issued an immigration detainer, but because of the county's sanctuary policy, it defied the request. I.C.E. says quote, \"These individuals had demonstrated violent criminal behavior before and because they were released in spite of the lawful detainer, they were afforded an opportunity to take a life.\" Authorities from Prince George's County are trying to pass the buck saying they transferred the suspects to a state youth detention center. Problem is, the 2014 Department of Corrections Policy mandates that county jails notify I.C.E. regarding any transport so that I.C.E. can track down the criminals. Escobar came to the U.S. in 2016 as an unaccompanied minor. Fuentes-Ponce came with a surge of families in 2015. None of this is news to you, Tucker, because you were in El Salvador in 2017, and saw firsthand how dangerous and ruthless MS-13 can be. Last week after being diagnosed with the flu, a 16-year-old migrant died in Border Patrol custody, the case got a lot of media attention and those who want stricter immigration controls wonder if the brutal killing of the 14- year-old will get as much attention. So far, the answer is, \"No.\" Tucker."

It wasn't an act of God or some freak accident. It wasn't even a random crime, the kind that inevitably occurs in a country as big as ours is. No, her death was the product of a deliberate policy. Our leadership class has decided to downplay the threat of MS-13. Why? Because Trump attacked MS-13. Therefore, in the demented zero sum calculation of permanent Washington, MS-13 must be virtuous. The enemy of Donald Trump must be my friend. That's how they think. It all started almost exactly a year ago when the President said this."

They're the deadliest criminal gang in America. And yet, once Trump attack them, the left decided that worrying about MS-13 was a greater threat to our values than the gang itself. Anyone who criticized MS-13 was denounced as racist, if not a tool of Putin. They said as much out loud, including on this show. The traditional Democratic Party, the one that represented blue-collar America would have been baffled by this. Working class people of all colors are always the biggest victims of crime, if you want to protect them, don't side with criminals. That was something that Democrats including the young Joe Biden once understood intuitively, but no longer. Today, criticizing MS-13 would mean asking questions about the party's orthodoxy on immigration. It would expose Nancy Pelosi's absurd lie that every single immigrant is impressive and must be allowed to stay in the country, no questions asked. Nobody in the left wants to talk about any of this.

That kind of propaganda where powerful people are lying right to your face again and again and again, it happens a lot. And it'll be pretty funny, actually, if the stakes were lower, but they're not low, they're high. The left defends MS-13 because they can't acknowledge a downside to the open borders they've given us. Once we start talking about all of this, who knows where it might end. So instead, they lecture us about dignity while high school kids get murdered. And for them, that's a small price to pay. Andrew Arthur is a Maryland resident.

I mean, we've had an MS-13 problem in these states for the last number of years ever since we saw a huge influx of unaccompanied alien children, if you would, that's anybody under the age of 18 coming in to the United States. At the end of the Bush administration, MS-13 as a force was almost spent in the United States, which was good for the United States, good for El Salvador because it deprived the gang of money that they used to carry out their heinous acts down there. But as we've seen this flood of unaccompanied alien children, we started to see the gang become more prevalent. In fact, there was a horrible case -- I was one of the few people to write about it in Kensington, Maryland, twelve miles from the White House, in which an under-aged sex trafficked prostitute was beaten with a baseball bat more than 20 times simply because she did not provide -- she didn't do her job well enough for the gang. But none of this actually makes any difference to the people who are in charge of the law in the state of Maryland. Governor Larry Hogan. I think would probably, you know, love to take action. But unfortunately, law in the State of Maryland is in the hands of Brian Frosh, a Democrat Attorney General."

But most of these crimes take place in immigrant communities. And when released from jail as these two individuals were -- Escobar and Fuentes-Ponce, they go back to those communities and they commit even more crimes, which is exactly what happened here. They were arrested for attempted murder and gang-related activities. Escobar got 10 months in juvenile facility for conspiracy to commit murder, and then he was released. We don't even know what happened to Fuentes- Ponce, who, by the way, is actually in the United States illegally. He is under a final order of removal. The family that he came to the United States with never showed up for court. So neither of these gentlemen should have been in the United States to commit any crime. They shouldn't have been in the United States to begin with, but they certainly shouldn't have been in the United States to commit any crime. Certainly, not one as heinous as this, and unfortunately, the machete is the weapon of choice of MS-13."

The settlement will not effect is ongoing criminal case. He is charged with rape and other offenses in New York State. A trial is scheduled for September. Obviously, we will follow the story as it continues to unfold. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has many concerns. She wants to preserve the dignity of MS-13 gang members.

They were let down by Bob Mueller, who was the nearest thing to Jesus to walk on the face of this Earth for the Democrats until he actually issued his report. They've been let down by judges and now they're putting their faith in the big guy himself. And when she says, she wants an intervention, basically she wants God to send Moses back down with a brand new tablet on which the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is inscribed, and that Moses will then persuade everybody else that it's time for Trump to be deposed from office. And it's a strange world because the ostentatious religiosity of Mrs. Pelosi is at odds with the sheer insanity of what her party is proposing. The party has actually changed a lot, Tucker in the last couple of election cycles. You know, the way it used to be. People like John Kerry would twist themselves like a pretzel to explain how personally-passionately, passionately-personally opposed to abortion they were, but that they would never let their deeply held personal Catholic faith interfere with their legislative agenda. There's no pretense of that now. She leads a party that's in favor of fourth trimester abortion, pregnant men, MS-13 on every corner, a sanctuary nation with lawyers for any six billion people around the planet who want to come here and claim the right to live here. And I think she is doing this in a sense to portray Trump is the crazy one, whereas it's their agenda that is crazy."

She just says, \"Today, at the request and recommendation of the Attorney General, President Trump directed the Intelligence Community to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General's investigation into surveillance activities during the 2016 election.\" \"The Attorney General has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation, in accordance with long established standards for handling classified information. This action will ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election and restore confidence in our public institutions.\" Again, this is a two-page memo. I'm looking at it right now, \"Memorandum for the Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, other Cabinet officials\" coming from President Donald Trump, a statement coming from Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declassifying that information on the Intelligence-related spying into that 2016 campaign.

That file could expose exactly how state prosecutors wound up dropping the case, despite substantial may be overwhelming evidence that the hate crime was in fact, a hate hoax. Robby Soave is associate editor of \"Reason.\" He is one of the leading experts on hate hoaxes. He is the author of the book, \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump,\" and he joins us tonight. Robby, thanks a lot for coming on.

She has already said that. So the only explanation -- the only, you know, explanation for her actions that would be okay would be that the case actually had holes in it. And we could learn that in these unsealed records. But she said that's not what we're going to find. She said, we're going to find the case was very strong. And she decided not to bring it to justice, not to at least get him to plead guilty in exchange for whatever, you know, mercy we were going to show him which would have been perfectly fine. But you had to get him to plead guilty and she opted not to do that. Why? Sympathy to him, maybe not wanting to push back on this narrative about hate crimes, that they're off the charts, something like that."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    {
      "speaker": "SOAVE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, the Democrats are holding hearings on this subject. I actually testified at one last week before a House Subcommittee on hate crimes. And I was, you know, the only -- even though the other witnesses there very much conceded that the statistics do not show that we have this massive increase in hate crimes, they were still there to call for the government to do more about this. And then Congress is taking this issue very seriously, the idea that there is some Trump connected rise in hate crimes across the country. And of course, the Smollett case was briefly Exhibit A in that argument. So it's pretty important to know that truth about this specific incident because it was held up as an example of a broader narrative that must be true. So we deserve to know the truth if that's what it stood for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I mean, if you judge a crime by a conviction -- and a conviction, that's when you know, a crime occurred is someone is convicted of it -- if that's how you measure hate crimes, we have virtually no hate crimes in America. So you pointed out that the stats don't show what they claim they show that this epidemic is not measured. What was the response when you said that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOAVE",
      "utterance": "Right, actually, a lot of people conceived that. Even the people I'm sitting next to at this congressional hearing are saying, \"Well, yes, you're kind of right. Actually, the statistics just kind of fluctuate from year to year and we don't really -- they don't really show us anything.\" But the government still needs to do something about this, right? Because there's never a committee hearing where the conclusion is the government doesn't actually need to do anything. The conclusion is always, you know, people will die unless we have a whole new department or something to take care of this. Obviously, hate crimes are bad when they do occur. But it's just, you have to be very careful about scaring people into thinking that unless there's immediate action, there's going to be things like what happened to Jussie Smollett happening on every street across America, unless we act decisively now."

      "utterance": "In April of last year, the United States launched a wave of missile strikes against Bashar Assad's government in Syria. It was the second time in two years. The justification for both attacks was an alleged aerial chemical weapons attack on anti-Assad rebels in Duma, Syria. At the time that happened, this program was pretty much the only show on mainstream television to show any skepticism about the official narrative of the attack."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Before we go to war, are we sure all of this is real? Do we really know that Assad was behind the gas attack? It's not a defensive Assad, but it's an obvious question. How could we know that conclusively so soon after the attack happened? We didn't have any Americans on the ground. And why would Assad do that given the certainty it would hurt his own interests?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We were attacked -- aggressively attacked for saying that. Now, a leaked document shows there was good reason to be skeptical. The OPCW is the world's top chemical weapons watchdog. In a leaked internal document, an investigator with that organization argued that the evidence from Duma does not indicate an aerial attack. Instead, he argued, the chemical weapons were manually placed on the ground. That's so just the attack may not have been a government operation after all. If he is right, United States went to the brink of war based on fraudulent information, and not for the first time. Tulsi Gabbard is a Democratic Member of Congress from Hawaii, the first female combat veteran ever to run for President and she joins us tonight."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, this is a significant and very important development we've got to take seriously. As you mentioned, you know, I initially expressed some skepticism around that whole situation, which is why I am getting more information, reaching out to the UN, reaching out to the OPCW and getting answers. And when I get those answers, I look forward to coming back and sharing them with you and with your viewers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So we're hearing again, even this week that we may need to bomb Syria yet again, because there may be yet another chemical weapons attacks. That would be three years in a row, always in the spring and always within the context of some of some other international question. I'm beginning to suspect that we're being played here. Has that occurred to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Once again, I mean, this is why doing our due diligence, and checking very carefully the evidence is so important. I want to bring up another issue that is extremely important to the American people right now. And that is something that that should concern all of us, which is the fact that we're at the brink of a war with Iran. And I can tell you, as a soldier, I've served over 16 years in the Army National Guard. I've deployed twice to the Middle East. I know very well, both the Middle East, as well as the cost of war. And as a Member of Congress on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees for over six years, I know where this path leads us. And I'm concerned, because the American people don't seem to be prepared for how devastating and costly such a war would be. It would undermine our national security, because right now, we have troops that are deployed to Iraq, for example. And right now, they're working with both Iraqi soldiers, as well as the Shia militia on the ground. And their mission is to defeat ISIS, to try to make sure that ISIS doesn't reconstitute itself and re-emerge there in Iraq. If we go to war with Iran, all of that changes, because then the United States, our troops, my brothers and sisters in uniform are fighting against the Shia militia, who knows what the Iraqi military is going to do. Maybe some go with us and fight alongside our troops, may be some fight against us and fight alongside the Shia militia. And so what we're facing is essentially a war that has no front lines, total chaos engulfs the whole region, it is not contained within Iran or Iraq, but would extend to Syria and Lebanon and Israel across the region, setting us up in a situation where in Iraq, we lost over 4,000 of my brothers and sisters in uniform. A war with Iran would take far more American lives. It would cost more civilian lives across the region. It would worsen the refugee crisis with millions of people fleeing into Europe, further destabilizing there. To speak of the fact that this would cost trillions of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayer dollars coming out of our pockets to go and pay for this endless war that begs the question, especially as a soldier, what are we fighting for? What does victory look like? What is the mission?"

      "utterance": "That is the question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So as far as I can tell us, this is being pushed primarily by one man, the National Security adviser, John Bolton. The President said repeatedly he is not interested in fighting war with Iran, Bolton clearly is. So how does the United States, if this happens, how do we benefit from this? Is there an upside that you --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "We don't. We don't and that's the bottom line. That's what's so concerning is even as people in the administration say, \"Hey, look, we don't want to go to war against Iran.\" You look at people like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo and others within the administration who have talked about waging regime change war against Iran for a very long time. They have stated their intent and made their objective very clear. Your question is the most essential one, how does a war with Iran serve the best interest of the American people in the United States? And the fact is, it does not. It better serves the interests of people like Bibi Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia, who are trying to push us into this war with Iran; again, a war that would undermine our national security in the ways that I talked about. It would strengthen terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda. It would carry a heavy human cost and it would cost us, taxpayers, trillions of dollars. Forget about investing and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. Forget about having the resources that we need for things like healthcare, education, affordable housing. We wouldn't have those resources because this would go towards yet another extremely devastating, costly war with Iran."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

I think if you were to poll on that question, and it is polled, you would find that what you just said has overwhelming support with voters in both parties, not just your part of the Democratic Party, both Republicans as well. And yes, I predict with certainty that you will be attacked for saying what you just did. And that tells you everything. Tulsi Gabbard, running for President from State of Hawaii. Great to see you tonight. Thank you very much."

So we brought you twice during the hour the alert that the President has announced that the Department of Justice will be declassifying documents pertaining to among other things, spying on the Trump campaign in 2016. I spoke during the commercial break with someone who is familiar with this process. And I will just say this, this is a bigger story even I think than we realized when we first broke it.
