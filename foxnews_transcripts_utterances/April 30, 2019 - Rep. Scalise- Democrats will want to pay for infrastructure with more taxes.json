This record of Trump's is stunning, even with all the ranches that the Democrats have tried to jam into his spokes. So pull the numerous planks out of your own eye, Joe before you start condemning others as immoral for political gain. And that's THE ANGLE. All right, joining me now with reaction to this and a lot more, Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union. Richard Goodstein, former Clinton aide and Charlie Kirk, Founder and President of Turning Point USA. He's also the host of the Charlie Kirk show launching tomorrow on podcast. Want a colleague there of mine. Well, you can also catch new episodes of course of my podcast, new one dropped today. All right Matt, are voters really to believe this Democratic morality masquerade?"

Pennsylvania shed manufacturing jobs under Obama, they're picking up those manufacturing jobs under Donald Trump. Looks specifically at trade and immigration. Popular issues with these swing voters in Pennsylvania. The reason why they're trying to morality because they can't beat him on the policy."

Joining me now is Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News Contributor and author of the brand new book, 'Collusion' out today. Mr. Speaker, the judge here is saying that people are making these Confederate statues out to be something other than what they actually are, just a reminder of our war history.

Lee is unacceptable and yet in 1975, Senator Joe Biden voted to give Robert E. Lee his citizenship back, something he'd lost in the civil war so this remarkable changes. I think that the whole effort on the left to erase American history is wrong. I think people ought to stand up for it. You're not standing up for the values of those people, you're standing up for the fact that they were a significant part of American history, they deserve to be studied as part of American history and I think that in fact, studying the role of slavery and civil war helps you better understand America."

It's very it's very odd but I want to move on to the dirty politics going in Washington, Newt because President Trump's refusal now to cooperate with these endless Democrat subpoenas, it's now intensifying the Democrats' push for impeachment.

Therefore the Democrats' House can jump up and down, they can scream, they can hold their breath until they turn purple, it doesn't matter. They're not going to have any ability to get anything done in terms of impeachment. So if I - my request to the President is, these people have proven that they have no interest in the truth. They have no interest in the facts and if you give in, they'll just demand more and so I think, he's very wise to draw a firm line in the ground, say no. We're not going to corporate. As I also think Attorney General Barr is very wise to not agree to allow lawyers who are on the staff to ask questions because it changes totally the relationship and frankly allows purely professional politicians who are trained lawyers to sit in there and spend weeks preparing ways to try to track them. Barr will do fine against members of Congress but nobody is going to win against the whole series of very, very well trained staff lawyers that do very well."

You can't - they're not going to be very effective in subpoenaing the Attorney General and they end up looking a little - the more they do this, the tireder the country's going to get and in that sense, I think Trump has a shrewd understanding that if he can get the Democrats into publicly being so focused on this kind of game, that the country will end up being very tired of the Democrats as people who aren't trying to help solve America's problems."

Both Jefferson and Hamilton used to subsidize newspapers to attack each other while they were both serving the President in Washington's cabinet so we've had a long history of this stuff but I think again, it's one of those places where after all the noise, you just shrug your shoulders and say so what. Mueller had every opportunity to come out the days that Barr released his letter.

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Why isn't a full-on disengagement from China a realistic and smart approach for this country? Are they not thieves of American ingenuity? The theft of trade secrets could be as high as $600 billion annually. Does China not pose a significant national security threat to the country? China is mining intelligence from an estimated 23 million records of American federal workers. Why are we not doing more to isolate China as we did with the USSR?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Since I asked that question three weeks ago, American officials and media outlets are speaking out more freely about the threat of communist China. \"The Wall Street Journal\" calling out business titans in a piece about tech, noting, \"U.S. law effectively prohibits American companies from exporting satellites to China, but the U.S. doesn't regulate how a satellite's bandwidth is used once that device is in space. That has allowed China to essentially rent the capacity of U.S. built satellites. Some of America's biggest companies, including the Carlyle Group and Boeing, have indirectly facilitated China's effort. Then there's American officials. Here's FBI Director Chris Wray just this past Friday."
    },

      "speaker": "CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "No country poses a broader, more severe intelligence collection threat than China. China has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation in any way it can from a wide array of businesses, universities, and organizations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Green lit by the Chinese communist government, of course. My next guest says there are two entities in particular that require serious repercussions. Here to deliver that message is Gordon Chang, and Asia expert and author of the book, \"The Coming Collapse of China.\" I'll wait to see that. And he is joined alongside Steve Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute and author of \"Bully of Asia, Why China's Dream is the new threat to the World Order.\" Gordon, you say that Chinese journalists and students here in this country need to face the music. Explain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GORDON CHANG, ASIA EXPERT",
      "utterance": "For decades, Laura, the American intelligence community and even China watchers without security clearances, have known that most of the journalists for the state media organizations have been spies. You go back Xinhua News Agency, which is the press outlet, and they not only do press releases and articles, they also provide classified intelligence briefings for senior Chinese leaders. That's a dual role. And also just on a personal level, I remember 2007, 2008, I gave a presentation about Korea and Washington, D.C., and afterwards this journalists from China Legal Daily, and I don't know what a Legal Daily journalist is doing with a bureau le in Virginia, but he came up to me and wanted to talk about China. So clearly there is an ongoing intelligence agency effort, and it is largely centered on journalists. And also, they do use students."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And speaking students, Steven, Washington, D.C., is a mecca for recruiting international students, and a lot of it is great and fine. But there is a special effort now underway in major American universities to recruit more Chinese students to come here, and many of them, an admissions officer told me on Sunday, many of those students are sponsored by the Chinese government to come here. We didn't do that during the Cold War, Steve. I actually studied in Russia during the Cold War for a semester. But there was no reciprocity. We didn't deal with it in that way. So why are we dealing with China in this particular open arms approach?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVEN MOSHER, PRESIDENT, POPULATION RESEARCH CENTER",
      "utterance": "There has never been reciprocity with China. I was in the first 50 American scholars who went to China back in 1979. How many scholars did China sent to the United States? Not 50. More like 50,000. So there has never been reciprocity. We welcome them with open arms. But remember this, that everybody who leaves China has to get a passport and an exit visa from the Chinese government. They are visited by security forces before the come here, and they are told that when they are in the United States they should keep their ears and eyes open for any technology, any intellectual property that would be useful to the Chinese government. And they are told they can stay in the United States and stay in place and feed information back, or they can get the information, put it on a flash drive, and take it back to China. But the recruiting is done on the way out of China. So in that sense, a lot of the Chinese scholars and students are here for one purpose, and that is to lift as much intellectual property as they can from our country and take it back to China as possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I just keep going back to this, and no one has a good answer. Why do we not treat China as we treated the USSR? They were an adversary. They were an enemy in many ways. They were trying to break down U.S. interests around the globe. They were exporting their communist values to other countries. China is much bigger and more powerful than the Soviet Union was in the 1970s today. Yet we take a completely different approach. Gordon, isn't this the power of Wall Street and global business interests, though, that drive this connection between the United States and China? It's all about the cash."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "Certainly, Laura, and that is our fault for creating those relationships. To just talk about what Steven has mentioned, in 2017 national intelligence law in China that requires every Chinese national organization to spy if demanded, and China indeed has this grains of sand approach where they collect information from businesspeople, tourists, scholars, students you name it. And they just bring it back and assemble it in China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Why are we doing this? Why are we allowing this to happen to our country? It's the same question I ask about our southern border. We worked our tail off to make our country the shining city on a hill, and then we leave our southern border open, and now we just open our arms to the communist government of China. I don't understand that. We are inching for this trade deal. Unless China is going to verifiably going to stop cheating, spying, picking up our technologies, I don't see why Trump would do any trade deal with China at all. Steven, let me get Steven on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOSHER",
      "utterance": "He shouldn't do a trade deal with China because, look, we have to understand the big picture here, and the big picture is that China declared a cold war on us in 1991. We know that Deng Xiaoping told the senior communist leadership America defeated the Soviet Union in the first cold war, but there is a new cold war now between China and United States, and we are going to win this one, Deng Xiaoping said. That was 28 years ago. They've been at war with us across all domains for almost the last three decades. They are the new evil empire. So we need to shut down the transfer of technology."

      "utterance": "And Laura, the real question is, how do you pay for it? And of course if you're Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, it's taxes, taxes, taxes. And that is where they are going to want to go. It has got to be paid for, and without new taxes. And that is where I think it probably breaks down."

What is going on here? Is Trump doing the charm offensive. I guess they started at $1 trillion, he was like let's do $2 trillion. What is that? That's a lot of money. We are $22 trillion in debt, Congressman."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",

I think she is smiling because she got to get away from the capital and all of the socialists and AOC and Omar and Tlaib that have just bogged her down in this mire of anti-Semitism, socialism.

All right, Congressman, some think that the president is looking for infrastructure for immigration trade. So we'll give you infrastructure, you've got to give us some stuff on immigration enforcement. But a new poll reveals that the percentage of Democrats who see the border as the crisis jumped 17 points since January amid the spike in migrant families. So if Democrat voters are coming to this conclusion finally that this is a real emergency, why would the president have to negotiate here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Well, maybe the infrastructure is the wall. And again, people get that we need to secure the border. Republicans and Democrats agree we ought to secure the border. How exactly do you do that? You're going to have to have some physical barriers, most of it. I'm not talking about Washington Democrats. I'm talking about people when you go out into the mainland of this country, they want a secure border, and they know the crime that's coming across. They know the drugs that are being brought across. They've seen this caravan, and Washington --"

But then he wants to give felons in prison the right to vote while they are in prison. We are for everybody being able to vote one time in each election, and they are having problems with those kinds of laws that make sure that you have the integrity of the vote for everybody.

We want to investigate anyone in his orbit who has in fact violated the law.\" And in her first three months in office, James has subpoenaed bank records to various Trump organizations along with tax documents. Critics say she should not be using the state attorney general's office to wage partisan political battles.
