Tonight, our own Raymond Arroyo joins us for the live report from McAllen, Texas after a very busy 24 hours on the ground there. So, he's basically going where Kamala won't go, the border and a full report a little later. Plus, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson's YouTube page suspended after he promoted hydroxychloroquine and talked about a study that was just released. We talked about it. He's here to respond to this. But first, Joe's European giveaway. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, after Kamala's disastrous trip to Central America, you can see why the media, they're desperate to switch topics. So, her avoidance of the border reflects so badly on the administration that the only way they can turn the page was to feature Biden appearing strong, right and command and eager to re-engage with Europe. There was one little problem though, Joe Biden.",

Nations like France and Germany prefer Biden because with him, they have outsized leverage, they'll get most of what they want, and then they'll give up nothing. Meanwhile, America gets stiffed and our taxpayers will of course, we pick up the bill. Now, both the media and the Democrats, they want to keep this entire conversation as you can hear it in the press coverage, just steeped in generalities. They don't want you to know what's actually in this 25 page G7 communique that Biden ended up agreeing to, now why don't they want you to know what's in it, if it's such a great accomplishment? Because it's a sovereignty killing, prosperity destroying series of policy pronouncements that would never get passed around Congress. Here's some of the lowlights. Vaccine passports. Oh, yay. If you're worried about being forced to show your papers for travel? Well, you should be, things sound ominous on the vaccine passport issue with the G7 recognizing the need for a set of common standards for travel, including interoperability and mutual recognition of digital applications, testing requirements and recognition of vaccination status. Well, how would any of this be possible without an actual digital vaccination certificate? Next item, Well, goodbye cars. Here's the relevant language here. We commit to accelerate the transition away from new sales of diesel and petrol cars to promote the uptake of zero emission vehicles. Well, we kind of like Elon Musk, I've said that before. And I'm glad he's happy. But this isn't anything that Joe Biden has the authority or voter mandate to commit to. The big anti-fossil fuels umbrella provision is ripped right from that International Energy Agency report that we warned you about some weeks ago. Biden reaffirmed his commitment to the goal of net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of our economies, and societies. My friends, this will destroy hundreds of thousands of the good paying American jobs that are left here, drive up energy costs for every living American, devastate our national security as we'll lose our energy independence. Of course, the cost of everything's going up, fuel costs going up. Now, as part of this, Biden wants not only your car, your gas powered car, but also, he'd kind of like your fridge and your favorite lamp as well. For document references, this nifty acronym called SEEAD, S-E-E-A-D, which refers to super-efficient equipment and appliance deployment initiative, requiring new systems by 2030. So, get ready to shell out big bucks. If you like low flow toilets, you'll love paying more while you're getting less from all your appliances. But a few groups, I've got to say will do just fine in this G7 document like Wall Street and global bureaucrats. Now this comes from the goal to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year from public and private sources for meaningful mitigation actions. What's that and increasing public climate finance contributions? I'm going to translate this for you. You're going to pay more for a lower standard of living, while bureaucrats make more money and along with this Green Act boondoggle or sweetheart deals for Wall Street, they're going to be cashing in, as government's quote, develop the Global Green finance market in order to, quote mobilize the trillions of dollars of private sector finance needed to meet net zero emissions. So, it's kind of like during the pandemic, even when American families got poor, big corporate interest got a lot richer. Of course, though, no Biden by end would be complete without a nod to the gender fluidity crowd. The document pretends to safeguard women and girl's empowerment, while at the same time supporting diversity including of sexual orientations, and gender identities. OK. This is THE ANGLE shorthand for you kids, boys and men should be able to play and even dominate girls and women's athletics. Three manly cheers for girl power. So, what did Biden get for all this nonsense that will weaken the U.S. vis-a-vis our G7 counterparts. Remember, during the campaign, he bragged that under a Biden Administration, he with all his foreign policy experience was going to be able to use his influence with our allies to get tough on China. Instead, he comes home with a limp, pointless statement, saying, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices. We will cooperate where it is in our mutual interest on shared global challenges, in particular, addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. I'm sure China is going to be up late at night about that. They go out of their way, by the way, not to offend China by including only a very tepid, very general bland mention of respecting human rights without ever mentioning the wiggers Uyghurs by name. And of course, they'll never use the word genocide. This is a complete abdication to China, they are celebrating tonight, it's a total failure on the part of Joe Biden. In response to this, all of this, Republicans on the Hill have to get their messaging right and deliver it with precision and clarity. It should go something like this. For our alliance to survive with the G7 countries, it must be between America and our foreign partners, not our foreign partners in the Democrat Party. But right now, Joe Biden is promising, he's promising to write checks that he won't be able to cash, they're not going to be able to ever get the money from Biden does not have the power to agree to any of this. And he certainly doesn't have the support of the American people to do it. So, we're going to put everyone on notice. We're going to retake the House next year, then we're going to retake the White House in 2024. And when we do, we're going to shred this document as soon as we can. Thus, when we get a president who is actually looking out for America's interest again, don't say we didn't warn you. This entire G7 exercise is a waste of time, it's completely invalid. Biden himself though, seems to know is in a bit of a jam given the political realities at home.",

You know that whole democratic process thing they claim to care so much about, the same one they claim was threatened on January 6th. Remember when Donald Trump, Happy Birthday Mr. President, traveled to these international con fabs, the global elites were very gloomy. They knew he wasn't a sucker for their charades. America came first for him and where we had shared goal with our European partners, he tried to forge common ground. That made sense. Macron and Merkel knew though that Biden was always going to be an uneasy touch, pun intended. A few references to build back better and that communique was all it took to get his team of fools to agree to a document filled with great reset giveaways to special interests. Republicans have to make it crystal clear, Joe may be a cheap date, but America is not. Whatever his endearing bumbling qualities, Uncle Chucklehead does not have the mandate for any of this. The voters who turned out for Biden did so thinking he'd protect our interests, not work against them. And that's THE ANGLE. Here now is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, this story keeps getting worse. Right before we went to air tonight, NATO released its own communique, which the New York Times summed up this way. Russia is repeatedly described as a threat to NATO in the document. By contrast, China is described as presenting challenges. The communique is summed up further by the times, saying in a gesture toward diplomacy engagement, the Alliance vows to maintain a constructive dialogue with China where possible, including on the issue of climate change. Senator, this is a complete joke, Biden's supposed foreign policy influence with just a bunch of smoke and mirrors, China is now on the catbird seat. Your reaction?",

She wants to keep German markets open. All these European leaders want Chinese money to continue come flooding into their countries, all at the risk of our shared common security. And Joe Biden simply did not push hard enough for our European allies to recognize China as the leading threat that we face and that the free world faces.",

People do not like the NIH guideline to basically do nothing, go home afraid, isolate yourself. If you get sick enough, go to the hospital, people actually looking for early treatment, YouTube censored that after 8 million views, and now they censored some pretty innocuous statements where again, I'm just asking people get information.

So, he's basically going where Kamala won't go, the border and a full report a little later. Plus, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson's YouTube page suspended after he promoted hydroxychloroquine and talked about a study that was just released. We talked about it. He's here to respond to this. But first, Joe's European giveaway. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, after Kamala's disastrous trip to Central America, you can see why the media, they're desperate to switch topics. So, her avoidance of the border reflects so badly on the administration that the only way they can turn the page was to feature Biden appearing strong, right and command and eager to re-engage with Europe.

Nations like France and Germany prefer Biden because with him, they have outsized leverage, they'll get most of what they want, and then they'll give up nothing. Meanwhile, America gets stiffed and our taxpayers will of course, we pick up the bill. Now, both the media and the Democrats, they want to keep this entire conversation as you can hear it in the press coverage, just steeped in generalities. They don't want you to know what's actually in this 25 page G7 communique that Biden ended up agreeing to, now why don't they want you to know what's in it, if it's such a great accomplishment? Because it's a sovereignty killing, prosperity destroying series of policy pronouncements that would never get passed around Congress. Here's some of the lowlights. Vaccine passports. Oh, yay. If you're worried about being forced to show your papers for travel? Well, you should be, things sound ominous on the vaccine passport issue with the G7 recognizing the need for a set of common standards for travel, including interoperability and mutual recognition of digital applications, testing requirements and recognition of vaccination status. Well, how would any of this be possible without an actual digital vaccination certificate? Next item, Well, goodbye cars. Here's the relevant language here. We commit to accelerate the transition away from new sales of diesel and petrol cars to promote the uptake of zero emission vehicles. Well, we kind of like Elon Musk, I've said that before. And I'm glad he's happy. But this isn't anything that Joe Biden has the authority or voter mandate to commit to. The big anti-fossil fuels umbrella provision is ripped right from that International Energy Agency report that we warned you about some weeks ago. Biden reaffirmed his commitment to the goal of net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of our economies, and societies. My friends, this will destroy hundreds of thousands of the good paying American jobs that are left here, drive up energy costs for every living American, devastate our national security as we'll lose our energy independence. Of course, the cost of everything's going up, fuel costs going up. Now, as part of this, Biden wants not only your car, your gas powered car, but also, he'd kind of like your fridge and your favorite lamp as well. For document references, this nifty acronym called SEEAD, S-E-E-A-D, which refers to super-efficient equipment and appliance deployment initiative, requiring new systems by 2030. So, get ready to shell out big bucks. If you like low flow toilets, you'll love paying more while you're getting less from all your appliances. But a few groups, I've got to say will do just fine in this G7 document like Wall Street and global bureaucrats. Now this comes from the goal to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year from public and private sources for meaningful mitigation actions. What's that and increasing public climate finance contributions? I'm going to translate this for you. You're going to pay more for a lower standard of living, while bureaucrats make more money and along with this Green Act boondoggle or sweetheart deals for Wall Street, they're going to be cashing in, as government's quote, develop the Global Green finance market in order to, quote mobilize the trillions of dollars of private sector finance needed to meet net zero emissions. So, it's kind of like during the pandemic, even when American families got poor, big corporate interest got a lot richer. Of course, though, no Biden by end would be complete without a nod to the gender fluidity crowd. The document pretends to safeguard women and girl's empowerment, while at the same time supporting diversity including of sexual orientations, and gender identities. OK. This is THE ANGLE shorthand for you kids, boys and men should be able to play and even dominate girls and women's athletics. Three manly cheers for girl power. So, what did Biden get for all this nonsense that will weaken the U.S. vis-a-vis our G7 counterparts. Remember, during the campaign, he bragged that under a Biden Administration, he with all his foreign policy experience was going to be able to use his influence with our allies to get tough on China. Instead, he comes home with a limp, pointless statement, saying, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices. We will cooperate where it is in our mutual interest on shared global challenges, in particular, addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. I'm sure China is going to be up late at night about that. They go out of their way, by the way, not to offend China by including only a very tepid, very general bland mention of respecting human rights without ever mentioning the wiggers Uyghurs by name. And of course, they'll never use the word genocide. This is a complete abdication to China, they are celebrating tonight, it's a total failure on the part of Joe Biden. In response to this, all of this, Republicans on the Hill have to get their messaging right and deliver it with precision and clarity. It should go something like this. For our alliance to survive with the G7 countries, it must be between America and our foreign partners, not our foreign partners in the Democrat Party. But right now, Joe Biden is promising, he's promising to write checks that he won't be able to cash, they're not going to be able to ever get the money from Biden does not have the power to agree to any of this. And he certainly doesn't have the support of the American people to do it. So, we're going to put everyone on notice. We're going to retake the House next year, then we're going to retake the White House in 2024. And when we do, we're going to shred this document as soon as we can. Thus, when we get a president who is actually looking out for America's interest again, don't say we didn't warn you. This entire G7 exercise is a waste of time, it's completely invalid. Biden himself though, seems to know is in a bit of a jam given the political realities at home."

You know that whole democratic process thing they claim to care so much about, the same one they claim was threatened on January 6th. Remember when Donald Trump, Happy Birthday Mr. President, traveled to these international con fabs, the global elites were very gloomy. They knew he wasn't a sucker for their charades. America came first for him and where we had shared goal with our European partners, he tried to forge common ground. That made sense. Macron and Merkel knew though that Biden was always going to be an uneasy touch, pun intended. A few references to build back better and that communique was all it took to get his team of fools to agree to a document filled with great reset giveaways to special interests. Republicans have to make it crystal clear, Joe may be a cheap date, but America is not. Whatever his endearing bumbling qualities, Uncle Chucklehead does not have the mandate for any of this. The voters who turned out for Biden did so thinking he'd protect our interests, not work against them. And that's THE ANGLE. Here now is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, this story keeps getting worse. Right before we went to air tonight, NATO released its own communique, which the New York Times summed up this way. Russia is repeatedly described as a threat to NATO in the document. By contrast, China is described as presenting challenges. The communique is summed up further by the times, saying in a gesture toward diplomacy engagement, the Alliance vows to maintain a constructive dialogue with China where possible, including on the issue of climate change. Senator, this is a complete joke, Biden's supposed foreign policy influence with just a bunch of smoke and mirrors, China is now on the catbird seat. Your reaction?"

And our European allies need to recognize that threat China poses, but instead you've got Angela Merkel watering down these communiques from NATO and the G7, because she wants to sell more BMWs and Volkswagens into Germany. She wants to keep German markets open. All these European leaders want Chinese money to continue come flooding into their countries, all at the risk of our shared common security. And Joe Biden simply did not push hard enough for our European allies to recognize China as the leading threat that we face and that the free world faces."

But at the same time, our military seems to be getting more woke, more focus on diversity, equity inclusion and critical race theory and all of that. And you have now whistleblower complaints from members of our military about the pervasiveness of this critical race theory issue. One complaint talked about a discussion on police brutality, white privilege and systemic racism, dominated by high ranking and white colonels. And a younger junior Hispanic officer, I would later learn that junior officer is a former DNC staffer, and these go on and on and on. What can you tell us, senator?"

Is our country inherently racist? Should people be promoted primarily on the basis of their race and sex? But in the end, he did say that no, of course, those things should not happen. And any trooper out there who has this kind of anti-American critical race theory, trained or presented to them, should report to their chain of command or the Inspector General, other appropriate channels, which I would suggest again tonight in your show, as I have the past couple of times, I've been on is through my office or Congressman Crenshaw's office as well.

Tens of thousands of military officers' promotions from First Lieutenant on up that includes a couple hundred generals every year that we don't have to rubber stamp those. We can examine them more closely. We can see if these generals have been dancing to the tune of the political appointees of the Biden Administration, now, contrary to the exact direction of the Secretary of Defense last week.

Second, early treatment. Third, hospital treatment. Fourth, vaccines. We've by and large ignored early treatment. I'm not exactly sure why. But the fact of the matter is, because we have ignored early treatment, I don't know how many thousands of lives, tens of thousands of lives were lost. It didn't need to be lost. But it's a tragedy.

Another reason might be the fact that if you have effective treatments, it's very difficult, if not impossible to get an emergency use authorization on an experimental vaccine. That could also be driving this. Again, I have no idea. I've just been beating my head against the wall for over a year. I've been labeled together with Dr. McCullough and Harvey Risch as the snake oil salesman of the senate, censored twice now, Dr. Pierre Kory, his YouTube video from his testimony from my hearing, 8 million views. People do not like the NIH guideline to basically do nothing, go home afraid, isolate yourself. If you get sick enough, go to the hospital, people actually looking for early treatment, YouTube censored that after 8 million views, and now they censored some pretty innocuous statements where again, I'm just asking people get information.

      "utterance": "We drove to a favorite cartel drop point, now patrolled by Texas National Guard. We waited in the dark until 1:00 a.m. when the cartel started moving migrants across the Rio Grande. They came, and they came some more. You notice they are tagged with bands, which is operating procedure for the cartel. They literally tagged these people. And not only are they clients of the cartel, but in some cases, they have to work off their journey once they are in America. There is no doubt they were brought here by the cartels, but when questioned, they won't speak at all. After dropping off these migrants, the smuggler returns to Mexico. This is a business, and in many ways a deception, a distraction, a human one. Up the road, they are met by Border Patrol, who now, unable to patrol, are forced to register and transport hundreds of migrants. Due to the relaxed Biden border policies, the surge of migrants has increased, and so has the power of the unseen cartels. And once their processed, Border Patrol brings migrants here to the respite center in McAllen. It is one of many faith-affiliated groups that help these migrants settle into America, help them find their destinations, and send them on their way."

So they pass through here and they're gone. So it's a municipal issue to an extent, but after that, it's an issue for our whole country."

And that's why Governor Abbott had to dispatch those 1,000 of his own law enforcement people to rebolster those efforts and fill in the gaps. By the way, Border Patrol has intercepted or arrested 180,000 migrants in the month of May. Tomorrow, we're going to tell you the real activity of these cartels, what they're doing behind the scenes. It's frightening."

It's both heartbreaking, infuriating, disheartening, disconcerting, outrageous. Again, the adjectives don't capture it. It is a human tragedy, an economic disaster. It hurts our schools, it hurts our health care system. Everyone feels bad for people who come from bad countries where they can't get a job, but that's half of the world."

They know what they are doing, and it's flood the zone with new people. They want new people coming into the country for a variety of reasons. And that's what they want, and that's what they are getting -- 2 million people will be here by the end of the year."

Not only does she use her speech to push Critical Race Theory, she also called for a jihad against the concepts of objectivity and neutrality. Joining me now is Dr. Carol Swain, former political science professor at Stanford and Vanderbilt Universities, author of the book \"Debating Immigration.\" Dr. Swain, this isn't just some activist. She sits on the school board of Fairfax County, one of the wealthiest school districts in the United States. Your reaction?"

And what disturbs me is that these were mostly immigrants, and that was an anti-American speech, and it is something that should not be taking place in our country. It robbed the students of an inspirational graduation speech, but it also painted America as a country that was hostile to these immigrants. And it is teaching young people to hate this nation. And when we have immigrants, and these students were immigrants, their parents and the immigrants that I know love America, and they have been among the most outspoken about Critical Race Theory and what is happening to this country because many of them fled nations where there was communism, socialism. They don't want to see it happen to America. And so she had these young people, a captive audience, that she is indoctrinating with information that cannot serve them well nor does it serve our nation well."

It's a very diverse place, a lot of great people, but it's a very different place than it was just even 10 years ago.

Why was she picked to be the graduation speaker? Was it because she was a minority? She is obviously hostile towards America. And it takes me back, you know, Theodore Roosevelt, 1907. He talked about America being open to immigrants, but those who came to America in good faith and wanted to assimilate and wanted to become a part of what we are, what we have to offer. Obviously, we are bringing people into this country that hate this country. They are looking for opportunities to undermine it from within. That is unacceptable. Our tax dollars should not be supporting it. And we need to hold racial and ethnic minorities like me to the same standards that we hold whites too. When need to hold everyone to the same standard."

Parents have got to stand up and run for these school board races. And by the way, the Virginia governor's race, Carol, is in full swing, Critical Race Theory a big issue in the commonwealth.
