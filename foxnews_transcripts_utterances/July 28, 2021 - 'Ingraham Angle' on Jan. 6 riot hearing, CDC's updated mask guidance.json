They didn't want to give it up so soon, this emergency will never pass. Remember, it was 15 days to slow the spread 100 days to mask up. They keep changing the rules of the game. Why? Because that's what megalomaniacs do, just as with 100 days of mask wearing, there's always a catch, right? The good news always comes with a big fat asterisk. But whatever marginal benefit we get from wet cloth masks, they became a security blanket for Democrats who wanted to get rid of Trump and of course, all the old traditions of America. Bad actors inside and outside government perversely kind of ended up loving COVID-19 of course, not the death but the opportunity that the COVID crisis presented to usher in a permanent new normal. They knew that as long as Americans were forced to social distance and mask up, the lot of Americans would conclude that we were indeed in a crisis mode. Thus, that would justify keeping kids and workers at home and the government checks coming. The great reset of America, but politically Biden had to offer something to a beleaguered nation. So one of his main pitches as you remember in 2020 was elect me because I have a plan. We're going to be disciplined and organized and we can beat the virus. Remember what he told us just a few months ago?",

Are you in a hot spot today or not? What's the exact metric on being a hot spot? As happened a year ago, blue state residents are going to start wondering why the heck life is so much better in the red states. And then the blue staters are going to demand that the restrictions be lifted the roller coaster ride that never ends. This is a political disaster for Biden, he wasn't elected to create giant new entitlement programs or to throw open the southern border. He was elected in large part to solve the virus issue. But his experts are fighting him on that. And he's either too out of it or too ignorant to know this. Every time you change the rules. It's not sufficient to explain it away. It's simply we're listening to the scientists. The scientists aren't president or are they? Now I think I figured out how they make their COVID policy over at the White House.

So we know that people who have had the disease, they have sort of cross immunity, which is - which seems very promising for any variants that come out. And we don't know exactly about the vaccine. But the key thing to realize with whether you are immune from vaccine or whether you immune from having had COVID is that it doesn't necessarily protect you from being infected again, because the virus will enter the body it and it might start with it using the body what the immune system do for you is that it prevents you from getting serious illness or death.

But what the heck is going on here? Joining me now is Sharon McKeeman, Founder of \"Let Them Breathe\", Sharon. So many parents are reaching out to me all day long after this news broke. Just moments ago, Teachers Union had Randi Weingarten said that when science and evidence speak, we listen, if that means requiring everyone in school buildings to be masked, so we will do it? These teachers unions, of course, have proven themselves to work against parents' wishes throughout this pandemic, your reaction to the news? SHARON MCKEEMAN, FOUNDER OF \"LET THEM BREATHE\": Well, as you read that tweet, these government agencies apparently can't even agree with themselves. They told us to vax to unmask, and now they're saying they're going to keep masks on kids indefinitely. And their justification for that is that there's a lot they don't know about these virus. And so what we do know for sure is that children are at very low risk from COVID. But they're very high risk from what the mental health impacts of these masking restrictions are doing. And I'm saddened, but I'm not surprised that this government overreach is continuing.

The Senate Republicans should do to the Democrats what the red state governors did to the CDC, just tuned them out. Joining us now is Phil Klein, editor at \"National Review.\" Philip, Senator Joe Manchin today revealed that the real goal of this infrastructure bill is if a bipartisan infrastructure bill falls apart, everything could fall apart. Phil, how stupid do the Republicans look, like, of course, Cassidy in Louisiana, Romney, et cetera, for being rolled on this? PHILIP KLEIN, EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE\": It's ridiculous. For months, the argument that defenders of this bipartisan charade have been making to a lot of conservatives has been, well, if we get this bipartisan, this smaller bipartisan deal, than it will convinced moderates such as Manchin and Sinema to oppose the bigger deal. And you could say that there is some logic to that, right. It's better to spend $600 billion then $3.5 trillion, right? But Manchin just gave away the game now. What he's saying is that, actually, the opposite of what Republicans have been arguing to conservatives is true, that is that the bipartisan bill is actually greasing the wheels for the larger bill, so that if they want the whole $4 trillion spending with expanding Medicare and Medicaid, childcare, Green New Deal, all of these things sandwiched in, that they need the bipartisan deal.

We'll get to them later on in the show. But first, the day, Fauci became president. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. It seems just like yesterday--"

      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",
      "utterance": "One of our 100 day challenges is asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days, the next 99 days; the mask could become a partisan issue, unfortunately. But it's a patriotic act. The fact is that the single best thing we can do the more important in the vaccines because they take time to work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, at the time, of any angle knew that Biden's 100 days appeal was just a stick. The mask had become a political symbol for too many on the left. They didn't want to give it up so soon, this emergency will never pass. Remember, it was 15 days to slow the spread 100 days to mask up. They keep changing the rules of the game. Why? Because that's what megalomaniacs do, just as with 100 days of mask wearing, there's always a catch, right? The good news always comes with a big fat asterisk. But whatever marginal benefit we get from wet cloth masks, they became a security blanket for Democrats who wanted to get rid of Trump and of course, all the old traditions of America. Bad actors inside and outside government perversely kind of ended up loving COVID-19 of course, not the death but the opportunity that the COVID crisis presented to usher in a permanent new normal. They knew that as long as Americans were forced to social distance and mask up, the lot of Americans would conclude that we were indeed in a crisis mode. Thus, that would justify keeping kids and workers at home and the government checks coming. The great reset of America, but politically Biden had to offer something to a beleaguered nation. So one of his main pitches as you remember in 2020 was elect me because I have a plan. We're going to be disciplined and organized and we can beat the virus. Remember what he told us just a few months ago?"

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, let me repeat that was a lie. Of course they were just words. Today the CDC announced a stunning reversal rendering Biden's pledge meaningless. The CDC Director for some reason too scared to actually show her face on camera inadvertently blew up much of the incentive to get vaccinated. She announced in a teleconference that both unvaccinated and vaccinated Americans should once again wear masks indoors, if they're living in virus hotspots."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, do they actually think that Americans are this stupid? For weeks, we've been saying that the vaccines still experimental have some limitations. We reported on the risk of inflammatory cardiac reaction. We noted the Israeli data showing that breakthrough cases weren't so rare after all. And we told you about the numbers in Tennessee. The Health Director there reported 1000 so called breakthrough infections of COVID among vaccinated individuals, with the full 75 percent being symptomatic cases. Well, for that, we were vilified by the same media figures. And by the way, some never Trump malcontents desperate for attention. Do the math. It doesn't mean that the vaccine is useless but it does mean we have to be realistic. We already have what nearly 90 percent of those over the age of 65 vaccinated in the U.S.? It's literally insane or diabolical to issue new directives that punish Americans who are just getting back on their feet. The White House's messaging is so bad, so idiotic. They're even infuriating their allies."

And now oh, my gosh, now you can maybe spread it. And they're making the change to the masking guidance based on unpublished data. But it shows that vaccinated and unvaccinated people infected by the Delta variant can have the same viral road - viral load really confusing. And it does beg the question of, do they really know?"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They don't get that vibe. OK. Well, wherever you come down on this, the CDC has been moving the COVID goalposts since March of 2020. It was two weeks to slow the spread where we had Mike Pence up there, it got to save the hospitals. Of course, we have to do that. Then it went to lock downs and capacity restrictions until we had a vaccine. Well, have a vaccine now and now it's entirely conceivable that Democrats will be wearing masks at their 2024 convention, there's always going to be a reason to take a step backward for people who prefer lock downs to actual living. We could have 90 percent of the entire country vaccinated, and then still come up with new reasons that we need COVID restrictions in place."

They just impose new mask mandates yesterday, after all the visitors to Palm Beach may not be vacced. Look, if they could the COVID control freaks would have us in and out of lockdown forever. I don't know if you've been watching what's going on in Australia, but they locked down for a few dozen cases. And in Sydney, they've been in a hard lockdown already for four weeks. And they announced today that it's going to extend for another four weeks. I kid you not. And when people go to protest the lockdowns there, as they did, by the way last weekend by the thousands well, what happens they're blamed again."

    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA",
      "utterance": "Let me deal with what we saw in Sydney yesterday. Of course, it was selfish. It was also self-defeating. It achieves no purpose. It will not end the lockdown sooner. It will only risk the lockdowns running further. There were millions of Sydneysiders who stayed home. They're the ones who are bringing an end to the lockdown sooner in a city and the lockdown to engage in that was reckless. And it was selfish."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Crikey, what a nightmare? The Biden Administration has fallen right into a COVID trap of their own making. Governors from multiple red states have already announced they're not going to be doing any new masks mandates or lockdowns, period. For them Fauci has blown whatever credibility had left. And by the way, it wasn't a lot. But if you live in one of the blue states, whether you're vaccinated or not, you're not going to really know what rules will be, in effect day to day. Are you in a hot spot today or not? What's the exact metric on being a hot spot? As happened a year ago, blue state residents are going to start wondering why the heck life is so much better in the red states. And then the blue staters are going to demand that the restrictions be lifted the roller coaster ride that never ends. This is a political disaster for Biden, he wasn't elected to create giant new entitlement programs or to throw open the southern border. He was elected in large part to solve the virus issue. But his experts are fighting him on that. And he's either too out of it or too ignorant to know this. Every time you change the rules. It's not sufficient to explain it away. It's simply we're listening to the scientists. The scientists aren't president or are they? Now I think I figured out how they make their COVID policy over at the White House. Well, they watch what the health experts on the other cables are saying the demands for new restrictions usually start there."

And he forcefully just starts to push it through, ram it through the bureaucracy, then Biden comes out, or if Psaki and says, oh, we're listening to the doctors to the experts, before they end up lashing out at Americans for making their own risk assessments."

The Democrats made a massive mistake by nominating a man who's either too impaired to think for himself, or just doesn't want to he can't see the political buzz-saw that he's walking into. And then by the way, Biden ended up making a colossal mistake by not sending Fauci out to pasture. Now it's clear who's really the Commander in Chief? And he's going to command you and the president to follow his - if we let him and that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, Harvard Medical School Professor Dr. Kulldorff is anything prolonging this pandemic, more than this on, again, off again, policy guidance from the Biden Administration and the CDC. What do you make of this?"

      "speaker": "DR. MARTIN KULLDORFF, PROFESSOR, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL",
      "utterance": "It's very strange. And I don't know if we have reached the end of the scientific era here. Because if we look at the data, currently, the COVID deaths in the United States is lower than it has been ever since pandemic started in March of 2022 when it took off the first wave. So I'm not sure why all of these things are happening right now. The key thing to realize is that cases have now disconnected from death. We have cases but because of the vaccines, and because there are many people with natural immunity, the fact that cases goes up a little doesn't that mean that deaths are going up? And that we see that in the United States? Yes, we have seen it in the United Kingdom and Sweden, for example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, the CDC today, Professor admitted, what came as a surprise to many people about the vaccines efficacy against the COVID variants and then transmitting them watch."

    {
      "speaker": "DR. WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "The largest concern that I think we in Public Health and Science are more worried about is that virus and the potential mutations away we are from a very transmissible virus that has the potential to evade our vaccines in terms of how it protects us from severe disease and death."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Doctor are we expected to keep taking new boosters every year as this virus continues to mutate down to the last letter in the alphabet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. KULLDORFF",
      "utterance": "No. And while there could be mutation that the base the vaccine, that has always been the case, so there's nothing new to that. But there was a study recently, a week ago, I think, coming out from Hutchinson and Emory that shows that people with natural immunity, who have high COVID, they have immunity not only to reinfection, but also to the other four common Coronaviruses, and to COVID, SARS COVID I. So we know that people who have had the disease, they have sort of cross immunity, which is - which seems very promising for any variants that come out. And we don't know exactly about the vaccine. But the key thing to realize with whether you are immune from vaccine or whether you immune from having had COVID is that it doesn't necessarily protect you from being infected again, because the virus will enter the body it and it might start with it using the body what the immune system do for you is that it prevents you from getting serious illness or death. And that's what's important. And that's, that's why we see now that while cases are going up in the U.S. the death or not the death--"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. KULLDORFF",
      "utterance": "There's no scientific evidence for efficacy of mask in children, mask have - children have extremely low risk of serious disease and mortality. Rather than putting a mask on children, we should just make sure that all older people get the vaccine. We shouldn't put a burden on the children again."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This is insane Dr. Kulldorff great to see you tonight as always, thank you. And to that point I want to show you two headlines about the CDC guidance that came just days apart. The first is from July 9th, just two weeks ago. Vaccinated teachers and students don't need masks, CDC says and today CDC as I just noted, Dr. Kulldorff recommends everyone in K through 12 wear a mask, regardless of vaccination status. But what the heck is going on here? Joining me now is Sharon McKeeman, Founder of \"Let Them Breathe\", Sharon. So many parents are reaching out to me all day long after this news broke. Just moments ago, Teachers Union had Randi Weingarten said that when science and evidence speak, we listen, if that means requiring everyone in school buildings to be masked, so we will do it? These teachers unions, of course, have proven themselves to work against parents' wishes throughout this pandemic, your reaction to the news? SHARON MCKEEMAN, FOUNDER OF \"LET THEM BREATHE\": Well, as you read that tweet, these government agencies apparently can't even agree with themselves. They told us to vax to unmask, and now they're saying they're going to keep masks on kids indefinitely. And their justification for that is that there's a lot they don't know about these virus. And so what we do know for sure is that children are at very low risk from COVID. But they're very high risk from what the mental health impacts of these masking restrictions are doing. And I'm saddened, but I'm not surprised that this government overreach is continuing. And that's why \"Let Them Breathe\", just filed a lawsuit because we're at the point where we're realizing legal action is our only hope to get our kids' lives their smiles back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, the parents just have to say no, I mean, exactly. We're not doing this. And they're finding out, by the way, in a lot of these big liberal public school systems, like in Fairfax County, Virginia, they're losing students. And so then they'll lose budget, that's when they start paying attention when they're starting to lose students. A lot of people are homeschooling the numbers are way up. And, and this part of the country, I'm sure they're way up in blue states across the country, but I just think people are going to vote with their feet. Sharon, I really do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCKEEMAN",
      "utterance": "Exactly. We just had a smile fest. And during that we helped parents explore all their educational aspects, all their options, because exactly parents, we just need to say not on our watch enough is enough. We're not going to allow this to happen to our kids. My son almost didn't survive the pandemic. And it wasn't due to COVID. It was due to the mental health impact of these restrictions on him and of the masking. And so we just have to just stand up together. That's why so many people are joining, \"Let Them Breathe\" we're advocating we're taking legal action. And I know there's going to be a lot of parents and families on the first day of school that are sharing their smiles."

      "utterance": "Pelosi's January 6 Committee held its first hearing today. And because of her actions leading up to today, the whole thing turned into the eyes of many nothing more than performance art. Now, as this show has reiterated time, and again, all criminal activity at the Capitol that day, should be prosecuted and punished. There was certainly a lot of violence that day, but it was not a terrorist attack. It wasn't a 9/11 it wasn't the worst thing that ever happened to America. It wasn't an insurrection. There is also something else happening a transparent attempt by Democrats to drag this all out ahead of 2022. They know they're going to lose big and they're trying not to, but they're casting their political opponents as the enemies of the state. So the theatrical were intended to produce an emotional reaction, logic and facts are damned. It is with that knowledge that we will unveil the angle awards for today's best performances. First for best use of tears and dramatic pauses in a leading role we have a tie. It's between Congressman Kinzinger and Schiff."

And you got to see that on full display today. Everything that you saw today was carefully scripted, by Speaker Pelosi and her staff. Even the statements that these police officers read, you could tell at times, they didn't write the statements they were merely reading them, as they stumbled over some of the words that they weren't familiar with as they were reading. This was carefully scripted even that, obviously, the members of Congress who were selected to be in the room were picked Republicans, including Liz Cheney, and Adam Kinzinger. By the way, those two do not want Republicans to win back the majority next year. They want Democrats to remain in control. And the American people should keep that in mind, especially Republicans, in their states and in their districts knowing that these two would rather Nancy Pelosi stay in charge. And the radical Democrats advanced their socialist agenda, then Republicans winning back the majority to save our country so this was a political stunt by the Democrats. It's clear to the American people; they're not falling for it."

But they came across as political actors. That doesn't help anything. I mean, we want the police to be just the police. I mean, not picking and choosing.

The heroes who show up every day to protect me to protect my staff to protect my family when they're on Capitol Hill and he would have provided a different perspective than what these four police officers provided today. He would have told the members of Congress and the American people if he was allowed to testify that on January 6th, they weren't prepared for what was going to happen that day, even though they had intelligence reports that were provided to the highest levels of the Capitol Police three weeks before January 6th, there's something dangerous was going to happen. They weren't trained for what was going to happen that day. And they weren't equipped for what was going to happen that day. In fact, he said that the rioters had better equipment than the Capitol Police officers did. And they knew it. They knew it heading into that day that they lacked the equipment that they needed would have been a whole different story if the leadership of the Capitol Police would have done their job and if those responsible with Capitol Police officer would have provided as well."

They have demonstrated nothing but bad faith with their infrastructure shell game as well. There's absolutely zero reason for the Romney group to be playing footsie with the White House on infrastructure, unless they actually want Democrats to keep the majority next year. It's one big set up, and it gives Biden the political cover of bipartisanship as he rams through a massive bailout of the very blue states that want to stay locked down and masked up forever. The Senate Republicans should do to the Democrats what the red state governors did to the CDC, just tuned them out. Joining us now is Phil Klein, editor at \"National Review.\" Philip, Senator Joe Manchin today revealed that the real goal of this infrastructure bill is if a bipartisan infrastructure bill falls apart, everything could fall apart. Phil, how stupid do the Republicans look, like, of course, Cassidy in Louisiana, Romney, et cetera, for being rolled on this? PHILIP KLEIN, EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW ONLINE\": It's ridiculous. For months, the argument that defenders of this bipartisan charade have been making to a lot of conservatives has been, well, if we get this bipartisan, this smaller bipartisan deal, than it will convinced moderates such as Manchin and Sinema to oppose the bigger deal. And you could say that there is some logic to that, right. It's better to spend $600 billion then $3.5 trillion, right? But Manchin just gave away the game now. What he's saying is that, actually, the opposite of what Republicans have been arguing to conservatives is true, that is that the bipartisan bill is actually greasing the wheels for the larger bill, so that if they want the whole $4 trillion spending with expanding Medicare and Medicaid, childcare, Green New Deal, all of these things sandwiched in, that they need the bipartisan deal. Manchin needs to go back to West Virginia and say he cut this bipartisan deal."

But Schumer is saying that they are going to stay through August recess to get this done. But the fact that Democrats and Biden are so desperate for this bipartisan deal, and the fact that they have allowed these talks to go on for so long, suggest that they are really desperate for this bipartisan deal."

Look no further than what we learned from \"Axios\" tonight -- 50,000 illegal immigrants have been released into the country without a court date and told to report to an ICE office instead. Just 13 percent have showed up so far. Senator Hawley joins me now. Senator, they won't come out and say it, but you can't convince me that this isn't what they Democrats want, a massive influx of humanity into the United States."

And I think one of the reasons that Secretary Mayorkas wouldn't say that their plans weren't working, he just wouldn't answer that question, is because there plan is an open border. Their plan is amnesty. And their plan is to dismantle ICE. And by the way, they're doing every single one of those things. And they're trying to call it different things. They're trying to label it in different ways. They're trying to hide it. But when you look at what's happening, you see a border that is open, you see easy effective amnesty for criminals. And then you see them taking away ICE's enforcement capability. This is their plan, and they are executing on it. And boy, is it bad for this country."

We've got 88 countries that are coming across the border. They don't have vaccines, so none of them are vaccinated, and they're getting dispersed throughout the country.\" For that, Senator Hawley, Governor Reynolds was attacked by Joe Henry, state political for Latin American Citizens Group, and said that Reynolds comments amounted to \"hate-mongering.\" So Senator, this really isn't about the COVID, really. It's not about COVID. This is about protecting the sensitivities of illegals against apparently name-calling, what they were called for decades in the U.S. code, aliens."

But, at the same time, to allow a flood of illegal immigrants across the border, it's not as if we're testing people when they come across. They are allowed into the country, allowed into the interior of the country. And the Biden administration just doesn't care. On the one hand, they it's a public health crisis. On the other hand, they're doing nothing at the border to try to stem it. So this is part of their plan, Laura. The truth is they want an open border, and that's what they're getting."

But their plan is working because they want to bring in, as they already have this year, double the size of the city of Cleveland, 1 million people so far have been apprehended at the border, 1 million. There is some good news, Senator. I've got to get to this. This is fresh polling from the NRCC see saying seven out of 10 voters in battleground districts expressed high levels of concern about rising prices and the higher cost of living. Further voters in these battleground districts trust Republicans over Democrats in Congress to deal with crime and public safety. Independents and Hispanics, Senator, also disapproving of Biden's handling of the border crisis by a staggering 23 percentage points. This is terrible news for the Democrats, and maybe there is a silver lining here at least for next year's midterm. Senator, your thoughts?"

The American people don't want the crimewave that he is allowing to crash all over the country. The American people don't want runaway inflation, yet he's allowing and pushing forward all of these things. And when it comes to the border, Laura, you look at the chaos there, you look at the violence, you look at the drugs that are coming across, it's insane. And the American people don't want it. And I think they are trying to send Joe Biden a message, and he is not listening."

The question of abortion legislation should be returned to the states.\" Senator, given some wobbly members of the Supreme Court, their very averse to rocking the boat, especially with this court commission bubbling over with potential court packing in the offing.

That's a decision that I think is a historically unjust decision, Laura, one of the worst decisions in American history -- 62 million innocent unborn babies have lost their lives since Roe. And listen, the state of Mississippi, who is the lead plaintiff in this case, petitioner, has asked the court to overturn Roe. That was the right thing to do, to ask them. And I'm proud to ask for the same, and joined by Senator Lee, Senator Cruz. We're asking the court to do the same. So we'll see. I'm hopeful that the court will see that they committed a historic injustice when they just invented this constitutional right to an abortion all these years ago, and now it's time to put it right."

      "utterance": "A disturbing story tonight of high-level intimidation campaigns being used at the top of our military, as recounted by a retired Marine, Josiah Lippincott. He said on July 22nd, Major General Patrick Donahoe, the commanding general of Fort Benning, reported from his official Twitter account that he was seeing a surge surgeon in ICU visit among young soldiers due to COVID. He reported he would mandate the vaccine if he had the power to do so. Then Josiah replied, pointing out that the DOD had lost a total of 26 out of over 2 million personnel to the virus. In the fourth quarter of 2020 alone, 26 additional servicemembers took their lives compared to the prior year. General Donahoe accused Josiah of engaging in false equivalency and of downplaying the vaccine. He also tweeted at the university where Josiah is now a student, at Hillsdale College, and told them \"come get your boy\" for questioning the military's quarantine and lockdown policies. Joining me now is Josiah Lippincott, former Marine officer. Josiah, this is such a wild, wild story. First of all, I love Hillsdale. Second of all, is General Donahue the norm in our military leadership today?"

These guys spent 20 years in Afghanistan, spent $2.4 trillion of American taxpayer money, we lost 2,300 servicemembers, and we left Bagram Air Force base in the middle of the night. Americans should be angry, they should be demanding answers. So instead of this January 6th commission, I suggest we have a commission on the wars in the Middle East. Bring these guys before Congress and make them testify as to what they were doing. This disconnect from reality has been there for a long time, and it needs to be held to account."
