You know, it is, is that something that you're pursuing with the White House in terms of a possible pardon for him to say that the time served is enough.

And these are moments that we'll never get back. My -- Rod sentences at least, double that of any other elected official up until that point. And it's outrageous for what the charges are.

However, their case has no legal merit that he was convicted not of 18 counts, 13 were upheld on appeal. The five that were dismissed were because of bad jury instructions on a technicality. He was convicted of wire fraud attempting to solicit bribes, and not just in the case of the -- of the Obama Senate seat. He was convicted of extorting a children's hospital for a $50,000 contribution in order to release money to them. He was convicted of extorting racetrack owners of it before he were refusing to sign legislation for racetrack. So, there's a lot of stuff that was going on here.

And we don't really understand everything that's going on, and we don't understand are they politically motivated or they not? And that's where I think that she raises a lot of interesting points at a time where we ought to be thinking about these sorts of things. From the beginning, the reason the investigation into the Trump campaign and into the -- into those around Donald Trump is so alarming. The reason to constitute a major constitutional question is for exactly, the reasons that she enunciated even though, she may -- you know, they may not be the best case for this. But, the idea that you would have, these -- you know, witch hunts that Donald Trump calls, but these investigations into politicians.

And so, I think what Patti Blagojevich is doing, and I totally feel for her -- you know, losing a husband and a father for that time. But I think what she is doing is trying to appeal to Donald Trump, even here tonight and to make the case to President Trump. Hey, we have a problem similar to yours. If you have a grudge against law enforcement if you see law enforcement as excessive in the use of their powers and abusive. Then, guess what, I'm the perfect case for you to use. And we know that President Trump is pardon Joe Arpaio, right? President Trump has gone out of the way to pardon Dinesh D'Souza, right?

So if this is true, this represents a glimmer of hope for the White House amidst some rocky negotiations that began in secret during the early days of the 2016 election and tonight we are getting a closer look at one part of how the Trump-Kim negotiations found their beginnings in an American tragedy that is detailed in a deeply researched new story in G.Q. Magazine. It is called the untold story of Otto Warmbier. It digs into the secret talks that took place to bring the American college student home, describing what happened to Otto as \"even more shocking than anyone knew.\" Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast newsroom tonight with the story. Good evening, Trace."

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. G.Q. is reporting that in June of last year President Trump signed off on a secret mission to send a planeload of diplomats and doctors into North Korea to bring Otto Warmbier home. The article says Mr. Trump told then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to \"take care of Otto.\" But at the time it was also known that Warmbier who had been held for 15 months was unconscious. His parents were told by their home state of Ohio Senator Rob Portman that their son had brain damage yet they held out hope that he was in a medically induced coma. That hope faded when the plane carrying their son arrived back in Cincinnati and they saw him strapped to a stretcher jerking violently and howling. Doctors still don't know what caused the injuries but there was talk of torture and coercion as evidenced by Warmbier's confession statement in February 2016. Watch."

So here now a man who is mentioned quite a bit in this story. He was a crucial part of the secret negotiations with North Korea. Mickey Bergman, Executive Director of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement has worked on these kinds of cases for years bringing back hostages. Mickey, thank you very much for being here. First of all your reaction to the suggestions in this story."

      "speaker": "MICKEY BERGMAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, RICHARDSON CENTER FOR GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the story is thorough, it's deep, it takes into account a lot of different interviews. Governor Richardson and myself were interviewed by the reporter several times and the reporter did a good job. There's parts of all of this that none of us know and I think you just touched on it in your coverage. There's no doubt and I got a chance to see Otto when he came back to Ohio of the damage that he had but as we heard we don't know exactly what caused it and I think Fred and Cindy, his parents know everything that they need to know. The North Koreans killed their son and they're looking for accountability and there should be accountability and that's it's a tragedy. And at the same time, I also want to remind you that what happened to Otto is the exception to other cases that we've seen in North Korea. I was on your show a few months ago when we welcome back three other Americans coming back and they were healthy. There's a lot of mystery around what happened over there."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He's a young man with his whole future ahead of him who according to them you know took some piece of propaganda to bring home as a souvenir and then saw his entire life end. He was going to be there for the foreseeable future 15 years and there's a suggestion in here that that may have led possibly to something that led to you know, the oxygen being caught off to his brain and even the suggestion that he may have tried to take his own life. His parents have not responded to this story. They do not believe that that is the case in any way. But even if that were the story, what is still clear is that doing this current -- and you say that what they routinely do is put them in a room, question them for sometimes 15 hours on end and mental torture is absolutely part of the equation in all the cases."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERGMAN",
      "utterance": "Correct and especially when you think about Otto being there we know what was happening here. We know that there was a movement, that there was attempt to get him. We don't know that he knew any of it. It is possible for somebody in isolation like that to be told many things that can be really devastating in any way or form. I know it might sound not so serious but for somebody saying hey, your parents don't care about you. Your parents admitted your fault. Your government is shying away. All those things when they repeated at you and you have no outlet can get you. So there's -- again, what the exact cause of Otto's condition I think we are not going to find out but the overall responsibility and accountability for itself no matter how it took place was the North Korean government and I think that's the important thing for Fred and Cindy."

In terms of what we're seeing now, the dismantling of this facility and their nuclear operations, how optimistic are you that they want to move forward with these -- with this dismantling. What do you think is going on?"

      "utterance": "I think what we saw today, the image is a very good sign. It means that Secretary Pompeo managed to get back on track after a bumpy visit he had. And I think what we -- what's important for us to understand that we're looking at the post at the timing of position, at a period of positioning by both sides. The summit last month was very good. It allowed the two leaders to meet but he did not produce a workable framework which was the task of Secretary Pompeo since. And so when Secretary Pompeo meets harsh language when he visits North Korea, that's the North Koreans positioning. When Secretary Pompeo goes to the U.N. as they did last week to reinstate maximum pressure, that's the U.S. positioning. So we're going to see this. It's going to be bumpy and we need to -- we need to remember not to -- not to cry all is lost every time there is a setback and not to celebrate mission accomplished every time we have a step forward. There's going to be a long and bumpy road ahead."

His people are fighting back. The shocking news story about Bill Cosby. And Republicans slammed the President for extending a lifeline to farmers who are hard hit by his tariffs.

You know, there are both of those, they're top five trading partners for the United States. A lot of corn, a lot of soybeans, a lot of meat products are exported to both of those countries and I think what we are being told is that would be the model. And so we would like to see NAFTA done so we can continue to see trade agreements with other countries. That's what the administration said they preferred instead of larger multilateral trade agreements, they would rather see unilateral or bilateral trade agreement. And so, we're anxious to see those take place so our commodities continue to flow to these other countries."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, obviously the president is very concerned about people in your situation and generally part of his base and he does not want to lose your support and here's one of the tweets that he put out today. \"Tariffs are the greatest. Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on trade negotiations negotiate a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs. It's as simple as that and everybody is talking. Remember, we are the piggy bank that is being robbed. All will be great.\" And earlier today he said, \"you've got to stick it out, you've got to fight. Nobody else fought it.\" So he's essentially asking for your patience and saying that in the end it will pay off for you. Do you believe that?"

Secretary Perdue has said multiple times as farmers if we raise the commodities and the crops that the government will find a home for those and will sell those for us, and so we believe that. We want to actually, you know, we want to see that take place and happen. So, you know, we, farmers are free-trade people. We want free trade, we want fair trade. We want open markets. You know, we are over producers in this country, the U.S. farmers are, and so we produce way more than what the American citizens can consume, so we have to have a market and export those for our market around the world. You know, 95 percent of the population lives outside of the United States."

But when we have trade disruptions that we now we believe illegal retaliatory tariffs against our farmers, then they need some help and that's exactly what the president has promised, and that's what he has delivered. Our farmers, if there were open trade around the world, they would benefit greatly, and that's what we would like to see. There have been non-tariff barriers for years and China has cheated ever since they got in the WTO. So this is what the president is the first want to call them on it and that's what we need, someone to play fair."

      "utterance": "It is. It's a temporary measure so we can get these trade disruptions resolved. The president wants trade more than anyone. He wants free and fair trade. Even our allies at the E.U. have non-tariff barriers that are damaging our farmers. Our farmers are the most competitive in the world. If you turn them loose with reciprocal trades, they can outcompete anyone in the world, and that's why we face these unfair trade practices from around the world."

His Cosby show, his stand-up act, a fatherhood book, all considered to be a role model for people across the country until it all came crashing down with sexual assault convictions. And today a Pennsylvania board recommended the 81-year-old, who is now under house arrest while he waits for sentencing, which could be 15 years long, while he's doing that at home is declared potentially a sexually violent predator. That's under advisement in Pennsylvania right now. So if the judge approves it, it would mean he has to register with the police for life, undergo mandatory sex offender counseling once a month and if he's released from prison, the neighbors would be alerted to his location. So how did this man get here? Joining me now, Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas Governor and a Fox News contributor. You know, it just occurred to me when I looked at this today. We've all watched the story, governor, as it has unraveled. But it just makes you question, you know, who we hold up as role models and how this kind of person ends up with this kind of situation surrounding them. It's just so disheartening."

But I feel sorry for the country because he did a lot to change even the mind of people regarding race because he played an upper-middle-class African-American father, extremely successful, great family. Changed the whole view and made it so mainstream and took away a lot of stereotypical and racist roles for African-Americans up until that point. And all that is gone. It's tragic."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And unfortunately, he joins people of all races who find themselves in this situation in the current world that we are living in and you just realize that there are so many people who believe that pushing the lines with people and crossing the lines and getting people to do things that they don't want to do is far, far too frequent in this society in terms of what they may see as sexual promiscuity, which is interpreted which is not, which is actually a violation of someone's freedom and liberty. But one of the things that you pointed out in your -- in what you sent over to me earlier is this. The whole fatherhood issue and the fact that he at one point in his career was very committed and was actually, you know, ruffling a lot of feathers in terms of encouraging black fathers in this country to take responsibility and do not abandon your children and to make sure that they are raised in homes with two parents."

He made it very clear that nobody should go around saying I'm the victim, because what you should do is take responsibility for your life, your actions and at that he was the iconic American dad. He gave us a picture that we didn't have really since father knows best back in the '50s. So it was an incredible role. And Bill Cosby owned -- he owned the '80s on television. His show was number one for five years that it was on the air and always in the top 20. And yet what we see I think from this, Martha, is that the people that we can look to as role models because of their public persona may be very different in private and it gives us pause, but it shouldn't take away that the role he played is a role that fathers should seek to be, and I pray that that won't get destroyed."

So what's behind this and do the alternative straws that are being offered even work? John Stossel, author of \"No, They Can't: Why Government Fails but Individuals Succeed.\" So this weekend, you know, I was out, I had of couple meals out, lunch, dinner, cocktail, everything. It came with a straw that eventually in the hot sun, like, started falling apart in the middle of drinking it and you can get to the bottom of it. So what's going on?"

San Francisco which, you know, there is a Daily Wire piece today that talks about how they think ridiculous it is that San Francisco is considering banning straws. It says, \"The proposed ban comes at a time when San Francisco is currently experiencing a public health crisis, becoming a city whose sidewalks are frequently littered with urine, feces, and discarded syringes. A web site that allows residents to request maintenance has received 16,000 complaints with the keyword feces in last week.\" OK. So that's the really disgusting problem they have on their hands but they are very excited that they have outlawed straws."

Quote, \"here is Senator Hatch preparing for an interview just weeks ago, alive and well.\" And this the senator's 84th birthday back in March, the theme was bacon, always a good theme when you're turning 84, and he even provided this video evidence.

He's a great guy, and we wanted him to come on tonight to prove it, so maybe he'll come tomorrow night. But, so what do you think about the straw thing? Because I'm already getting some pictures of sea turtles with the straw in their nose, and we're going to find out whether those pictures are actually accurate because we might have to revisit. But this is the straw cleaner that comes with the portable straw that you can carry around. So do you like that kind or this kind, you can email us at thestory@foxnews.com and we wish you --"
