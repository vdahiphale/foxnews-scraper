I think a normal press corps would be very interested in getting answers to that. And this is again just a tiny part of a much large scandal that also news break about Senators Grassley and Senator Graham did a criminal referral of Christopher Steele that verifies a lot of what that Nunes memo last week said, that there was the use of this unverified, salacious dossier, that they didn't tell the court that this was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee, and that they didn't corroborate this in any meaningful sense.

It went out higher in the FBI. It went up higher in the Justice Department. Just recently, a top Obama State Department official said she knew about the dossier in July which was really early.

      "utterance": "Right. That's where they're going to have to work some more wonders behind closed doors because that's right. The House has the Freedom Caucus that is supposed to stand up and object to this on budgetary reasons. And then you're going to have this roaring left saying we didn't get an agreement on a DACA fix so we can't vote for anything. Again, I don't know -- I think you can probably see a situation where Donald Trump gets on the phone and bends enough ears and minds among those fiscal hawks in the Freedom Caucus to get the numbers to where they need to be, and then they lose the liberal Democrats on the House side but they get it through. Maybe that's an optimistic scenario but that's where I see the map going."

And just moments ago we saw a picture of the shoes she was wearing. If those are the shoes that she was wearing, regardless of where you are on the positions that Nancy Pelosi hold, I have to take my hat off to her. She's wearing those four- inch stilettos the entire time on this eight hours, that's a sacrifice."

      "utterance": "And just long speeches in general are admirable. It's something you used to see a lot in the Senate and see in the House. And people have stopped talking through issues or advocating for their beliefs. So it is admirable to see someone giving an eight hour speech. At the same time it does feed into these problems the Democrats have right now which is they care more about noncitizens than citizens and they are willing to do a lot of work on behalf of noncitizens without thinking through the people who will actually be eligible to vote for them."

      "utterance": "The problem for Pelosi is that a lot of her base thinks this is just show anyway. She was part of this deal. She was part of the leadership that came to this deal. And they said it's really nice that you go out and give an eight-hour speech, we're glad you're on our side. But you are just going to agree to it when crunch time comes. So this was really a very, very long virtue signaling from the minority leader telling the key constituent groups that she's on their side even though they are about to just put DACA off to the side."

      "utterance": "OK, let's talk about the news texts that we're seeing more of today put together by Senator Ron Johnson. Some of these have been released between, again, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. One of them comes on September 2nd, 2016, and says \"TP for D,\" apparently making a we think, talking about talking points for Director Comey, Page said, \"Yes, because POTUS wants to know everything we're doing.\" There was some speculation that was about the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but now there is talk that that was about the Russia potential collusion investigation, A.B. But it's now raising more questions and more criticism for these people who were so intimately involved with both of those investigations."

    {
      "speaker": "STODDARD",
      "utterance": "Right, but the Wall Street Journal reported this afternoon they think from their reporting they have concluded that Senator Johnson is incorrect and that this was a president asking for intelligence on Russian meddling because he was going to face Putin in person in the coming days. I think Peter Strzok and Lisa Page have had their -- everyone is made up their minds about what they were doing. We don't know the answer to the question what the insurance policy is that they discussed in Andy's office, and that is the office of Andrew McCabe. He has since left, the deputy FBI director. There are a lot of questions that I have, but I think I'm going to with the Wall Street Journal reporting on this until further notice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "That is what's interesting about the Wall Street Journal reporting. Initially some people thought it had to do with the old Hillary Clinton email investigation, learning that it's in fact about Trump-Russia meddling election is far more interesting. When was Obama first briefed on the Trump components of that investigation? When did he first learn about the dossier? I think a normal press corps would be very interested in getting answers to that. And this is again just a tiny part of a much large scandal that also news break about Senators Grassley and Senator Graham did a criminal referral of Christopher Steele that verifies a lot of what that Nunes memo last week said, that there was the use of this unverified, salacious dossier, that they didn't tell the court that this was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee, and that they didn't corroborate this in any meaningful sense. So having that corroboration not just from the House but the Senate that there are problems with our surveillance authorities is also big news."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Byron, why do you think that that memo didn't get a lot of attention yesterday when it came out? Because what essentially Grassley had done is they sent this for a criminal referral back in January, but what they essentially asked the FBI do is to un-redact it as much as possible so that they could release the memo. This is prepared by different people, a different body than Devin Nunes, and it does, as Mollie said, seem to lay out many of these same claims, almost exactly as we saw in the House memo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "I think it didn't get as much attention because a lot of people, certainly all Democrats and a lot of people in the press had already pronounced the House memo a dud. So it's all over. This was, you're right, a separate investigation coming to this conclusion separately, and certainly people in the House committee are frustrated today that this is not getting more attention because they do feel it is corroboration for their findings. On the dossier, one of the themes we have been seeing in recent months on this dossier is that we are learning every day that knowledge of the dossier went up higher and further around in the Obama administration that we previously knew. It went out higher in the FBI. It went up higher in the Justice Department. Just recently, a top Obama State Department official said she knew about the dossier in July which was really early. There'd only been one or two installments of it at that point. So the idea of asking whether they were talking to the president about that on September 2nd is not a crazy idea at all."
