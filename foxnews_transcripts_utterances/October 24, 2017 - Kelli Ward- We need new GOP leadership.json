Read Joe Lieberman's speech, a full-bore Democrat then attacking and criticizing Bill Clinton, just demolishing him for his behavior, and this goes way back in American history, so it's not groundbreaking. I like Jeff Flake, I like Bob Corker, I think they're good men, but I don't find what they're saying persuasive or convincing. If you say, as Jeff Flake you have him quoted there saying \"coarseness and decency,\" you know, \"terrible disunity in the country.\" Therefore, I'm going to quit. It just doesn't add up. So, he and Corker are quitting, which is a victory for Donald Trump. And now we'll see, we'll see what the challenges are as you rightly said. We'll see what happens with the Bannon candidates and others. I just hope we're selective. I just hope we don't throw out everybody. There were some very, very good Republican Senators.

I never -- when he was taking this country down the tubes economically, taking all of America, black America, white America down the tubes, I didn't hear this kind of criticism. So, I think a lot of this is very personal and it does go back, as you said in the lead, you're right, this is November 8th, this is the election: people are still fighting this election."

Your friends -- our friends at \"Fox and Friends\" go to those diners and they talk to people there. Donald Trump talks like people talk when they're having breakfast in a diner, maybe sometimes talk, some people talk after having a beer somewhere else. But it's direct talk, it's straight talk.

You've to get after China and Mexico for the importation of this Fentanyl and Heroin. You've to get the drug dealers off the street. It does make a difference, the supply.

We're going to talk to two of the biggest names behind those probes: Congressman Trey Gowdy and Senator Chuck Grassley, both join me next. Plus, President Trump goes to the Hill for lunch with some senators after a tweet storm over breakfast. He wants to get tax reform done. Tony Sayegh from Treasury will join me with what he thinks -- about how things went today for that big lunch. Also, there's going to be lots of little Moanas out there this Halloween.

That's the allegation. But, Martha, it's more than that, there were Democrats who were really unhappy with the Department of Justice last fall; there are Republicans that were unhappy earlier in the year, and that's the one entity that everyone has to have confidence in. Even if you disagree with the decisions that are reached, you have to understand those decisions and you have to have confidence that they were apolitical. So, Chairman (INAUDIBLE) and I came up with really six questions that we think are pretty evenly divided in terms of what Democrats want to know and what Republicans. And the Department of Justice is not above scrutiny, and they're not above review. I've great respect for them, but they are not above scrutiny. In 2016, in my opinion, left a lot of unanswered questions for the department."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And one of those is why they Hillary Clinton investigation was discussed and the Trump investigation in terms of the possibility of Russian collusion was not discussed. But in terms of what you just mentioned, the political aspect of this, is there any evidence that Loretta Lynch made a phone call that she asked anyone before she took that meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "If there's evidence of that, Martha, I haven't seen it and it has not been brought to my attention, but you put your finger on exactly what you need to have investigations. You need to come up with a list of witnesses, and, of course, she's on that witness list, and then you need to access the documents. Again, you and I are having this conversation because someone sought to access documents from the Department of Justice, so you do all of that, and then you do your interviews, transcribed interviews, which is my preferred way of doing it. And whatever you learn, you share in a public forum. But you don't start with public hearings, you end with public hearings. You have to do the hard work of investigating before you get to that point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And in terms of that, do you expect that you will have access to anyone at the FBI who may have been privy to the writing of the Jim Comey draft when he started to put that together two months before reaching his conclusion about Hillary Clinton?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDEY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's a really good question, and that will be up to the Department of Justice. And so far, in some instances, we have gotten no better cooperation from the current Department of Justice than we did, their predecessors. So, that remains to be seen, whether or not the Department of Justice is cooperative, I would remind them of this: Congress created them; Congress funds them and no entity is above oversight. I get oversight done on me every two years for sure and more often -- more frequently than that. The Department of Justice is not above having to explain the decisions they reached or do not reach. And it doesn't have to be adversarial, but so far, it's been really difficult to get information from this Department of Justice and I would recommend that they change that posture."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, I would tell Secretary Clinton, and Mr. Connors, and Mr. Cummings, Republicans don't get to write the headlines. We don't get to decide what the media covers and what they don't cover. God knows they've been covering Russia since January. I spent all day in a skiff, interviewing witnesses related to the Russia investigation. So, I don't know where Mr. Connors or Mr. Cumming or Secretary Clinton were today, but I know where I was, which is investigating allegations of collusion. So, I'm at peace with what I'm doing, but Congress is actually capable of doing more than one investigation at a time, and there was a time when Democrats did not think Jim Comey was the second coming of Christ. Remember last fall, Harry Reid wanted him prosecuted for a hatchet violation."

There has not been a single witness who has provided a single piece of evidence supporting collusion, coordination or conspiracy, but we are not through with the investigation."

Is the FBI trying to not let the public know exactly what went on in that investigation? Maybe why they had some plea agreements that maybe weren't as strong as they should have been.

We've had weeks of progress and momentum building on tax reform and, frankly, it started when senators like Bob Corker voted in the senate budget committee for a budget that made it clear that we were going to get what we needed through the reconciliation instructions as a vehicle to pass tax reform. The full house passed it, the senate passed, and now the house is going to pass again, hopefully on Thursday or this week. The budget that's going to take us to being able to vote on tax reform. So we feel that the president has been working very well and very closely with leadership, with other members, and we're going to get this done and get it done this year because the middle class and workers and our businesses need tax reform immediately.

You know, it's interesting, as you just pointed out, Bob Corker voted in favor of the budget. Senator Flake and Senator Corker have voted with the president I think 92 percent of the time. So how did these relationships where they're voting and they're supporting with the president wants to pass and they want to pass obviously, how do these relationships get so bad?"

We look at, for example, a state like Tennessee, Bob Corker state, where during the eight years of President Obama's term unemployment averaged 7.6 percent. During this first year of President Trump's term, Tennessee unemployment is around 3 percent. His economic policies are great for both Arizona, Tennessee. I think these senators know that. And I think they know it good for the country. And it's very important to remember that whatever personally they might feel or might say the party has been unified by this president around tax reform. And that's why we're at a position now, Martha, despite a lot of skepticism throughout the year, that we're going to get it done and we might even get some bipartisan support on this."

I think they all know, and it's been made very clear that it's really been the president's leadership that is going to be able to take us over the finish line on tax reform. I think that something that almost unanimously is understood. And we have been working again extraordinarily well together from when this process began back in April with Secretary Mnuchin, with Director Cohn from the White House here, working with the congressional leadership on the framework that we released.

But because he -- you know, there's the art of the deal, and the negotiation he puts out that marker, and I think even if he falls short of it in the end, a little bit short of it in the end, he considers that a win. But he doesn't seem to mind letting people know where he stands on the top tax bracket, or the 401(k) issues, or the 15 percent, right?"

He wants to make sure that the code is simplified and that we get rid of special interest loopholes and deductions, and he wants to make sure that we give our businesses the most competitive rates in the world so we can have a tax system that actually incentivizes the growth of American jobs and American wages that helps American workers in our economy."

As a matter of fact, I myself was there four years ago visiting our troops and seeing firsthand what they were doing to help the local military improve their capability so they can deal with their terrorist problem on their own without us having to come and do it."

So I don't know how Senator Schumer and, certainly, Senator Graham, who was obviously very well-versed in these things, wouldn't be up on that, right?"

      "speaker": "THORNBERRY",

Well, I think there's two different things, one is it has been difficult to get the details of this particular incident, and partly that's because the Pentagon is still putting them together. But it's a separate question to say whether we have troops there or not. That has been public information. I think, Martha, you really hit on the key point that we ought to be looking at, and that is -- is our military stretched too thin? Do we give appropriate support, including intelligence assets, to our folks who are out there on the front lines protecting us here at home? And unfortunately, we've cut the military budget of about 20 percent over the last seven years. So whether you're just talking about destroyers in the Pacific, or these folks pursuing terrorists in Africa, or a variety of other things, we are really stretched too thin."

So we're starting to get a little bit more information about this. You know, some of this may change, obviously, as we get more. I know you're going to have a closed door hearing that the senators will have, and the congressman will have as well on this topic. But that they were in search of ISIS recruiter and that possibly the ambush was a set up that perhaps the villagers that they were meeting with may have tipped off these terrorists?"

      "speaker": "THORNBERRY",

And that's one of the fundamental questions that will have to be answered. There's no doubt that there are terrorist groups in this area and they move across borders, and it is because the distances are so vast, it is a big challenge for the local militaries, even without advice and assistance, to find these terrorists and to stop them. So there are a variety of missions, they change all the time. It's a very fluid situation, but that's even more reason to have the adequate support, whether it's airplanes, drones, or whatever it is to back them up."

Dana Loesch and Michael Starr Hopkins, who is a costume expert, join us to debate that, coming up."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Developing tonight, Catholics may be considered a hate group at Georgetown University, which ironically is the nation's oldest Catholic university. A group called Love Saxa, a group that advocates that marriage is between a man and woman is now under fire from LGBT groups on campus. The students filed a complaint saying that the group's definition of marriage violates the university standards by promoting hate or intolerance. That complaint could strip Love Saxa of all funding and ban it from using campus facilities. Joining me now is Dana Loesch, host of Dana on the Blaze TV, and Michael Starr Hopkins, Democratic strategist who worked for both the Obama and Hillary Clinton campaign. So this up first, it is just astonishing to me that a Catholic university could ban an organization that promotes basically the values that the university is founded on and has to ascribe to as a Catholic Jesuit university, Dana. DANA LOESCH, HOST OF \"DANA\" ON THE BLAZE TV: No, I agree with you, Martha. It seems weird to me, and I can't stand this tactic of defining that with which we disagree as hate. Just because you disagree with it doesn't make it hateful. Just because it isn't your belief, that doesn't make it hateful either. You know, it seems pretty close-minded to refuse the same courtesy of equal existence on a college campus to groups with whom you disagree."

They wrote an editorial, Love Saxa, they say their definition of marriage does not include same-sex couples, and we believe that marriage is a conjugal unit on every level, emotional, spiritual, physical, mental, directed towards the carrying of biological children. To us, marriage is more than commitment of love between two consenting adults. So Michael, they're saying to us, you know, in our organization, and what we write about and what we talk about, this is what we believe, so why -- how does that seem as hate or intolerance?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But Georgetown is a Catholic university, it's not a public university. So if Georgetown won't allow a Catholic group -- this girl also wrote an op-ed called confessions of a college virgin, talking about, you know, what she sees as the value of abstinence. These are basic Catholic values, not everyone agrees with them, not even all Catholics agree with them, but, Dana, I think if Georgetown can't back this group, I don't know how they can be a Catholic university?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOESCH",
      "utterance": "Well, and I think we've seen that with a number of Catholic universities, where there is other student groups and just the colleges themselves have been under attack from secular groups. Look, it's a Christian group that has Christian principles. Shocking. I mean, it's the oldest Catholic university in the United States, one of, if not the. So it's not a big surprised to think that there's going to be a student group on campus that perhaps share the same values with which the university was at least founded. Christian groups are allowed to exist and have their own beliefs, it's OK."
