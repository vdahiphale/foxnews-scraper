If you look at President Obama's approval rating at the beginning of the year and the end of last month, beginning of June, 2010, among African-American he has been absolutely steady 91 percent approval and 91 percent approval.

BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: The president with his first major speech on immigration reform, a speech largely devoid of specifics about guest worker programs, work visas, and other specifics that would have to be in a piece of legislation. What about all of this and the debate ongoing? Let's bring in our panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Juan Williams, news analyst for National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Bill?"

This is the first major speech he has given on immigration 18 months into his administration. He promised to introduce legislation in the first year of this two-year congressional session and there is still no legislation and no specifics in this speech. So it is a political speech, not a legislative speech. Nobody expects there to be immigration legislation this year. The reason for the speech, the Gallup poll did an interesting breakdown. If you look at President Obama's approval rating at the beginning of the year and the end of last month, beginning of June, 2010, among African-American he has been absolutely steady 91 percent approval and 91 percent approval. Among white Americans he's been steady -- 41 percent approval, 41 percent approval. His drop came last year. Among Hispanic-Americans this year he has dropped from 69 percent approval to 57 percent approval. He promised improvement on immigration. A lot of Hispanic-Americans care an awful lot about that. There was no movement, and he's trying to buck up his support and the Democratic Party's support among Hispanics."

      "utterance": "I thought Bill Kristol's analysis was on target. If you look at the numbers, the Hispanic community is very upset with this president, the president that they back in the election over a man they knew better, John McCain, and they trusted in the idea of his campaign pledge, that he would act on immigration in his first year in office. Obviously he didn't do it. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. A lot of people thought it would win Hispanic affection and some time for the president, and it has not as you just heard in terms of those numbers. But I think the speech was on target to this extent -- the Republicans are not willing to work with the president on this issue at all. They didn't work with President Bush. I think that is why the issue got stuck back in 2006 when President Bush tried to do it. I think there is intransigence on this issue and a lot of rabble rousing about it. It's interesting, you can listen to Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg, and they say we need some kind of immigration reform in this country, and why can't we get it. It's because at some point it becomes a matter of angry finger pointing and nobody wants to admit what people like Chris Christie and Rick Perry, who say we need to deal with this. If you call it amnesty, my gosh, forget about it."

The president wants to blame Republicans because it's all about politics. This is nothing about legislation. It's typical Obama-style to deliver a speech that even in The New York Times in a news story tomorrow on this speech will say, because it's already online, saying the speech is more about the politics than the legislation. That isn't exactly a right wing source. It's obviously a political attempt to appeal to the base to the election where the party will be in trouble and he needs the base. He is not serious, and yet he attacks the other side for posturing. On the substance of this, he says for example we don't want the Arizona law because we don't want a patchwork of laws to be the national standard. We have a national standard. It's the existing law, which he isn't enforcing. And what he is doing is exactly what Kyl said Obama said to him. Whether or not he said it isn't important. The fact is that the Democrats are holding enforcement hostage in order to get a bargain on amnesty and that is against their constitutional duties. They should enforce the border. Obama said a fence won't solve the whole problem. Nobody pretends it will. It won't solve the problem of the 11 million already here. But it will solve the problem of new immigrants from the south. If you solve that, you would get a national consensus on a humane offer of amnesty and legalization."

The people on the left who said the Arizona law will trigger every other state to do something equally draconian. It's not that draconian. That wasn't true. Citizens in other states had their own judgments and others said we don't need something like Arizona. Arizonans around the border, Jon Kyl is from there, made a different judgment.

I think Bill himself was really wounded by the one statement that Obama made in 2008 where he said Reagan was the president of historic consequence and Clinton was not. It enraged Clinton. I don't think he forgets easily. Secondly, we have a tradition here where for ex-presidents we get nostalgic and they become popular in time. Look at the elder Bush. Even though he lost the reelection he became extremely popular afterwards. Bill, himself, is extremely popular. And his wife, secretary of state, and has done nothing of consequence as secretary of state, is therefore quite popular and Obama has done unpopular stuff. I think this is not a challenge, not a conspiracy, not a declaration of war. It's I think the Clintons putting up a flag in the corner of the field as a way of saying we have been here, we're still here. If you need us, we're ready -- we're tan, rested, and ready for the future."

And if you look at the record where the races he intervened, primary races, Pennsylvania with Sestak and Specter, you know what, the president -- you can look at New Jersey. President Obama's campaign trail is not very good. So President Clinton seems to have greater clout in a place like Colorado, and the White House feels like, OK.
