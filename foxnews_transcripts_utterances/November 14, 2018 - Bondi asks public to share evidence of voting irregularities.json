Now, some are actually seen scaling the fence between Tijuana, San Diego. We have the video.

We will reveal how Democrats are trying to rewrite the rules, upend the will of the American people. Once again, the armchair constitutional scholars on mainstream networks, left-wing networks, guess what? Dead wrong again. The Department of Justice, they are standing behind President Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the new acting attorney general. We also have an update tonight. I knew it was coming.

      "sentences": "All right. We've been warning you now for weeks, thousands upon thousands of undocumented migrants, they have been marching towards America, our southern border. Now, the vast majority of these people, I've been saying, I believe are coming here in search of a better life. More opportunity, a land of opportunity, and freedom. But here's the problem. These individuals, they have not been vetted -- no background checks, no criminal history checks, no proof of employment, no family ties to the U.S., no comprehension, in some cases, of what the laws of America are, no case for asylum. Many have no paperwork whatsoever.  But they are demanding entry into the United States. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, the first migrants have now reached our southern border. A group of around 80 migrants that split off from the much larger group, they claimed widespread harassment, mistreatment at the hands of their fellow migrants, and they were able to fast-track their journey north and advance to the United States. According to the \"A.P.\" tonight, while another group of several hundred migrants will arrive the next few days. Now, some have tried to scale the U.S. border fence -- look at these videos -- right near Tijuana. Others crawled through openings forced to crawl back because U.S. border control agents responded and they are about to enforce the law. That is not a good first impression. This is just a small part of how many people are actually coming, and a clear warning of a looming crisis. And according to reports from Mexican officials who as many as 10,000 migrants are just days away. Now, the Department of Homeland Security is warning and they have put out statements that over 270 suspected criminals, gang members, drug traffickers have been blending in with what is mostly a male caravan. We've also learned that some illegal immigrants previously deported from the U.S., they are also attached to the group. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, 7,000 active duty U.S. soldiers, they have been deployed to help secure the southern border. Now, they have been laying razor wire and conducting and constructing other barriers to prevent illegal immigration, protecting our sovereignty, our rule of law. We are a constitutional republic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's important to remember, weeks ago, we witnessed the breaking down of that fence as you can see in southern Mexico in their border, crashing the gates into that country. This is a serious situation and an important reminder about why strong borders the rule of law, and yes, the wall is so important. Now, if the president's plan has been implemented so far for a massive border wall, that had been completed with the big door in it, as he has said, the situation would be mitigated. It would be controlled. As a matter of fact, it would not even be a possibility of some type of confrontation. America needs immigrants. But we have to vet anyone, everyone coming into this country. We have to do everything in our power, other bad people, even if they are mixing in with good people, from entering this country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is the very reason why Democrats few short years ago supported the enforcement of our border laws and our border.

Now, there's nearly 130 million trees that are dead. That have died in the past seven years alone, the government has prevented them from being cleared. For example, quote, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act have hampered tree clearing, controlled burns, timber sales on federal land. The article goes on, quote: California also restricts timber harvesting and requires myriad permits and environmental impact statements to prune overgrown forests. And in California, quote, to burn leaves, tree limbs, land owners must obtain air quality permits. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, these permits are extremely restrictive, can be difficult to produce, controlled maintenance in California's forest, we get these forests put out -- when these fires are put out, this has to be a top priority.

It shouldn't take another fire for laws to be adjusted and all the people in California now in these areas have their lives at risk. And, by the way, our prayers are with all of them.

And Snipes continued to report these ballots in the week following the election. And for days, she wouldn't tell anybody where these ballots were coming from.

The DOJ releasing a 20-page memo explaining the things we told you, that Whitaker is unquestionably authorized to lead the department. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they cited the very law we had cited, a 1998 law that called the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and the Appointment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, adding that there have been, quote, countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally tonight, we're going to end with one very important topic and it's called due process, the presumption of innocence. I have been saying all during the Kavanaugh hearings, a foundational principle in a fair and just society, it has served this country so well, a pillar, our constitutional republic. And, by the way, if you remember during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, we defended this principle from baseless attacks and irresponsible accusations by individuals, some on the left, some for political gain.  And, of course, we have that fame seeking attorney Michael Avenatti who is one of those irresponsible actors. And he brought forth claims from a client who accused Kavanaugh of gang rape almost on a weekend basis and drugging young teenage girls, boys lining up in the hall, and one by one, quote, waiting their turn to rape these young women. There was no evidence, that story eventually changed. Avenatti demanded his client and all others, you know, who had made accusations, that they should all be believed. You might remember this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Now, some are actually seen scaling the fence between Tijuana, San Diego. We have the video. Thousands more just days away marching by foot through Mexico, demanding passage into the U.S. Now, coming up, we'll bring you a full report to what is now becoming potentially a serious situation and show you how the left is trying their best to play it down, ignore what could be a looming crisis. Now, we'll also cover another serious situation, that is these massive, deadly wildfires ravaging California as we speak tonight. By the way, our prayers with everybody out there impacted by this horrific fire. And we have more post absurd election drama out of Florida and Georgia tonight. We will reveal how Democrats are trying to rewrite the rules, upend the will of the American people. Once again, the armchair constitutional scholars on mainstream networks, left-wing networks, guess what? Dead wrong again. The Department of Justice, they are standing behind President Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the new acting attorney general. We also have an update tonight. I knew it was coming. Mueller's which hunt. And, by the way, we have serious news, Michael Avenatti. He is the attorney for Stormy Daniels. Has been arrested on serious charges. And on minutes, I will take on two -- not one, two liberals on everything from the border wall, the Trump agenda, the caravan, you name it, we'll get to it. All right. Sit tight. A lot of news.

      "utterance": "All right. We've been warning you now for weeks, thousands upon thousands of undocumented migrants, they have been marching towards America, our southern border. Now, the vast majority of these people, I've been saying, I believe are coming here in search of a better life. More opportunity, a land of opportunity, and freedom. But here's the problem. These individuals, they have not been vetted -- no background checks, no criminal history checks, no proof of employment, no family ties to the U.S., no comprehension, in some cases, of what the laws of America are, no case for asylum. Many have no paperwork whatsoever.  But they are demanding entry into the United States. And tonight, the first migrants have now reached our southern border. A group of around 80 migrants that split off from the much larger group, they claimed widespread harassment, mistreatment at the hands of their fellow migrants, and they were able to fast-track their journey north and advance to the United States. According to the \"A.P.\" tonight, while another group of several hundred migrants will arrive the next few days. Now, some have tried to scale the U.S. border fence -- look at these videos -- right near Tijuana. Others crawled through openings forced to crawl back because U.S. border control agents responded and they are about to enforce the law. That is not a good first impression. This is just a small part of how many people are actually coming, and a clear warning of a looming crisis. And according to reports from Mexican officials who as many as 10,000 migrants are just days away. Now, the Department of Homeland Security is warning and they have put out statements that over 270 suspected criminals, gang members, drug traffickers have been blending in with what is mostly a male caravan. We've also learned that some illegal immigrants previously deported from the U.S., they are also attached to the group. Now, 7,000 active duty U.S. soldiers, they have been deployed to help secure the southern border. Now, they have been laying razor wire and conducting and constructing other barriers to prevent illegal immigration, protecting our sovereignty, our rule of law. We are a constitutional republic. It's important to remember, weeks ago, we witnessed the breaking down of that fence as you can see in southern Mexico in their border, crashing the gates into that country. This is a serious situation and an important reminder about why strong borders the rule of law, and yes, the wall is so important. Now, if the president's plan has been implemented so far for a massive border wall, that had been completed with the big door in it, as he has said, the situation would be mitigated. It would be controlled. As a matter of fact, it would not even be a possibility of some type of confrontation. America needs immigrants. But we have to vet anyone, everyone coming into this country. We have to do everything in our power, other bad people, even if they are mixing in with good people, from entering this country. This is the very reason why Democrats few short years ago supported the enforcement of our border laws and our border. Remember this?"

Thousands of buildings, homes, other structures destroyed, billions of dollars in damages. And an entire town was even burned to the ground. The devastation was shocking. Tonight many are looking for answers, making a serious case. Could this fire have been prevented? Now, according to The Wall Street Journal editorial board tonight, federal, state, environmental protections have left the drought impacted forest invulnerable to these fires. Now, there's nearly 130 million trees that are dead. That have died in the past seven years alone, the government has prevented them from being cleared."

We cannot put peoples' lives in jeopardy. These fires cause more far worse at environmental damage than a controlled burn, or timber excavation and human lives are irreplaceable here. It shouldn't take another fire for laws to be adjusted and all the people in California now in these areas have their lives at risk. And, by the way, our prayers are with all of them. All impacted by this horrific crisis. Look at that. It is out of control. And we will continue to track this story. But first, we do turn to Florida. The election catastrophe that is ongoing. Tonight, the statewide recount continues with tomorrow's deadline looming. Both Republicans, Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott, they do look poised for victory. And tonight, there are still so many questions surrounding the sketchy actions of Broward County and its supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes.  Now, she somehow managed to magically find -- oh, I found it -- 75,000 purportedly uncounted ballots days and days after election night, by the way, all in violation of state law and the state constitution. And Snipes continued to report these ballots in the week following the election. And for days, she wouldn't tell anybody where these ballots were coming from.

And remember, redistricting, that would have zero impact or effect on the statewide race. But of course, this is nothing new from this crop of radical Democrats.  There seemed to be no moderates left in the party. They are all literally cheering for Robert Mueller. Please, find something, anything. We can't do it on our own. And tonight, we have new developments from that witch hunt. Fox News has learned that President Trump and his legal team are on the verge of making a decision about whether to submit written answers to the special counsel.  That development follows the latest on from Senator Jeff snowflake who again today exposed himself, well, not as a conservative. Now, Majority Leader McConnell flatly rejected Flake's bill for, quote, protecting Mueller to the floor. President said recently he has no plans to do anything with Mueller and Flake is threatening the president, all his Republican colleagues, saying he will oppose all the presidents judicial nominees until he gets his way and the Senate votes on that legislations that supposedly protects Mueller from being fired by the president which isn't happening, blocking conservative judges, breaking a promise to the people you represent in Arizona? Senator Flake, tonight, he should be ashamed. And also breaking tonight, the armchair constitutional scholars on left- wing mainstream so-called media networks and the Democratic Party, they were all wrong. The acting attorney general, as we all told you on this program, Matt Whitaker, he did receive the full backing of the Department of Justice. The DOJ releasing a 20-page memo explaining the things we told you, that Whitaker is unquestionably authorized to lead the department. And they cited the very law we had cited, a 1998 law that called the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and the Appointment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, adding that there have been, quote, countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years. And finally tonight, we're going to end with one very important topic and it's called due process, the presumption of innocence. I have been saying all during the Kavanaugh hearings, a foundational principle in a fair and just society, it has served this country so well, a pillar, our constitutional republic. And, by the way, if you remember during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, we defended this principle from baseless attacks and irresponsible accusations by individuals, some on the left, some for political gain.  And, of course, we have that fame seeking attorney Michael Avenatti who is one of those irresponsible actors. And he brought forth claims from a client who accused Kavanaugh of gang rape almost on a weekend basis and drugging young teenage girls, boys lining up in the hall, and one by one, quote, waiting their turn to rape these young women. There was no evidence, that story eventually changed. Avenatti demanded his client and all others, you know, who had made accusations, that they should all be believed. You might remember this."

He's been charged with a serious charge, and that would be felony, domestic violence. He is denying these allegations. He is proclaiming his innocence. And I will be consistent on the issues of due process and the resumption of innocence. But one can only wonder if now maybe Michael Avenatti would apply the same standard to himself that he had applied to Justice Kavanaugh. Or maybe tonight that he would prefer the country give him due process, and the presumption of innocence. Or will you lock yourself up and just throw away the key? I believe he deserves assumption of innocence, due process. Let the legal system do their job. And hope and pray that the right justice and answer comes through. All right. Joining us now with an update on Florida is the attorney general of that state, Pam Bondi. Pam, thank you for coming back. Let's go to the criminal investigation of what is going on there.

On the flip side, we are working tirelessly right now, constantly, on the civil suits that are being filed, and frankly not by Bill Nelson, but by everybody who's been using him as a pawn."

You're supposed to report every 45 minutes. Other laws that we know have been broken, and it seems like certainly it's been mishandling. I mean, all of a sudden, you find a box of ballots in a rental car in Tampa from Broward County. That seems pretty problematic to me.

I can't discuss any more about it because it is ongoing. And that's much different than the civil lawsuits that have been found. But this is very serious. We are taking it very seriously.

If I'm chairman next chairman, we are going to do judges, judges, and more judges. And at the end of the day, I am convinced that Mr. Mueller will be allowed to do his job. I've not seen one scintilla of evidence of collusion. The obstruction of justice thing never made any sense to me.

Then of course the FISA abuse and FISA court fraud that was committed, the bulk of information being the unverified dossier that not even Christopher Steele would stand by, and of course trying to influence the 2016 election with bought and paid for Russian lies and using the false information circular reporting to also influence the appointment of special counsel. A lot there."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "A lot there, Sean. And I think Senator Graham is right off the money. If we get Senator Graham and he takes the chairmanship of the Senate judiciary committee, I can guarantee you that he's going to move forward with this. The American people need this. They want this to wrap up. They want to know the truth. This is why not only does there need to be an investigation by the Senate judiciary committee, but we also need those documents declassified and only the president can do this. The only way to get to the truth is to get transparency, to get those documents declassified. That's the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on Carter Page. We also need the gang of eight to find her."

      "utterance": "The gang of eight, 302's."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and the 302s by Bruce Ohr. This is what needs to be done now so that we can move forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, it's interesting. Because Donald Trump was able to defy the history of Bill Clinton who lost 60 seats, eight Senate seats in his first midterm. Obama who lost, Gregg, six seats in the Senate but 63 House seats. And he fought to keep the Senate as hard as he did."

    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "It's rather profound now because all of the threats that the Democrats are making, all of this would move right over to the U.S. Senate, wouldn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Right. It's absolutely would."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And oversight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "And Lindsey Graham is the perfect person to conduct the investigation. Because he knows there is a plethora of evidence that there was an illicit scheme by the FBI and Department of Justice to clear Hillary Clinton and frame Donald Trump. And he would reopen the Hillary Clinton email case -- you know, it's a crime for an FBI director or official or agent--"

      "utterance": "Eighteen USC 793 I have it etched in my brain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Yes. It is a crime to hide incriminating evidence and to make a decision about a case, the Clinton case, for political reasons. So Lindsey Graham will investigate that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this. If it's true, all the reports that there are going to be written answers only on Russia, not on any obstruction -- because the president can fire anybody he wants. You know, Jerry Nadler saying, well, he wants to investigate, you know, what the president said -- it's meaningless if he said something, didn't do it. But is this the beginning of the end if, in fact, there is not going to be a subpoena, written answers are going to be handed in? It sounds like the airplane is now heading in for a landing, Sara."

    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "It is. It is. Every source that I've spoken with tonight and over the past week says that Mueller is going to wrap up this investigation. We are not going to see anything happen to President Trump. What we might see is some indictments, maybe Roger Stone, Jerome Corsi who is his assistant, Roger Stone's assistant very closely involved with him. One of the things that I did, Sean, that to me is so important, and there was never any evidence -- never, from the very beginning of this investigation by the FBI, that there was any kind of collusion, which isn't a crime anyway, but there was never any evidence--"

    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "You should be commended for what you said about that. Because everybody, including Michael Avenatti, deserves the presumption of innocence and due process, but isn't it ironic that Avenatti was the one who didn't want to afford due process and presumption of innocence to Brett Kavanaugh?"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Maybe."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "That's the question. You know, does he now believe in that? Because he is claiming his innocence? And as a matter of fact -- thank you, both. We will have a full report and an update on Michael Avenatti's arrest as we continue tonight on HANNITY."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Joining us now with the very latest news on the arrest, serious charges, Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, Fox News Correspondent, Trace Gallagher. Trace, very serious charges, it's a very strong denial by attorney Michael Avenatti. Tell us."

    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Sean. Michael Avenatti was booked on felony domestic violence. The Los Angeles Police Department wouldn't identify the alleged victim or say how Avenatti knew her, but police did say she had visible injuries. And TMZ is reporting the injuries were on her face and were, quote, \"serious.\" There are also reports that Avenatti says she hit him first, calling the situation, quote, \"B.S.\" Police say the alleged violence happened yesterday in West Los Angeles. Avenatti was arrested today and posted a $50,000 bond just a short time ago. When he walked out of jail, Avenatti diplomatically thanked the police for their hard work and then said this. Watch."

      "speaker": "MICHAEL AVENATTI, STORMY DANIELS' ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women's rights my entire career and I'm going to continue to be an advocate. I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Unclear exactly what he's, quote, \"doing,\" but there's been talk of a 2020 presidential run. He was reportedly set to speak this weekend at events for the Vermont Democratic Party but had to cancel. Avenatti became well known for being Stormy Daniels' attorney and then brought forward serious allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Those allegations were later knocked down. We don't know when the Avenatti has to appear in court again. Sean?"

      "utterance": "OK. And these are felony charges, correct, that we are looking at?"

      "utterance": "All right. Trace Gallagher, thank you. I do believe in due process, presumption of innocence. And it should take place here as well.  Let not your heart be troubled.
