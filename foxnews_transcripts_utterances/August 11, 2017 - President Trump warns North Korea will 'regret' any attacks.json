Back channels, front channels. You say this. You say that. Bad cop. Good cop. But one of the things he said today, that was interesting Jesse is, he was asked a question about -- somebody said, well, what about when Kim Jong-un says this, and President Trump who had just come from a briefing with his top advisers said, \"I don't think it was he that said that.\" Like he is very specific. Like Kim Jong-un hasn't said anything in three days. So, until I hear him actually say it, I am not going to react.

And he's doing what is very smart is saying, you are not going to not only threaten San Francisco or California. You are not going to threaten Guam. No one knows anything about Guam.

The problem is, I just don't know that Kim knows that. Right? I don't know that Kim sees it that way. We talked about this a little bit last night.

And I actually think the people should have a little bit more strategic patients in this country and see if that might work. Because we're also hearing today in the aftermath of this that there are diplomatic back channels and that there is some sort of a dialogue and I think that's the most interesting thing and to get back to something that you said at the beginning of the show, Greg, you're absolutely right. That you said that this is the part of the presidential orientation that every administration despises. I would say, like North Korea, unfortunately, is part of the three failures.
