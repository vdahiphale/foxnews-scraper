Think they've the inevitable elite chin- stroking about how so many mainstream media outlets should not have rushed to judgment about President Trump. Maybe getting impeached because of the original BuzzFeed story. We were told maybe everybody learned a lesson about fake news. Within hours in this video of the student from Covington Catholic High was posted.

Our correspondent Trace Gallagher is live in a West Coast newsroom with the real story tonight. Good evening, Trace. Good evening, Ed. This is why context is so critical. The early reporting about these Catholic high school students only focused on certain clips of video that appeared to paint them as instigators. And because of that reporting, lawmakers, Native American leaders, the Diocese of Covington, all quickly criticized the student's behavior. But the tape is an hour and 47 minutes long and it starts with a group of five or six Black Hebrew Israelites who believe they are descendants of God's chosen people. And it's the Hebrew Israelites who started calling the student's extremely offensive terms that we cannot repeat. And also call them things like crackers and incest children.

And my mom had shared with me that when she was younger she had an abortion and that when she became pregnant with me at 19, she knew she could never have another one. That was all that I ever knew of the story. And on that day that I was on set when she called me, she had no idea what I was filming. And so, when I went to tell her all about Abby story, I wanted to be gentle and respectful of her feelings because I didn't want her to feel judged. And in explaining Abby's story my mother just broke down completely. And she said, I need to tell you something that I never told you before and I said OK. And she was weeping to the phone. And she said, you don't know this but I was actually on the table, a pregnant nurse came in to examine me and that was when I got up and decided to keep you.

Now in the nearly two years since he went missing the family has quietly worked with the State Department and the FBI to uncover any clues or proof that he is still alive. A Czech ambassador initially confirmed that Majd Kamalmaz was being held in a jail, then the diplomat went silent and the Syrian government denied the claim. Now the family is asking President Trump to help save his life, sending a letter to the president that reads in part, quote, \"Mr. President, you are the only power that is able to bring him safely home to his wife, children, grandchildren, mother, siblings and friends. We have seen your tremendous effort and success in returning American citizens wrongfully detained abroad and write this letter to bring your attention to our father.\" The family believes the president can help because Kamalmaz is one of just a small number of Americans believed to be held by the Syrian government or its allies. Though their hopes were dashed a bit by a recent report out of Syria that claims Layla Shweikani, a 26-year-old Illinois woman was executed by the Syrian government for her pro-democracy work. Though, the Kamalmaz family points out Majd is not an activist. He's a therapist who set up several clinics in Lebanon to help Syrian refugees deal with their trauma. In fact, Kamalmaz is well known for his volunteering time and skills to those in need all over the world. The family says time is also critical because Majd Kamalmaz is diabetic and his health is thought to be in decline. Ed?",

Think they've the inevitable elite chin- stroking about how so many mainstream media outlets should not have rushed to judgment about President Trump. Maybe getting impeached because of the original BuzzFeed story. We were told maybe everybody learned a lesson about fake news. Within hours in this video of the student from Covington Catholic High was posted. And once again, some of the media not only rush to judgment, many on the Left spun the video into some kind of referendum on the president. One Democratic congressman actually calling for a ban on teenagers wearing MAGA hats despite you know, that thing we call the First Amendment. And one celebrity called those hats \"the new white hood\". Well, today is Dr. King Jr. day. He once said, \"Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love could do that.\" So, surely Democrats tonight are building on that positive legacy, right? Think again. Senator Bernie Sanders is flat-out calling the president, a racist. While a deputy to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today, referred to the president as the grand wizard. We'll get to those nasty comments from Democrats in a few moments. But first, that viral clip that has many in the mainstream media backpedaling tonight. The entire video tells a very different story than was originally assumed and reported. Plus, the teen in this video is speaking out, and his school is threatening to sue journalists who got it all wrong. Our correspondent Trace Gallagher is live in a West Coast newsroom with the real story tonight. Good evening, Trace. Good evening, Ed. This is why context is so critical. The early reporting about these Catholic high school students only focused on certain clips of video that appeared to paint them as instigators. And because of that reporting, lawmakers, Native American leaders, the Diocese of Covington, all quickly criticized the student's behavior. But the tape is an hour and 47 minutes long and it starts with a group of five or six Black Hebrew Israelites who believe they are descendants of God's chosen people. And it's the Hebrew Israelites who started calling the student's extremely offensive terms that we cannot repeat. And also call them things like crackers and incest children. Listen."

You can see one of the students takes off his shirt and that's when Native American elder and Vietnam veteran, Nathan Phillips, walks up to the group of students with his drum. Moments later, Phillips and Sandmann are face to face. Some witnesses heard chants of build that wall, but nothing is audible on the video. Though some students are doing tomahawk chops which some consider offensive. But Nick Sandmann says quoting here, \"He looked he locked eyes with me and approached me coming within inches of my face. I believe that by remaining motionless and calm, I was helping defuse the situation.\" Nathan Phillips still contends he was being mocked, and then he said this. Watch."

It's not a democratic problem or a Republican problem. It's not a pro-wall problem or anti-wall problem. But what this video shows is where we have a heart problem. We don't see each other as people.  We see each other by the labels that we carry or he has a MAGA hat or he happens to be Native American. Instead of seeing each other as Americans, one country coming together to form a more perfect union.

And the thing about the boys at this school is that they check off all the boxes or, at least, some of the biggest boxes to trigger left-wing bigotry. They're white, they're male, they're supporters of Donald Trump, and to boot, they're Catholic, that makes -- that those are four of the things that will set off the bigots on the left. And so, people on the left, and I'm afraid a lot of people in the news media want to believe any calumny that is leveled against them. So, when the lies were told about -- you know, then surrounding this Native American and this elder, and mocking him, that's what people wanted to believe because they triggered all these boxes."

      "speaker": "NUNES",

This was the Clinton paid for dirt gleaned from the Russian activists or some type of Russian officers intelligence people given to Christopher Steele and BuzzFeed published this information. OK.  So BuzzFeed along with dozens and dozens of actors of news media people have staked their entire careers on this Russian gambit. And so they are desperate. So every week we have something new, something comes up that this is the end-all be-all and it just so happens that last week BuzzFeed you know, I think was looking for a Hail Mary pass and it just didn't work."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But so -- is Michael Cohen though at this point he was already supposed to be going in early February to the House Oversight Committee to talk more broadly about what he allegedly knows, but he's already been you know, pled guilty to lying to Congress. So how credible could he be on this story anyway?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, you look, I don't know how credibly is. He already was -- he did lie to Congress as you just said. But something also important to note about the so-called Trump Tower meeting. This is the meeting that actually fusion GPS met with the people before and after that meeting. Fusion GPS once again was a Clinton campaign paid for operations out. So they were clearly involved in the setup of the Trump Tower meeting. So if they want to bring Cohen in and talk to him, that's great. We'll participate. But likely, if the truth -- if you really want to get to the truth behind the Trump Tower meeting, Fusion GPS and the Clinton campaign are all over it, probably behind it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "And if you want to talk about the Clinton campaign and Fusing GPS, you have to talk about Bruce Ohr at the Justice Department his wife of course work for Fusion GPS and I find it interesting that a moment ago you were saying many in the media week after week will jump on any anonymous source story that they think fits a narrative against the President. But then you have an on the record a transcript of House Republicans bringing Bruce Ohr in a couple months back and among other things. This is from Kim Strassel in The Wall Street Journal on Friday. Mister Ohr told this team the information in the dossier came from the Clinton camp and warned that it was likely biased, certainly unproven. When I provided, he said, the Steele information in the FBI, I tried to be clear that this is source info, he testified. I don't know how reliable it is. You're going to have to check it out and be aware. These guys were hired by somebody relating to the Clinton campaign and be aware. It sounds to me like he told Republicans in private that he was trying to sound the alarm about the dossier being biased and others at Justice and the FBI did not listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "So why is this important? This is important because if you remember about a year ago, we put out a memo to the American public that was declassified. We want to make sure the American public knew that the Clinton campaign had paid for this dirt. It had not been presented to the FISA Court at all. And we knew that that top people within the DOJ and FBI knew about it. Now, they -- we spent a year they see a year and a half fighting over this information but now we know for certain and now the American people are beginning to find out that not only did top officials know at the FBI, top officials also knew at the Department of Justice including four people that were on the Mueller team. Two have now been fired, one is now the leader of the Mueller team, the so-called attack dog. And so these people have a lot of questions that need to be answered that we in the House, because our investigation continues even though we don't have subpoena power, we will continue to investigate this and bring this information out to the public so the truth gets out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Quick last question. Based on what I just read, is Bruce Ohr a good actor. So many Republicans initially have painted him as a villain.  Is he -- was he being honest Republican or was he just covering his tracks because he's in deep as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I believe that he's telling the truth in his testimony.  I have no reason to not believe that because it actually lines up with a lot of additional information that we know about. So you know, look, the fact that that he -- you know, Bruce Ohr has his own problem because he did not tell the government that his wife was being paid and working for essentially a Clinton campaign operative. But look, there's so much more on these transcripts. They need to all come out. They need to all be made public and there's still additional information that needs to be declassified so the American public has a true understanding of what happened."

      "utterance": "Back in the Obama administration. Yes, back in the summer of 2016, the campaign is going on July 30th. Bruce Ohr has breakfast with Christopher Steele, the British author of the dossier. It's at the Mayflower Hotel here in Washington. He very quickly goes and tells Andrew McCabe who at that time was number two at the FBI, tells him what he has learned from Christopher Steele. And remember at this time, Steele and the ones who know about this are very, very excited about this story of President Trump allegedly in a Moscow hotel room with prostitutes are just buzzing about that. And then we learn Bruce Ohr did go to the Justice Department and he told among other people Andrew Weissmann who is now the top deputy of Robert Mueller, sometimes known as Mueller's pitbull."

Well, I want to show a tweet from Adam Schiff because when you connect the dots and all these stories, I just mentioned to the congressman that in the case of BuzzFeed, anonymous sources right or wrong, correct or incorrect, you've got all kinds of people in Congress and elsewhere running with it and the Ohr story has it got a lot of attention.  Look at Adam Schiff, what he tweeted on Thursday. We checked. It's still up there. The allegation from BuzzFeed that the President United States may have suborned perjury before our committee in an effort to curtail the investigation and cover-up his business dealings with Russia is among the most serious to date. We will do what's necessary to find out if it's true. So here you have Adam Schiff, he's still digging on this story about BuzzFeed whether it's true or not."

One who apparently avoided both was Wilber Martinez-Guzman wanted for a crime spree in Reno, Nevada. Now, initially please thought they had a single burglary and murder, then three days later came another of a 76-year-old woman. Then a third last Wednesday, an 81-year-old couple robbed and shot."

Evidence in his apartment and car connected him to all three crimes and the D.A. expects to file murder charges this week. Now so far police have not revealed exactly what connects Guzman to the victims. Now unlike California, Nevada is not a sanctuary state. So police can cooperate with ICE. And in this case, they used his illegal status to hold him until they obtain a search warrant to get to have additional evidence. Ed?"

I had shades of grey in my opinion like I've mentioned before that after hearing Abby's testimony and listening to a firsthand account of what was going on behind the scenes and understanding everything that was happening, it just really opened my eyes to know that this isn't OK for me in any situation. And understanding though, Abby's pro-choice position because this is a woman who was a very strong feminist and pro-choice advocate to begin with. So any time that anyone has this moment in their lives that they completely do a 180, that's such a compelling thing that you want to look no matter which side of the argument you stand on."

    {
      "speaker": "BRATCHER",
      "utterance": "Right. I had been on set for four days already before I spoke to my mother, she called me and I was out in Oklahoma and I thought OK, maybe I should tell my mom that hey, I'm in Oklahoma. I'm a couple thousand miles away from home. And my mom had shared with me that when she was younger she had an abortion and that when she became pregnant with me at 19, she knew she could never have another one. That was all that I ever knew of the story. And on that day that I was on set when she called me, she had no idea what I was filming. And so, when I went to tell her all about Abby story, I wanted to be gentle and respectful of her feelings because I didn't want her to feel judged. And in explaining Abby's story my mother just broke down completely. And she said, I need to tell you something that I never told you before and I said OK. And she was weeping to the phone. And she said, you don't know this but I was actually on the table, a pregnant nurse came in to examine me and that was when I got up and decided to keep you. And I get emotional every time I tell the story because I don't know that it's ever going to go away when you look at your life and you think that everything that you've experienced almost never happened. Just within a few seconds, a few minutes and I think it was a really courageous thing for my mom not only to have me. Those are the stories I feel like we really should celebrate this woman. She chose the struggle and empower herself to have me and to tell me, it took a lot of grace for her to tell me this."

And in my generation specifically, I feel like we are asking more questions. You know, we might be divided on issues, but we want to be educated and that's what this film does because we look at the pro- choice side and we look at the pro-life side and its unbiased true story."

One day into the trip he simply vanished, never heard from again. Tonight, the son of Majd Kamalmaz is breaking his silence in hopes of enlisting President Trump's help to bring him home. We'll speak to the son in a moment but first, Trace Gallagher with the back story. Trace?"

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Ed, the last known location of Majd Kamalmaz was on February 2017 where he was stopped in a taxicab at a government checkpoint in Damascus. The cab driver was later released but there was no sign of Kamalmaz. Now in the nearly two years since he went missing the family has quietly worked with the State Department and the FBI to uncover any clues or proof that he is still alive. A Czech ambassador initially confirmed that Majd Kamalmaz was being held in a jail, then the diplomat went silent and the Syrian government denied the claim. Now the family is asking President Trump to help save his life, sending a letter to the president that reads in part, quote, \"Mr. President, you are the only power that is able to bring him safely home to his wife, children, grandchildren, mother, siblings and friends. We have seen your tremendous effort and success in returning American citizens wrongfully detained abroad and write this letter to bring your attention to our father.\" The family believes the president can help because Kamalmaz is one of just a small number of Americans believed to be held by the Syrian government or its allies. Though their hopes were dashed a bit by a recent report out of Syria that claims Layla Shweikani, a 26-year-old Illinois woman was executed by the Syrian government for her pro-democracy work. Though, the Kamalmaz family points out Majd is not an activist. He's a therapist who set up several clinics in Lebanon to help Syrian refugees deal with their trauma. In fact, Kamalmaz is well known for his volunteering time and skills to those in need all over the world. The family says time is also critical because Majd Kamalmaz is diabetic and his health is thought to be in decline. Ed?"

And he was able to bring them back home to their families. And we want to ask him to do the same for our American father. He's been a patriot. He loves America. He's been here all his life and he just wants -- we just want to bring him back home to his friends and his family."

But I had another son who was born just about two weeks before my father disappeared. So, he's never met my second son which is something that really hurts me because I've seen how he's played with my others -- my sister's grandchildren and my sister's children. He is the type that rolls on the ground and plays with them and cares for them and sits down and talks to them and looks them in the eye. And I couldn't wait to have my own children so he could do the same with my own children."
