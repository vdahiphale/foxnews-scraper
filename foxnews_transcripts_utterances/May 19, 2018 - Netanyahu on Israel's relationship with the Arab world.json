The democrats chuckled. But he was right. He was right. Prosecutors and FBI agents working to change the course of political history. A shadow government whose agenda is to maintain their own power and control. A deep state we thought existed only on the pages of novels, alive and well here in the United States of America. We've watched in real-time as text messages revealed those agents conspiring not only to interfere with the Presidential election, but to then create the basis to overthrow a sitting President. $10 million and millions of documents later, nothing.

      "sentences": "And every time we hear more is coming, the deep state does nothing, but continue to show how deep and dirty it is. The head of the FBI lies to Congress. He even lied about the statutory elements of a crime because he wants to protect Hillary Clinton. That same director conducts a laughable, make believe investigation of his favorite Hillary with no grand jury, no search warrant, no subpoenas, where he sat back and watched as the accused destroyed evidence, deleted e-mails with his cohorts and the Department of Justice hands out immunity deals without ever requiring that they testify. He exonerates the target before the investigation is even over, so biased that he allows the same FBI agents who exonerate Hillary to create an investigation against Donald Trump based on a fake dossier to create the basis for surveillance of the Trump campaign paid for by the candidate they wanted to win. The FBI knew that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for that dossier that had no basis in fact. They even tried to get a friendly judge to take the case and issue the warrant by trying to set up a dinner party as a cover. That judge ended up recusing himself from the prosecution of Michael Flynn. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For months we watched as the FBI and DOJ had denied having any document. They said, there are no e-mails on the Clinton-Loretta Lynch tarmac meeting, but there are. They lied to us. We watched as members of Congress tried again and again to get documents from the Department of Justice and the FBI, but they won't hand them over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They stonewall and there seems to be no way to get those documents. And all the while, the Department of Justice and the FBI sit back and watched as their candidate approved the sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia and pocketed $145 million for their so-called charity. All the while the Clinton Foundation received hundreds of millions of dollars from people doing business with the US government -- our government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And when Jeff Sessions decides to recuse himself, Rod Rosenstein, a man we have never even heard of, appoint his pal, Bob Mueller to investigate our president, and this week we find out the FBI ran a spy operation, actually placing an informant, a mole in the Trump campaign before there were any legal grounds to do any such thing. It was a classic totalitarian third world tactic. This person has as much as been identified. He's engaged in skullduggery going back to Bush 41. My FBI sources tell me there would be no reason for him to even run into a Page or Papadopoulos, and get this, he's disappeared for the last nine months. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I want you to remember that you heard it here first. Any collector, their name for an informant working on a national campaign must have a sign-off by the Attorney General. Here that would be liar Loretta Lynch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Lynch herself would have had to have approved an informant on that campaign. If she didn't, then the FBI under James Comey was even more corrupt going rogue in their attempt to destroy Donald Trump. But what, ladies and gentlemen is unmistakable in all of this is the single most of dangerous person to the agenda of President Trump, the Republican Party and ultimately to all Americans is the attorney general of the United States Himself, Jeff Sessions. The man has done nothing to make anyone responsible for the blatant corruption, the unmistakable perjury, the in-your-face obstruction of our laws that we have seen play out every day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He has fought the release of telling documents that will put an end to this horrible period in America's political history. Document that would make clear that the criminals in this attempt to overthrow an American president. He has even argued that he doesn't want to release records of Hillary because she is now a private citizen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This man has done nothing to create confidence that wrongdoers will be accountable, answerable. He has done nothing to create confidence on the part of the American people and our system of justice. And with all the power and might of the Department of Justice behind him, he continues to do nothing. He refuses to take them out in cuffs. The most of powerful prosecutor in the world, the man who holds the scales of justice in his hand hides behind the coat tails of a Rod Rosenstein, a man we've never even heard of who is in fact behind all of Jeff Sessions' decisions, who is in fact running our Department of Justice. The man who has the honor to carry the prefix, United States Attorney General before his name, Jeff Sessions, is indeed the most of dangerous man in America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's my open.

We have a fantastic guest lineup tonight. My exclusive interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Live reaction to all the day's news with White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, former Trump campaign manager David Bossie, former aide to Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn. Plus I take you inside the historic opening of the Jerusalem Embassy, you won't want to miss a second of it. But first, my opening statement. So, here we are at the one-year anniversary of the Mueller investigation, staffed with a singularly most biased special counsel attorneys in American history. And since then, we have witnessed events unfold, which are so unbelievable, so unimaginable, you would have to be wearing a tinfoil hat or a card-carrying member of the conspiracy party to even believe it exists. We watched the President claim he had been wiretapped. The democrats chuckled. But he was right. He was right. Prosecutors and FBI agents working to change the course of political history. A shadow government whose agenda is to maintain their own power and control. A deep state we thought existed only on the pages of novels, alive and well here in the United States of America. We've watched in real-time as text messages revealed those agents conspiring not only to interfere with the Presidential election, but to then create the basis to overthrow a sitting President. $10 million and millions of documents later, nothing. I repeat nothing has touched the President in spite of their claim."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And every time we hear more is coming, the deep state does nothing, but continue to show how deep and dirty it is. The head of the FBI lies to Congress. He even lied about the statutory elements of a crime because he wants to protect Hillary Clinton. That same director conducts a laughable, make believe investigation of his favorite Hillary with no grand jury, no search warrant, no subpoenas, where he sat back and watched as the accused destroyed evidence, deleted e-mails with his cohorts and the Department of Justice hands out immunity deals without ever requiring that they testify. He exonerates the target before the investigation is even over, so biased that he allows the same FBI agents who exonerate Hillary to create an investigation against Donald Trump based on a fake dossier to create the basis for surveillance of the Trump campaign paid for by the candidate they wanted to win. The FBI knew that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for that dossier that had no basis in fact. They even tried to get a friendly judge to take the case and issue the warrant by trying to set up a dinner party as a cover. That judge ended up recusing himself from the prosecution of Michael Flynn. For months we watched as the FBI and DOJ had denied having any document. They said, there are no e-mails on the Clinton-Loretta Lynch tarmac meeting, but there are. They lied to us. We watched as members of Congress tried again and again to get documents from the Department of Justice and the FBI, but they won't hand them over. They stonewall and there seems to be no way to get those documents. And all the while, the Department of Justice and the FBI sit back and watched as their candidate approved the sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia and pocketed $145 million for their so-called charity. All the while the Clinton Foundation received hundreds of millions of dollars from people doing business with the US government -- our government. And when Jeff Sessions decides to recuse himself, Rod Rosenstein, a man we have never even heard of, appoint his pal, Bob Mueller to investigate our president, and this week we find out the FBI ran a spy operation, actually placing an informant, a mole in the Trump campaign before there were any legal grounds to do any such thing. It was a classic totalitarian third world tactic. This person has as much as been identified. He's engaged in skullduggery going back to Bush 41. My FBI sources tell me there would be no reason for him to even run into a Page or Papadopoulos, and get this, he's disappeared for the last nine months. I want you to remember that you heard it here first. Any collector, their name for an informant working on a national campaign must have a sign-off by the Attorney General. Here that would be liar Loretta Lynch. Lynch herself would have had to have approved an informant on that campaign. If she didn't, then the FBI under James Comey was even more corrupt going rogue in their attempt to destroy Donald Trump. But what, ladies and gentlemen is unmistakable in all of this is the single most of dangerous person to the agenda of President Trump, the Republican Party and ultimately to all Americans is the attorney general of the United States Himself, Jeff Sessions. The man has done nothing to make anyone responsible for the blatant corruption, the unmistakable perjury, the in-your-face obstruction of our laws that we have seen play out every day. He has fought the release of telling documents that will put an end to this horrible period in America's political history. Document that would make clear that the criminals in this attempt to overthrow an American president. He has even argued that he doesn't want to release records of Hillary because she is now a private citizen. This man has done nothing to create confidence that wrongdoers will be accountable, answerable. He has done nothing to create confidence on the part of the American people and our system of justice. And with all the power and might of the Department of Justice behind him, he continues to do nothing. He refuses to take them out in cuffs. The most of powerful prosecutor in the world, the man who holds the scales of justice in his hand hides behind the coat tails of a Rod Rosenstein, a man we've never even heard of who is in fact behind all of Jeff Sessions' decisions, who is in fact running our Department of Justice. The man who has the honor to carry the prefix, United States Attorney General before his name, Jeff Sessions, is indeed the most of dangerous man in America. That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine. Here with reaction to my opening statement, and all of the developing news tonight, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, who joins me now from DC. Good evening, Hogan."

This president comes in and in a short amount of time says, \"We are moving it, I promised it, we are doing it.\" Last week, we literally not just moved the embassy, we got out of an Iran deal that didn't protect this country, that actually paved the way for Iran to make a nuclear weapon. We got three people -- American citizens who were detainees in North Korea back to American soil. I was at the Air Force base at 4:00 in the morning when they arrived. It was an incredible moment. And instead, it took -- as quick as the media could say detainees, they shifted their focus back to Russia. It's absolutely incredible what the mainstream media is doing right now."

You know, that hot mic moment, tell Vlad after the election, I will be able to get back to him. And most frustrating is that we know Putin hated Hillary Clinton because she said that his election was rigged in Russia. He never forgave her, that's where the connection was, but I want to move on from that. You know, right now we have got the -- they say that China -- we are working out an agreement with China that is starting to kind of balance the trade agreement. What's going on?"

They are doing a horrible thing to the American people. The international stage understands that China is cheating. They are taking intellectual property. They are dumping steel -- all the thing we know. No politician has had the backbone to stand up to China and say, \"You're cheating the American people. No more.\" President Trump comes into office and says, \"We're stopping it. We are protecting the American people,\" and that's where we are right now, it is trying to protect the American worker.

President Trump withdrew from the Iran deal, and in 2015, you came to America to warn America of what most straight-thinking people could have figured out anyway, and that is that the Iran deal was a flawed deal. There were many in Congress, some of them Jews who boycotted, and Donald Trump today there are some American Jews who don't support Donald Trump. Why do you think that is?"

    {
      "speaker": "NETANYAHU",
      "utterance": "I don't think it's a question of being Jewish or not, I think it's a question of understanding the threat posed by Iran. I mean, the nuclear deal was based on an assumption that if you give Iran a lot of concessions in the nuclear field, they will be nice. They will stop being the radical regime that oppresses its own people and devours countries in the Middle East. The opposite happened. You gave the deal, pushed billions into their coffers and instead of become this nice country, it actually went on a rampage in Yemen and Iraq, now in Syria and elsewhere. They are trying to conquer the Middle East with the money from the nuclear deal. So, I think what the President has done is first, he smashed Iran's money machine for its dreams of empire, and everybody in the Middle East is applauding him. I am not talking about in the European capitals, I am talking -- I am not talking about those who are now outside the missile range of Iran. Those who are in missile range, yes, like this capital, Jerusalem, Riyadh, elsewhere in the Middle East, we understand that President Trump has done a great thing because he told Iran, \"You are not going to get the money for this flawed deal.\" And the second thing is, \"You are not going to get the nukes.\" Because this deal, if it's kept guarantees Iran's multiple paths to get a nuclear arsenal. Everybody says, \"Oh, well we should keep this deal because it blocks Iran's path to the bomb.\" No it doesn't. It guarantee's Iran's path to the bomb."

      "utterance": "So, why did the UK, France, Germany -- if this is so obvious, and you gave them proof, I mean, that was the process, you gave the proof, the evidence from Mossad. Why are they still in the deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NETANYAHU",
      "utterance": "I think they are kicking the can forward, you know what they say. You know what this deal actually does, it says to Iran, \"Do not enrich uranium,\" which is .the critical component of a bomb. For one bomb, for a single bomb, and in exchange, in a few years' time, now it's seven years' time. You will get the ability to enrich uranium for a hundred bombs. That's the deal. That's crazy. That's what this deal says. So, why do people do that? Why do people sacrifice the middle term and the long term for the short term -- they often do that, but it's wrong to do that, but it's wrong to do that. So, I think the President is absolutely right, both smashing the cash machine for Iran's aggression and ambitions of empire, and also telling them, \"You are not going to go with our approval, housekeeping seal of approval, and within seven years have unlimited enrichment for a nuclear arsenal."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NETANYAHU",
      "utterance": "I think they sort of do. Gradually, I mean, if you look at the Arab world as a whole, there is a change in the way many of the Arab countries perceive Israel. They no longer perceive it as their enemy, but as their indispensable ally against a common threat, and the common threat is Iran. So, there are -- and I am not revealing shocking news here, but I am not going to go into details, but our relations with many of the Arab countries has undergone a profound transformation. And we are united in our desire to confront Iran's aggression, and we are united in our appreciation of the fact that President Trump has confronted Iran instead of appeasing Iran. The President gets a lot of applause not only here in Jerusalem, but also in quite a few Arab capitals. We are just open about it and the people of Israel are open about it."

A heavy favorite, Justify won by just half a lane after trailing into the home stretch. A win at the Belmont stakes in June would complete the Triple Crown title. I'm Marianne Rafferty.

They want a peace without Israel. They don't want a Palestinian state next to Israel. They want a Palestinian state instead of Israel. That's why the conflict goes on because they want to throw us into the sea. The minute we will get Arab leaders, as we got with Saddam and with King Hussein -- the late King Hussein of Jordan who are willing to coexist with us, then now, we are moving towards peace.

Well, I have said, \"No.\" You know, we will rather, we'll confront you now before you build up your forces rather than later. What would you do?

I love to read your comments, I do, and you never have to miss \"Justice.\" If you can't watch, set your DVR, those things really work. Plus, get ready, my new book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy\" comes out in June, but you can preorder it now on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. Thank you for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro, advocating for truth, justice and the American way. \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" is coming up next, and I will see you next Saturday night here in New York.
