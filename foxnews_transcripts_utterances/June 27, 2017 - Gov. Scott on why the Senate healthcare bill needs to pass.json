I think we actually need a process of constant reform because we're learning new things as we go along. The second point, I would say is, if people -- if the American public has to understand one thing very clearly if you want pre-existing conditions excluded, so insurance companies cannot exclude people with cancer or heart disease or diabetes, or depression or asthma, you have to have everybody in the system. You cannot allow people to choose: I'm going to be in or I'm going to be out until I get sick and then I'll jump in. Those two things cannot operate at the same time. If we want no pre-existing disease exclusion by insurance companies, you have to have a mandate or some other way of getting everyone into the system.

Just a few weeks ago, there was the Comey story that was completely false that they ran crazy with for the day leading up to the testimony. They were claiming that Susan Rice had nothing to do with unmasking, which is something that she didn't even claim. And they were also kind of duped on that original dossier story, where they really hyped that.

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Martha, let me make two points. Since day one of passing through the Affordable Care Act, I said that we are going to need revisions. We're going to learn about unintended consequences. We didn't get everything we wanted in the bill, especially, efforts to control cost and reduce deductibles. So, I've always said we need reform. I think we actually need a process of constant reform because we're learning new things as we go along."

      "speaker": "The second point, I would say is, if people -- if the American public has to understand one thing very clearly if you want pre-existing conditions excluded, so insurance companies cannot exclude people with cancer or heart disease or diabetes, or depression or asthma, you have to have everybody in the system. You cannot allow people to choose",
      "utterance": "I'm going to be in or I'm going to be out until I get sick and then I'll jump in. Those two things cannot operate at the same time. If we want no pre-existing disease exclusion by insurance companies, you have to have a mandate or some other way of getting everyone into the system. I know people don't like that, but that is inevitable. It is one of those things you have to eat your vegetables to make progress here."

    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I mean, under this program, the mandate would be gone. But basically, were bailing out the insurance companies now. That's why you got, you know, a nice boost for hospitals and for insurance companies because now the money is all going to go to them to stabilize them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Martha, if we actually -- there are things we can do to encourage young people to get into the insurance market. A lot of them don't know they're eligible for subsidies. A lot of them don't understand what the risks are without it. And I do think we need to be serious about enforcing the mandate, and what the insurance companies have said. Reduce the number of exemptions and exclusions so that people actually have to come in and tell them we're serious about it. We also do need to stabilize the insurance companies, just the way Republicans stabilized the insurance companies under Medicare Part D-the Drug Benefit. You don't know who's going to be in the market, you don't know what their profile is going to look like. And so, you -- to keep rates down, you need stabilization. But you know, the uncertainty created by this bill, the uncertainty created by the Republicans about the cautionary subsidies-those subsidies for the deductibles and coinsurance. Though, we're not going to enforce the mandate claim by the president; that creates a lot of uncertainty. And insurance companies increase the premiums. One of the reasons we've got the big fish to premiums is the uncertainty created by the Republicans."

Let's bring in Florida Governor, Rick Scott took into politics after a career in health care, and he was in meetings all day on Capitol Hill talking about this bill. Governor Scott, good to have you here. I mean, this is really the opposite of what you spent your life in the private sector doing, which is to give a lot more choice to people and to allow the free market to have a role in health care choice.

I appreciate the fact that President Trump invites us into; I met with Vice President Pence today, they're working hard, they want to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Let's look at the numbers. ObamaCare is a disaster. Costs have spiraled out of control. We knew that was going to happen. The only way to you're going to get the cost down, where people can afford their own health care is more competition, allow people to buy the insurance they want to buy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, you know, we're just -- this is what Zeke Emanuel and I were just talking about. You had millions of people who opted out of ObamaCare. They said I don't want to -- either I'm going to pay the fine, or I'm just not going to check the box and I'm going to ignore it, and in those cases, they weren't fine. But you either have to have it one way or the other in terms of how I look at this. You either had to have everybody buy-in, essentially, have a single-payer system, or you have to allow the free market a larger role in health care in order to bring prices down. Is that right?"

We pay our taxes just like every other state. Our taxes, our federal taxes remain lower, so to make sure that the Medicaid reimbursement coming back to us is fair to us. And second, whether you have a pre-existing condition or not, you should be able to buy the insurance you want. You will spend your money smarter and better than anybody else will. I grew up in a family without health insurance. I know the struggles my parents had to get health care for my brother who had a significant hip disease. We've to give them less expensive health care, great health care at a price that they can afford."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. You say you're there fighting for Medicaid reimbursement for your state; that's what a lot of Governors are doing. Nobody wants to give anything back once their state has been given it. Now, you know, I think it's a legitimate question to ask why we have such an increase in people on Medicaid, you know, and the subset question there is should able-bodied people have to work in order to get Medicaid. We've got an economy that's generally improving over the last several years. And yet we have more and more people on Medicaid, why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Martha, we didn't do the expansion because we knew the program could not pay for it. But here's the numbers: we have a million more people on our basic Medicaid program in New York, and they get paid $23 billion out of the federal government, and we get $14 billion. How is that fair? I want to make sure we take care of our taxpayers. I want to make sure we take care of our citizens. I want people to get health care. But it's hard to be fair to our state. We didn't do the expansion, so we need to get the same rate per person as every other state. And then give our citizens the choice of what to buy"

The president of the United States, apparently, in August, was briefed by the CIA that Russians had been -- seriously, it's something to interfere in the American election. For whatever reason, the president made the decision not to tell the American people, not to tell the two presidential candidates who would; by the way, I think both have roundly condemned that. I think you could've had Trump and Clinton on the same side, vigorously condemning Putin, saying it was totally unprecedented no matter who was going to help. And I think it would've been a much healthier kind of thing. I said I think the president, President Obama, should come up and testify. When did he learn, who did he learn from, who did he get in his advisors, why would they keep it secret from the American people for five months? And frankly, the things they did to retaliate were pathetically weak, which was, of course, the Obama model in foreign policy. But I think, if the serious effort if the CIA believed there was, the NSA believed there was a serious effort, I think they should've had a public American confrontation with Putin, and they would've had Presidential candidates behind him. Instead, because this whole fiasco of six months of worrying about Trump and collusion, and none of which gets proven. And then we finally discover, oh, you know, president Obama already knew about this almost a year ago. It's just unconscionable."

So, the first question I have for you about that is, given this new part of this whole spotlight, turning back on the Obama administration and asking how they dealt with this information when at that point it was, you know, pretty much everybody thought Hillary Clinton was going to win, and they decided not to come out and talk about it. And that does deserve a question for the President. But is that going to change Mueller's investigation, this newer sort of angle to all of this?"

Mueller is out on a hunt to try to get the president; he has nothing to do with the original Russian story, and you can tell that by the people he hired. And let me be clear about numbers, I thought it was amazing that among those people who donated to the Justice Department, 97 percent donated to Clinton, and three percent donated to Trump.

Late last night, a stern message was delivered from the White House to Syria and here it is: \"The United States has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children. The activities are similar to the preparations the regime made before its April 4th, 2017 chemical weapons attack. As we have previously stated, the United States is in Syria to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria. If, however, Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price.\" Today, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, extended that warning to Assad's allies."

      "speaker": "HALEY",

And I will say this, Martha, as -- I had the honor of serving 9-1/2 years shoulder to shoulder with some real patriots as an undercover officer in the CIA. And I learned something there: be nice with nice guys, and tough with tough guys. And this is a tough message. We already know Bashar al-Assad is a barbarian. And only a barbarian would use chemical weapons against his own people. And a lot of times we only focus on the last time he did this, which has resulted in 59 missiles into Syria, but he had done this dozens of times before. And I think this is a clear message. And I think the Syrians, I think the Iranians, I think the Russians know that President Trump means business and there will be a response. And if this red line crossed, you'll see a response."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "HURD",

And the goal here is to prevent the Syrians from using chemical weapons on their own people or on a U.S. forces or own allied forces. And so, there are times when you do want to telegraph your response because it does give you -- it does serve as a deterrent. And I think everybody recognizes that President Trump and his team mean business, and the Iranians, and the Russians, instead of worrying about our response. What they should be doing is making sure that Assad doesn't use his chemical weapons, because if he uses them, the Iranians and the Russians are just as much at fault."

Most refugees yearn, but lack, the U.S. tie that SCOTUS says need.\" She's referring to the change in the travel ban that says that you have to have some sort of connection to something: school, work, a family member in order to be able to come here from those countries where that apply."

      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, safe zones are a good idea in theory. But in practice, they are exceedingly difficult to do. First of all, there weren't a lot of places for a lot this conflict where we could do that, and that would probably mean committing a lot more U.S. troops and U.S. assets to protect that; something, I think, a lot of the American people aren't looking to do. Why, when the Syrian people or try to escape this, would we prevent refugees from coming here? It's such a simple message, and I actually don't think it's a controversial one."

This really shouldn't be a partisan issue, but when she comes out and makes these statements, you have to point out that it was the Obama administration policies in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya, that created this refugee crisis. All three of those countries became failed states. We saw the genocide of Christians, the attacks on the Kurds, the Yazidis, and everything, and that is what created the environment where I think you've got somewhere between 7 and 9 million people who are either refugees or displaced persons. And this is what the Trump administration inherited. This isn't about whether we're going to take 60 to a 100,000 refugees into the United States. This is about how do we go back into the Middle East, how do we stabilize the Middle East so that this 7 to 9 million people, hopefully, could find a way back to their homes and try to reestablish their lives in their home countries."

In recent weeks, we've seen the shooting down of a Syrian fighter jet. We've also seen the shooting down of two drones. So it's quite clear, Marie, that this administration is willing to take military action in order to topple Assad, which is something that the Obama administration said had to happen. He must go, said President Obama."
    },

      "speaker": "HARF",

I was supportive of those strikes after the last chemical attack. I said it on air. I've said it many times since. But what I also said was one night of strikes is not a strategy. And in the long term, I haven't seen the Trump administration say publicly or to congress or to the American people, here's the strategy, here's the end goal, and here's how we're going to get there. And this warning last night to me was incredibly interesting because now if Assad does another chemical weapons attack, Donald Trump has drawn his own redline."

You cross that redline. This was all about deterrent, hoping that Assad would change his mind and not use these weapons. I think in the coming weeks you will see the evolution of a Trump doctrine for not only Syria and Iraq, but also for Libya and Afghanistan.

The U.S. navy paying tribute today to the seven soldiers killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a merchant ship off Japan. More than 2,000 soldiers and their families attended the ceremony to honor those victims. The warship and a container ship from the Philippines crashed on June 17th, severely damaging the destroyer. The incident is currently under investigation. And Google has been slap with a record $2.7 billion antitrust find by European Union regulators. Google is accused of using its search engine to unfairly steer people to its own shopping platform. The tech giant is now considering an appeal. And finally, the house of mouse versus the White House, President Trump animatronic debut at Disney's hall of presidents. So they're delaying rolling out the Trump figure. Disney is reportedly blaming the White House. Imagineers as they're called, they usually work with the president's team to write and record a little speech that the robotic president will say when the kids go to Disney. According to Disney, the White House alone is crafting that address. In the meantime, back to the real White House where President Trump and his administration have been trying to break through the noise surrounding Russia and get back to advancing the president's agenda. So chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, spoke exclusively with President Trump's chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, and he joins us tonight from the White House lawn. Hi, Ed."

Think about that. We're no longer dependent on other countries to be willing to sell us energy. We're now in a position where we can take care of ourselves, not only can we take care of ourselves, we can export energy out of the United States, and we can take care of other nations around the world.

He's been supportive of coal, he's supportive of solar, he supportive of anything in between, and the natural gas as part of the in between products.

We've been repealing much of the over burden regulation that's been going on, we've been talking about what we want to talk about. We've been executing what we want to execute upon.

He told me a quick anecdote that they have one company out west that has come to them several times, saying they're trying to build a copper plant.

It all began when CNN published a now retracted story that they said was basically the collusion link between a Trump ally and a Russian investment fund.

The CNN article citing just one anonymous source claimed the senate intelligence committee was looking into the executive of a $10 billion Russian investment fund, and that the Russian executive had met with hedge fund manager and Trump ally, Anthony Scaramucci. After Scaramucci threatened a lawsuit and CNN decided it could not fully stand behind its reporting, the story was retracted. CNN apologized, and Scaramucci accepted. The president, however, was not as magnanimous, tweeting, quote, wow, CNN had to retract big story on Russia with three employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? Fake news. Trump went on to indicate without evidence that CNN maybe about to undergo management changes, and that ratings are way down. To which, CNN fired back, quoting, CNN just posted its most watched second quarter in history. Those are the facts. And while CNN has won awards for its recent investigative work, it is also been involved in a series of embarrassing missteps. Like having to fire its New Year's Eve co-host Kathy Griffin for the picture of her holding an imitation of the president's severed head, or having to host Reza Aslan for going after the president in a series of vulgar tweets. And just a few weeks ago, CNN had to correct a story saying that former FBI director James Comey would testify before the senate that he never told the president he was not under investigation. And for the record, Mr. Trump also believes ABC, CBS, NBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post are fake news. Martha."

Why did have his press secretary say that the inner circle knows what covfefe is, that's obviously a typo. But he misrepresents himself on a daily basis.

Having said that, this is a story that actually goes back, many months, and CNN has been pushing an elaborate Russian conspiracy theory with many stories that have not really been -- they have not been solid stories. Just a few weeks ago, there was the Comey story that was completely false that they ran crazy with for the day leading up to the testimony. They were claiming that Susan Rice had nothing to do with unmasking, which is something that she didn't even claim. And they were also kind of duped on that original dossier story, where they really hyped that. And we know that these stories really have perpetuated this belief that there is a Russian conspiracy, that Donald Trump is a traitor in the White House, and we have had many dollars, much time, much energy wasted on a conspiracy theory for which there really isn't evidence."

      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, which could prove to be embarrassing for any journalistic organization that has gone too far out on a limb. And you could sort of feel, Emily, that on a number of fronts they're kind of starting to wonder if they went out too far on that limb, and whether or not it's going to come back to bite them. Of course, we don't know the final outcome of this story yet."

      "utterance": "We don't, and neither did Trump when he tweeted about it today. So we could call that a misstep, we could call that -- maybe at some point we'll start calling it lies. But, CNN is hardly the only one who are pursuing this line of investigation. And the reasons that news outlets have to do it is because the president won't be up front, and congress won't pursue it really and a very serious way. If he could just -- if he could work, actually have a special investigation, actually support the federal council, not be constantly trying to undermine the special prosecutor in this investigation, we could just have answers, and then it wouldn't have to be this constant."

      "utterance": "The adoring tweets, Rick Perry, official from another planet, charmingly tells the press, why don't you all get two questions. Here's another one. Rick Perry is having the most fun of anybody who's ever stood at the Trump briefing podium by a factor of infinity. And then, he's a natural at the podium. And to be honest, food for thought, and Rick Perry for press secretary. We will see you back here tomorrow night. Thanks for being here on \"The Story\" with us. Tucker, coming up next.
