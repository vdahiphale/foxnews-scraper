It's time to admit a lot of you how wrong you were about Donald Trump, although I'm not going to hold my breath tonight. So, as the president has mentioned many times, he is committed to picking from a solid list of qualified originalist justices who have a proven track record of upholding the Constitution, not legislating from the bench, people who's judicial philosophy is one that believes in separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, sadly, this is the opposite of what Democrats and people like Hillary would want. Instead, the left -- they want judges who even value and cite international law, not our own Constitution. People that would legislate from the bench, people that believe in this evolving interpretation that means nothing of our Constitution. What the left can never accomplish through the ballot box, or through real legislation, they actually tried to accomplish by abusing the court system and using activist judges to accomplish their left wing dreams and ideology. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, make no mistake. As soon as the president taps whoever Anthony Kennedy's replacement will be, you are going to witness the single most contentious, nasty, vicious, dirty propaganda, character assassination campaign. It will be one of the most contentious political battles in decades. Tonight, your news media is already going there. So, in light of today's breaking news, yes, it's time for another \"Hannity\" history lesson to bring you. This time it involves just how desperate and low Democrats will go and literally malign the character of good, decent, smart people and what they plan to do to the president's next Supreme Court nominee, whoever it ends up being, they will try to destroy them. Let's start with the outgoing Justice Anthony Kennedy. Now, for 30 years, Kennedy, he's accumulated what is a very mixed track record, nominated by Ronald Reagan in 1988. Many referred to him as the court's swing justice. He saved Roe versus Wade from being overturned. He upheld the use of affirmative action, extended legal rights to foreign terrorists at Gitmo. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Kennedy also voted to kill Obamacare, preserve Second Amendment rights, and most recently, he voted to uphold the president's travel ban. It's kind of weird because he never had a judicial philosophy that he seemed to adhere to like Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia or Justice Alito. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now with President Trump poised to nominate what he has said he will do in the campaign, a strict originalist to replace the very unpredictable Kennedy, Democrats are now sharpening their spears just like they did back in 1987. Let's go down memory lane. Now, before Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court, he did tap somebody who was a judicial genius. He tapped a strict constitutional originalist. His name was Judge Robert Bork. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And hell-bent on preventing Robert Bork from becoming a Supreme Court justice, Senate Democrats engaged in one of the most disgusting smear campaigns which culminated on the Senate floor, with outright lies from Senator Ted Kennedy. Watch how low they can go. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The confirmation of now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, during his Senate hearings. This goes back to 1991.

Well today he was apparently grilled but only behind closed doors by two committees on Capitol Hill. And according to a brand new report from Sara Carter, bad news. One congressman in attendance Representative Ron DeSantis said, quote, \"It was Strzok.\" He is full of it and he kept hiding behind the, quote, \"classified information excuse.\" Now fortunately we do have one hopeful development. Now today the House judiciary tweeted, quote, \"Peter Strzok will be interviewed first in a closed door deposition they will be classified information to sort through before a public hearing is held. A public hearing will be held. Now this public hearing is crucial.

We deserve answers. You know why? Because this was about influencing a presidential election.

That will begin immediately. We have a very excellent list of great, talented, and highly educated, highly intelligent, hopefully tremendous people. I think the list is very outstanding. When I was running, I put down a list of 20 people. Because not being a politician, I think people wanted to hear what some of my choices may be. And it was pretty effective. And I think you see the kind of quality that we are looking at when you look at that list. But I did add -- I added five additional people to the list. So, it will be somebody from that list."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I want to take a minute, by the way. For all of you Never Trumpers and you all know who you are, I'm thinking about naming names, but not tonight. I do have a message for you: if you had your way, remember we'd say the Supreme Court is at stake. That alone means everything. Hillary Rodham Clinton now would be making this now a second appointment in the terms of the judicial course of American history which would alter this country for decades to come. It's time to admit a lot of you how wrong you were about Donald Trump, although I'm not going to hold my breath tonight. So, as the president has mentioned many times, he is committed to picking from a solid list of qualified originalist justices who have a proven track record of upholding the Constitution, not legislating from the bench, people who's judicial philosophy is one that believes in separation of powers, co-equal branches of government. Now, sadly, this is the opposite of what Democrats and people like Hillary would want. Instead, the left -- they want judges who even value and cite international law, not our own Constitution. People that would legislate from the bench, people that believe in this evolving interpretation that means nothing of our Constitution. What the left can never accomplish through the ballot box, or through real legislation, they actually tried to accomplish by abusing the court system and using activist judges to accomplish their left wing dreams and ideology. Now, make no mistake. As soon as the president taps whoever Anthony Kennedy's replacement will be, you are going to witness the single most contentious, nasty, vicious, dirty propaganda, character assassination campaign. It will be one of the most contentious political battles in decades. Tonight, your news media is already going there. So, in light of today's breaking news, yes, it's time for another \"Hannity\" history lesson to bring you. This time it involves just how desperate and low Democrats will go and literally malign the character of good, decent, smart people and what they plan to do to the president's next Supreme Court nominee, whoever it ends up being, they will try to destroy them. Let's start with the outgoing Justice Anthony Kennedy. Now, for 30 years, Kennedy, he's accumulated what is a very mixed track record, nominated by Ronald Reagan in 1988. Many referred to him as the court's swing justice. He saved Roe versus Wade from being overturned. He upheld the use of affirmative action, extended legal rights to foreign terrorists at Gitmo. But Kennedy also voted to kill Obamacare, preserve Second Amendment rights, and most recently, he voted to uphold the president's travel ban. It's kind of weird because he never had a judicial philosophy that he seemed to adhere to like Justice Thomas or Justice Scalia or Justice Alito. And now with President Trump poised to nominate what he has said he will do in the campaign, a strict originalist to replace the very unpredictable Kennedy, Democrats are now sharpening their spears just like they did back in 1987. Let's go down memory lane. Now, before Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court, he did tap somebody who was a judicial genius. He tapped a strict constitutional originalist. His name was Judge Robert Bork. And hell-bent on preventing Robert Bork from becoming a Supreme Court justice, Senate Democrats engaged in one of the most disgusting smear campaigns which culminated on the Senate floor, with outright lies from Senator Ted Kennedy. Watch how low they can go. Take a look."

That's how we now have ended up with the term of being Borked, which, by the way, the Oxford English Dictionary described as, quote, obstruct someone by systematically defaming or vilifying them. Let's fast forward a couple of years later. The confirmation of now Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, during his Senate hearings. This goes back to 1991. Democrats rolled out his former colleague Anita Hill to make sexual harassment allegations against him. The process became so vicious and nasty, Justice Thomas in what is now infamous, famous comments, he referred to it as a high-tech lynching. Watch this."

It's called \"My Grandfather's Son.\" Now if you think what you saw is bad it's about to get actually probably worse with the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court now hanging in the balance after President Trump successfully nominated originalist Neil Gorsuch to the court. Senate Democrats are about to pull out all stops. They'll do and say anything just like Ted Chappaqua (Ph) Kennedy to block Donald Trump's pick. Now we're not even a day out from Justice Kennedy's announcement and the left is already in total free freak out panic and scare the American people mode and full on lying mode. Watch this."

The era of global free loathing, the president said is over. An example, last night a 28-year-old socialist from New York defeated the long time Democratic incumbent in a congressional primary race. As President Trump said tonight he got his assed kicked. And many are hailing Cortez as a rising star on the political landscape but in reality her views her policy positions are actually downright scary. Look, by the way, he was a guy that was supposed to take over for Nancy Pelosi perhaps. Look very carefully. This is the future. This is your modern Democratic Party.

You just turn it but they are not going to tell you. And of course they want to preserve Obamacare. And by the way, Nancy Pelosi and company, they are even saying this publicly. They want the tax cuts back. They want their crumbs returned and that means $2,000 on average per American family, and obviously they want open borders. Now we have a fifth part of their Democratic agenda that we're adding to our list. And that is to destroy whoever the president picks to replace Justice Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. I keep saying this is the single most important midterm election of our lifetimes. Now will President Trump be able to assert his agenda for the last two years of his first term? Or are socialists, will they be able to impeach him or obstruct him every step of the way? Will we have another originalist on the Supreme Court or will Democrats be able to successfully block Kennedy's successor? Do you really want these people running the country? Let's take a look."

But first, we do have breaking development surrounding Peter Strzok. As you know by now he was the corrupt, bias, pro-Hillary, anti-Trump, Trump hating FBI official once tasked with investigating Trump Russia collusion, and also was at the forefront of helping to exonerate Hillary Clinton of all the felonies and obstruction we know she committed as it relates to her server investigation. Well today he was apparently grilled but only behind closed doors by two committees on Capitol Hill. And according to a brand new report from Sara Carter, bad news. One congressman in attendance Representative Ron DeSantis said, quote, \"It was Strzok.\" He is full of it and he kept hiding behind the, quote, \"classified information excuse.\" Now fortunately we do have one hopeful development. Now today the House judiciary tweeted, quote, \"Peter Strzok will be interviewed first in a closed door deposition they will be classified information to sort through before a public hearing is held. A public hearing will be held. Now this public hearing is crucial. You the American people deserve to know how biased at the highest levels of the FBI, in fact, tainted what was the Hillary Clinton so-called investigation. It's irrefutable, incontrovertible. She committed crimes. And then the same people involved in literally putting the fix in for her were the beginnings or begun the witch hunt into of course so-called collusion and the Mueller investigation. Peter Strzok and Lisa Page and three other FBI investigators, Comey and McCabe, the Ohrs, Mueller, Mary Bond (Ph), the Democratic donors, Jeannie Rhee, Andrew Weissmann and so many more. We deserve answers. You know why? Because this was about influencing a presidential election. And literally supporting and helping somebody we know broke the law and then viciously trying to destroy another candidate. And Peter Strzok must be held accountable and he has questions to answer to the public. All right. We have a lot to get to tonight. Joining us with reaction as the open Supreme Court vacancy, President Trump's judicial nominations advisers, Leonard Leo, and joining us by phone is President Trump's attorney, Jay Sekulow, who, by the way does legal work for me and by the way has -- do you like basically represent everybody? Full disclosure, and I had dinner once with Jay, and I pay. All right. Let's start with your reaction to -- this is -- this is history. This is generations. This is an opportunity now -- this is a big deal. And let's go through the philosophy of the president in making this decision."

      "speaker": "JAY SEKULOW, MEMBER, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think we were talking I litigated Supreme Court cases in front of Anthony Kennedy for three decades. So, and about 80 percent of the time he ruled on our favor. About 20 percent of the time he did not. He was always a professional. But the fact is that when I disagree with him or he disagree with me which is a right to do, he's the justice to this -- his vote counted a lot more than mine. But at the end of the day, obviously more times than not he went with us. But there was not a consistent, what we were called conservative philosophy in the mold of say now Justice Gorsuch or Antonin Scalia, Justice Alito and Justice Thomas. And the president now has an opportunity to nominate a justice in that judicial philosophy that the president talks about and continues to talk about. And that is putting someone on the court that has, what I would call the originalist Supreme Court philosophy or constitutional philosophy. A constitutional conservative. We call it a lot of different phrases but the fact is someone that views the Constitution by the words that are written in it. You amend the Constitution through an amendment process not through judicial fiat and I think that's what you'll see in the Supreme Court nominee."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yes. And Leonard Leo, I think what Jay is right in the money. Kennedy did not have a consistent judicial philosophy which made him the swing vote. I mean, you have four reliable liberal justices on the court right now. And I mean, we know how they are going to vote in nine out of 10, 99 percent of the cases. This is important. But it's been at least 25 times that Anthony Kennedy has sided with the four liberal justices on the court. This is a game changer."

      "speaker": "LEONARD LEO, VICE PRESIDENT, FEDERALIST SOCIETY",
      "utterance": "What is transformative about this is that the president is committed to nominating people to the court who have a very firm judicial philosophy. You know, people who understand that the Constitution needs to be interpreted the way the framers meant it to be. Individuals who are courageous in that interpretative approach and are not going to flinch. We saw that in Neil Gorsuch. And I think if the president nominates another individual like Neil Gorsuch what we're going to see is widespread public support, and I would say also, probably bipartisan support in the Senate assembly as we did with Justice Gorsuch."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

I just look at the Democratic Party today and I think basically unless you are a saint and you've never written on the law at all, if you have any judicial philosophy, we know what they want to do. And that's bork somebody. I want to go a little bit deeper, Jay, into the idea -- this is important for people to understand. The president does not believe in judicial activism. He believes in separation of powers. He believes in co-equal branches of government. He doesn't believing -- believe inciting foreign law. He -- they believe in the Constitution he believes that justices should not legislate from the bench. That's for the legislative body to do."

      "utterance": "Well, that's right. And here's the -- you mention the foreign law application. I litigate in courts in other countries. I've litigated cases in the European court of human rights. And when our court, when the U.S. Supreme Court of the United States were to cite, and they do from time to time, cite cases from the European court of human rights. Recognizing that many of these governments that are part of ETA charges as it's called do not have Constitutions let alone our Constitution. So I think this whole trend that you've seen developed over the last 40 years -- Sean, this goes way back. And I've been doing this for 30 years but this goes way back. The idea that and I think this is where Leonard is absolutely correct. I'm actually optimistic that if we see and I am convincingly will, see a nominee in the caliber of Neil Gorsuch that individual will get bipartisan support."

What's so interesting since Strzok, himself, and his attorneys said they were more than willing to come to the Hill to speak to lawmakers and be forthright with them and now they are hiding behind this. And I think that a lot of the sources that I've been speaking with are saying, OK, look, we're going to give him one last chance behind closed doors for classified testimony. Then it will be a public hearing. And now the final notch in all of this is the fact that Peter Strzok himself is apparently saying that he had nothing to do with Carter Page's FISA warrant. This is really important because if he didn't that means there's other people just like Peter Strzok that had the same intentions and that means we need those documents. And that is what they are going to be fighting for and that is what the lawmakers tomorrow are going to be asking for."

So, you know, he is a very, you know, a clever guy with his words. The fact is his text show overt explicit pervasive bias and there was only one thing going on. He was out to stop Trump."
