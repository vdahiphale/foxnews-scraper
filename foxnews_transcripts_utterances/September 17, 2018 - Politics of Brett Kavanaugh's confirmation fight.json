      "utterance": "I'm sure they would, but there is a serious consideration for Democrats politically here that I don't think they have wrapped their brains and completely. If they did succeed in getting the Kavanaugh nomination taken down and there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court on Election Day, and Joe Manchin and Claire McCaskill will say come on, Schumer, you are not helping us here. Nobody more than those red state Democrats wants this nomination complete, done, and moved on from. If this linger overs it has political consequences for them."

      "utterance": "I've long believed you'd get some Democrats if no Republicans broke. I still think that's a distinct possibility, if all the Republicans stay together and the nominee is thereby guaranteed to be confirmed, I'm sure Schumer will privately say to the wavering Democrats that are in tough reelection fights this year because of the states they're in, you go ahead and cast the vote you need to take for the purpose of your reelection. But, if a Republican or two cracks, I don't think this nomination is going to be saved by Democrats. I don't think there is the slightest chance of that.
