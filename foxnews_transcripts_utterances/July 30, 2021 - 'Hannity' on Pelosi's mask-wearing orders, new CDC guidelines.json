And tonight, we begin with a look back from just two months ago in May 2021, at the time, Joe Biden proudly announced that his dark winter was finally over. He vowed that Americans who took the vaccine could remove their masks and return to a normal life. Since then, 45 million more Americans received the vaccine. But now, after new murky guidelines from the CDC, the Biden administration is vowing to crack down on we, the people. This includes new mask rules and so-called COVID-19 hot spots, vaccine mandates for federal employees, and maybe, just maybe a universal vaccine mandate. Take a look.",

You know, that's a bit frustrating as a mother of three myself. There is no reason that schools should not be open full-time in person, absence like a local outbreak within that school or community. And for Randi Weingarten to still give some credence to that is absolutely wrong and it is criminal. But, Judge, I can tell you -- the landscape has changed when it comes to the delta variant. But the best we can do is look to the U.K., India, Israel, all the other places that are coming down from their delta wave. Here's the great news, Judge. Yes, it is much more contagious and yes, we're seeing higher viral loads. But the great news is we have seen a drastic uncoupling of severe disease and new cases. And the CDC unfortunately is doing a disservice by keeping people in a paralyzed state of fear that does not match reality. And specifically when you talk about Randi Weingarten, we have to look at the children, Judge. If we look at the England who just came down from their delta wave, they had schools open, kids were not wearing masks. The good news is for the -- since the beginning of the pandemic, this COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, kids are not being severely affected by it. Yes, any child can get sick, but the good news is it is extremely low risk of a severe outcome for children. Children should absolutely be back in school and I personally believe younger children should not be wearing masks. I do not think there is a benefit in mask wearing to these children, especially when teachers can be vaccinated and if they want, they can wear a high-grade medical mask to give themselves even more protection if they so choose.",

I mean, how do they move that to the children who are the least vulnerable of all? DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR Yeah, absolutely. And that's what upsets me. We should not be putting the burden of protection on our children. The mortality rate in children is less than half a percent when it comes to coronavirus. And under no circumstance should we be closing schools because of coronavirus. It's the school closures that kill our kids, that's causing an increase in teen suicide, childhood depression, anxiety, increase in substance abuse. Ninety percent of our teachers are vaccinated. That is what we needed in the first place. So instead of even thinking about closing down these schools, we just need to continue to encourage vaccinations. That was the goal in the first place.

But you have to remember, their hands are tied. They have to listen to their local public health authorities. So it really comes from the governor's office. If you want to make a difference, you need to be getting on the phone talking to your governor, because ultimately, it is up to the governor what the local municipalities are doing and ultimately, what the schools are doing. Because I can tell you, if the local public health department is saying they have to wear mass or they have to do this, it's really -- it's going to be very difficult for a school to make any other decisions because if something goes wrong, which we know it's not going to but if something were to happen, they would have some sort of liability. So you have to get on the phone to the governor's office. And the CDC has to get back to a normal level of risk.

Like asthma or -- they do it for religious exemptions in colleges I understand. What can a frustrated parent do other than go yell at the school board?

Tell us about the whistleblowers. DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST OF \"THE DANA SHOW\": Oh goodness. Yeah, two whistleblowers who are government employees or civil servants, they were -- they were they were asked to essentially lie on behalf of the administration concerning the infection rates of people who are illegally entering at the southern border -- these migrant children taken to Fort Bliss. And then from there, we've even had a problem here in the republic of Texas with these same individuals who you either -- you don't know if they've been tested, you don't know their infection rates. And in fact what these two government workers were saying is that, yeah, the infection rate is way worse than what's being reported in the media and, in fact, when they were coming to the end of their term, end of their time working with these kids at these facilities, they were asked to basically sign off on make -- painting this like kittens and sunshine happy little picture of what was really happening there, that infection rates were out of control, that people were getting sick and that it definitely was not -- it definitely was not at all being managed. So, government -- and, Judge, I -- this is what angers me so much because the government right now is trying to cast dispersions on the characters of millions of Americans who are vaccine hesitant due to a lack of transparency and an absolutely disastrous messaging from this government where it concerns the rollout of this vaccine. And now, you have government employees coming forward saying that the government was trying to make them lie to the public about what was really happening with infection rates.

But as you point out, it does matter when he does sit down with the leaders of China or Russia or the European Union, any of these places. It does matter and it's an embarrassment. But here's the real thing that I think is very strange about Joe Biden. Joe Biden has been at this for 50 years. He's been in politics for 50 years. He's been running his mouth for years. He's been running for president for most of that time, and he's really bad at it. He's terrible at it. He doesn't know whether he drove an 18-wheeler, the White House said, well, it was a school bus. If the guy doesn't know the difference between driving a 18-wheeler and a school bus -- I mean, how would you let this guy be in charge of anything?

I'm tired of them holding this over our officer's head, and these guys have -- they're trying to go home to their families and just live like regular people. But they can't because they have limited resources that they're dealing with. And these politicians are constantly taking more and taking more. Now, they want to hold -- they want to they want to dangle a carrot in front of their face saying that they're going to give them money.

The last thing I'll say on this, Judge, is -- you know, the Democrats, they are receiving a private protection courtesy of the American taxpayer in their cities. But you notice when they're receiving their private protection paid for by you and me, they're not using social workers. They're using actual security detail.

I mean, you think about that kind of stuff and you look at what we're dealing with -- I mean, that's why I filed a lawsuit back in 2016 against Black Lives Matter and George Soros because I knew they were inciting violence against our police. Look, I was on the front line dealing with this -- these radicalized agenda. In 2016, we lost police officers. We lost five officers, killed in the line of duty in a domestic terrorist attack.

And tonight, we begin with a look back from just two months ago in May 2021, at the time, Joe Biden proudly announced that his dark winter was finally over. He vowed that Americans who took the vaccine could remove their masks and return to a normal life. Since then, 45 million more Americans received the vaccine. But now, after new murky guidelines from the CDC, the Biden administration is vowing to crack down on we, the people. This includes new mask rules and so-called COVID-19 hot spots, vaccine mandates for federal employees, and maybe, just maybe a universal vaccine mandate. Take a look."

We don't know what the new guidelines are based upon, and we don't have any of the data other than the CDC saying, well, it seems that even if you've been vaccinated, even if you had COVID, you know, the delta variant is contagious, and you may give it to somebody else.

So when the left and Nancy Pelosi and President Biden, Chuck Schumer talk about the delta variant and spreading COVID, what do you think they're doing along the border? They're allowing in illegal immigrants who have COVID, they're not being tested, they're not getting vaccinated and you sure as heck know that we're not requiring them to wear masks when they cross the border.

Good to be able to speak to both of you this evening. I'll start with you, Dr. Saphier. What do you interpret from what Randi Weingarten is saying? To me, she's giving herself a big out in case something comes up, something is created where they don't want to go back to school."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge, she did seem to say in her statement a bit to give themselves an out, saying, well, for the schools that can open. You know, that's a bit frustrating as a mother of three myself. There is no reason that schools should not be open full-time in person, absence like a local outbreak within that school or community. And for Randi Weingarten to still give some credence to that is absolutely wrong and it is criminal. But, Judge, I can tell you -- the landscape has changed when it comes to the delta variant. But the best we can do is look to the U.K., India, Israel, all the other places that are coming down from their delta wave. Here's the great news, Judge. Yes, it is much more contagious and yes, we're seeing higher viral loads. But the great news is we have seen a drastic uncoupling of severe disease and new cases. And the CDC unfortunately is doing a disservice by keeping people in a paralyzed state of fear that does not match reality. And specifically when you talk about Randi Weingarten, we have to look at the children, Judge. If we look at the England who just came down from their delta wave, they had schools open, kids were not wearing masks. The good news is for the -- since the beginning of the pandemic, this COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, kids are not being severely affected by it. Yes, any child can get sick, but the good news is it is extremely low risk of a severe outcome for children. Children should absolutely be back in school and I personally believe younger children should not be wearing masks. I do not think there is a benefit in mask wearing to these children, especially when teachers can be vaccinated and if they want, they can wear a high-grade medical mask to give themselves even more protection if they so choose."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Exactly, exactly. And, Dr. Nesheiwat -- I mean, the concept of children who we know are not as vulnerable uh as adults are and certainly older adults as it relates to COVID, and even the delta variant as Dr. Saphier said, which is -- you know, it's more contagious but it's certainly not as dangerous or lethal. I mean, how do they move that to the children who are the least vulnerable of all? DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR Yeah, absolutely. And that's what upsets me. We should not be putting the burden of protection on our children. The mortality rate in children is less than half a percent when it comes to coronavirus. And under no circumstance should we be closing schools because of coronavirus. It's the school closures that kill our kids, that's causing an increase in teen suicide, childhood depression, anxiety, increase in substance abuse. Ninety percent of our teachers are vaccinated. That is what we needed in the first place. So instead of even thinking about closing down these schools, we just need to continue to encourage vaccinations. That was the goal in the first place. They should not be moving and shifting the goal post. That is just unacceptable at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But what can parents do about that, Dr. Saphier, I mean, what -- I mean, other than move your child to another school, what if you can't go to another school? What if you can't afford a private school?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Judge, and like you've seen some of those school board meetings. You see the parents yelling at the principals and the teachers. But you have to remember, their hands are tied. They have to listen to their local public health authorities. So it really comes from the governor's office. If you want to make a difference, you need to be getting on the phone talking to your governor, because ultimately, it is up to the governor what the local municipalities are doing and ultimately, what the schools are doing. Because I can tell you, if the local public health department is saying they have to wear mass or they have to do this, it's really -- it's going to be very difficult for a school to make any other decisions because if something goes wrong, which we know it's not going to but if something were to happen, they would have some sort of liability. So you have to get on the phone to the governor's office. And the CDC has to get back to a normal level of risk. Children have more chance of getting in a severe car accident driving to school than they do from COVID-19. Keep it in perspective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. Yeah , but, Dr. Nesheiwat, you know, first of all, I'm not so sure about the liability issue, when the CDC doesn't even have any basis upon which to, you know, rack things up again. But with children in masks, are there any exceptions that any of the schools that you know of or are accepting to exempt kids from wearing masks? Like asthma or -- they do it for religious exemptions in colleges I understand. What can a frustrated parent do other than go yell at the school board? And by the way, everybody go vote for members of the school board. Make sure you have input. But go ahead, Dr. Nesheiwat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NESHEIWAT",
      "utterance": "Yeah, yeah, absolutely. We need to have some exemptions and alternatives. For example, if a child has already had COVID and they have protection through antibodies, they don't need to be wearing a mask. They are protected. They got that immunity. And also, there are children that have allergies. They may have allergic reactions. So we have to take all these factors into consideration, and understand the risks and the benefits. Right now, the benefit is children must be in the classroom. It affects them mentally, emotionally, physically, and in every single way psychologically. That is the most important thing, and we're causing a detrimental impact on our children by not having them in the classroom. And we have data that shows that the risk of keeping them at home is more detrimental than having them in the classroom."

Now, two whistleblowers are accusing the Biden administration of trying to cover up a COVID outbreak at Fort Bliss among migrant children. Joining us now is nationally syndicated radio host, Dana Loesch, along with host of the \"Rubin Report\", Dave Rubin. All right. Good evening to both of you. Dana, I'll start with you. Tell us about the whistleblowers. DANA LOESCH, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST OF \"THE DANA SHOW\": Oh goodness. Yeah, two whistleblowers who are government employees or civil servants, they were -- they were they were asked to essentially lie on behalf of the administration concerning the infection rates of people who are illegally entering at the southern border -- these migrant children taken to Fort Bliss. And then from there, we've even had a problem here in the republic of Texas with these same individuals who you either -- you don't know if they've been tested, you don't know their infection rates. And in fact what these two government workers were saying is that, yeah, the infection rate is way worse than what's being reported in the media and, in fact, when they were coming to the end of their term, end of their time working with these kids at these facilities, they were asked to basically sign off on make -- painting this like kittens and sunshine happy little picture of what was really happening there, that infection rates were out of control, that people were getting sick and that it definitely was not -- it definitely was not at all being managed. So, government -- and, Judge, I -- this is what angers me so much because the government right now is trying to cast dispersions on the characters of millions of Americans who are vaccine hesitant due to a lack of transparency and an absolutely disastrous messaging from this government where it concerns the rollout of this vaccine. And now, you have government employees coming forward saying that the government was trying to make them lie to the public about what was really happening with infection rates. This is pretend theater, pretend care theater from the administration."

So I don't know how surprised we should be with this. But at the same time, you would think the government would be concerned because Border Patrol is getting sick, Border Patrol is taking it home to their families. Everyone is working for the government, people busing them, flying them, non-government. And they're infecting everyone. Does the government not care? DAVE RUBIN, HOST OF \"THE RUBIN REPORT\": No the government doesn't care because the government knows that it can get away with this, with its allies in the mainstream media. That this will only really be covered on FOX or on a couple podcasts and YouTube channels like mine, and that really is it. So, remember, we cared about kids in cages when it was Donald Trump who was president. Then when we saw kids in cages, suddenly, they weren't cages and even though they were as you pointed out at some points ten times overcrowded and there was obviously no social distancing, and people weren't wearing masks and just in the last few days, we suddenly see all of these people pouring in through the southern border.

      "speaker": "CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that they're probably very relieved that they're dealing with this guy now instead of the last guy. But I also kind of wonder if -- you know, after four years of one of the most consequential presidents we've ever had in modern times, it's almost like the swamp is back to sort of make the argument that it doesn't matter who's president. You -- even this guy can be president because he says the dumbest things and for some reason, it doesn't matter. But as you point out, it does matter when he does sit down with the leaders of China or Russia or the European Union, any of these places. It does matter and it's an embarrassment. But here's the real thing that I think is very strange about Joe Biden. Joe Biden has been at this for 50 years. He's been in politics for 50 years. He's been running his mouth for years. He's been running for president for most of that time, and he's really bad at it. He's terrible at it. He doesn't know whether he drove an 18-wheeler, the White House said, well, it was a school bus. If the guy doesn't know the difference between driving a 18-wheeler and a school bus -- I mean, how would you let this guy be in charge of anything? But then he says things like -- you know, the Freudian -- he doesn't even know what a Freudian slip is. And then and then and it's like the most basic thing -- when you start off to list three things, you're supposed to always list three things."

Well, I guess that the plan was that he would win. And so, Ari, I'll go to you. I mean, you've trained enough politicians, worked with enough of them that, you know, those three reasons that you give like -- the first question why do you want to run for president? Why do you want to run for governor? Why do you want to run for this? I mean, you know, the guy doesn't pass the basic fundamentals. And yet no one in the media cares -- I know because the media's in with them. What's your take on him?"

      "utterance": "Well, this is what bothers me so much. We do see a president who is about to turn 79, and legitimate questions should be raised about how he's doing, how his mental health is, how his acuity is. You watch him in the -- in his speech, in the news conference today, he can be sharp, there's no question about it. He can go back and forth with reporters and hear their questions and give lucid answers to it. But when he constantly gets things wrong too, there should be a scrutiny. The press should cover it. But the mainstream media has just seen fit to give him a total pass. They don't hold him to account when he makes up all these lies about himself. They kind of just chuckle. They'll note it maybe in passing once and then move on to the next pro-Biden story that they write. This is the problem too. Why do they have to protect and cover for him, instead of criticize him and draw attention to his frailties the way they would for any other president?"

But Ari puts his finger on something that's very important here, the fact that he can be lucid sometimes is almost more problematic because, you don't know whether you're getting lucid Joe Biden or completely insane Joe Biden. And that -- and that makes it in a lot of ways even more frightening because it raises the question, okay, so if he can -- if he's all over the place in terms of his mental abilities and his ability to sort of be with it, then who's actually in charge when he does lose his mind? Is there somebody there? And who is that person? We -- this is a free country where we elect our leaders and that means we get to know we get to pick our leaders and we know who's in charge. And right now, we have no idea who's in charge when he's behind closed doors eating ice cream and talking about a fantasy of driving an 18-wheeler or whatever it is. It's pretty alarming."

His gallery of corruption that are full of masterpieces. Exhibit A, Burisma. Vice President Biden, then in charge of reducing corruption in the Ukraine, Hunter Biden on the board of one of the most corrupt companies in the country. Exhibit B, China. Flies with Vice President Biden to China on official business, on Air Force Two, and months later, $1.5 billion dollars invested, partnered with the Central Bank of China. And to this day, Judge, to this day, is an equity holder in the Chinese nuclear supplier group which is blacklisted for trying to steal warhead technology from the United States. And then, of course, exhibit C. This, you know, absolutely corrupt new art business. Enough is enough. Let's get to the bottom of it. This bill would force disclosure, I want to know who's circumventing the law and getting to the White House through buying this -- I even put air quotes around art."

Unfortunately, we have had to get here -- in America, you've got to force transparency in the Biden administration because no one knows who is buying these outrageously priced art pieces. And by the way, I didn't need the experts to tell me that they were overpriced, Judge. I love that whole part of it. But it's really sad because what the bill ultimately would do is I guess for future non-dependents of presidents, it's going to -- and vice president -- it's going to force them to disclose their financial information. This is like the one kid that can't behave at recess so the whole class has to get punished. But it would be nice to know what is happening behind the scenes. As Congressman Waltz just walked through, we know that Hunter Biden has been dependent on Joe Biden and his position in government for many, many years, and to the tune of millions and billions of dollars of profit for the Biden family. So, hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this. He certainly had no experience that got him the job at Burisma. That was because his dad was vice president. Certainly getting money from China, from Russia, all because his dad was vice president. Had nothing to do with his skill set whatsoever. So, it would be nice to get to the bottom of exactly what he's making all that money for."

The American people deserve to know that before they cast their vote. But I don't think we see this actually move -- to be candid with you, Judge -- until we fire Nancy Pelosi in 15 months and send her back to her ice cream in California. But I have to tell you, when we do take the majority, we are going to get to the bottom of these business dealings from the House of Representatives, because what I want to know is what kind of businesses are the Chinese directing Hunter to give them access to. The Chinese Communist Party isn't giving him a billion dollars to buy a shoestring factory in Michigan. They want robotics. They want advanced materials. They want artificial intelligence. They want things their military can use to then dominate the United States. And if there was a circumvention of their export controls and trying to protect that IP, that's what I want to get to the bottom of. And I think there's a lot more shoes to drop here."

We will never get to the bottom of this. And, unfortunately, it is terrible for America. What a bad precedent something like this could set. And it's incredibly frustrating to see because as you know, as I continue to say and you continue to hear from our family, when my father-in-law was president, we went out of our way to make sure that there was full transparency. We didn't have to do it, but we paid every dollar that any foreign entity spent at a Trump property back to the United States Treasury because we didn't want to have the faintest hint of impropriety when we wanted everything to be above board.

But furthermore, it's not enough just to hire more officers. You also have to stop demonizing the ones you have left and you have to stop demonizing officers in general so that you have those men and women that are willing to step up and take that calling to serve and protect their communities. The last thing I'll say on this, Judge, is -- you know, the Democrats, they are receiving a private protection courtesy of the American taxpayer in their cities. But you notice when they're receiving their private protection paid for by you and me, they're not using social workers. They're using actual security detail. So it just goes to show they place their service and their security over the American people. And it's enough of this. And the culture of lawlessness, stop demonizing officers, start hiring more officers and stop coddling criminals."

      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. She bowed to the political left, but the political left has lost this battle. Basically, the whole idea of defunding the police judge has backfired. The Democratic Party have surrendered the argument of defunding the police. You ask why. The poll numbers, the people in those cities are upset. They're going to lose in 2022, that's a fact. And so, the defunding the police, you won't hear that other than from the Squad, from the socialist congressional district. But these big-time Democratic mayors in Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Atlanta and in Los Angeles, they have felt the anger from their own party and that's why they are reversing course. And I guarantee from now to 2022, other than the loudmouth AOC and Tlaib and Omar, the Democratic mayors are going to support the law enforcement because they are in trouble right now politically."

      "utterance": "Well, and back to the Dallas Sergeant Pennie. You know, Sergeant, a bull's eye has been put on the backs of a lot of police officers. They've retired. They've quit. It's going to take a generation I believe for police to get back their -- their -- how can we say it? You know, their strength, their confidence, the society's belief in them. What are you seeing with the Dallas police?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENNIE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, we've also dealt with this decrease in -- and law enforcement officers leaving the profession. You know, we've seen the increase in crime. I mean, every city across the nation is dealing with this, and Dallas is not uh exclusive to that -- very problem. But more importantly, I think we need to talk about the politics involved in this and look at how we have -- these politicians and people like George Soros that are promoting these anti-police agendas. I mean, I saw this past week, that he donated over a million dollars to defund the police. I mean, you think about that kind of stuff and you look at what we're dealing with -- I mean, that's why I filed a lawsuit back in 2016 against Black Lives Matter and George Soros because I knew they were inciting violence against our police. Look, I was on the front line dealing with this -- these radicalized agenda. In 2016, we lost police officers. We lost five officers, killed in the line of duty in a domestic terrorist attack. And all that is fueled by this anti-police agenda. So you have police not want to enter the profession because they know that they're not being protected, they know that these politicians are against them, they know that these radical agendas are being funded by massive amounts of money and they don't have a chance. So I'm doing everything I can through the National Fallen Officer Foundation, make sure that we are raising attention to these issues and trying to do everything that we can to advocate for the interest of police in this country, and I'm going to keep doing that."

      "utterance": "I still think that there are a number of young people out there that still want to serve and protect their community. But it's going to take again, like you said, a generation of Americans that are not only proud of their police officers and law enforcement but proud of their country, because in order to answer that call, you want to serve and protect your community and your country. And that's going to start in our schools. We have to end the indoctrination and we have to make Americans proud to be Americans again. I think we'll start to see a radical change."
