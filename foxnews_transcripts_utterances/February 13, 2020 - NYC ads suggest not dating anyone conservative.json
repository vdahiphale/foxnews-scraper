      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. America is a great country precisely to the extent that it's a fair country. Fairness is the most important American idea, it's the foundation of all others and equality before the law is the purest expression of it. That's why the Roger Stone case ought to horrify anyone who has followed it. Left or right, Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Nine years in jail for lying. That's what prosecutors have demanded that Roger Stone receive. How disproportionate is that sentence? Let's put it this way. James Clapper and John Brennan are both confirmed perjurers. They did it in public. They will ever be prosecuted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At this moment, they're getting rich on television. Meanwhile, for the crime of sending explicit sexual photos to a child, a serious felony, former Congressman Anthony Weiner got just 21 months and he served less. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Weiner was an admitted sex offender, but he was also a close personal friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton's. And in the end, that's what mattered most. See how this works? Prosecutors want Roger Stone to serve nine years not because he hurt someone or hurt this country. He didn't. But because they hate him. As status liberals, they hate his politics. But above all, they hate his attitude. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Stone made fun of the ruling class. That's not allowed and they never forgot it. They're trying to kill him for it. How unscrupulous are they in pursuit of that goal? Well, prosecutors lied about what Stone did. They linked him to foreign election interference, when he had no tie to that and it had nothing to do with the charges against him -- not one thing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then apparently, they deceived their superiors at the Department of Justice about it. Attorney General Bill Barr suggested as much today.

No, she claimed. She hadn't paid much attention to the Russia probe. That turned out to be a lie and a stupid one at that. That juror's Twitter account is public, and it turns out that she's an anti-Trump zealot who closely followed the Mueller investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In one tweet, for example, she called Donald Trump, \"The Klan President.\" When Stone was taken into custody in a dawn raid by dozens of Federal agents armed with automatic weapons and an airboat, she mocked the idea that the arrest was excessive. Oh, it seems fine to me. This is not a neutral person. This is not someone capable of judging this trial fairly.

We still don't have the Centers for Disease Control in there to help out. Neighboring countries are starting to get more and more concerned about this. Physicians having to diagnose this without all the material they need and the ability to isolate patients is very worrisome.

Let them stay here, even if they commit more crimes and then amazingly, require taxpayers to pay for criminals who've already been deported to come back to our country. You'd get to buy plane tickets for armed robbers to move here from Guatemala. It's lunatic. The bill wouldn't just remake American immigration policy, it would remake the country itself. That's the point of course, and supporters of the bill often say openly, America's criminal justice system is racist. If you want crimes punished and criminals kept out of your country, you are racist, too. Only a truly radical party would consider a piece of legislation like that. The Democratic Party of 2020 is every bit that radical. If Democrats win this year's presidential election, some version of this insanity will almost certainly become law. But immigration isn't the only issue in which Democrats have become dangerously radical. It's now virtually every issue, including believe it or not, banking regulation. America has about 8,000 separate banks and credit unions and every one of them receive what's called a Camels rating. The rating evaluates a bank's financial health based on its assets, earnings, sensitivity to market risk, and other relevant factors. Crucially, all six parts of a Camels score are financial in nature, as you would imagine, or related to running a functioning business. Bad Camels score don't just mean a bank is in danger of failing and that investors should be wary of it. No. Low scores frequently trigger regulatory intervention by the Federal government. They can destroy a bank. It's a big deal. Now, congressional Democrats are pushing to add a seventh factor to the Camels rating, a nakedly political one. A bill called the Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Banking Act is currently working its way through the House. The bill would impose a so-called diversity mandate on banks if they want to stay in business, and we're not talking about diversity of assets that might make sense. No. This is the age of wokeness. Nobody cares about math anymore. Instead, regulators would monitor banks to see that they're providing enough anti- bias training and would keep track of their hiring practices based on race. They get out the ledger and see what color everyone is. Any bank with more than a billion dollars in assets would be required by law to have something called a Diversity and Inclusion Officer reporting directly to the CEO. Now, why are Democrats doing this? To make the country better? Right? No. It's a shakedown, like everything else they do. Listen to this strikingly clear explanation from the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion.",

At the same hearing, Green peppered witnesses with questions about whether it was time for, \"race conscious regulations in banking.\" You probably had no idea race had anything to do with banking, and most Americans of course had no idea that any of this was going on. But banks got the message loud and clear. Higher diversity commissars, the same kind that have done so much to destroy higher education in America, or the Feds will crush you. So where are congressional Republicans while this has been going on? Well take a guess. As is so often the case, they're playing along. At the same Diversity Subcommittee hearing, Ranking Member, Ann Wagner of Missouri praised banks for their work instituting unconscious bias training. By the way, something that has never been shown to do anything other than deepen racial wounds and divide this country -- ever. Now, it's a given that all of this is stupid and wasteful and divisive. It certainly is, but it's also dangerous to the country. So we already know what happens when the government pressures financial institutions to make financial decisions based on political considerations. We've seen it recently. Starting in the early 90s, and continuing through both Democrat and Republican administrations, banks face steadily rising pressure to make more risky loans to borrowers with lower income, thinner credit histories, and a much greater risk of default. Banks comply. They are afraid not to. So millions of Americans received subprime loans. Remember that? Down payments were cut or eliminated altogether. In most cases, the intentions behind this weren't bad actually. The government wanted more people, especially people in minority groups to own homes. Again, that's a laudable goal. Homeownership is a good thing for everyone. It gives all of us a stake in our society, something to be proud of, and by the way, a legacy to leave our children. But the way to promote homeownership is to make homes less expensive, and to create an economy robust enough that people can afford to buy them. They didn't do that. They ignored reality. That doesn't work. It never works. But for years, the government demanded that banks follow the rules whether they made sense or not. And the result, as you remember was the 2008 financial meltdown. It was the worst economic crisis in this country in 80 years since 1929. America still has not recovered from it, nor apparently has Congress learned a thing. We live in the age of woke colleges and woke tech companies, woke billionaires, woke investment banks. Now, we have -- of course we do -- woke dating. Mark Steyn joins us to discuss why more and more Americans refuse to date outside the narrow band of their ideology. But first, time for Final Exam.

Years ago the BBC used to put me on shows, they put me up against radical Marxist feminists thinking they'd get a lot of fireworks and it would make for great television. And about two minutes in, I'd usually think wow, this really severe radical Marxist feminist telling me what a racist bigot I am is kind of turning me on and I get all flirty and the show would fall to pieces.

Fairness is the most important American idea, it's the foundation of all others and equality before the law is the purest expression of it. That's why the Roger Stone case ought to horrify anyone who has followed it. Left or right, Republican or Democrat, it doesn't matter. Nine years in jail for lying. That's what prosecutors have demanded that Roger Stone receive. How disproportionate is that sentence? Let's put it this way. James Clapper and John Brennan are both confirmed perjurers. They did it in public. They will ever be prosecuted. At this moment, they're getting rich on television. Meanwhile, for the crime of sending explicit sexual photos to a child, a serious felony, former Congressman Anthony Weiner got just 21 months and he served less. Weiner was an admitted sex offender, but he was also a close personal friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton's. And in the end, that's what mattered most. See how this works? Prosecutors want Roger Stone to serve nine years not because he hurt someone or hurt this country. He didn't. But because they hate him. As status liberals, they hate his politics. But above all, they hate his attitude. Stone made fun of the ruling class. That's not allowed and they never forgot it. They're trying to kill him for it. How unscrupulous are they in pursuit of that goal? Well, prosecutors lied about what Stone did. They linked him to foreign election interference, when he had no tie to that and it had nothing to do with the charges against him -- not one thing. Then apparently, they deceived their superiors at the Department of Justice about it. Attorney General Bill Barr suggested as much today. Watch."

But we know them, and they lead us to the conclusion that the charges and recommended sentence against Roger Stone weren't the only parts of the process that were distorted by tough politics grotesquely. The trial itself was, too. During the jury selection process at Roger Stone's trial, lawyers asked the eventual foreman of the jury, if there was anything that would affect her ability to judge Stone fairly. No, she claimed. She hadn't paid much attention to the Russia probe. That turned out to be a lie and a stupid one at that. That juror's Twitter account is public, and it turns out that she's an anti-Trump zealot who closely followed the Mueller investigation. In one tweet, for example, she called Donald Trump, \"The Klan President.\" When Stone was taken into custody in a dawn raid by dozens of Federal agents armed with automatic weapons and an airboat, she mocked the idea that the arrest was excessive. Oh, it seems fine to me. This is not a neutral person. This is not someone capable of judging this trial fairly. This is a partisan who lied about who she was. Roger Stone is facing life in prison because an Obama appointed judge, Amy Berman Jackson allowed this woman to run the jury. And that's all fine with CNN, which has colluded with the Justice Department from day one on this, and which is rooting for Stone to die behind bars. But it should be deeply upsetting to anyone who cares about fairness and that should be all of us. But it's not. For example, Republicans in the Senate. You'd think they'd be outraged by all of this. And yet, it's perfectly obvious they could care less. Watch."

Because if Roger Stone spends even a day in jail, they will point to him for the next 40 years as evidence that Russia collusion was real. That's what they really want. Let's hope the President doesn't let them have it. Judge Andrew Napolitano is a Fox senior judicial analyst. We just spoke to him about Roger Stone."

Why would someone like this allowed to remain on the jury?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Let me start by telling you, I'm happy to be here with you. And Roger Stone and I have been friends for about 40 years. I'm going to take the friendship equation out of this and wear my judicial hat. This is information that she must have hid hidden from the lawyers and the judge who interrogated her before she was put on the jury. Now in Federal Court, judges pick the jurors. So judges do the interrogation. The lawyers sign off ahead of time on the questions that judges are going to ask. The purpose of the interrogation is to weed out people that have a biased prejudice, knowledge of the case or interest in the outcome. She obviously had a prejudice against Roger Stone, a bias in favor of his prosecution and an interest in seeing him convicted. That should automatically disqualify her. Now, what do you do when you discover this after the conviction, Tucker? The proper thing for the judge to do is to bring this juror back in the courtroom in the presence of Roger Stone and his lawyers and in the presence of the four prosecutors that have since resigned. Because their resignations are not effective until, she, the trial judge accepts them and interrogate this woman in order to determine whether the bias influenced her guilty vote and whether that bias was passed on to other members of the jury."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So that's interesting. That sounds from a layman's perspective, like the right thing to do, though, I mean, the court screens for bias, of course in jury selection. If it turned out that this juror who ran the jury as the foreman, lied about her background or her views, what would that mean?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Well, it would be catastrophic for her. First of all, she's a lawyer, so she would be prosecuted for perjury since the statements are given under oath. And if convicted, she would lose her license to practice law. That will be the least of her concerns. She probably would serve jail time if she lied in order to affect the outcome of a case, and if she did lie, if the judge concluded she lied, Tucker, that is an automatic vacation of the conviction and an order for a new trial if the government even wants to try Stone a second time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So Judge Amy Berman Jackson has kept Roger Stone under a gag order for many months now. He makes his living by speaking, of course. He is now broke as a result. I'm confused. We can go on television and attack Roger Stone. CNN does it all day long. They did it all day today. Roger Stone is not allowed to defend himself using the First Amendment rights the rest of us enjoy. How is that allowed in this country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "It is highly inappropriate and a direct violation of the First Amendment. There is at least an argument to be made about restraining both the defendants and the prosecutors from making statements about the case while it's pending because those statements might make their way to the jury. That's an extra courtroom way of communicating with the jury. And I hated having to do it. But there are sometimes that's the only way you can assure the integrity of the trial. But there is zero benefit to be served to the justice system in silencing a defendant after he has been convicted. Once conviction comes out or acquittal as the case may be, that defended resumes the full panoply of First Amendment rights that he had before the case started."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "You would certainly think and finally, the sentence guidelines here. So the median rapist in this country serves about four years in prison; nine years is the top end of the recommendation for Roger Stone. Put that in context for us. Why would they recommend that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Probably because they dislike him, they despise him. Listen, if you despise the person you're prosecuting, you probably shouldn't be in the case. I did the calculation myself as if I were the judge. Tucker, there is some subjective elements to the calculation. There are 20 questions, aggravating factors. There are 20 mitigating factors, you have to choose the factors that apply. I came up with three and a half years. Now this is just a recommendation. She could sentence him from zero to 50 years. Under the new law that President Trump signed, she is no longer bound by the guidelines. It's just a recommendation. So when the public became aware of this recommendation, most of us were outraged. I mean, Roger Stone is not a menace to society. This isn't a jail case to begin with, much less one of this magnitude. The judge is free to reject it. But now we don't know what she's going to do. In my view, she has to examine the integrity of the trial and the conviction before she proceeds to sentencing."

You'd have to be like a Rhodes Scholar McKinsey guy to think that was a good idea. By the way, Mayor Pete's plan is already being attempted in the City of Seattle. Leftwing prosecutors there have abandoned almost all drug prosecutions. So how is it going? Is it working? Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio show host and he joins us tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. So simple question, Pete Buttigieg judge is telling us we need to do this. It's essentially happened where you live? Has it worked?"

      "utterance": "Simple answer. No. It has not worked at all. What we've seen here unfortunately, is an increase over the last 10 years when our prosecutor in King County, Dan Satterberg decided first not to charge felony accounts, and then he chose instead not to charge anyone with \"personal amount of possession.\" So to your point, crack cocaine, methamphetamine, whatever. And what we've seen at the same time is a dramatic increase in the amount of overdose deaths. At the same time, we've also seen a dramatic increase in the amount of drug deals that are happening out in the open in Seattle streets. A big part of the problem is that cops will say, well, now they don't really have any leverage to use over addicts to get them to seek treatment, because they know that there's no actual consequences."

They resupply, they restock up on their supply, more often they would normally do, but they know that if they were to get stopped, if they had some product on them, they can say no, I'm not a drug dealer. I'm just a user and they know that they're not actually going to see any time in jail for their drug crimes. And that's why it's gotten so out of control. It's been a total failure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    {
      "speaker": "RANTZ",
      "utterance": "So Dan Satterberg does, this King County prosecutor. He had a sister who he lost to a drug addiction. The problem with this when you put ideology into what is a reasonable idea, because I do think it's reasonable to say, if you're an addict, and you're not committing a crime, I don't want to just throw you in jail. I want to put you in treatment. I think that's the right thing to do."

But you can't even at this point, leverage jail time against an addict to go after the drug dealer, to turn on the drug dealer to go after the bad guys. And it's an unfortunate reality all across Seattle. They tried it in a neighboring county in Snohomish County, and it was a total disaster.

First of all, the international health community is in a state of outrage over the way that this virus has been handled in China from the very beginning. We believe that they knew about this for weeks before it ever started to come out or was even declared. Now, they're saying, well, we're running low on test kits, Tucker. So we have to start using chest x-rays and CAT scans to diagnose the pneumonia we see in 15 percent of cases and that points to a larger problem. How many thousands of cases are out there in China that are still in diagnosed or never diagnosed? The head of the C.D.C. pointed out today that we think within the first week, you can spread it asymptomatically before you even have symptoms. All of this points to it still not being under control. We still don't have the Centers for Disease Control in there to help out. Neighboring countries are starting to get more and more concerned about this. Physicians having to diagnose this without all the material they need and the ability to isolate patients is very worrisome. And eventually it's going to spill over to the rest of the world potentially causing a pandemic. I want to point out a neighbor right next to China, North Korea, the Hermit Kingdom is claiming today they don't have a single case. I ask you, Tucker, do you believe that? I certainly don't. But talk about lack of disclosure. A virus is something that doesn't obey boundaries. It's public health. The world needs to come together here to solve this problem before it really gets out of control."

      "utterance": "A week ago on this show, we told you about the New Way Forward Act. If passed, that law would welcome dangerous violent criminals into the United States. Let them stay here, even if they commit more crimes and then amazingly, require taxpayers to pay for criminals who've already been deported to come back to our country. You'd get to buy plane tickets for armed robbers to move here from Guatemala. It's lunatic. The bill wouldn't just remake American immigration policy, it would remake the country itself. That's the point of course, and supporters of the bill often say openly, America's criminal justice system is racist. If you want crimes punished and criminals kept out of your country, you are racist, too. Only a truly radical party would consider a piece of legislation like that. The Democratic Party of 2020 is every bit that radical. If Democrats win this year's presidential election, some version of this insanity will almost certainly become law. But immigration isn't the only issue in which Democrats have become dangerously radical. It's now virtually every issue, including believe it or not, banking regulation. America has about 8,000 separate banks and credit unions and every one of them receive what's called a Camels rating. The rating evaluates a bank's financial health based on its assets, earnings, sensitivity to market risk, and other relevant factors. Crucially, all six parts of a Camels score are financial in nature, as you would imagine, or related to running a functioning business. Bad Camels score don't just mean a bank is in danger of failing and that investors should be wary of it. No. Low scores frequently trigger regulatory intervention by the Federal government. They can destroy a bank. It's a big deal. Now, congressional Democrats are pushing to add a seventh factor to the Camels rating, a nakedly political one. A bill called the Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Banking Act is currently working its way through the House. The bill would impose a so-called diversity mandate on banks if they want to stay in business, and we're not talking about diversity of assets that might make sense. No. This is the age of wokeness. Nobody cares about math anymore. Instead, regulators would monitor banks to see that they're providing enough anti- bias training and would keep track of their hiring practices based on race. They get out the ledger and see what color everyone is. Any bank with more than a billion dollars in assets would be required by law to have something called a Diversity and Inclusion Officer reporting directly to the CEO. Now, why are Democrats doing this? To make the country better? Right? No. It's a shakedown, like everything else they do. Listen to this strikingly clear explanation from the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion."

At the same hearing, Green peppered witnesses with questions about whether it was time for, \"race conscious regulations in banking.\" You probably had no idea race had anything to do with banking, and most Americans of course had no idea that any of this was going on. But banks got the message loud and clear. Higher diversity commissars, the same kind that have done so much to destroy higher education in America, or the Feds will crush you. So where are congressional Republicans while this has been going on? Well take a guess. As is so often the case, they're playing along. At the same Diversity Subcommittee hearing, Ranking Member, Ann Wagner of Missouri praised banks for their work instituting unconscious bias training. By the way, something that has never been shown to do anything other than deepen racial wounds and divide this country -- ever. Now, it's a given that all of this is stupid and wasteful and divisive. It certainly is, but it's also dangerous to the country. So we already know what happens when the government pressures financial institutions to make financial decisions based on political considerations. We've seen it recently. Starting in the early 90s, and continuing through both Democrat and Republican administrations, banks face steadily rising pressure to make more risky loans to borrowers with lower income, thinner credit histories, and a much greater risk of default. Banks comply. They are afraid not to. So millions of Americans received subprime loans. Remember that? Down payments were cut or eliminated altogether. In most cases, the intentions behind this weren't bad actually. The government wanted more people, especially people in minority groups to own homes. Again, that's a laudable goal. Homeownership is a good thing for everyone. It gives all of us a stake in our society, something to be proud of, and by the way, a legacy to leave our children. But the way to promote homeownership is to make homes less expensive, and to create an economy robust enough that people can afford to buy them. They didn't do that. They ignored reality. That doesn't work. It never works. But for years, the government demanded that banks follow the rules whether they made sense or not. And the result, as you remember was the 2008 financial meltdown. It was the worst economic crisis in this country in 80 years since 1929. America still has not recovered from it, nor apparently has Congress learned a thing. We live in the age of woke colleges and woke tech companies, woke billionaires, woke investment banks. Now, we have -- of course we do -- woke dating.

OKCupid is running ads encouraging users to fill out questionnaires about their political beliefs in order to help the website find a partner for them. Unfortunately, it's a good business move. New York is full of people with strong progressive political views. Polls show that 83 percent of those who despise the current President would never date someone who doesn't hate Donald Trump. We just saw Mark Steyn in Final Exam. He rejoins us tonight. Mark, what does this tell you?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think the fact that actually all the categories, particularly all the advertising, where they say it's OK to choose Mr. Right based on how far he leans left or it's OK to date someone who is prochoice, these things actually suggest that it's woke people who are finding it harder than anyone to get a date. And that's kind of rather sad. That's actually borne out by the statistics that in fact, there's been a collapse of dating rituals and a collapse of dating and a collapse of relationships. You know, love can strike you where it finds it, and politics shouldn't be factored into that to the degree this is, that people actually have litmus political tests. Years ago the BBC used to put me on shows, they put me up against radical Marxist feminists thinking they'd get a lot of fireworks and it would make for great television. And about two minutes in, I'd usually think wow, this really severe radical Marxist feminist telling me what a racist bigot I am is kind of turning me on and I get all flirty and the show would fall to pieces. So I think it's kind of sad that the idea of being able to find love, where one might. The idea of choosing your partner based on their attitude to these kind of dreary political considerations is rather -- If you feel like that, why not just go to an Eric Swalwell rally? In the unlikely event that there's anybody there, you might want to date, you already know the check will be --"

And actually, as I said, all the statistics bear that out that in fact, young people are finding it more and more difficult to form relationships, in part because of all these rules. By the way, like all woke corporations, they're slightly behind the curve on this. You have things like there's -- for example, there's a situation in Britain where a transgender lady made a criminal complaint because she'd been booked for a pornographic movie. And when the porn star found that she was in fact transgender and was non- conforming, as I believe, if you know what I mean, she -- he fired her and she complained, and she's actually expecting a judge to order this guy to have sex with somebody he doesn't want to have sex with. That's what super woke is. Super woke, it doesn't matter whether you're straight or CIS or gay or whatever, you've got to just show how super woke you are by having sex even if you don't want to. That's how -- that's dating in the super woke era."
