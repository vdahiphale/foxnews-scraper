And since then, because of Obama's decision, ISIS carried out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed more than 2,000 people and injured tens of thousands more. And so having campaigned against that, having pledged, having then re-defeated ISIS, why would he make the same mistake that Barack Obama made by pulling all of our troops out, taking our boot off the terrorist neck, and allowing them and Al Qaeda to have a safe haven in Syria?

And here's war against ISIS by the numbers -- 2,000 troops in Syria, about 5,000 stationed in Iraq, recent reports from the Pentagon believed to be about 30,000 current and former ISIS members still present in the Syria and Iraq area. So far, $23 billion military operations that we've spent in Syria and Iraq. And the question is, if these lawmakers are right, Susan, is how much this affects that effort on the ground."

And Charles is certainly right that this is something President Trump has said from the days of the campaign that he wanted to do. But he did not apparently give a heads up to a secretary of state, for one, secretary of defense for another, not to mention Republicans on Capitol Hill, that this was coming. And that is a -- messy might be one word. But it means that you don't have the kind of discussion about whether this is the wise thing to do, how do you go about doing it. And do you claim victory, which is a very dangerous thing to do against a foe like ISIS."

      "utterance": "The positive is that Donald Trump has removed the Islamic State's physical caliphate. Just last week they knocked out a final town where they were living in. But the problem with that is what ISIS has now done is ISIS has reverting into it an insurgency. And as you showed on those stats, thousands of troops that can go out and cause all sorts of mayhem. And also, ISIS is not the only terrorist organization and Syria. Al Qaeda, which is more dangerous than ISIS according to our intelligence community, has a safe haven there. So President Trump deserves great credit for the military accomplishments against ISIS, and while he did campaign, Charlie, for pulling out of a lot of these countries, he also campaigned against Barack Obama's precipitous decision to pull out of Iraq in 2011, saying that it was a disaster that we shouldn't have been there to begin with, but once we were there we had to stay and win, and that he called him the founder of ISIS for allowing is to rise up. And since then, because of Obama's decision, ISIS carried out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed more than 2,000 people and injured tens of thousands more. And so having campaigned against that, having pledged, having then re-defeated ISIS, why would he make the same mistake that Barack Obama made by pulling all of our troops out, taking our boot off the terrorist neck, and allowing them and Al Qaeda to have a safe haven in Syria? It makes no sense."

The Russia statement about this decision came out. \"A milestone story which might involve this decision is a real prospect for a political solution. Hope emerges that this location on the Syrian map will follow the example of Aleppo and other Syrian towns and villages which begin getting back to peaceful life. Once Americans were there, there was no such hope.\" There was also no such hope, really, of protecting those Syrian Kurds who, people like President Erdogan, really would like to get rid of as a possible threat."

But in terms of the broad policy that the president has sort of put forward about not being the world's policemen, I would argue that is one of the three main reasons he got elected in the first place. And what we are seeing here is keeping that promise."

But there are larger calculations that have led other presidents to say this is the kind of mission the United States must do for broader interests. So it's not that I think there's going to be a lot of political blowback for the president. I think there are Democrats who think, great, our soldiers are coming home. We're going to spend time and effort here in the United States, not in places called Syria where I've never been. But that doesn't mean it's the wise thing to do. Time is going to tell us about that."

So what's happened is he's weakened himself.

The fact that you have Democrats playing this word game, I think the bottom line is they do want to keep it as an issue. They view it as a very good issue for them in the election, not just in terms of bargaining."
