He issued an invitation late today, said come on over, bipartisan folks from the hill, and we're going to watch the new Churchill movie, \"The Darkest Hour.\" It is the story of his leadership during England's darkest hour after the fall of France in World War II. Churchill's job was to convince the British people that the war against Nazi Germany was winnable even if the British Empire had to fight it alone. He said this. \"It must be remembered that we are in the preliminary stage of one of the greatest battles in history. What is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs. Victory in spite of all terror. Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory, there is no survival.\" And right he was. And victory it was. Send me one of your favorite quotes and maybe we'll put it on at the end of the show. You can email me at thestory@foxnews.com. Have a great night, everybody. That's our story for tonight.

But the reality of it is, on this issue, I could not agree more. American small business is generally categorized as a sole proprietorship, about 95 percent of small businesses are categorized as a sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship at a rate of 45 percent. This allows us to take a 20 percent tax deduction, and we need that tax deduction.

Let's bring a David Bossie, Trump 2016 deputy campaign manager and president of Citizens United; and Marie Harf, former spokesperson for both the State Department and the CIA, and both are Fox News contributors. Marie, let me start with you on this. You know, in my office, I look at a bunch of different T.V. screens throughout the day, I look at what everyone's covering. We think about what we're going to put on the show every night, and, you know, we want to be fair and we want to give balance to what we're presenting every evening. But, you know, you look at these numbers, the potential for a four percent GDP, and then I read things from Javier who says, you know, I'm a Democrat, I would really like to see other Democrats get on board here. You look at housing numbers, which are very strong, retail numbers which are very strong. And you do have to ask yourself why there's not a little bit more credit being given on the Democratic side."

      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR BOTH STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE CIA",
      "utterance": "Well, in general, look, President Trump also has a historically low approval rating. It's not just Democrats, it's moderates, independents, and it's some Republicans who say, sure, he's moving forward on tax reform but the divisiveness, the way he's handled certain issues like DACA, like the failed Obamacare repeal. He has had a number of issues he's not followed through on. And when you look at tax reform, you know, Democrats do support tax reform in principle, but this bill was written in secret, they didn't want Democrats to be a part of it and it really rolled back President Trump's promise to focus on the middle-class. If this were a middle-class tax bill, not a corporate, focused corporate wealthiest Americans tax cut, I think you would have Democrats on board."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I think you're going to have a lot of Democrats constituents, David, who look at this bill and they look at what they get back, you know. If the promises hold true, they're going to get the money back starting in February. They're going to be asking why some of their members of Congress won't support it. DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND TRUMP 2016 DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Absolutely. The Democrats -- the problem with the Democrat Party is they have no ideas and no agenda for the American people. That's why they continue to lose elections and in droves. So, look, we -- this tax plan is good for all Americans, not Democrat or Republican, Conservative or Liberals. This is a good tax reform package for all Americans. So, I just want to say that the mainstream media just gives no credit to this president. This economy is on his back. He's carrying it through deregulation and through the sheer force of his will and he understands what businesses want and businesses know that they have a business-friendly president. Let me just say, if Barack Obama had had a three percent and near four percent GDP, he would've gotten a Nobel Prize for economics. That's the difference here. They can't even look at this objectively and say how good this would be for the American people."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He said, look, some of these jobs are never coming back, right? And then, you look at the beginning of the Trump administration when they saved one carrier factory, 800 jobs. And you know, we looked at the balance on that, are they doing better because one factory did end up going to Mexico. But politi-fact judge that a promise kept, Marie. You know, there's a positivity that, you know, as you point out is not reflected in these numbers, which makes you wonder about the polling in some ways -- maybe it's accurate, maybe it's not. But there's a positivity that seems to be filled out there in America that isn't necessarily felt when you watch T.V."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, I think in some places. But look, President Obama also had a record number of months with consistent job growth. Record low unemployment coming out of the worst financial crisis since the great depression. So, President Trump inherited an economy that was growing, he has -- I agree, he has done things that have helped positively in terms of the market, people are expecting tax reform. But we need to talk out there in the country about the reality of this economy, promising coal miners that all of their jobs will come back because Donald Trump as president is irresponsible. We need to talk about where we're going in 2018, and 2019, and 202o, and not making these promises to get votes that aren't in the realm of possibility in today's economy. I think that's irresponsible and you're going to see voters, you've already seen anecdotal stories about voters in places like Indiana and West Virginia and Ohio -- where I'm from -- say, wait a second, we thought things were going to change, but they're not going."

      "utterance": "What has changed is the stock market has 5,000 more points on it, the economy is growing leaps and bounds and that's what this president has done. And so, look, the Democrats just have no plan, they've never had an economic plan. They don't believe in tax cuts. Fundamentally, you're going to see no Democrats vote for this, and they're going to pay for it at the ballot box. Because when the economy continues to grow and we get four percent growth, 4.5 percent growth, then -- and the economy is humming. The American people are going to recognize who's responsible."

At this hour, at least six people are confirmed dead after the high-speed train that was on its maiden voyage jumped the tracks of an overpass south of Tacoma. It crashed down onto one of the state's busiest highways. Witnesses described a horrific scene: passengers screaming for their lives as first responders rushed into the train and try to pull them off of the one that was hanging over the overpass down onto the highway below. Dan Springer is live at the site tonight with the very latest information from Dupont, Washington as they try to figure out what happened here. Good evening, Dan."

The Associated Press reported that six people died, at least six. But nobody here on the scene has been able to confirm that number and perhaps part of the confusion is because they're having difficulty getting into some of those train cars that are still dangling over that Highway Trussell, that bridge where that train derailed this morning. You can see that that is still dangling over the side, at least two of them are off of the tracks and over that thing. So, we believe that they have some of this heavy equipment in here, and you can see a light in there. They're looking at ways to shore up that train to be able to get inside, to see exactly how many people are inside. 70 people at least were injured. There were 77 people on the train, passengers, and then five crewmembers. It was a chaotic scene right afterward; the initial moments were picked up on scanners. Here's the train conductor."

However, at that point of that curve, the speed limit we understand it supposed to be no more than 30 miles per hour. NTSB will be looking into that and as well as many other issues.

BARACK OBAMA, 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There've been times where America showed arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.

      "speaker": "WALTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, a number of things were really striking to me. You know, one, just taking a step back, it really looks at the world very realistically as it is, and then tries to chart America's path within that world rather than looking at the world as we wish it to be -- which is what I think we saw the last eight years. So, what does that really mean? Well, one, I think philosophically, you know, this president is looking for America to lead within the world in accordance with its values and sees America as a force for good. Whereas President Obama, I think at his core saw American intervention as doing more harm than good and sought to pull that back. The second thing is that, you know, it really sees the world -- you know, the United States in a competitive space from diplomatic information and military to economic period and acknowledges that and charts on how America is going to compete. And that's from pure competitors like Russia and China, that's from rogue states like Iran and North Korea, and that's from terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Qaeda."

And looking at things like currency manipulation at the wholesale theft of the United States technological edge at unfair trade deals. Those are all things that this administration is looking to take on as national security issue, not as sideline kind of economic issues. It also looks at areas like space where the Chinese are incredibly aggressive right now in challenging American dominance and then charts a course on how the United States is going to challenge and lead in space whether it's through the commercial sector like SpaceX or through national security sector."

Other Democratic senators who called on Franken to step down are standing by their decisions. Things in the world of sports are moving much faster. Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson now says he is selling the team. The 81-year-old, Richardson, has been accused of workplace misconduct that Sports Illustrated says includes sexually suggestive language, inappropriate comments, and at least one racial slur. A top female executive will now run the Panthers until they're sold. Sean Diddy Combs has already said he's interested in buying and that his first move would be to get controversial quarterback Colin Kaepernick back on the field. And the top man in ESPN, John Skipper, has now stepped down as president. ESPN has been hit with its own sexual misconduct allegations, but Skippers says his resignation is because of substance abuse problems, though he did not specify, only saying, quoting, I come to this public disclosure with embarrassment, trepidation and a feeling of having let others I care about down. Skipper's contract had just been renewed last month and we're told the decision has nothing to do with Disney, the owner of ESPN, buying most of 21st Century Fox, the owner of us. Martha."

I went on radio, I've been here on Fox saying, wait, he's not resigned. He hasn't said when he's going to. And I think this is of course before the Roy Moore case at that election thinking that he would get in. But let's keep in mind what the congress has to deal with. Jackie Spears said that there're 260 individual cases that were paid out through the shush fund. That would involve not just sexual harassment but racial discrimination, et cetera. If we have the precedent of a series of individuals, John Conyers is already stepped away. That seems to be a unique dynamic, but I think that there's an expectation that if Franken resign, thank God, forbid, we might expect others to resign, especially if they can't protect those names on that list, because that is the next demand that people want to see the sides. If you have an ethics committee and people within your club there are judging you, are some of those people on the ethics committee involved with the shush fund? How can we know if there's fairness?

Then you mentioned Linda Sarsour or even George Takei, who plays Sulu on Star Trek. I loathe both of their politics, and yet each individual accusation. If you've got -- normally you would have a systemic problem that others are aware of as well. We're seeing that play out. So it is in a way a case by case basis.

In fact, Democrats trying hard to pour gasoline on this fire by spreading rumors, and that's all it is right now, suggesting that President Trump will try to fire Robert Mueller. The president flatly denying that, but in fact there are some Democrats suggesting maybe the special counsel's credibility is being undermined. And in fact, allies with the president are trying to directly undermine that credibility. A lawyer for the president's transition team trying to make the case Mueller himself came to the probe by obtaining tens of thousands of emails from the time period between the election and the inaugural. Mueller did this not by issuing a subpoena that would have been found out by the White House, but by quietly going directly to the general services administration, which helps manage bureaucratic functions including the presidential transition. Trump for America Counsel Inc. council, Kory Langhofer, declaring that career government employees, potentially hostile to the president, quote, unlawfully produced the transitions private materials including privileged communications to the special counsel's office. Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel push back on that, quote, when we have obtain emails in a course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process. But Alan Dershowitz, as you mentioned, a lifelong Democrat says this was a close legal call, so it was foolish for Mueller to fail to make this airtight by seeking an easily obtainable warrant. Dershowitz adding that Mueller should have immediately disclosed to the public he had in fact removed that FBI agent, Peter Strzok, from the case because of anti-Trump text messages rather than waiting a couple of months for everyone to find out.

No judge will sign a search warrant, as a person who has signed thousands of them, no judge will sign a search warrant when the documents are in the hands of a third person. You sign a search warrant when you're worried about the defendant getting rid of the documents. So when they're in the hands of a third person, here a computer server in the possession of the government, the proper way to do this is by a subpoena, which is what Bob Mueller did. Here is where the ball was dropped, and it wasn't dropped by Bob Mueller. It was dropped by the GSA, the government entity and the executive branch that owned the server. They should have said to the transition lawyer we just got a subpoena from Mueller. We have two weeks to comply. Here's a copy of it. Do you want to go challenge it before a judge? We'll let a judge call it. They didn't tell the transition lawyer's. That's why the transition lawyers were so upset when they found out about it. But there is a danger here because Bob Mueller has already, through his FBI agents, interviewed all the people in the west wing who worked in the transition and they probably didn't know at the time of those interviews the FBI agents doing the interviews had read their emails."

And Harry Reid says he doesn't feel bad about it at all. In fact, he considers it to be - - he said I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry that I got this thing going. I think it's one of the good things that I did during my congressional service. I've done something that no one has done before. Charlie."

There's way too much fraud, waste and abuse happening in our government. A lot of it happens at the Pentagon. This is a great example of it, whether it's a Democratic Party doing it or the Republican Party doing it, it all happens at the Pentagon."

He issued an invitation late today, said come on over, bipartisan folks from the hill, and we're going to watch the new Churchill movie, \"The Darkest Hour.\" It is the story of his leadership during England's darkest hour after the fall of France in World War II. Churchill's job was to convince the British people that the war against Nazi Germany was winnable even if the British Empire had to fight it alone. He said this. \"It must be remembered that we are in the preliminary stage of one of the greatest battles in history. What is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs. Victory in spite of all terror. Victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory, there is no survival.\" And right he was. And victory it was. Send me one of your favorite quotes and maybe we'll put it on at the end of the show. You can email me at thestory@foxnews.com. Have a great night, everybody. That's our story for tonight.
