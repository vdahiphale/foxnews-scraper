When you're watching those idiots on those other networks talk and fart master, Swalwell, this is all a deflection because if you look at the -- if you look at the suspect, he's mentally ill, he's homeless, he's illegal. Those are three areas that have been abdicated by the Democrats. They don't deal with the border. They don't care about the mentally ill, and they certainly don't care about the homeless. They just let him sleep on the streets. They let him camp. They don't give them any medical care. So that's what you're seeing right there with those people. It was their responsibility to create an environment of safety and security, and because it doesn't exist, they go after speech. But the funny thing is, if you believe that speech causes violence, then what do you advise? Like, what do you -- what do you advise having 370 million people change their discourse to appease a tiny number of deranged people? That is impossible. However, you could institutionalize the mentally ill. You could make it harder for the homeless to be living on your streets. You could deport illegal aliens.

Well, it's because we have the emails directly from her and her team to the CDC. And the CDC say, oh, OK, yes, absolutely. Remember Rochelle Walensky said, I think schools should be open. All of a sudden, the White House said, actually though you're in front of a CDC sign right now. You are speaking in your personal capacity. Teachers, they were given the -- in Fairfax County, Virginia, given the first option for vaccines in order to bring back kids to school but they didn't do it. They're like -- they're like, oh, no, actually, we can't have kids in school. So, I don't think there's people who are going to be very forgiving. And there's another group that we forget about, and that is the recent retirees who lost two and a half years of their bucket list opportunities and it's not fair to them. Or how about the ones who now have to get a second job or aren't able to retire because inflation is crushing them? So, there's not a lot of forgiveness at this point.",

But early May, we knew exactly who was affected by this, who was dying from it. We knew that lockdowns didn't work from data in New York City. And we knew that kids could go back to school because they weren't at risk. May 2020 -- and yet, as of this year, I have a friend who wasn't who -- she had a doctor, she's pregnant, who called her and said, you are not going to be a fit for our practice. We are denying you care because you don't want to take the COVID vaccine, which we know was lied about not only by the government by -- but also by Pfizer, in terms of what they said that they did for testing, before everyone was forced to choose between their job and taking an experimental vaccine. You know, who can't forgive are the firefighters in New York City were willing to run into buildings and risk their lives during COVID, at the height of COVID, at the beginning when there was no vaccine, but then were fired from their job or let go because they refuse to take it. So, when you look at the long list of things whether it's the kids in school, whether it's denial of health care to people for whatever reason, for you know, really because of an ideology, the issue is about like you said the intention. And it's a matter of the control that they took. They weren't interested after May of 2020 in actually helping people with the pandemic. They held on forever and they're still doing it. And people's lives were ruined and they can't get it back. So, I think there's a lot of people who are deeply affected their lives were changed forever as a result of this who aren't willing to forgive and they have a really good reason not to.",

So, what they see as something that's been good and something they can run on and they made the argument that the Republicans didn't help us get this across the finish line at all, well, voters are saying, yeah, and we're glad that they didn't and that's why I might hire them for the job on Tuesday.

That's what they would have done if this was just somebody else. When you're watching those idiots on those other networks talk and fart master, Swalwell, this is all a deflection because if you look at the -- if you look at the suspect, he's mentally ill, he's homeless, he's illegal. Those are three areas that have been abdicated by the Democrats. They don't deal with the border. They don't care about the mentally ill, and they certainly don't care about the homeless. They just let him sleep on the streets. They let him camp. They don't give them any medical care. So that's what you're seeing right there with those people. It was their responsibility to create an environment of safety and security, and because it doesn't exist, they go after speech. But the funny thing is, if you believe that speech causes violence, then what do you advise? Like, what do you -- what do you advise having 370 million people change their discourse to appease a tiny number of deranged people? That is impossible. However, you could institutionalize the mentally ill. You could make it harder for the homeless to be living on your streets. You could deport illegal aliens.

He was a guy who thought he was Jesus for the last five years. He also -- there are accusations of pedophilia against his own children. They're --not -- not to mention the fact that homeless and obviously creating problems for the neighbors. He probably shouldn't have been on the streets at all and he shouldn't have even been in the country because he was here illegally. I think that we could all say political speech has gone too far. You have Supreme Court justices who have not been able to sleep in their own homes for several months and the Attorney General did nothing about that. And then you also have the fact that, you know, Steve Scalise, he can't walk correctly anymore because he was shot. And there was, at that time, it was like okay, let's all agree, this was a lunatic and lunatics and crazy people are radicalized by lots of different things all across the board. That is one of the reasons that crime is such a concern for people who are living in places like this, is that you don't know what they're going to do or what they're going to think on any given moment. They could just lash out at you. It's not like crime is just concentrated in one little area now. When you have homeless all across the country that is something that is a huge problem and you don't -- I don't even know if Republicans have a good answer on homelessness, but at least I think people are trying to say we want some sort of order.

And two, I'm glad he's being held. I think that we should all be glad he's being held. I think we should -- we can point out that the -- perhaps the shortcomings and hypocrisy of our bail laws and I think I'm a huge advocate that that should be a big part of what -- I hope the Republicans, that they do take control of the House, that that's one of the first things they do as oppose to investigate. It'd be a smart thing for everybody in the country. Two, it is -- one of the worst things about the last two weeks of politics that has progressed over the last several years, last several cycles, is that we try to instigate people to go vote by. It used to be, when my dad was in office, we'd instigate people to go vote by saying what we were for. And we'd say Jesse may not be for that, but here's what I'm for. And it progresses -- as over time it has evolved into not only am I for the right things, but Jesse is not only for the bad things or the wrong things, but he's a terrible person. So, in politics what happens after you get elected, after the election is over, how do you justify working with someone if you think the person not only is wrong but they are a terrible human being.

Where does he go to get his amnesty? The last thing, Randi Weingarten of the teachers union, remember, she was the one out there advocating for the lockdowns. How do we know this? Well, it's because we have the emails directly from her and her team to the CDC. And the CDC say, oh, OK, yes, absolutely. Remember Rochelle Walensky said, I think schools should be open. All of a sudden, the White House said, actually though you're in front of a CDC sign right now. You are speaking in your personal capacity. Teachers, they were given the -- in Fairfax County, Virginia, given the first option for vaccines in order to bring back kids to school but they didn't do it. They're like -- they're like, oh, no, actually, we can't have kids in school. So, I don't think there's people who are going to be very forgiving. And there's another group that we forget about, and that is the recent retirees who lost two and a half years of their bucket list opportunities and it's not fair to them.

But early May, we knew exactly who was affected by this, who was dying from it. We knew that lockdowns didn't work from data in New York City. And we knew that kids could go back to school because they weren't at risk. May 2020 -- and yet, as of this year, I have a friend who wasn't who -- she had a doctor, she's pregnant, who called her and said, you are not going to be a fit for our practice. We are denying you care because you don't want to take the COVID vaccine, which we know was lied about not only by the government by -- but also by Pfizer, in terms of what they said that they did for testing, before everyone was forced to choose between their job and taking an experimental vaccine. You know, who can't forgive are the firefighters in New York City were willing to run into buildings and risk their lives during COVID, at the height of COVID, at the beginning when there was no vaccine, but then were fired from their job or let go because they refuse to take it. So, when you look at the long list of things whether it's the kids in school, whether it's denial of health care to people for whatever reason, for you know, really because of an ideology, the issue is about like you said the intention. And it's a matter of the control that they took. They weren't interested after May of 2020 in actually helping people with the pandemic. They held on forever and they're still doing it. And people's lives were ruined and they can't get it back. So, I think there's a lot of people who are deeply affected their lives were changed forever as a result of this who aren't willing to forgive and they have a really good reason not to."
