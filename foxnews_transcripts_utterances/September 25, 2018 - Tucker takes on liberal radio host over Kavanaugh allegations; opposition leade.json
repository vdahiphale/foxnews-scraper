      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" It's been more than a week since a California Psychology Professor named Christine Ford accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of committing some form of sexual assault against her back in 1982. They were both high school students at the time. Ford's claim has stopped Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in place. Washington has been consumed by the debate ever since. A number of Senate Republicans are said to be undecided on the question of Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence. They say they'd like to hear more from Christine Ford on Thursday when she's scheduled to testify in the Senate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Strikingly though, not a single Democrat remains undecided. Every one of them plans to vote against Kavanaugh. They've made up their minds. They don't need the evidence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now this wrinkle. Tonight, there are more allegations consistent in many ways with the allegations we have already heard. Leading Democrats are calling these new claims powerful, compelling, and highly credible. They're all but daring Republicans to question the new accusers. The victims, they say, must be believed. Here's a selection of the charges. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Mob accuses villager of witchcraft, villager denies it because witches always deny it. \"Prove you're not a witch,\" they scream. The witch can't, proving beyond a doubt that she is in fact a witch to the stake she goes. Chris Coons would understand this reasoning.

The rest of us assume the Constitution guarantees us the presumption of innocence when we're accused. Brett Kavanaugh no longer has that protection. It's up to him to clear his own name. He can either figure out how to prove that Christine Ford's foggy 36-year old memories are wrong or his daughters can grow up learning about how their dad is a sex offender.

Yes, he has submitted to half a dozen federal background checks already. But Democrats want another. That's the only way he can show he is innocent of these charges. Various dumb people on television agree with this. They nod their heads in unison. But would that really work? Is that the purpose of FBI investigations? Joe Biden doesn't think so. Keep in mind that Biden is both an attorney and the former Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

He's hardly an abrasive character as you learned if you watched his interview with Martha last night. There's nothing personal about any of this. Kavanaugh stands between the Democratic Party and the power it seeks. He is in the way. He must be crushed, in this case, along with his wife and his two little girls. Sorry. That's the cost of winning no omelets without some broken eggs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The problem is that outside party headquarters in D.C., people out there don't understand this. When they hear a U.S. Senator call Brett Kavanaugh a sex criminal, they believe it. Why wouldn't they believe it? Because that's the other thing that never changes, ever, human nature. There's a mob instinct in people, a gut-level desire to worship the powerful and hurt the unpopular. It's always there in every population, in every country from the beginning of time until now. Wise leaders know that.

They never stoke the mob instinct. Once unleashed, there is no controlling where a mob winds up or who it destroys. You can tell a mob is building by the way people start talking, like this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } JIMMY KIMMEL, 'JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!': I think there's a compromise here. And look hear me out on this. So, Kavanaugh gets confirmed to -- to the Supreme Court. OK. Well, in return we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone. Why should Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have to prove his innocence? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The search giant's employees plan to rig search results for the sake of promoting political groups and undermining the Administration's immigration policies. We brought that to you exclusively last week. Now, shortly after our story, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai sent out a staff-wide email. He said in part, \"We do not bias our products to favor any political agenda. The trust our users place in us is our greatest asset. If any Google user undermines that trust, we will hold them accountable.\" Google has already told us it won't punish any of the employees who planned to subvert Google's search. So, if they're lying to us about holding people accountable, and they are, why should we believe them when they claim they show no bias? Our investigation continues. Well the campaign to crush Brett Kavanaugh is consuming most of the energy of the Democratic Party right now. But it's going beyond just hearings and magazine pieces and cable news appearances. Now, according to some extremists, anyone who supports Kavanaugh is fair game for physical harassment. Just last night, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and his wife were targeted by a mob at a restaurant in Washington. Watch this.",

They were both high school students at the time. Ford's claim has stopped Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in place. Washington has been consumed by the debate ever since. A number of Senate Republicans are said to be undecided on the question of Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence. They say they'd like to hear more from Christine Ford on Thursday when she's scheduled to testify in the Senate. Strikingly though, not a single Democrat remains undecided. Every one of them plans to vote against Kavanaugh. They've made up their minds. They don't need the evidence. And now this wrinkle. Tonight, there are more allegations consistent in many ways with the allegations we have already heard. Leading Democrats are calling these new claims powerful, compelling, and highly credible. They're all but daring Republicans to question the new accusers. The victims, they say, must be believed. Here's a selection of the charges."

That was a time when liberals still cared about civil liberties and due process and the right to face your accuser. Miller wrote it as an allegory about the McCarthy hearings. McCarthy hearings were a period the Left deeply hated until they took power and recreated it themselves. Nowadays you wonder if progressives still read Miller's play. And if so, are they outraged by it? Maybe not. It might seem completely reasonable to them. Mob accuses villager of witchcraft, villager denies it because witches always deny it. \"Prove you're not a witch,\" they scream. The witch can't, proving beyond a doubt that she is in fact a witch to the stake she goes. Chris Coons would understand this reasoning.

The rest of us assume the Constitution guarantees us the presumption of innocence when we're accused. Brett Kavanaugh no longer has that protection. It's up to him to clear his own name. He can either figure out how to prove that Christine Ford's foggy 36-year old memories are wrong or his daughters can grow up learning about how their dad is a sex offender. That's his choice. So, what does he do next? How do you disprove an accuser who can't even tell you when or where you supposedly committed the crime? Well, the FBI, of course. Democrats are demanding that Kavanaugh call down yet another FBI investigation on himself. Yes, he has submitted to half a dozen federal background checks already. But Democrats want another. That's the only way he can show he is innocent of these charges. Various dumb people on television agree with this. They nod their heads in unison. But would that really work? Is that the purpose of FBI investigations? Joe Biden doesn't think so. Keep in mind that Biden is both an attorney and the former Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Watch this."

      "utterance": "OK. We fooled you again. That is Joe Biden from the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings. Biden was on the other side of the debate then so, naturally, he had completely different views from the ones he holds today. What hasn't changed are the inherent limits of an FBI investigation. Democrats know that, of course, but so what? Proving or disproving a recovered memory is not the point. The point is destroying Brett Kavanaugh. It's worth saying that most Democrats in Washington don't really hate Kavanaugh personally. He's hardly an abrasive character as you learned if you watched his interview with Martha last night. There's nothing personal about any of this. Kavanaugh stands between the Democratic Party and the power it seeks. He is in the way. He must be crushed, in this case, along with his wife and his two little girls. Sorry. That's the cost of winning no omelets without some broken eggs. The problem is that outside party headquarters in D.C., people out there don't understand this. When they hear a U.S. Senator call Brett Kavanaugh a sex criminal, they believe it. Why wouldn't they believe it? Because that's the other thing that never changes, ever, human nature. There's a mob instinct in people, a gut-level desire to worship the powerful and hurt the unpopular. It's always there in every population, in every country from the beginning of time until now. Wise leaders know that. Wise leaders fear that. They try to keep it contained. They never stoke the mob instinct. Once unleashed, there is no controlling where a mob winds up or who it destroys. You can tell a mob is building by the way people start talking, like this. JIMMY KIMMEL, 'JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!': I think there's a compromise here. And look hear me out on this. So, Kavanaugh gets confirmed to -- to the Supreme Court. OK. Well, in return we get to cut that pesky penis of his off in front of everyone.

And I can determine as an adult and a U.S. citizen whether I believe the evidence or not. And until they come for me I'm going to do that. But let me ask you this. Did she have a responsibility? She's claiming that this man sexually assaulted her and then altered the course of her life. She can't fly in airplanes. It's affected her relationship with men. He's a predator. She didn't tell anybody his name for 36 years during which time he got married, he interacted with many others in our population. Sex offenders tend to commit serial sex crimes. Doesn't she have an obligation to tell someone to stop him from doing that if he is in fact a sex criminal? Where's her obligation here?"

The search giant's employees plan to rig search results for the sake of promoting political groups and undermining the Administration's immigration policies. We brought that to you exclusively last week. Now, shortly after our story, the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai sent out a staff-wide email. He said in part, \"We do not bias our products to favor any political agenda. The trust our users place in us is our greatest asset. If any Google user undermines that trust, we will hold them accountable.\" Google has already told us it won't punish any of the employees who planned to subvert Google's search. So, if they're lying to us about holding people accountable, and they are, why should we believe them when they claim they show no bias? Our investigation continues. Well the campaign to crush Brett Kavanaugh is consuming most of the energy of the Democratic Party right now. But it's going beyond just hearings and magazine pieces and cable news appearances. Now, according to some extremists, anyone who supports Kavanaugh is fair game for physical harassment. Just last night, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and his wife were targeted by a mob at a restaurant in Washington. Watch this."

      "utterance": "I'm sorry to do this. But I sometimes get texts from viewers on the show. We just did a segment on Ted Cruz's wife being confronted in a restaurant by angry young progressives. And I just got this text. How come these kids who confront Ted Cruz never confront Ryan Zinke , which is a good question. I think we know. Well the fight over Brett Kavanaugh feels like something brand-new in American politics in some ways. The willingness to destroy him personally and to overthrow every norm of fairness and due process to do that seems like a sign of sickness, honestly, in our society, maybe one that's been building for a while. Victor Davis Hanson has been following it as a Senior Fellow at Hoover out in California. He just wrote a piece entitled We Are Living Nineteen Eighty-Four, and he joins us tonight. Professor, what do you mean We Are Living Nineteen Eighty-Four?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "Well I think what we're doing is systematically destroying 2,500 years of Western jurisprudence and three centuries of American law on the basis that well it's a Supreme Court, so it's special or it's not a criminal case, so these rules don't apply. And we forget that the Constitution is our secular Bible whether you're -- you're under examination little-league or a grammar school we get inspiration for every process in our country. Our daily lives are based on the -- the inherent right to meet your accusers, to cross-examine, not to bring into evidence hearsay, to have detailed evidence, to have statutes of limitations, so we're going to throw all that out because the means are necessary for this noble end of -- of stopping Brett Kavanaugh. And then, culturally think of it a minute, Tucker, so now, everything that we know about our literature and culture just is out the window. So, Euripides wrote a play about Hippolytus. Phaedra was always right because she must be believed when she made a false accusation -- accusation. Tom Robinson was guilty because somebody accused him of being rape in To Kill A Mockingbird. And whether that the Left likes it or not, they're making a Manichaean choice now. Millions of Americans are watching them and they're saying to themselves, whatever my views are on Donald Trump for, against, pro, or con, they're making this, they mean the Senate Democrats and this MeToo radical movement and the effort to destroy Kavanaugh, they're saying we're the issue and--"

      "utterance": "Well I'm shocked, you know, because I -- I can talk by my experience in Venezuela is socialism in Venezuela has meant expropriating thousand of companies and losing millions of jobs in the name of the poor people. But at the end, it has meant to abolish freedom, to abolish progress, to violate human rights, all in the name of socialism. So, for me, there is no reason why some people can back up and support this kind of ideas right now when the worlds need free trades, democracy, progress, and human rights?"

      "utterance": "On the contrary. Venezuela was one of the most richest countries in the world. It was a -- a land where the people went in the 20th Century looking for -- for progress. And now, we are in a real misery. 5 million people has left Venezuela, and in the name of socialism, a -- economy has been destroyed and there is no freedom in order to do whatever you want to do. And we have the -- probably the highest hyperinflation in the history of the world. We can -- we could end this year with 1 millionth percent of hyperinflation. And this is a direct consequence of the system to control price, expropriation, state trying to control everything in the economic sector, and it has been a real failure producing more and more poverty in Venezuela."

And in the case of Venezuela, we are beyond a dictatorship. Right now, we are like a failure at the state like a narco-state. And all over Venezuela there is no institutions but corruption at different groups trying to -- to get the money from the oil. And so, always that is the -- the end of any socialistic scheme to -- to any democracy in the world."

Because they have the power now. They're the establishment. That's the subject of my new book. It's called Ship of Fools. It's out next week. Tomorrow, after the show, we'll be doing a live book signing. It'll take place on our Facebook page @tuckercarlsonFOX, also link to it on the Tucker Carlson Tonight Facebook page. We're taking questions from viewers, signing books. You'll be able to pre- order them if you want. Mark Steyn will be there too because everything is better with Mark Steyn. You can order a -- an autographed copy right now in shipoffools.com, and you can submit your questions. Tomorrow night, Facebook @tuckercarlsonFOX. That's it for us -- shipoffoolsbook.com, they're telling me. Anyway that's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow and every night to fight pomposity, and smugness, and groupthink.
