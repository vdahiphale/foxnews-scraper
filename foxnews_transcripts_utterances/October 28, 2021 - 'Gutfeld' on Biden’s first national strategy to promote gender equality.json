And they enter your country and say, no, thanks. We'll keep going. Mexico must feel like everyone's first wife. It is rude. It's like asking the maitre d' of a restaurant directions to another restaurant. It's like - - It's like going up to the hostess at Applebee's and saying, excuse me, do you know a place nearby that offers mainstream American dishes served in a casual dining atmosphere that offers pasta, burgers and delicious Riblet appetizers and no, not you. That's Mexico. Everyone walking right on through like it's the hosiery department at Macy's. You always had to go through there to get to someplace good. It's more demoralizing than not getting a rose on the bachelor. Just ask Kat. But that's not the only problem. We don't just have inflation but apparently hyperinflation. I asked Larry Kudlow what hyperinflation was and he said, Greg, it's inflation but hyper. Then he punched me in the face because that's how he rolls.

Because that's the urgent problem and no, not just at home, but abroad. Yes, abroad. That's funny. A sexist would say, never mind the murder rate, the open border hyperinflation here at home, there's a hostess at the (INAUDIBLE) making three cents less than her male counterpart. Thankfully, we've already been telling the Taliban to hire more women. But apparently this is to remedy an unequal playing field, one that has been worsened by COVID, which is such B.S. the smell of it should be seeping out of your T.V. So you want to talk COVID inequality? The global death rate for men from COVID is about 50 percent higher than women. That statistic were reversed. There would be marches. And they'd be the kind of marches that the media would say don't spread COVID. But 50 percent, that means for every 10 women there were -- are 15 dead men who are men who croak. In America. 65,000 more men have died than women. I bet that's the first time you heard that. And probably the last. Because unlike me, gender equality only goes one way. If you're a woman who disagrees. Try registering for the draft. Never mind industrial accidents and fatalities, the ravages of war, the obvious lifespan gaps. Men often get the shorter stick in life, but we aren't complaining. Women however, need a national strategy to fix something that does not rate compared to the issues that both genders face right now under Joe. It's like a doctor giving a patient with diabetes, a treatment for his dandruff. But it's the same old stick as they ignore issues that affect all of us crime economy, education, flatulence on planes, cat. They chase the easy identity driven stuff, gender equity. Racial diversity. Stuff that helps no one but the diversity consultants. It's easy to do. And like Mayor Pete, you don't have to do any work. Telling the world, we're all sexist and bigots. It's free. It's the only plan the Democrats have that actually does cost nothing. Biden and Kamala Harris, you remember her. She's the crazy lady that cackles like a Halloween witch in a haunted house. So they both -- they both wrote a letter together. She held the pen, claiming that rates of gender-based violence have risen significantly. Really, is that so? Well, maybe it's so because all violence has risen significantly. So they only admit that the violence has gone up if they can cherry pick the victims. But gender based violence went up along with all kinds of violence. A rising tide of blood lifts all corpses. But at least we've heard from Kamala, she disappears more often than Jesse Watters when the dinner bill comes. Yes. He's cheap. Meanwhile, the turmoil we see crime, the overdoses, the mental illnesses, the sexual assault in Loudoun County. They pretend none of this exists, but fake problems they embrace. Why is that? Let's ask our angry white male.",

They've expanded the meaning of white supremacist so much that it even includes black moderates.

If that's medical misinformation, it's a lot catchier than the Fauci documentary. Now, to be fair, the song did make other more controversial claims that I don't agree with like saying the pandemic isn't real. That's false. Dr. Fauci funded its creation in a lab. But it's not like this would have been the only rap song on YouTube with claims that I don't agree with. And you probably agree, I mean, I certainly don't think all bitches are hoes. And just to be clear, vice versa. Vice versa, I learned that, Kat, in sexual harassment training. But how did YouTube do on its mission to make sure no one would hear those claims? Well, not only did Gray song hit number one on Monday, but another anti-Biden's song titled \"Let's Go Brandon\" by Luis Alexander was at number three. It's another example of the Streisand effect where censoring something has the unintended result of making people ask, who is Barbra Streisand? By Tuesday, Bryson's song was still at number one, and the other \"Let's Go Brandon\" had edged out Adele for the second spot in your face Cavuto. So, in other words, if YouTube wanted fewer people to hear the song would have been better off just funding an ad campaign for it instead. But in a perfect world, the whole top 10 would be filled with rap songs like this.",

Because that's the urgent problem and no, not just at home, but abroad. Yes, abroad. That's funny. A sexist would say, never mind the murder rate, the open border hyperinflation here at home, there's a hostess at the (INAUDIBLE) making three cents less than her male counterpart. Thankfully, we've already been telling the Taliban to hire more women. But apparently this is to remedy an unequal playing field, one that has been worsened by COVID, which is such B.S. the smell of it should be seeping out of your T.V. So you want to talk COVID inequality? The global death rate for men from COVID is about 50 percent higher than women. That statistic were reversed. There would be marches. And they'd be the kind of marches that the media would say don't spread COVID. But 50 percent, that means for every 10 women there were -- are 15 dead men who are men who croak. In America. 65,000 more men have died than women. I bet that's the first time you heard that. And probably the last. Because unlike me, gender equality only goes one way. If you're a woman who disagrees. Try registering for the draft. Never mind industrial accidents and fatalities, the ravages of war, the obvious lifespan gaps. Men often get the shorter stick in life, but we aren't complaining. Women however, need a national strategy to fix something that does not rate compared to the issues that both genders face right now under Joe. It's like a doctor giving a patient with diabetes, a treatment for his dandruff. But it's the same old stick as they ignore issues that affect all of us crime economy, education, flatulence on planes, cat. They chase the easy identity driven stuff, gender equity. Racial diversity. Stuff that helps no one but the diversity consultants. It's easy to do. And like Mayor Pete, you don't have to do any work. Telling the world, we're all sexist and bigots. It's free. It's the only plan the Democrats have that actually does cost nothing. Biden and Kamala Harris, you remember her. She's the crazy lady that cackles like a Halloween witch in a haunted house. So they both -- they both wrote a letter together. She held the pen, claiming that rates of gender-based violence have risen significantly. Really, is that so? Well, maybe it's so because all violence has risen significantly. So they only admit that the violence has gone up if they can cherry pick the victims. But gender based violence went up along with all kinds of violence. A rising tide of blood lifts all corpses. But at least we've heard from Kamala, she disappears more often than Jesse Watters when the dinner bill comes. Yes. He's cheap. Meanwhile, the turmoil we see crime, the overdoses, the mental illnesses, the sexual assault in Loudoun County. They pretend none of this exists, but fake problems they embrace. Why is that? Let's ask our angry white male."

They've expanded the meaning of white supremacist so much that it even includes black moderates.

What I think needs to happen though, is some of us have to come forward. I think it's time I came forward. I wrote the jokes. I'm sorry. It was me. I can't let Chappelle take all the heat anymore. I did it. So come get me. You know, they go after him so hard. And they push so hard that he was this, you know, he was transphobic. And he was attacking people. And they tried to compare it to other things. And I --for one was like, well, when do I get my turn to complain about Dave Chappelle? All the light-skinned brother jokes he's made over the years? I always tell him how handsome we are, how we get the jobs and the girls. Like it's unbelievably upsetting. So maybe we should go. The only times he said the N word on T.V. Why are we not getting him? Oh, because he's black. He gets a pass. No, sir. So let's just give me my platform so we can go after him. And another thing, which is really great and I wish, you know, when you talk about a group being or a group coming after you as the people who are saying that, you know, it's causing hate. I -- one of the things that I always enjoyed about when they had clan meetings, at the end of every clan meeting after they talked about getting rid of all the darkies from the neighborhood. Usually, it was more to kind -- come up with the end to discuss the scholarship funds that they set up for all the minority children so they can get a good education afterwards. Because that's literally what Dave Chappelle did to the gentlemen or -- to the woman, sorry, that passed away. He got a scholarship for her children -- for her children.

Looks like his history class has completely missed the Civil War. But I guess some people can't stand it when a successful black woman shares her opinion. And her opinion that it would be great if we didn't pit children against each other based on race. But Toray is an irrelevant (BLEEP), whose parodying crap he already heard months ago about Larry Elder. But you know, I'm starting to think that maybe segregation isn't a bad thing, but only if we separate the (BLEEP) of every color from the nice people of every color. I would be for that, that's how a colorblind society should be, nice people here, (BLEEP) over there.

Just days after Bryson Gray tweeted that his anti-Biden rap song \"Let's Go Brandon\" had been banned by YouTube for medical misinformation. It reached the number one spot on iTunes. Check it out. If that's medical misinformation, it's a lot catchier than the Fauci documentary. Now, to be fair, the song did make other more controversial claims that I don't agree with like saying the pandemic isn't real. That's false. Dr. Fauci funded its creation in a lab. But it's not like this would have been the only rap song on YouTube with claims that I don't agree with. And you probably agree, I mean, I certainly don't think all bitches are hoes. And just to be clear, vice versa. Vice versa, I learned that, Kat, in sexual harassment training. But how did YouTube do on its mission to make sure no one would hear those claims? Well, not only did Gray song hit number one on Monday, but another anti-Biden's song titled \"Let's Go Brandon\" by Luis Alexander was at number three. It's another example of the Streisand effect where censoring something has the unintended result of making people ask, who is Barbra Streisand? By Tuesday, Bryson's song was still at number one, and the other \"Let's Go Brandon\" had edged out Adele for the second spot in your face Cavuto. So, in other words, if YouTube wanted fewer people to hear the song would have been better off just funding an ad campaign for it instead. But in a perfect world, the whole top 10 would be filled with rap songs like this."
