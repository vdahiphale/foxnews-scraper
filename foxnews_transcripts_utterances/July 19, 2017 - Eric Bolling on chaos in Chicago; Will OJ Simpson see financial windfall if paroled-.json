If you pass nothing at all you're going to get hurt in 2018, another warning. What you really have -- the only choice forward and the most logical one and the most sensible one for the American people is passed the clean repeal now and then spend the next two years with a good replacement bill that encompasses the four things that conservatives have complained for eight years about state lines, being able to have competition across state lines, drug pricing, tort reform, and hospitals posting their prices online.

And get this, a war torn country of 32 million people, Afghanistan, has less violent deaths per 100,000, which is 5.19, than Chicago, America's third largest city of 2.72 million at a rate of 13.5. That's less than half of Afghanistan. What's happening? I'll tell what's happening. Liberal Democrats are happening. Mayor Rahm Emanuel is a complete failure. Rahm, was in over his head from the get-go. At the beginning of his term, Emanuel eliminated the mobile strike force and targeted response units over budget issues. As the violence started to spike, Rahm hired Eddie Johnson, basically a yes-man who defended all the foolish liberal policies Rahm could cook up. Rahm, Eddie, and the ACLU placed massive restrictions on how officers were allowed to made contact with suspects. When they do make a perfectly legal stop, officers are required to pump put mounds of bureaucratic paperwork. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to John -- and a gun issue expert, Chicago has a detective force that is undermanned and overextended, struggling against reluctant prosecutors and a notorious no-snitch code. The results have been deadly. In 1991, 67 percent of murderers were arrested. Under Rahm Emanuel, it hit a new low of 20 percent in 2016. Shocking, isn't it? Only one in five murders are cleared. Not much of a deterrent is it when you have an 80 percent of not getting caught? Chicago, ground zero for Chicago's tsunami of murder, armed robbery, and assault is not the West and South Sides of Chicago. No, ground zero sits right there in city hall. Wake up, Chicago. Empower law enforcement to enforce the law. Spend the money to break up the gangs and lock up the criminals. And for God's sake, get rid of the Rahm and Eddie show or continue this failed progressive experiment and watch the body counts continue to skyrocket.

That's important because originally it was that big bill that no one really liked, and then it was going to be just the clean repeal that Rand Paul and the others like. Look, if you pass the big bill that no one likes, Republicans, you're going to get hurt in 2018, period. I'm just -- fair warning right now. If you pass nothing at all you're going to get hurt in 2018, another warning. What you really have -- the only choice forward and the most logical one and the most sensible one for the American people is passed the clean repeal now and then spend the next two years with a good replacement bill that encompasses the four things that conservatives have complained for eight years about state lines, being able to have competition across state lines, drug pricing, tort reform, and hospitals posting their prices online. Get that done and you're winner in '18 and a winner in '20."

I think if they don't replace, if they do the clean repeal but they don't have anything in place, I think there's still might be damage in 2018 because I can see the ads rolling now from the Democrats. They're going to have grandma going off the cliff, they're going to have children dying, and saying this is what happens when the Republicans has do something. When they take something away and offer nothing in its place. That's going to certainly be the narratives that the Dems will run with in 2018, and I think it will be damaging."

She's a former anchor for One American News Network, she's one of the most provocative conservative commentators in the country, and she's the senior communications advisor for the Great America Alliance, the largest pro- Trump political action committee, but she specializes in melting snow flakes with her virial final thoughts commentary on Facebook, Tomi Lahren is here. And he's a conservative commentator, he's won 70 awards for journalism from the associated press, society of professional journalists, the national press club, and he's the host of the nationally syndicated Lars Larson Show, so he specializes in all things radio, Lars Larson is here. Lars, what do you think about how this health care thing been going? Not great. LARS LARSON, \"THE LARS LARSON SHOW\" HOST: No, listen, I've got to tell you, Kat. A lot of conservatives are starting to feel like Ann Coulter on a Delta flight. We got the ticket, we got the promise, and now all of a sudden flight attendants Paul Ryan and Lisa Murkowski are in the back saying get out of the seat. We're not going where you wanted to go anymore. And meanwhile, up front, you've got Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell and they don't know how to fly to the state of independence anymore, independence from government regulation and health care, so they're going to take it to rhino land instead. I want them to do something. And if it means, OK, we're going to clean repeal. Two years, you now have a hard deadline to come up with something to replace it. That's probably the best way to go if you can't get some sensible replacement right now. And it doesn't sound like they can."

And I think President Trump, by the way, is right to hold their feet to the fire and hold them accountable. He's got pen in hand, he's ready to go. He should not be in a position right now as the commander-in-chief, the first Republican in the oval in 8 years, and not have legislation that can move. That's ridiculous."

Right now, today, there are 38 counties in America with no insurers. They're going to be something like 30 percent of the country with one insurer by 2018.

Here's the fact, homicides are skyrocketing, 369 so far, just this year. And get this, a war torn country of 32 million people, Afghanistan, has less violent deaths per 100,000, which is 5.19, than Chicago, America's third largest city of 2.72 million at a rate of 13.5. That's less than half of Afghanistan. What's happening? I'll tell what's happening. Liberal Democrats are happening. Mayor Rahm Emanuel is a complete failure. Rahm, was in over his head from the get-go. At the beginning of his term, Emanuel eliminated the mobile strike force and targeted response units over budget issues. As the violence started to spike, Rahm hired Eddie Johnson, basically a yes-man who defended all the foolish liberal policies Rahm could cook up. Rahm, Eddie, and the ACLU placed massive restrictions on how officers were allowed to made contact with suspects. When they do make a perfectly legal stop, officers are required to pump put mounds of bureaucratic paperwork. According to John -- and a gun issue expert, Chicago has a detective force that is undermanned and overextended, struggling against reluctant prosecutors and a notorious no-snitch code. The results have been deadly. In 1991, 67 percent of murderers were arrested. Under Rahm Emanuel, it hit a new low of 20 percent in 2016. Shocking, isn't it? Only one in five murders are cleared. Not much of a deterrent is it when you have an 80 percent of not getting caught? Chicago, ground zero for Chicago's tsunami of murder, armed robbery, and assault is not the West and South Sides of Chicago. No, ground zero sits right there in city hall. Wake up, Chicago. Empower law enforcement to enforce the law. Spend the money to break up the gangs and lock up the criminals. And for God's sake, get rid of the Rahm and Eddie show or continue this failed progressive experiment and watch the body counts continue to skyrocket. Tomi, Chicago, I'm calling it a law enforcement handcuff environment. Handcuffed by liberals."

Simpson currently owes the family of Ron Goldman, who was murdered along with Simpson's wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, back in 1994, tens of millions of dollars that stem from a wrongful death lawsuit that Simpson lost back in '97. And you can bet that the Goldman family is going to try to collect every red cent, especially if Simpson starts making serious loot when he comes out. Now, Eric, I know that you, like many Americans in this country, feel like justice won't really be served if Simpson goes free, even if 70, but he might. And there's two things that could happen. He, as legend tells it, will be looking for the real killer. You know he's been saying that for years. But also, you know, I've heard it floated that he'll have a reality series.
