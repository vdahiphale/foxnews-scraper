      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. A few weeks ago, a driver for a charter bus company reached out to reporters at FOX 17 in Nashville. She had been told not to speak to the media, but she did it anyway. Why? Because what she was seeing every day on the job was so strange, without precedent in her 20-year career as a driver that she felt she had to tell the public about it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Starting this April, the bus driver said, government agents began instructing her to pick up busloads of migrant children -- foreign nationals from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras et cetera. The driver wasn't given any information beyond that, she was just told to take those children deep into the interior of the United States, away from the border and do it as quickly as possible, quote: \"There have been some drop-offs in Nashville, some in Knoxville, some in Chattanooga, a couple in Atlanta,\" the driver said. \"That's just as far as I go, then the children continue on further.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Another source familiar to what's going on told FOX 17 that some of these foreign nationals were taken as far away as New York and Chicago and Miami, but there's a problem. If you're trying to change the population of a country without the people who already live there finding out, it's tough to do it with buses, because when you pull a bus packed with illegal migrants from a foreign country without the proper ID, without the right to be in this country at all, people tend to notice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, the Biden administration came up with a different plan, quote: \"Now they're flying the kids because the buses were easier to videotape going down the highway.\" Ask yourself by the way since we've been talking a lot about democracy in this country, everything is a threat to democracy. If you change the population of a country without the consent of the people who live there, is that democracy? Doesn't that country belong to the people who live there? It's their country. That's what democracy is. But what if a small number of hardened ideologues decided to take it away from those people and give it to foreign nationals? That would not be democracy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, some of the footage of buses hauling illegal migrants was shot by the Center for Immigration Studies back in March and we have a clip. Here it is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } TODD BENSMAN, SENIOR SECURITY FELLOW (voice over): What's happening most of the time is that they are boarding buses and heading into America's heartland. A conveyor belt of commercial and charter buses just like this one in Del Rio, Texas are carrying tens of thousands, a sight unseen from Texas, Arizona, and California borderlands northward and they are dropping their Haitian, Venezuelan Cuban, and Central American family units in Florida and New Jersey, Tennessee, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and to large cities in Texas such as Dallas and Houston. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You're changing the population of America without the consent of Americans, you're doing it secretly on a huge scale and no one is noticing? Six months after Inauguration Day, the borders are more open than ever. It tells you everything you need to know about how the Biden administration approaches immigration. They are not going to stop the flow of illegal migrants across our southern border, no. Instead, they give those migrants free transportation to anywhere in the United States they choose and when you notice that they're doing it, they don't stop. They just find a different way to do it, a new method of transportation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How is this not an invasion? That's exactly what it is, and it's being abetted by the Biden administration. Here are the numbers. In May of last year, a total of 24,000 people were encountered by authorities at the southwestern land border. In May of this year, that number had risen to 180,000. A hundred and eighty thousand people. That's the equivalent of the entire City of Chattanooga, Tennessee showing up at the southern border every single month. And we're not cherry picking data, by the way, that's true every month. Last April for example, 17,000 people showed up at the southern border. This April, the number was 178, 000. It's that kind of increase, dramatic to the point that your eyes pop open every month of this year since Joe Biden became President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In all, the number of illegal immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border this fiscal year is already at its highest level since 2006 with four months still uncounted. Here is what it actually looks like at the Rio Grande. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice over): In less than an hour, the smugglers have brought a group of at least 60 migrants into the United States just in this spot alone, many of them women and children. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Border Patrol buses can't get down to the river's edge, so agents have to lead the migrants up a hill to a processing area. That is where they're joined by other migrants who have also illegally crossed on rafts in the area. It is big business for the human smugglers who continue to benefit the most from the ongoing border crisis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "So, that report makes an important point. A lot of people coming over, just economic migrants who are moving from very poor countries to the largest welfare state in the world, which is our country, and why wouldn't they do that? You'd probably do the same if you could. We shouldn't allow them, but you can't blame them for wanting to. But not all of them are good people with obvious human motives like that, some of them are very bad people. Some of them have preexisting criminal records. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to Customs and Border Protection, immigration authorities have arrested 760 illegal migrants since October just in the Laredo section of the Texas border. Last year during the same period, they arrested only 60 people, so that's a 900 percent increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained with criminal backgrounds. By the way, that's not all who came here. Those are just the ones that we detained. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We should tell you that includes sex offenders and gang members, not just drunk drivers, and it includes a lot of drug traffickers. Mexico is in the middle of a drug war right now, a real one. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, just in the last year, fentanyl seizures at the southern border have surged more than 800 percent and that's just in Texas. Keep in mind, fentanyl is extremely difficult to detect. It doesn't take much, it's odorless and colorless. It is very easy to smuggle fentanyl, that's why they do it. Seen the OD rates in the United States? They're off the charts. Those deaths are being fed by the drug trade coming across our southern border. It is killing Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So this is a disaster and the numbers prove it, but according to Kamala Harris, it's progress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

There's only one man who can. His name is Greg Abbott. He is the Governor of Texas. The Governor of Texas could send the National Guard to the border and seal it, it's his border, too. There are 19,000 soldiers in the Texas National Guard. As of tonight, we believe, Greg Abbott has deployed a mere 500 of them to the border. Why is that? Why not seal the border between Texas and Mexico? California is not going to do it, Arizona may or may not. Texas could tomorrow. Why aren't they?

And when they were done with their shift, we asked them, hey, is it going to be the same time tomorrow and the coyote said, yes.

It's no big deal, stop whining. But it is a big deal. It is completely wrong, not to mention illegal, and this is hardly the first time the so-called Intelligence Community has done something like this. They've done an awful lot of it. Look it up. If we let them continue to do it, it's the end of democracy. Democracy can't function with semi-independent highly politicized Intel Agencies. It's really dangerous.

He is the highly political left-wing four-star general who runs the N.S.A. The receptionist refused to put us through. We're American citizens though, so we kept trying because it's our right. This afternoon we got his direct line and we tried again. Nakasone's assistant seemed shocked that someone whose e-mail, the N.S.A. is reading would dare to call the Director himself. Shut up, serf. Obey. So they told us Nakasone just wasn't there. Then just minutes before air tonight, the N.S.A. sent us an infuriatingly dishonest formal statement, an entire paragraph of lies written purely for the benefit of the Intel Communities lackeys at CNN and MSNBC, all those people they hire with the titles on the screen. They also tweeted out a few minutes ago. Now, last night on the show, we made a very straightforward claim, N.S.A. has read my private e-mails without my permission. Period. That's what we said. Tonight's statement from the N.S.A. does not deny that, instead it comes with this non-sequitur in part quote, \"Tucker Carlson has never been an intelligence target of the agency.\" Okay, glad to know. But the question remains, did the Biden administration read my personal e- mails? That's the question that we asked directly to N.S.A. officials when we spoke to them about 20 minutes ago in a very heated conversation. Did you read my e-mails? And again, they refused to say, again and again, and then they refused even to explain why they couldn't answer that simple question.

We can read your personal text, we can read your personal e-mails, we can send veiled threats your way to brush you back if we don't like your politics. We can do anything. We're our own country and there's literally nothing you can do about it. We're in charge, you're not. Orwellian does not begin to describe the experience. It was like living in China, but we should get used to it. Now that the Biden administration has classified tens of millions of patriotic Americans, the kind who served in the military and fly flags in front of their homes as potential domestic terrorists, white supremacist saboteurs, we're going to see a whole lot more of this kind of thing, a whole lot more. Harmeet Dhillon is a Civil Rights attorney. We're happy to have her on the show tonight. She has dealt with a lot of this stuff. In a text exchange we had a couple of hours ago, I expressed my frustration, you said quote: \"I'm not surprised at all.\" It seems to me we should be shocked by this. We have a right to be as American citizens, why can't we find out? It hardly just applies to me. Why can't any American find out if some bureaucrat in a spy agency is reading your private e-mail?

So, I suspect if you're able because you are a person with a lot of connections and this is a good platform, if you are able to find out more information about this, I think what you're going to find is that you are being described as incidental, so the gathering of your information is going to be because they are really focusing on somebody else. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But I want to really break that down. When you look at the Carter Page violations for example, the lies to the FISA Court, does anybody think that the national security apparatus was trying to find out Carter Page's activities and communications? No. The trick is, if they can get a surveillance order on an individual, what they're able to do is scoop up all of the communications of all of the people who reach out to that person, text them even you know without any predicate. And so that's really where it's at, and so that's a huge dragnet and when Americans have become scandalized or Members of Congress are asking questions about this, there have been some reining in of these things, but now the current law is that the phone companies gather this data and they have to store it. But the N.S.A. can go over and ask for it and go shopping in a treasure trove of billions of pieces of data anytime they want and in fact dating back to 2018 that N.S.A. has looked at or had access to over half a billion records of American communication. So, you're one of them, but frankly any important person, any enemy of the state should expect that there's some way that the N.S.A. can get a hold of somebody near you, get an order or a right to ask questions, and all of a sudden they have all the information and a bunch of unelected faceless bureaucrats are going shopping in your data and then, you know talking to the guy next door in the cubicle next door passing it around the office, and then making plans of what to do.",

BRET WEINSTEIN, \"DARKHORSE\" PODCAST HOST: It is confusing, but I think to understand it, the thing to do is to consider the question of what would be ideal from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry at the moment? It would be ideal if vaccines were recommended for all people irrespective of their age, irrespective of whether they had already had COVID-19, and irrespective of whether or not they were pregnant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it would be essential that there were no safe and effective alternatives to the vaccine because if there were safe and effective alternatives, the Emergency Use Authorizations that allow the administration of the vaccines would evaporate.

The individual is never culpable for committing a crime. He is a victim. He is a victim of larger social economic cultural forces whose task is to equalize the playing field, that's what progressivism says. Notice that in all these cases you cite, the one thing that they're especially sensitive is property crimes. Remember Mayor Rawlings said, we gave space for people to burn and the Mayor of Minneapolis said, ah, just brick and mortar, and our DA in San Francisco said, yes, I think if you commit $950.00 of crime, who cares and you know Hannah Jones, the architect of the 1619 Project said, you know, looting is not a crime. And what they mean by that is that it's sort of a social redistribution and it's going to continue because these people are victims and if you're going to make a beautiful omelet, it doesn't really matter if a few eggs are broken. That's just collateral damage. A shooting there, an accidental shooting there, a deliberate one, it's okay because we're engaged in a bigger reset. The only reason that we're having this discussion now, Tucker, is they're worried about the optics and there's one too many swing voters in the suburbs who voted for Joe Biden who is worried, one too many professional basketball players who was robbed one, too many people in the inner cities are shot and telling their black caucus members, hey, wait a minute and they don't know what to do with it because as I said, they are prisoners of their own party. And so now, they're lashing out with these ridiculous thesis, sort of like the border or the racial divisions they've ginned up. It's this cosmic agenda and they don't care about the individuals who suffer. They are just little people and they're exempt. They're never going to be hurt by the crime wave.

My Twitter friends. Cuomo was talking about himself, as always, when a fellow Twitter user essentially told him to be quiet, \"You're going to break your arm,\" he said if you keep committing the crime for which God smote down Onan, though he put it more colloquially than that, we won't repeat it. How did Chris Cuomo respond to this? He didn't seem embarrassed, you would have been, he wasn't. Instead he sent a picture of that very arm. \"That how this happened,\" Cuomo wrote, \"Come on, baby, don't hate facilitate.\" Facilitate? What does that mean? We're not sure, but it sounds like a pickup line. We do that when Chris Cuomo asks you to facilitate him online, it's time to turn off the iPad and get back to dinner with the family.

She had been told not to speak to the media, but she did it anyway. Why? Because what she was seeing every day on the job was so strange, without precedent in her 20-year career as a driver that she felt she had to tell the public about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Starting this April, the bus driver said, government agents began instructing her to pick up busloads of migrant children -- foreign nationals from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras et cetera. The driver wasn't given any information beyond that, she was just told to take those children deep into the interior of the United States, away from the border and do it as quickly as possible, quote",
      "utterance": "\"There have been some drop-offs in Nashville, some in Knoxville, some in Chattanooga, a couple in Atlanta,\" the driver said. \"That's just as far as I go, then the children continue on further.\" Another source familiar to what's going on told FOX 17 that some of these foreign nationals were taken as far away as New York and Chicago and Miami, but there's a problem. If you're trying to change the population of a country without the people who already live there finding out, it's tough to do it with buses, because when you pull a bus packed with illegal migrants from a foreign country without the proper ID, without the right to be in this country at all, people tend to notice."

      "speaker": "So, the Biden administration came up with a different plan, quote",
      "utterance": "\"Now they're flying the kids because the buses were easier to videotape going down the highway.\" Ask yourself by the way since we've been talking a lot about democracy in this country, everything is a threat to democracy. If you change the population of a country without the consent of the people who live there, is that democracy? Doesn't that country belong to the people who live there? It's their country. That's what democracy is. But what if a small number of hardened ideologues decided to take it away from those people and give it to foreign nationals? That would not be democracy. By the way, some of the footage of buses hauling illegal migrants was shot by the Center for Immigration Studies back in March and we have a clip. Here it is."

      "utterance": "How is this not the biggest story in the country? You're changing the population of America without the consent of Americans, you're doing it secretly on a huge scale and no one is noticing? Six months after Inauguration Day, the borders are more open than ever. It tells you everything you need to know about how the Biden administration approaches immigration. They are not going to stop the flow of illegal migrants across our southern border, no. Instead, they give those migrants free transportation to anywhere in the United States they choose and when you notice that they're doing it, they don't stop. They just find a different way to do it, a new method of transportation. How is this not an invasion? That's exactly what it is, and it's being abetted by the Biden administration. Here are the numbers. In May of last year, a total of 24,000 people were encountered by authorities at the southwestern land border. In May of this year, that number had risen to 180,000. A hundred and eighty thousand people. That's the equivalent of the entire City of Chattanooga, Tennessee showing up at the southern border every single month. And we're not cherry picking data, by the way, that's true every month. Last April for example, 17,000 people showed up at the southern border. This April, the number was 178, 000. It's that kind of increase, dramatic to the point that your eyes pop open every month of this year since Joe Biden became President. In all, the number of illegal immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border this fiscal year is already at its highest level since 2006 with four months still uncounted. Here is what it actually looks like at the Rio Grande."

      "utterance": "In less than an hour, the smugglers have brought a group of at least 60 migrants into the United States just in this spot alone, many of them women and children. Border Patrol buses can't get down to the river's edge, so agents have to lead the migrants up a hill to a processing area. That is where they're joined by other migrants who have also illegally crossed on rafts in the area. It is big business for the human smugglers who continue to benefit the most from the ongoing border crisis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, that report makes an important point. A lot of people coming over, just economic migrants who are moving from very poor countries to the largest welfare state in the world, which is our country, and why wouldn't they do that? You'd probably do the same if you could. We shouldn't allow them, but you can't blame them for wanting to. But not all of them are good people with obvious human motives like that, some of them are very bad people. Some of them have preexisting criminal records. According to Customs and Border Protection, immigration authorities have arrested 760 illegal migrants since October just in the Laredo section of the Texas border. Last year during the same period, they arrested only 60 people, so that's a 900 percent increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained with criminal backgrounds. By the way, that's not all who came here. Those are just the ones that we detained. We should tell you that includes sex offenders and gang members, not just drunk drivers, and it includes a lot of drug traffickers. Mexico is in the middle of a drug war right now, a real one. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, just in the last year, fentanyl seizures at the southern border have surged more than 800 percent and that's just in Texas. Keep in mind, fentanyl is extremely difficult to detect. It doesn't take much, it's odorless and colorless. It is very easy to smuggle fentanyl, that's why they do it. Seen the OD rates in the United States? They're off the charts. Those deaths are being fed by the drug trade coming across our southern border. It is killing Americans. So this is a disaster and the numbers prove it, but according to Kamala Harris, it's progress."

      "utterance": "Extreme progress as the numbers rise and as the Biden administration without your permission or knowledge, but at your expense moves some unknown thousands of people into the interior of the United States where they begin new lives, again on Federal programs. Not a slam on them, but it's an attack and one we should all join in on the people making it possible. The question is, what can you do about it? The administration IS out of control. There is no oversight at all from the Congress, certainly not from the media. The stakes couldn't be higher. At this point, there's only one way to stop it. There's only one man who can. His name is Greg Abbott. He is the Governor of Texas. The Governor of Texas could send the National Guard to the border and seal it, it's his border, too. There are 19,000 soldiers in the Texas National Guard. As of tonight, we believe, Greg Abbott has deployed a mere 500 of them to the border. Why is that? Why not seal the border between Texas and Mexico? California is not going to do it, Arizona may or may not. Texas could tomorrow. Why aren't they? We wanted to ask Greg Abbott that question, but he refused to come on. One senior official in the State of Texas has agreed to address that question and we're going to talk to him in just a minute. We want to begin tonight with someone who is down there, firsthand seeing what's happening, one of the few reporters who has covered our open borders and that's Julio Rosas. Last night, he was in Roma, Texas. While he was speaking, a coyote showed up bringing migrants across the river in a raft. Here is what it looked like."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSAS",
      "utterance": "Well, basically, Tucker, I mean what I've told you back in March and you know, I'm saying it now and I'll probably say it again in a few months and the fact is that the crisis is continuing down here and you know, it's very unfortunate that the Vice President not only went to El Paso, which granted, it has seen its fair share of the crisis, but the Rio Grande Valley is really the epicenter for everything because it is a lot easier to cross into the United States in this area than as opposed to the El Paso sector. And so you know, last night, we actually came upon that scene while they were midway through the people that they were ferrying across, and so you know, Border Patrol was further up inland already and inundated with all the people that had already crossed before we got to Roma and they continued to cross over for about another hour and a half. And when they were done with their shift, we asked them, hey, is it going to be the same time tomorrow and the coyote said, yes. And so this is happening every day and it affects the Americans that live here along the border, but as you pointed out earlier in your show, there are other things like the increase in drugs that are flowing across that affects Americans further up north. And so you know, the only good thing with Harris's trip really was to bring back attention to the border because it did kind of, you know, go out of the news cycle. But this is happening every single day."

      "speaker": "ROSAS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, what I can say is, you know I've spent a lot of time with the Texas Highway Patrol. They are part of Operation Lone Star. They have helped augment the Border Patrol here along with the National Guard, but no, they definitely need more resources and that's why Governor Abbott asked for additional support from other states because I mean, this is a very large section and just again, there's just a lot of people coming across. And what's not really being talked about is that the border towns in Mexico at the same time when this is happening we're seeing an increase in violence over there. I mean, it just appears the cartels are really getting stronger, really getting emboldened to carry out just mindless acts of violence over there. And so you know, we've been advised not going to Reynosa, which is across McAllen, you know Rio Bravo is also getting inundated with attacks as well, so I mean it should -- you know, open borders that we've seen today, it's just not good for anybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "No, it's not good for anybody. That's exactly right. Julio Rosas, appreciate it. Thank you. Well, when several hundred mostly senior citizens got really frustrated with the election results in January and broke the law and walked through the U.S. Capitol building, Members of Congress were so afraid -- Sandy Cortez is still in therapy, she says -- that they built a wall immediately around their workplace, around the Capitol. Then they brought in the Army to protect them. Meanwhile, our country has no southern border, effectively. You just saw that, and no one is doing anything. That's totally fine. Too bad that Congress is not in McAllen. The question tonight though is why isn't the State of Texas stopping this? It's their border, too. They have a National Guard. They could shut this down. Why aren't they doing that? Sid Miller is the Agricultural Commissioner of the State of Texas and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Miller thanks so much for coming on. Now, I know, you know these problems are famously complicated, but this one is maybe not that complicated. How about shut down the border? Why doesn't Texas do that?"

He has been in office seven years, I'm hoping it's not political theater because we've got the basic questions that aren't even -- he has, you know -- he hasn't given us his plan. We need to know, where does the wall need to be built? How much of it needs to be built? What's it going to cost? And how do we pay for it? You know those are four basic questions that haven't been answered. I'm glad he's doing something, but we're not doing near enough. The problem I have, Tucker, is the timeline. When we knew on November 4th or 5th, you know pick a day, or January the 6th, when the legal avenues were closed or even on you know, January 20th, when Biden was sworn in, we knew that there was going to be open borders and the welcome mat was going to be out."

Once the surge is here, it's too late, you know.

On Sunday, we heard from a whistleblower within the U.S. government, someone with direct knowledge who warned us that the N.S.A. was reading our electronic communications, our e- mails and texts and was planning to leak them selectively in an effort to hurt us. This person had details from my e-mails that no one outside the recipient could have known, so it was not a delusion, it was entirely real. In fact it was confirmed. After the show last night, after we announced this, other news organizations acted as if it's totally normal for heavily politicized Intel Agencies to spy on and threaten journalists they disagree with. It's no big deal, stop whining. But it is a big deal. It is completely wrong, not to mention illegal, and this is hardly the first time the so-called Intelligence Community has done something like this. They've done an awful lot of it. Look it up. If we let them continue to do it, it's the end of democracy. Democracy can't function with semi-independent highly politicized Intel Agencies. It's really dangerous. For its part, the Biden administration just ignored the story. They did not deny the story, they can't, they know that it's true. Today, the President's flak was asked about it on Air Force One. Here is the exchange."

      "utterance": "It's like she is reading a Wikipedia entry. Ask them. But here's what to notice, no denial. Of course, she is right that the N.S.A. is chartered to spy on foreigners, not on Americans. That's illegal, and yet the N.S.A. does routinely spy on Americans -- it won't call it spying, that's exactly what it is -- millions of Americans, and sometimes it does it for political reasons and everyone knows this. Everyone including sitting members of the Intel Committee, some of them are paranoid about their own communications. That's true. In Washington, this is just considered fine, but it's not fine. It is dangerous and it is wrong. Some faceless hack in a powerful government spy agency decides he doesn't like what you think, so he is going to hurt you and there's nothing you can do about it. That could happen to you. And when it does happen trust us, NBC News will call you a delusional QAnon conspiracy theorist for complaining about it. Well, this morning, we decided to just call Paul Nakasone directly. He is the highly political left-wing four-star general who runs the N.S.A. The receptionist refused to put us through. We're American citizens though, so we kept trying because it's our right. This afternoon we got his direct line and we tried again. Nakasone's assistant seemed shocked that someone whose e-mail, the N.S.A. is reading would dare to call the Director himself. Shut up, serf. Obey. So they told us Nakasone just wasn't there. Then just minutes before air tonight, the N.S.A. sent us an infuriatingly dishonest formal statement, an entire paragraph of lies written purely for the benefit of the Intel Communities lackeys at CNN and MSNBC, all those people they hire with the titles on the screen. They also tweeted out a few minutes ago. Now, last night on the show, we made a very straightforward claim, N.S.A. has read my private e-mails without my permission. Period. That's what we said. Tonight's statement from the N.S.A. does not deny that, instead it comes with this non-sequitur in part quote, \"Tucker Carlson has never been an intelligence target of the agency.\" Okay, glad to know. But the question remains, did the Biden administration read my personal e- mails? That's the question that we asked directly to N.S.A. officials when we spoke to them about 20 minutes ago in a very heated conversation. Did you read my e-mails? And again, they refused to say, again and again, and then they refused even to explain why they couldn't answer that simple question. We can't tell you and we won't tell you why we can't tell you. My e-mails and the message was clear, we can do whatever we want. We can read your personal text, we can read your personal e-mails, we can send veiled threats your way to brush you back if we don't like your politics. We can do anything. We're our own country and there's literally nothing you can do about it. We're in charge, you're not. Orwellian does not begin to describe the experience. It was like living in China, but we should get used to it. Now that the Biden administration has classified tens of millions of patriotic Americans, the kind who served in the military and fly flags in front of their homes as potential domestic terrorists, white supremacist saboteurs, we're going to see a whole lot more of this kind of thing, a whole lot more."

      "utterance": "But our government regularly flouts that. I mean, you know we have the example of James Clapper lying to Congress about spying on American citizens and gathering millions of pieces of data, phone call records, and all of that, and so when you ask why, well, of course it's about this military industrial complex, the security industrial complex, and they justify the spying on Americans in the name of we're really focusing on foreigners and the American data that we scoop up, they call that incidental. So, I suspect if you're able because you are a person with a lot of connections and this is a good platform, if you are able to find out more information about this, I think what you're going to find is that you are being described as incidental, so the gathering of your information is going to be because they are really focusing on somebody else. But I want to really break that down. When you look at the Carter Page violations for example, the lies to the FISA Court, does anybody think that the national security apparatus was trying to find out Carter Page's activities and communications? No. The trick is, if they can get a surveillance order on an individual, what they're able to do is scoop up all of the communications of all of the people who reach out to that person, text them even you know without any predicate. And so that's really where it's at, and so that's a huge dragnet and when Americans have become scandalized or Members of Congress are asking questions about this, there have been some reining in of these things, but now the current law is that the phone companies gather this data and they have to store it. But the N.S.A. can go over and ask for it and go shopping in a treasure trove of billions of pieces of data anytime they want and in fact dating back to 2018 that N.S.A. has looked at or had access to over half a billion records of American communication. So, you're one of them, but frankly any important person, any enemy of the state should expect that there's some way that the N.S.A. can get a hold of somebody near you, get an order or a right to ask questions, and all of a sudden they have all the information and a bunch of unelected faceless bureaucrats are going shopping in your data and then, you know talking to the guy next door in the cubicle next door passing it around the office, and then making plans of what to do."

The current case pending in the Ninth Circuit is called Jewel Versus National Security Agency and for the last 13 years that case has bounced back and forth up and down to the court. So, if you can prove that you're being spied on, which is what all of the, you know glitterati there in D.C. are mocking you for saying, you know then the government says well, because this is a national security issue, we can't reveal any information. We're not going to give you any information in response to subpoenas. But you usually don't get that far. They just say you can't prove it.

The N.S.A. doesn't like giving information to the F.B.I. in recent years because the F.B.I. has been blatantly abusing the information that the N.S.A. gives it.

He is an evolutionary biologist who in a former life was a Professor at Evergreen College who came on here at the time, maybe four years ago. Now, he hosts a very popular podcast called \"The Darkhorse Podcast.\" On June 5th, Weinstein discussed the benefits of a drug called ivermectin, which can and is around the world used to treat and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. It's not some crackpot fish tank cleaner. It's a real drug, and physicians prescribe it. Well this afternoon, YouTube confirmed to this show that it has blocked Brett Weinstein's channel from generating any ad revenue, which is how he makes a living in part since he left Evergreen. YouTube said quote, \"We have demonetized Bret Weinstein's channel and affiliated channels and suspended them from the YouTube Partner Program.\" YouTube added that they will not allow any channel to discuss quote, \"Claims that ivermectin is effective in treatment or prevention of COVID.\" Bret Weinstein joins us tonight. Bret, thanks so much for coming on, so tell us -- I mean, I think those are the bare bones of the story. Tell us what you think this means and why Google would be opposed to talking about ivermectin? It's confusing in some ways. BRET WEINSTEIN, \"DARKHORSE\" PODCAST HOST: It is confusing, but I think to understand it, the thing to do is to consider the question of what would be ideal from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry at the moment? It would be ideal if vaccines were recommended for all people irrespective of their age, irrespective of whether they had already had COVID-19, and irrespective of whether or not they were pregnant. And it would be essential that there were no safe and effective alternatives to the vaccine because if there were safe and effective alternatives, the Emergency Use Authorizations that allow the administration of the vaccines would evaporate. So, I think ultimately that is at the root and what we see is that all of those things that I've called ideal and essential are in fact the position, the official position of the C.D.C., which the tech sector has encoded as their censorship policy on the social media platforms."

At the moment, it is not acknowledged that we have drugs that work on COVID-19, and so they're not being administered and that is a medical abomination. The fact is, even if the skeptics were right -- and they are not -- the evidence is strong that ivermectin works both as a prophylactic and as a treatment if given early, but even if the skeptics were right and the data was inconclusive, because ivermectin is a safe drug, you would still administer it to people who showed up with COVID rather than sending them home until they're so sick that they need to be rescued by a hospital."

In fact, police departments by and large are not funded by the Federal government, they're funded by you. It's your local cops. Your tax dollars pay for them. So, it's City Councils in city after city, nine out of the 10 biggest controlled by Democrats that have defunded police in the last year. That's just true. You did it. Why not just say we're for it or it was a mistake, instead they are telling us, unless Republicans vote for a $2 trillion Federal spending bill that has really nothing to do with crime, whatsoever then they are responsible for defunding the police and crime rates shooting up.

The individual is never culpable for committing a crime. He is a victim. He is a victim of larger social economic cultural forces whose task is to equalize the playing field, that's what progressivism says. Notice that in all these cases you cite, the one thing that they're especially sensitive is property crimes. Remember Mayor Rawlings said, we gave space for people to burn and the Mayor of Minneapolis said, ah, just brick and mortar, and our DA in San Francisco said, yes, I think if you commit $950.00 of crime, who cares and you know Hannah Jones, the architect of the 1619 Project said, you know, looting is not a crime. And what they mean by that is that it's sort of a social redistribution and it's going to continue because these people are victims and if you're going to make a beautiful omelet, it doesn't really matter if a few eggs are broken. That's just collateral damage. A shooting there, an accidental shooting there, a deliberate one, it's okay because we're engaged in a bigger reset. The only reason that we're having this discussion now, Tucker, is they're worried about the optics and there's one too many swing voters in the suburbs who voted for Joe Biden who is worried, one too many professional basketball players who was robbed one, too many people in the inner cities are shot and telling their black caucus members, hey, wait a minute and they don't know what to do with it because as I said, they are prisoners of their own party. And so now, they're lashing out with these ridiculous thesis, sort of like the border or the racial divisions they've ginned up. It's this cosmic agenda and they don't care about the individuals who suffer. They are just little people and they're exempt. They're never going to be hurt by the crime wave.

CNN's chief bodybuilding correspondent, Chris Cuomo spent his Sunday as he does most weekends hanging with strangers on social media, exchanging non-sequiturs with the vast disproportionately mentally ill digital throngs online, a group that for Chris Cuomo and so many others in journalism fills the void where actual loved ones should be. My Twitter friends. Cuomo was talking about himself, as always, when a fellow Twitter user essentially told him to be quiet, \"You're going to break your arm,\" he said if you keep committing the crime for which God smote down Onan, though he put it more colloquially than that, we won't repeat it. How did Chris Cuomo respond to this? He didn't seem embarrassed, you would have been, he wasn't. Instead he sent a picture of that very arm. \"That how this happened,\" Cuomo wrote, \"Come on, baby, don't hate facilitate.\" Facilitate? What does that mean? We're not sure, but it sounds like a pickup line. We do that when Chris Cuomo asks you to facilitate him online, it's time to turn off the iPad and get back to dinner with the family. Nothing good can happen next. We hope his Twitter pals did just that. That's it for us tonight. Amazing interview with the Chinese virologist who told us corona came from the lab, \"Tucker Carlson Today\" tomorrow. We'll see you then. Sean Hannity right now.
