In a scene that had everybody scratching their heads. The state's attorney, throughout the findings of their own law enforcement and a grand jury. Just suddenly dropped all the charges against him. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. Jussie Smollett, to the shock of the Chicago police, cleared all -- of all 16 counts against him. You remember, just weeks ago, the Chicago police said that the actor had made up the whole hate crime allegedly to advance his career."

Legal experts across the country, say it is highly unusual for a state's attorney to completely back down from a strong case without uncovering new evidence or new witness testimony. Yet the assistant state's attorney Joseph Magats, who dropped the charges made it sound like this stuff happens every day. Saying, Jussie Smollett was treated like any other defendant who has no felony criminal background and was not involved in a violent crime. Yet, the very same assistant state's attorney says this should not be interpreted as Smollett being innocent. And he says the prosecutor's office stands behind the Chicago police investigation. A bold statement considering Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and the lead investigator, both say the case was rock solid. But today, Jussie Smollett wasn't about to take responsibility.

Turns out, weeks ago, a former aide to Michelle Obama called Foxx saying, Jussie Smollett's family wanted her help in getting the investigation turned over to the FBI. Fox responded quoting here, \"Spoke to Superintendent Johnson. I convinced him to reach out to the FBI to ask that they take over the investigation. Foxx, then sent nearly the same message to a Smollett family member who responded, \"Oh my God, this would be a huge victory.\" The case was never turned over, but the Chicago Police Union is now renewing calls for a federal investigation into Foxx's interference and what they call suspicious conduct from the beginning.

It says, \"After reviewing all the facts and circumstances of this case, including Mr. Smollett's volunteer service in the community an agreement to forfeit his bond to the city of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case,\" she says. So, essentially, it looks like it's not an exoneration note. But it says because he's done -- you know, some nice community service, good things for the city, and because the $10,000 bond is going to be given back to the city of Chicago, there -- they're just going to call it a done deal."

The good thing about all this is that the national media gets a really clear window into how the criminal justice system works, or I should say, doesn't work in Chicago. This is -- this is an example of -- you know how things work in this city. And it's ludicrous, it's ridiculous, and -- but, but that's the reality of things in Chicago."

Secondly, you know, to the president, I say, the only person who has been caught lying about Russia is the president. He said he had no business dealings with the Russia. We have now learned that he had dealings going all the way up to and beyond the primary. But, what's most important is I actually think your first segment which is you and your guests expressed outrage, which I think was justified about the Smollett outcome where the charges were dismissed, yet, we all believe we know what happened because of the evidence that exists in the case."

So now there's all these kinds of revisions being made to the argument. And I think that just as a country, all of us regardless of your politics need to go, OK, we all waited for this report. Let's look at this report and I know you want to see it in full and so do I and so do I think most people in this country, but isn't it time for a little bit of reflection on everything that's happened?"

When he meets with Vladimir Putin, he won't tell the country what was said and he destroyed -- and he essentially took the notes from the interpreter. That really worries me and I think Martha it should worry you too. But just because he's not been criminally indicted for collusion, doesn't mean he has conducted colluding types of behavior with the Russians. And again going back to your earlier segment, you're outraged because a person wasn't charged with a crime although you think you know what happened. I'm upset and I think a lot of people are upset because we've seen this president have his campaign, take meetings with the Russians were dirt was offered, we've seen the president say on a stage Russia keep hacking, and we've seen the president constantly lie about his contacts with Russia. I agree what Bob Mueller -- I accept his report that the president did not commit criminal collusion but if the best day of his presidency is that he's not been indicted for criminal collusion, we still have problems, and that's what I think should be addressed by seeing the full Mueller report."

It's like trying to find that Chupacabra, you know, like the mythical animal that came from Puerto Rico that supposedly people see out in the southwest. They're like a bunch of Chupacabra hunters, Martha. They've never seen it, they've never had any evidence, they've said they had more than circumstantial evidence, they said they've had direct evidence. The truth of the matter is the people who colluded with the Russians were the Democrats. The Democrats paid Christopher Steele, a former British spy to get dirt on Trump from Russia. That's just a fact."

There'll be -- you know, once we get it all done, we'll make it as much of public as possible that'll probably be hopeful by the end of next week. But also what needs to happen is we need full transparency in this matter, full transparency. So you know, there was a lot of -- the FBI and DOJ have claimed falsely that this investigation started in July of 2016, late July 2016. That was a lie. So we need to know all the informants, everybody that they were running into the Trump campaign, because look what happened here is wrong. The FBI and Department of Justice should not be able to use counterintelligence capabilities that are used to target terrorists and other bad guys around the globe against political parties. Republicans and Democrats should agree political opposition research from one candidate should not be used to let the nation's top spy capabilities be used against political parties."

That's actually not what happened. And part of the reason I was one of four witnesses that was invited to testify in front of the House Oversight Committee a couple months ago was especially because I have a real story to tell and it has to do with FISA surveillance abuse and actual just overall abuse of the previous administration and foreign governments, not the Russians but unfortunately U.S. allies, the U.K. and Australia. So what happened essentially was I got pinned in my first interview with the FBI in which I'm sitting there. I made a mistake dealing with this professor named Joseph Mifsud who I wanted the simply distance myself from him to the campaign and President Trump because it was my fault. I was trying to arrange a meeting with Vladimir Putin and Trump, where Trump obviously wanted to have some sort of relationship with Russia. This individual promise that he could make it happen."

I failed to do it with the Russian dealer, I succeeded with the Egyptian but the main point is this. This professor who got me in this all this trouble, the FBI falsely characterized this person as a Russian asset or Russian agent. We now have overwhelming evidence that this was no Russian asset and this person was actually a western intelligence asset sent to meet with me to basically sabotage me and try therefore to sabotage Trump and the rest of the campaign.

HUME Yes. A lot of other media have gone to the new corner to defend themselves now. And the new line seems to be is, hey, what did you want us to do? Not cover the story? It was a big story and it was an important story and we were just reporters covering the story. That's what Jeff Zucker was saying over at CNN. You heard that from Margaret Sullivan in The Washington Post and a number of others. And the trouble with it is that that misses the entire point. Yes, they were -- some of this reporting that was done was bad. There were number of bad stories. We had CNN had to, you know, got caught out a couple of times. We had the Daily Beast saying Mueller is telling us that he's got Trump on conclusion. The list of bad stories is fairly long. But beyond that it wasn't that they were covering a story, it was the sheer volume of the coverage, and the sheer weight given to it. Every little turn and detail in the story convey the unmistakable sense that this was going somewhere and it was going to unearth something very serious about our president and his campaign.

And you know, and it might not be a bad idea for journalists who are worried about what happened here to say, well maybe we shouldn't listen to these people in the future. Maybe we shouldn't have them on so much. Not because the White House says it but because of the record they composed."

If you call someone a traitor and it turns out that you lacked evidence for that charge, and the only decent things to do is apologize. Do you think he'll be waiting a long time?"

Although you're beginning to hear from certain seasoned politicians and even some liberal journalists this idea of come on, folks, this is a dead horse. Stop beating it, particularly to Democratic politicians. Stop beating it, move on to things that people care more about because, you know, we got an election coming up and you want to have something to run on beyond an investigation that turned up essentially nothing."
