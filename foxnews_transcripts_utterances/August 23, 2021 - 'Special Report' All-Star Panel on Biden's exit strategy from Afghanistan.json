I do think there are Americans that are stranded there, at least they feel like they're stranded. The context, I agree, as I often do, I agree with Trey that the -- we all wanted to exit, or many wanted to exit, but the execution is the problem. Serious-minded people have to be willing to set aside the politics here for a moment, and let's focus on, Democrat and Republican, what resources will be needed. If the Taliban is to be believed that they want us out before the 31st and aren't for extending the deadline, what are we prepared to do? I think the president has got to think long and hard about that and be ready to articulate that to the country. I listened to Prime Minister Blair, the former prime minister, and I like him, too. But he also was part of an effort that diverted resources under President Bush he agreed to from Afghanistan's counterterrorism efforts to go war with Iraq, which I think history will prove probably was a mistake. I voted for that war based on what was told to me in the Congress. There is no doubt occupying forces in Afghanistan don't work. Alexander the Great suffered his only defeat there, and obviously the Russians did. Now, that gives no excuse why this president, and I would argue predecessor, couldn't get a better deal to get the extraction of not only Americans out, but our Afghan allies. But unfortunately for President Biden, it's on his watch now. And as he shared the other day, the buck stops with him, and they're going to have to have a better plan if it extends beyond August 31st to get Americans out of Afghanistan safely.",

And going back to that clip of Jen Psaki today in that exchange with Peter Doocy, I have been mystified repeatedly on the policy and the messaging choices of this administration on this issue, and the withdrawal in particular. I was particularly mystified by her choice, the White House press secretary's decision that she made, to pick a fight on parsing the word \"stranded\" involving thousands of Americans and allies who are definitionally stranded right now. They didn't say abandoned. Peter didn't use that word, abandoned forever. Right now they are stranded. There is example after example pouring in from people, Americans and otherwise, who feel and are stranded.
