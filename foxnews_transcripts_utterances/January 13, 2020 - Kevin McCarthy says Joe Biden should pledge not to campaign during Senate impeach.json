After months of screaming, urgency, urgency, urgency -- also they can go on vacation -- Pelosi inexplicably, well, she sat on the bogus articles of impeachment for weeks. What happened to urgency? Keep in mind, Article I, Section 3, our U.S Constitution, it states, quote: The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. Sole power. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, the House has the sole power to impeach. When that House sends over their partisan garbage, the Senate has every right to dismiss. Pelosi doesn't get to tell the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell how to do his constitutional job and what his role is, which is why as McConnell pointed out, Pelosi's stall tactics have achieved nothing, except the phony belief that it was urgent to do it so quickly. Never was. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He's afraid he'll actually have to answer for his malignant behavior. After all, this is the coward who afforded zero rights, zero due process, zero, basic fundamental fairness to President Trump, the way Newt Gingrich and Republicans did with Bill Clinton. It appears he tampered, perhaps, with witnesses, leaked material to shape public opinion, and entered a fraudulent evidence into the official record.

That's 3.5 percent. The labor of underutilized rates, they also are at all times lows.

Nope, these crowds, massive crowds turned out to denounce their own hostile regime that has basically pretty much imprisoned all of them. They were ripping down posters of the dead terrorist leader, Soleimani. They were chanting, \"Our enemy is right here. They lied to us that it's America.\" Government forces, they then had to respond the way they always do in Iran, firing live ammunition into the crowd, beating protesters. Still -- and look at this powerful scene. See that? Undeterred demonstrators, they chose to walk around a large American and Israeli flag painted on the sidewalk. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at this.

Hatred, bigotry, ignorance as far as the eye can see. And tonight, no, we can't do it for you for the people of Iran. We do stand in solidarity. We believe in freedom in America. We don't believe in the suppression of freedom and liberty and rights. We don't like how women are treated. We don't like Sharia law. We don't like how gays and lesbians are thrown off buildings and murdered because they just do that. We don't like any of that. We don't support any of that. They truly want to rid themselves of this hostile regime, they will have to act, the people themselves. One thing is clear, because under President Trump, Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. Besides that, you are going to have to win your own independence. And we can help you, I hope we find a way too at some point in time. But we can't put American troops on the ground.

Why was he appointed? Well, I can tell you this, that senior Republican lawmakers led by Mark Meadows are going to send a letter to the judge, to Boasberg, to Judge Boasberg, demanding that Kris be removed from this oversight.

It was a five-year reauthorization. That's a tool that we use to really target terrorists. The bigger problem here is that FISA itself is a law that dates back 30 years. And so, we would actually end up shutting down a critical program because of the abuses that have taken place on a larger program. But I agree with Mark Meadows and others, that if we're going to appoint people like this, and, look, it's not just the guy accused me of federal crimes. It's more that the guy has really downplayed this and has been an apologist, really, to the -- about what has happened with the FISA report.

The president sent him a kind farewell, tweeting out, quote: Really big breaking news. Booker who was in zero polling territory just dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary race. Now, I can rest easy tonight. I was concerned that that I'd someday have to go head-to-head with him. Now, as the Booker campaign ends, it looks like the feud between Sanders and Warren is just beginning. Tonight, comrade Bernie, he's now denying a report that he told the Massachusetts senator back in 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidential race. But just moments ago, Warren released a statement on the meeting that said, in part, quote, I thought a woman could win. He disagreed. The conflict comes after Warren herself was out there taking a shot at Sanders over leaked campaign messaging against her. The president, well, he thinks it's already over, tweeting, quote, everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Anyway, while the Trump campaign dubs Bernie Sanders the new frontrunner, well, now, what's undeniable is that there is low energy and enthusiasm all throughout the rest of the Democratic Party. Take a look at your screen. Highly touted event in San Antonio this weekend with Michael Bloomberg and Judge Judy -- I like Judge Judy -- drew literally 45 people. And, of course, there's also quid pro quo Joe, who continues to face the ire of progressives on everything -- the Iraq war, he lied. Trade deal, well, of course. His record on serving minority communities, because look at this, Sanders' national co-chair, Nina Turner, published a blistering op-ed entitled, quote: While Bernie Sanders has always stood up for African-Americans, Joe Biden has reportedly let us down. But what the piece fails to mention is that President Trump, not the far left, not the Obama-Biden administration, it's the Trump administration that has been delivering for the forgotten men and women in this country. Look at this. Breaking down demographics, record low unemployment again, one record after another for African-Americans, for Hispanic-Americans, a new household high in median income. Fifty-year low unemployment, 3 percent wage gains. And we just got even more good news, because since President Trump took office, average wage growth for individuals at the tenth percentile of the income distribution, that now outpaces wage growth for the individuals at the 90th percentile. And the average wage growth for African-Americans now outpaces wage growth for white Americans. It's all great news for Americans. In other words, those disproportionately that were left behind during the Obama-Biden years, the forgotten men and women, they're doing so much better under the policies of Donald Trump. But the bad news for the extreme socialist economy-killing Democratic agenda, by the way, New Green Deal, $94 trillion in 10 years, Medicare for All, no more private insurance, $52 trillion in 10 years.

It's going to make your blood boil tonight. Plus, knives are out. Democratic Party are heading to Iowa. We will show you how all of the radical 2020 socialists are now starting to turn on each other, as we predicted. Also, massive anti-regime protesting going on in the country of Iran, drawing worldwide attention. But many so-called liberals -- they are, of course, notably silent, because it doesn't fit into their deranged anti- Trump narrative. First, we start, tonight, once again, in the swamp, where Nancy Pelosi, speaker by name only, and her botched impeachment charade is now a source of official embarrassment for top Democrats. After months of screaming, urgency, urgency, urgency -- also they can go on vacation -- Pelosi inexplicably, well, she sat on the bogus articles of impeachment for weeks. What happened to urgency? Keep in mind, Article I, Section 3, our U.S Constitution, it states, quote: The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. Sole power. By the way, the House has the sole power to impeach. When that House sends over their partisan garbage, the Senate has every right to dismiss. Pelosi doesn't get to tell the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell how to do his constitutional job and what his role is, which is why as McConnell pointed out, Pelosi's stall tactics have achieved nothing, except the phony belief that it was urgent to do it so quickly. Never was. Take a look."

Let's take a look."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. From start to finish, Pelosi has totally botched this obvious political stunt. She announced the inquiry before the transcript of the phone call with Zelensky. Never knew what was in it. She criticized the call in question before she even read that transcript. She authorized the impeachment inquiry without a vote. She appointed a corrupt, compromised congenital liar by the name of, yes, Adam Schiff, to lead this bogus inquiry. And Schiff then conducted the Schiff show investigation in secret where he first auditioned behind closed doors the witnesses, grooming testimony, selectively leaking material. Why? To shape public opinion. His star witness, the so-called whistle-blower, non-whistleblower, hearsay whistleblower, never testified after it was discovered that he had been apparently talking to, may be coordinating with Schiff's office from the beginning. Now, in the end, the only fact witness, well, that information, that testimony was exculpatory for the president as he refuted the Democrat's wild accusations. And yet, they still passed two B.S. articles of impeachment. Zero Republican support while a few Democrats actually voted against the articles. Now, these are the weakest articles of impeachment in the history of the United States, not worthy, frankly, of the Senate's time. And despite their best efforts, even the mob and the media failed to bolster the support they wanted. Look at this. According to NewsBusters, over the past 100 days, a whopping three-fourths of the media's coverage of President Trump is centered around impeachment. And naturally, 93 percent of that, negative. But Americans are not buying it. Look at the Real Clear Politics average, the polls have shifted in the president's favor. And now, Pelosi is desperately trying to save face. Good luck with that mission in life."

We offered him three hours nonstop, the radio show with 625 of the best talk radio affiliates in the country. One hour, thanks to this great audience, the number one show in cable news. Oh, that's right. He's afraid he'll actually have to answer for his malignant behavior. After all, this is the coward who afforded zero rights, zero due process, zero, basic fundamental fairness to President Trump, the way Newt Gingrich and Republicans did with Bill Clinton. It appears he tampered, perhaps, with witnesses, leaked material to shape public opinion, and entered a fraudulent evidence into the official record. Remember, he actually fabricated a transcript that didn't exist of the president's call with the Ukrainian president, and, of course, he lied about all of it. Schiff doesn't apparently care about constitutional duties. Now, since 2016, Democrats have cared about one thing, one thing only, destroying any means possible, Donald Trump. This impeachment charade was their desperate, last ditch attempt and it has been an abject failure. Meanwhile, the Trump agenda continues to be a massive success. According to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate -- wow. In spite of all of the noise and all of the impeachment, and all the conspiracy theories and all the hoaxes, it is now at the lowest rate since 1969. Many of you watching probably weren't born yet. That's 3.5 percent. The labor of underutilized rates, they also are at all times lows. Look at this, wage growth for low and middle income earners, you know, the forgotten men and women, disproportionately negatively impacted by Biden and Obama's economy, yep, they're actually outpacing the growth of high income earners. Wow. The rich. And earnings, growth among every race, every gender, tax bracket is far exceeding the Obama-Biden years. The economy now by every measure firing on all cylinders. The election is only 295 days away. Here now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Sir, I don't know how you explain it because there was all this urgency. Then the urgency led to everybody going away on vacation and they came back from vacation, and they had no urgency there either. So, the only urgency seems to be just to try and get everybody at Christmastime talking about Donald Trump and he was impeached for nothing."

Let's lay this out, just as Clinton had and Nixon had -- a fair process, a due process. She denied us even the ability to do that. And now, she holds it up. But I believe she held it up for a number of reasons. One, she knows she has a very weak case. Two, it also plays in the hand -- remember what the Democrats did in 2016? They beat Bernie Sanders. Why? They used superdelegates. They also had the DNC chairperson, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to resign the night before the convention, because they got caught cheating. What this does, it harms every senator running for president with Iowa being February 3rd and benefits Joe Biden. Joe Biden should actually make a pledge not to campaign while impeachment is on, if he believes in the fairness and that Nancy Pelosi didn't do this for him."

She said she wanted to go really fast and now she held up. She has a weak case, which you are very clear about. This is the weakest, fastest impeachment in the history of America.

They had their opportunity. But one thing that wouldn't happen in America, you have people in this jury box who are already made a decision on this case, like Kamala Harris.

      "utterance": "All right. Thank you, Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives. Now, let's turn to a huge developing situation out of Iran. Over the weekend, widespread protests erupted all across the country. Now, look at this. This time, demonstrators weren't burning American flags, Israeli flags, or shouting death to America, death to Israel. Nope, these crowds, massive crowds turned out to denounce their own hostile regime that has basically pretty much imprisoned all of them. They were ripping down posters of the dead terrorist leader, Soleimani. They were chanting, \"Our enemy is right here. They lied to us that it's America.\" Government forces, they then had to respond the way they always do in Iran, firing live ammunition into the crowd, beating protesters. Still -- and look at this powerful scene. See that? Undeterred demonstrators, they chose to walk around a large American and Israeli flag painted on the sidewalk. Look at this. Pretty amazing stuff. And to avoid stepping on it. Then, they were booing and jeering the few who did not follow suit. Compared to the protest mandated by the Islamic dictatorship of Iran, and when the mullahs are there, and they are leading the chants of \"death to America, death to Israel,\" burning our flag, burning the Israeli flag. Hatred, bigotry, ignorance as far as the eye can see. And tonight, no, we can't do it for you for the people of Iran. We do stand in solidarity. We believe in freedom in America. We don't believe in the suppression of freedom and liberty and rights. We don't like how women are treated. We don't like Sharia law. We don't like how gays and lesbians are thrown off buildings and murdered because they just do that. We don't like any of that. We don't support any of that. They truly want to rid themselves of this hostile regime, they will have to act, the people themselves. One thing is clear, because under President Trump, Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. Besides that, you are going to have to win your own independence. And we can help you, I hope we find a way too at some point in time. But we can't put American troops on the ground. This president has promised he won't. We can't get long protracted conflicts of any kind. But you do have the right, it is a God-given right. In this country, we believe to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We are endowed by our Creator. We believe that for all human beings. The crippling sanctions will not be lifted if Iran continues to engage in their hostile behavior all around the regime, all around the region. If they continue to attack Americans, if they continue to attack American assets, or kill Americans. If you, the Iranian people, want what we have and often take for granted here in this country, better, greater country, more freedom, more prosperity for your country, you must take control of your own destiny. Joining us now with more, Arizona Senator Martha McSally is with us. I watched this and as I watched a few people that did step on the American flag and then I watched the majority that didn't, and I'm thinking, wow, ever since the president's sanctions have been put in place and are working --"

Would they support that for all people? Because their silence is deafening. After spending more than a week hyperventilating over the president's actions against the hostile Iranian regime and Soleimani who's killed so many Americans, top Democrats, they've have almost totally, entirely ignored the anti-regime protesters.

You know, if the dog bites, the bee stings, if you're feeling said, blame Trump if you're a Democrat, or part of the mob and the media. Here, we have millions of Iranian citizens now crying out for freedom. We should stand with them in solidarity at least. We can't save them. I wish we could. The left's hatred is so extreme that they now have turned a blind eye to pure evil in this Iranian regime. No human rights -- I thought they cared about human rights. I thought they cared about the rights to women, and gays, and lesbians. Apparently not, because this would be a good opportunity for them to speak out about oppression, all while turning their backs on the citizens of Iran. Here now with reaction, Salem Radio nationally syndicated host, Larry Elder, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino. You know, Dan, I don't think this is that complicated. I know we can't save every part of the world were dark and evil and regimes like this exist. I'd like to think, though, we'd stand with solidarity with the people and watching the majority step away from stepping on that American and Israeli flag was pretty inspiring and spoke volumes."

Having said that, if we have an opportunity, an open opportunity to minimize risk to Americans around the world, with minimal exposure to U.S. assets at the time, we should take it. And I have to ask the Democrats, and I've asked this a couple times. I'll ask it again. You know, seriously, I'm not kidding. What side are you on? We should turn the table on them, Sean, and we should ask them the question. You keep challenging President Trump for killing one of the world's worst terrorists. I need you to explain to me in a coherent paragraph or less, what was the benefit of keeping one of the world's number one terrorist alive? Please go ahead, Democrats. Let's explain that to the American people, what the benefit of this guy living or having a pulse was. They'll never do it. They'll run from the question."

To assist with reforming, they hired this guy, the FBI's FISA process. But breaking tonight, GOP Congressman Mark Meadows, he's now told Sara Carter, FOX News investigative reporter, that lawmakers will appeal to the FISA court to remove the former Obama official from the FBI's review. Here now to explain it is investigative reporter, Sara Carter. All right. So this is a guy, just to remind everybody, Sarah, David Kris -- you know, he was the one in this particular case, who openly was criticizing the Republicans like Devin Nunes who will join us, and defended the FBI bureau's premeditated fraud on the FISA court.

      "utterance": "Well, this is the question that everyone is asking, Sean. I mean, this is what is stunning about this. David Kris was appointed by the new FISA court judge, James Boasberg, to basically lead this oversight of the bureau. He's the same man, as you said, that both defended the FBI's surveillance of Carter Page and then went directly after Congressman Devin Nunes' incredible report which, by the way, was verified and validated by inspector general Michael Horowitz of the FBI's malfeasance. He still defended the FBI. He played it down Horowitz's report just recently. And he's continuing to write for stuff like \"Lawfare\" blog, different blogosphere, as well as his Twitter account, going after both Devin Nunes. In fact, he accused Devin Nunes in March of 2018 of obstructing justice and said he should be charged. What's fascinating right now is that people are asking the very question that you asked. Why was he appointed? Well, I can tell you this, that senior Republican lawmakers led by Mark Meadows are going to send a letter to the judge, to Boasberg, to Judge Boasberg, demanding that Kris be removed from this oversight. And they actually threatened that come March when there's a reauthorization for the FISA, that they might not reauthorize it at all, regarding the FISA report. So, this is a serious situation. It can change at the drop of the hat. So, it looks like Dave Kris is in for a fight. It looks like the Republicans are pushing back. And come March, FISA might not be reauthorized."

Remember, she was the former head of the FISC court, of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. And she suggested that this wasn't the only one. And this is something that we need to look at seriously, Sean, because there are a number of people saying we need to review all of these FISA applications. And I know that Horowitz is now in charge of that. So, that's something that he is going to be doing. But, remember, that reauthorization comes back up in March. And if nothing changes and if the FISA is reauthorized, then we may never get those changes. And that's what a lot of people are concerned about."

I'd said now a few times in interviews that the -- it's like the court wants to get itself abolished. And so, what Sara is talking about is the 702 section of FISA that we reauthorized. It was a five-year reauthorization. That's a tool that we use to really target terrorists. The bigger problem here is that FISA itself is a law that dates back 30 years. And so, we would actually end up shutting down a critical program because of the abuses that have taken place on a larger program. But I agree with Mark Meadows and others, that if we're going to appoint people like this, and, look, it's not just the guy accused me of federal crimes. It's more that the guy has really downplayed this and has been an apologist, really, to the -- about what has happened with the FISA report. So I just don't know that what we've read is that there were eight people that were selected as possibilities to implement these changes at the court."

And as you said as well, that the selection of this guy Kris by the FISA is ridiculous. The FBI lied, and to help make sure this doesn't happen again. Now, where is Director Wray? And I would think if I was a judge and I was lied to and it was premeditated lying against me to take away someone's civil rights and spy on a presidential candidate, transition team and president, that I'd want the truth told to me."

Now, I can rest easy tonight. I was concerned that that I'd someday have to go head-to-head with him. Now, as the Booker campaign ends, it looks like the feud between Sanders and Warren is just beginning. Tonight, comrade Bernie, he's now denying a report that he told the Massachusetts senator back in 2018 that a woman couldn't win the presidential race. But just moments ago, Warren released a statement on the meeting that said, in part, quote, I thought a woman could win. He disagreed. The conflict comes after Warren herself was out there taking a shot at Sanders over leaked campaign messaging against her. The president, well, he thinks it's already over, tweeting, quote, everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Anyway, while the Trump campaign dubs Bernie Sanders the new frontrunner, well, now, what's undeniable is that there is low energy and enthusiasm all throughout the rest of the Democratic Party.

But what the piece fails to mention is that President Trump, not the far left, not the Obama-Biden administration, it's the Trump administration that has been delivering for the forgotten men and women in this country. Look at this. Breaking down demographics, record low unemployment again, one record after another for African-Americans, for Hispanic-Americans, a new household high in median income. Fifty-year low unemployment, 3 percent wage gains. And we just got even more good news, because since President Trump took office, average wage growth for individuals at the tenth percentile of the income distribution, that now outpaces wage growth for the individuals at the 90th percentile. And the average wage growth for African-Americans now outpaces wage growth for white Americans. It's all great news for Americans. In other words, those disproportionately that were left behind during the Obama-Biden years, the forgotten men and women, they're doing so much better under the policies of Donald Trump.

      "speaker": "DEVINE",
      "utterance": "The entire story has gripped the world, I think because of this clash of cultures and it's between the sort of vacuous, virtuous signaling, celebrity work, Hollywood culture that Meghan Markle represents, the American divorcee, and the sort of duty and tradition that -- and the sort of self-abnegating way of the monarchy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANKSTON",
      "utterance": "I think the thing is, is that people always want to play the blame game. You know, is it Meghan's fault? Is it who's fault is it? I think we really all have to look at the fact that they are both grown- ups. And Harry has been raised as a member of the royal family and needs to take responsibility for his own actions."

      "utterance": "Which rather, we would be fair."
    },

      "speaker": "LANKSTON",
      "utterance": "Right, and remember, there was a rift between the two brothers who've been around for a very long time, isn't just in the wake of this announcement. And I think the truth of the matter is William has said, Harry, you were, first and foremost, a member of this family and you need to take responsibility for what happens."

Warmly greeted, loud cheers, chants of \"USA, USAs\" as they arrived in the field prior to the singing of our national anthem. Listen. I think we're out of time. We'll do that tomorrow.
