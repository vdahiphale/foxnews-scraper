And that doesn't mean clever stuff on YouTube and trying to out-argue them on the Internet. That has nothing to do with it. It's what Usama said a long ago, people go with the strong horse.

There will still be adherents, there will still be people who get into cars, trucks, and kill people. But the idea that it's on the march, that it's collecting recruits, it will be the beginning of the end. The same way Al Qaeda when it lost its base in Afghanistan and was scattered, it's still active, it still kills people. But it's not in 16 years been able to launch anything like 9/11. You've got to kill it at the source.",

It could have been Steve Bannon at the podium but for the fact that Trump wouldn't say he wasn't going to fire him. So it's confusing. There's a lot of theories about what Bannon was up to. Did he know that he was on the record when he was later claiming he was off the record? Bill, I say to people that in Washington if the question is, is it a mistake or sloppiness or confusion versus some master plan or conspiracy, always go with the first one.

It's a frustrating paradox that as ISIS loses territory it feels that it needs to compensate to show that it still in the game by striking outside of that territory in the Middle East that we are systematically taking away from it. And there are a lot of foreign fighters who have returned to Europe, they have training. They have the desire to kill. They've been radicalized, not to mention the ideology that lives on online. Radicalization doesn't have to have anything to do with people who have been in combat, gone to Mosul, gone to Raqqa, met al-Baghdadi. As we all know by this time, guys on the Internet on Twitter are getting radicalized left and right and there's just not a lot you can do about it. This is the new normal unfortunately.

They capture like the American NSA does every phone call in real time, every email in real time, every text message in real time, and so they, just like the NSA here, suffer from information overload. More information about decent people and they don't have time to sift through it. These things are just going to keep happening until intelligence authorities focus their attention on those as to whom there is reason to have suspicion. We know of at least five human beings involved in this, and some of the 40 or 50 miles apart. Unless they communicated by smoke signals, their communications were captured by Spanish authorities but not recognized until it was too late."

The president tweeted this a short time ago. \"The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough and strong. We love you.\" Charles, to this point about crushing the ideology that Michael brings up here, Michael Waltz, a former Green Beret commander about 30 minutes go, he talked it to throughout history, you have to be committed to go ahead and wiping it out. When you look at the tactic that was used yet again, taking a vehicle, driving down the sidewalk and swerving right to left and back again trying to hit as many people as possible, this is not easy to defend, and some may even suggest impossible."

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "It is impossible to defend. And I think we have to do what we can, we have to surveil. We have to set up pedestrian barriers. We have to do all of that. But in the end is not going to make much of a difference. One thing will make a difference, and that is defeating the ideology. And that doesn't mean clever stuff on YouTube and trying to out-argue them on the Internet. That has nothing to do with it. It's what Usama said a long ago, people go with the strong horse. As long as people have the sense that Jihadism is on the rise, the caliphate, there's a utopia on the other side, they will join. Once they get the idea that it's collapsing on them, then you get a radical reduction in that attraction. The obvious example is communism. There was a lot of communist terror, Latin America, middle of Europe, everywhere in the heyday of communism. It got wiped out. It lost its home base, it lost its ideology, and there's almost none of it around the world. The key battle here is Raqqa. ISIS has been defeated in Mosul. When the Raqqa campaign is over, when ISIS has been utterly routed and on the run, it's not going to disappear. There will still be adherents, there will still be people who get into cars, trucks, and kill people. But the idea that it's on the march, that it's collecting recruits, it will be the beginning of the end. The same way Al Qaeda when it lost its base in Afghanistan and was scattered, it's still active, it still kills people. But it's not in 16 years been able to launch anything like 9/11. You've got to kill it at the source."

      "utterance": "Very interesting point. You know, Michael, you wonder, then, Charles, and to you, Michael, how far we are from that point that Charles describes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CROWLEY",
      "utterance": "We are a ways from that point I think. I take Charles' point, but I would say there is a scenario where we take the territory from ISIS but it becomes an insurgency in Iraq much like the one George W. Bush had to authorize a major and controversial troop surge to quash. The Iraqis would not be able to put on the major insurgency on their own at this point. And remember, that insurgency was flourishing and was a propaganda boon for Al Qaeda in the 2000s. So the pessimistic take on what you're saying, which may be the right answer, is that even having lost territory, having lost the caliphate, ISIS will become more of a free-floating insurgency in the Iraq-Syria region that will continue to produce all kinds of propaganda victories and videos that will continue to be a recruiting tool. And what is the answer to that? I don't know. It's hard and it's disturbing."

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",

But in the meantime during the commercial break the vice president, Mike Pence in Panama City, Panama, went on to reiterate how the U.S. stands by our European allies in helping them in any way possible given the attack there in Barcelona. Some more on that when we get it. In the meantime with regard to Steve Bannon, here is what we are learning. He did an interview in a liberal magazine, and in it he said a lot of things. But with regard to the nationalist movement, this is what he said. \"These guys are a collection of clowns, ethno-nationalism. It's losers. It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much and we have to help crush it, you know, help crush it more. The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got them.\" That was one interview with the American Prospect. There was another interview with The New York Times. In part he said the following on the Confederate statues, \"President Trump by asking where does this all end, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, connects with the American people about their history, culture, and traditions. The race identity politics the left wants to say it's all racist, just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it,\" end quote. And how do we then, back with the panel, how do we, Michael, look at these comments as to why they are coming out now? Let's start there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CROWLEY",
      "utterance": "It's a very confusing moment because we have been hearing for several days, longer maybe, that Bannon's job was in trouble, Trump was on the brink of firing him. But this is one of the most Bannon-esque moments in Trump's presidency. That performance at the press conference a couple days ago was pure Bannon. It could have been Steve Bannon at the podium but for the fact that Trump wouldn't say he wasn't going to fire him. So it's confusing. There's a lot of theories about what Bannon was up to. Did he know that he was on the record when he was later claiming he was off the record? Bill, I say to people that in Washington if the question is, is it a mistake or sloppiness or confusion versus some master plan or conspiracy, always go with the first one. Washington is more like the TV show \"Veep\" than \"House of Cards.\" My bet would be that Bannon in that first interview did think he was off the record. But let's step back and on the larger point of what he's talking about, the politics here, I think in the short term, particularly if you look at some of the polling, the Republicans are still with the Donald Trump are on the issue of the events in Charlottesville, the statues and that sort of thing. He has more support among Republicans in particular than I might have expected. But I think that in the longer term, this is a losing game. So Bannon may be right that race and identity politics, generally speaking, leave the Klan out of it, there's no good that comes from being associated with the Klan. But on these questions of race and identity politics, it could be short-term gain for Trump. It's long-term terrible for the Republican Party in an America that is growing more and more diverse. Race is not a long-term winning issue for the Republicans."

Donald Trump has just had the worst week of his presidency and it was 100 percent self-inflicted. And Bannon is trying to make himself a lightning rod. Bannon is trying to cause himself to be the center of attention to get the criticism off the president. The president lost natural allies in the Senate and natural allies in the business community as a result of that horrific press conference the other day. And Steve Bannon is trying to get the pressure off his boss. I think it will be short-lived."

The removal of our beautiful statues and monuments, you can't change history but you can learn from it. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish.
