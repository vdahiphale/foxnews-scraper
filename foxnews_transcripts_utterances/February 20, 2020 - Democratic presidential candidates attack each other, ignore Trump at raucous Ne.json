Throw cash at the crowd then tell those who are already been playing to drop out because you arrived. Plus, his reputation is piggish, but it's a sobering observation.

Because the Cold War was, like, history, and that was 31 years ago, a long time. So maybe Bernie just forgot, like all of his supporters did.

Biden, for once, seemed semi-coherent. Amy K. took the opportunity to clobber the word faucet that is Mayor Pete. But the big winner, Bernie, who barely got touched because everyone wanted a piece of the billionaire, Sanders was like a magician benefiting from misdirection. Here, everyone, look at laughable mini-Mike while I steal the nomination. Of course, Mike had it coming. You don't enter late in the game. Throw cash at the crowd then tell those who are already been playing to drop out because you arrived. Plus, his reputation is piggish, but it's a sobering observation. Among Democrats, it's worse being a billionaire who started businesses than an apologist for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Because the Cold War was, like, history, and that was 31 years ago, a long time. So maybe Bernie just forgot, like all of his supporters did. That's scary for the rest of us who prefer capitalism over socialism, who rooted for America, docked the USSR in the 70s and 80s, who see that success in competition and profit, jobs, and incentives can actually change lives. Sadly, Bloomberg worked hard and all he got was rich. He never stood a chance. All right, can we just admit, Dagen, that that was so much fun? It was so much -- I was having a blast last night."

But even last night, this was so awkward and painful. I think people will have pity on him and they will give Mike Bloomberg a second chance. But you -- I've been where he has been.

I think he is a bully, a braggart, a big mouth. But -- and, you know, a merry prankster -- not so merry prankster. But this is a very, very unfair -- this is a process crime. They trapped him in a perjury trap just like General Flynn. It's disgusting what these prosecutors in their self-righteousness, which makes me, puke how they go after these people and then say they are doing god's work. It is appalling, and then seven to nine years? You know, people guilty of manslaughter, they're walking out in four, five years. Seven to nine years for that? That is what they wanted. And then they criticize Attorney General Barr for saying perhaps that is excessive. I think that people hate Trump so much that they suspend reason in a way that, you know is -- to use the word appalling is tiresome. I know that. But I just -- I feel very strongly.

Roger Stone, when he was initially arrested, I think about two dozen federal agents with assault rifles showed up at his house at, like, 5:30 in the morning. There was a boat -- with CNN with a boat behind the house and a helicopter whirly bird in the air. And it's just -- again, you don't go to jail if you hate Trump.

But I think everybody agrees. Barr and the judge was at the sentence was too long. And to the jury forewoman should have never been there. I would say that this is worthy of a new trial and not just a sentencing. But I think that what Trump is trying to do, he's attempting to rectify the collateral damage of a witch hunt, in which it was backfilled. Like, they initiated the witch hunt and then they backfilled it with investigations and prosecutions, and trapped all these people. And now, he's just trying to pick it all apart and pardon this and pardon that, which makes sense. But it is -- I'm with Geraldo on it. It's like you have to separate feelings from the actual facts."
