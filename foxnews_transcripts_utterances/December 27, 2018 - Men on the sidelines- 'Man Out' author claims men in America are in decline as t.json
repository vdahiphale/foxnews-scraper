The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that wise?

When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security. Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know, \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops on Christmastime.\" People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in media is this. Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And you say all right (ph), that's Republicans.
