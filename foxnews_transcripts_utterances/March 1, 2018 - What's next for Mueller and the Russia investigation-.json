Sounds simple. They called it the PROMISE Program -- Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and Education. It's quite an acronym. You see, in 2011 into 2012 school year, Broward had the highest public school related arrest record in the state. More than 1,000 kids in that year alone were arrested.

The standard to show that their lives are actually improving? Fewer arrests at schools, less police involvement, fewer disciplinary problems, at least on paper. So, school administrators were basically paid to deal with student crime in-house and keep the cops off the premises. Had Nicolas Cruz been arrested or charged by police for bringing knives or bullets to school or for other various infractions, threats and so forth, he might not have been able to buy that gun he used to kill 17 people.

These are people making false representations to a court. And so, nothing that is coming out here with regard to McCabe or any of these other players is surprising to me. It's just surprising that they are being allowed to you get away with it and distract all of us from what should be going on and the President should be focusing on in the country moving forward.

So the real story here. I don't think there is any doubt he would have gotten authorization. The story is, we know from the Manafort indictment and the Gates indictment all you have to do is look at it. Then he got authorization long ago to go beyond the four corners, at least the specific things he is supposed to be looking at. I'm surprised it hadn't been commented on that much earlier. If I can go back to for one minute to McCabe, to me, the two main things about McCabe that we have keep going back to, one, the gross conflict of interest. He should not have been involved in either the email or the Clinton Foundation investigation, which, if you believe news reports, he kept agencies from looking at things and number two, he is responsible for that FISA warrant. And that FISA warrant he has admitted and the shift memo did not contradict this. That if they had not had the Steele Dossier, they would not be even not have even submitted that.

We know back in September of 2016 that the intel agencies were picking up these communications and were doing their own investigation, you if you didn't verify everything in the FISA warrant, if you didn't document everything, that means there were other things in that FISA warrant that you told you that the Trump Administration or the campaign needed to be investigated. And by the way, there is a term called corroboration that Sal knows very well. If everything in that FISA warrant was corroborated, then what are we talking about then.

The more we learn about the school shooting in Florida, the more it appears that a Broward County invention may have played a role in what happened. And what am I talking about? In 2013, Broward County and their new school superintendent, Robert Runcie had a novel idea. Lower school expulsions and arrests by reducing police involvement. Sounds simple. They called it the PROMISE Program -- Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and Education. It's quite an acronym. You see, in 2011 into 2012 school year, Broward had the highest public school related arrest record in the state. More than 1,000 kids in that year alone were arrested. The Obama Administration Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder were so impressed by the PROMISE Plan that it inspired their own new national guidelines."

Too often, so-called zero tolerance policies, however well-intentioned they might be, make students feel unwelcomed in their own schools. They disrupt the learning process, and they can have significant and lasting negative effects on the long-term wellbeing of our young people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I'd say a violent kid whose outbursts are tolerated week after week leading years later to a school shooting also has lasting negative effects on young people and disrupts the learning process, Eric. But I digress. The Obama bureaucrats incentivized Broward to go even further, awarding the district nearly $54 million in grants to improve the lives of students in poverty and students of color. The standard to show that their lives are actually improving? Fewer arrests at schools, less police involvement, fewer disciplinary problems, at least on paper. So, school administrators were basically paid to deal with student crime in-house and keep the cops off the premises. Had Nicolas Cruz been arrested or charged by police for bringing knives or bullets to school or for other various infractions, threats and so forth, he might not have been able to buy that gun he used to kill 17 people. When CNN's Jake Tapper pressed Sheriff Scott Israel about his office's approach to student crime, he said this."

So, I place a lot of blame on the school board with that and some of the programs that they have initiated with the state attorney and the sheriff's office in the years past, for example the PROMISE Program. The problem is, when that program started, we took all discretion away from the law enforcement officers to affect an arrest if we choose to."

By turning Broward Schools and those across the nation into these social justice petri dishes, they may have facilitated a lunatic. And their soft policies have turned our schools into soft targets. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction from New York City is Shavar Jeffrey, President of Democrats for Education Reform and a supporter of the PROMISE Program, and also in New York is Michael Faulkner.

We'll start with you, Michael. What about this? I mean, it led to a big drop in arrests. I could tell you they had 1,056 arrests from 2011 to 2012. Skip forward 2015 to 2016, I think we have the full screen. That number goes down to 392. Kids started really behaving well, I guess."

It's a numbers game that we are playing, and unfortunately, when you play the numbers' game, ultimately you lose because those 17 lives that were lost can be directly attributed to the lower standards that were created and setting of the tone that actually lowered the standards on what law enforcement should be involved with. Now, I was a juvenile detention chaplain in New York City. I understand. I have worked with children who have had troubles and troubled background and so forth. I understand. I get it. Every kid doesn't need to be thrown in jail, for their first infraction or second infraction. But when I set a tone and begin to allow school officials to deal with all of those specific issues, you are setting us up -- all of us up for a catastrophic problem which we saw."

So, the kind of activities that are the everyday sort of activities we see from kids, maybe it is a low level after school fight, low-level vandalism. These are issues that are not law enforcement issues. These are issues where a school personnel or teach should work with young people to keep them on the right path. That's very different with what we had in the shooter in Florida who trafficked assault weapons, who was found on school grounds with weapons, who on multiple reports went to the FBI and did go to law enforcement about this young person's inclination towards violence, and the real fundamental problem we have here is that we have a culture of readily access to assault weapons where this young man could go and purchase the assault weapon as if he bought a bag of potato chips."

Kids speak in 17 languages in northern Virginia schools. The teachers are managing a lot. And my point is, if someone is a disrupter, we should worry less about what our reputation will look like if the police get involved and less about disparate impact and more about how to keep the kids in the school, white, black, Asian, whatever they are --"

He is not a racist, and you and others are concluding that he is a racist based upon your speculation from some statements that were made. You have no evidence, no results that suggest that he's a racist. Secondly, I, like Laura, I know Mr. Trump. I can spot racism 3,000 miles away and he doesn't have a racist bone in his body based upon my own personal experience.

Do you believe 21 percent of Republicans think Donald Trump is a racist? I don't know who these Republicans are, but I don't know if they belong in the Republican Party. To me, it's crazy. They can disagree with his policies, that's fine, or say he shouldn't tweet that's fine."

Here's why you have such a high number of Democrats believing that he is racist and you have a few Republicans. They are being told this. The liberal media and many Democrats have been using false racist narrative ever since this president became president and even before.

And a lot of those jobs are gone now. Those entry level jobs hurt, like a lot of people that I came from and a lot of minorities. And they are not there anymore. And Trump is standing against that."

I'm a radio talk show host. I like that job. I never dreamed I would be able to achieve that job. But do you know how I got it? I worked hard at it. I got it the old-fashioned way, probably the way you got yours.

So many questions to get to our guest, of course Stanford professor, National Review Institute fellow Victor Davis Hanson. All right, VDH, let's first do Putin because the neoconservatives want us to have a terrible relationship with Russia no matter what. So they must be happy today. What should we make of this?"

And they had a bruising in Syria, some Russian mercenaries did, so he wants to reassure the world he thinks that Russia is a still a world power. But I think the real reason is that the eight years of appeasement are over with, the reset has failed. During that Obama administration they increased their nuclear arsenal by 24 percent. We decreased by 17 percent. And he knows that's over with. And whether there is not going to be another Ukraine or Crimea. If he goes into Baltic nations or something like that, or another cyberattack, it's not going to be cut it out. But people like Jim Mattis and H.R. McMaster and Trump himself are just a different sort than the last administration and he's worried about it. There is kind of a tragedy about the whole thing because Russia has got less than half the population of the United States. It has got an economy smaller than where I am in California. And in past years we would use them diplomatically, but we are not allowed to do that given the hysteria in Washington."

I think what's different about Trump, though, is as he has made minimum wage controversies irrelevant because there is a shortage of jobs and the market is rebounding and people need workers. And the same thing I think will happen with trade as we have cheaper energy. We're going to have a more favorable business climate. We have got better deregulation than Europe and we have a better and more conducive tax code. I think what's going to happen, capital is going to come into the United States and this entire hysteria over one or two tariffs is going to fade."

By the way, Victor, I loved how Trump said today, he said if you are a country and you don't make steel or aluminum but especially if you don't make steel, are you really a country? That's a genius way of putting it because for national defense and all the reasons we need heavy steel, he made that point. Like no one can say anything. Do we really want to live in a world where China is the predominant power making material like steel with overcapacity, overcapacity, overcapacity? That's a disaster for us. He pointed that out.

This led to China's membership in the World Trade Organization. Clinton said it would inevitably lead to Chinese liberty. In that same year, presidential candidate George W. Bush flat out claimed, quote, trade with China will promote freedom. Bush also claimed in a GOP debate that there was a huge difference between trade with Cuba and trade with China.

American companies are also willingly giving Chinese authorities control over their previously independent operations. And now Chinese censors just announced that they have banned certain words and phrases from posts on popular microblogging sites. Here are the words, \"disagree, my emperor, lifelong control, any references to George Orwell's novels \"Animal Farm\" and \"1984,\" shocker. The website Vox found searches for terms \"immortality,\" \"incapable ruler,\" and \"I oppose\" were also blocked so you can't say \"I oppose.\" We haven't fostered a democracy in China. We have created a monster. We have created enormously rich communists and given them control over language, including ours when you go over there. Here's one word, by the way, that has not been banned by the Chinese yet. And I have been saying it for all of you free trade people for a long time. Free trade will lead to Chinese freedom.
