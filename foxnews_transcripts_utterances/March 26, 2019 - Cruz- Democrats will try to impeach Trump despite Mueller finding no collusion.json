Obamacare was just dealt a serious blow. Democrats are running scared from their Green New Deal of insanity. The wall in our southern border, guess what?

And the economy is booming. And this is been a major week for the country, one we will never forget. We are going to cover it all, and we will begin the process tonight of holding people responsible that were involved in the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal, in our history. Those that committed crimes that need to be investigated, the people who rigged an investigation, rigged a primary, tried to rig a general election. In other words, those people who used Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies from a foreign source with funneled money, leaked to influence you, the American people, head of that vote in 2016. Russian lies, fraud perpetrated on FISA courts, citizens denied basic fundamental constitutional rights, spying, infiltrating an opposition party in a presidential campaign, using Russian lies that Hillary paid for to bludgeon and attempt to remove a duly elected president. People that we entrust the most power to, they thought they knew better than you, then we, the American people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, we begin the process -- it is a process -- of getting the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and holding all of these people accountable for their actions. If we do not do it, it will happen again. And, plus, almost an unbelievable news development out of Chicago tonight, a miscarriage of justice has just taken place after some major, backroom, Chicago wheeling and dealing, alleged hate crime faker Jussie Smollett -- well, completely let off the hook for a mere $10,000. Now, the corruption in Chicago is a national disgrace. We are going to have an important mini monologue coming up on that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the ramifications, oh, of the Covington kids, and the Smollett case, and how it is all intertwined in the psychotic, hate-rage of Donald Trump. But first, this is a new day for the country. President Trump was totally and completely cleared of all the Russian collusion lies and all the other fabricated allegations against him. No collusion, no obstruction of justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The long-standing two-plus-year narrative of the media mob and the Democrats, it was nothing more than a hoax. It was contrived and built off irrational hate and in this psychotic rage perpetrated by those who first wanted to ever prevent Trump from becoming president but had an insurance policy to destroy his presidency in any event that he wins. At any cost, even if the heart and soul of this country was ripped apart in the process, and our Constitution. For years, you, the American people, you have been deliberately lied to. You have been deceived on a spectacular and frankly historic level. But this process of holding people accountable from the deep state to the media, to their friends in the Democratic Party, we will name every name, we will demand justice. We will call out every single solitary liar, con artist, who actively promoted a hoax, conspiracy theories, many for personal and political gain only, for power. This is not part of our mission going forward. Tonight, we start with the chief conspiracy theorist of all of them, starting at the top. NBC News, Tom Brokaw, are you proud of your network tonight? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Rachel Maddow, the face of MSNBC, supposedly a news channel. Yesterday, prominently featured on the cover of \"The New York Post,\" along with the title \"Mueller madness: Who got it the most wrong?\" Well, to actually put up brackets of the media's numerous collusion conspiracy theorist. As you can see, oh, yes, she is the number 1 seed. By the way, you can see my filled out bracket on hannity.com. And you better believe she has earned that position. Night after night, never ending lies, one bizarre conspiracy theory after another. And she has been rewarded for being the number one liar, conspiracy theorist in America. Nobody ever has challenged her or vetted her or questioned her as to the depths and length she has sunk in this process, breathlessly suggesting that the Kremlin and Putin are controlling the White House, that Donald Trump is a Russian puppet, and Vladimir Putin is pulling all the strings in our very own federal government. Watch with your own eyes and see if you believe this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I don't know that I would change the world that much, but what would change the world is if, you know, Russia was interfering in the election, and they weren't doing it on their own, and he was in on it. After all of the worry, we are actually about to find out if Russia maybe has something on the new president? We are about to find out if the new president of our country is going to do what Russia wants, once he is commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We haven't ever had to reckon with the possibility that someone has ascended to the presidency of the United States to serve the interests of another country rather than our own. What's the corrective to that? How do you remedy that? These are no longer hypothetical questions. This is where we are. He received the order of friendship from Vladimir Putin personally, the highest civilian award that Russia gives to non-Russian citizens. Somehow, Rex Tillerson ended up as secretary of state under Donald Trump, who he had never met. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mueller is proceeding without being stymied, and he is proceeding at this kind of a pace, rolling out the stuff right now, everything is aiming right at the president personally and that's not to be very unsettling. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The legal jeopardy here not only enters the president's immediate family, it also enters the White House. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Have you had enough? Do you really see what has gone on here? You know, have they backed up anything with evidence and proof, or has it just been speculation and rumors and innuendo and anonymous sources and reckless, nonstop speculation? This program, by the way, we welcome you with open arms. We have been right so many times, not because we have a crystal ball, this is Richard Jewell, this is Duke lacrosse, this is UVA, this is Cambridge police, this is also Trayvon and George Zimmerman, and Ferguson, and Baltimore, why are we right and they usually wrong? Why were they wrong on Smollett and the Covington kids? We don't rush to judgment. We believe in due process and the perception of innocence. Something they don't understand or seem to care about. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But a much different story over there at NBC News. Despite Mueller's findings, Rachel Maddow still cannot let go that her collusion obsession, now claiming the attorney general of the United States is somehow complacent in another grand conspiracy to cover up obstruction of a crime that never took place. In spite of how much they really wanted it, for years, rather than retract, apologize, about the dishonest, reckless, irresponsible coverage, which clearly has destroyed her own credibility and the network's, they double town on stupid, more conspiracy theories, more lies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, Andy Lack, Phil Griffin, are you proud of this? Really? You know, this is your brand, NBC News, complicit in lying to people for years. In fairness, NBC News did not act alone. And we got fake news CNN pushing the same Russia collusion hoax, every single minute of every hour of every day, for every month, for every year. Don Lemon among them, the walls are closing in on President Trump. CNN editor-at-large saying that Russia collusion was choking Trump's presidency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For two-plus-years, the collusion news network, except for the fact that they are actually not reporting any news, baseless speculation, hysteria, breathless reporting, all in an attempt to advance their political agenda and feed and insatiable hatred for all things Donald Trump. Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz claiming fake news CNN wouldn't even have him on the air because they didn't like his opinion. It was too fair. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And yet despite being so wrong so often, there you got CNN fake news chief, the king of it all, Jeff Zucker, pretending, oh, I'm not embarrassed at all, telling \"The New York Times,\" oh, another line news network, we are not investigators, we're journalists. Our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's pretty hard to seek facts when you are so blinded by hatred and rage. It's also nice to hear a rare moment of truth from Zucker. They don't actually investigate anything they report, they basically spread rumors, innuendo, maybe things they pick up on the Internet, Twitter, or maybe Facebook, or maybe Instagram, rumors to help their narrative, oh, like the Smollett case where the Covington kids. And today's narrative du jour, well, that's the Mueller report was totally clearing the president of any campaign collusion -- well, he doesn't actually do what I did, because in their fantasy world that they can't give up because then they would have to put aside their egos and their pride and admit, oh, guys like Sean Hannity were right and they were wrong. Instead, they just go on with a new one. And even though the attorney general stated clearly that Trump would not be charged with obstruction, Rod Rosenstein agrees with the analysis. A NewsBusters chronicles CNN fake news chanted what? A hundred twenty times, well, it doesn't exonerate -- that's what they tell their audience. Take a look, this is a 24-hour period. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Let's forget about -- not forget about the major crimes they may have committed. Many, I think, did. During their time, high ranking deep state actors abusing the power we gave to them, which brings us back to how did this all start? How did we get to this point? Who must face the consequences for their illicit action surrounding the 2016 election? We don't fix it, it will happen again. July 15th, 2015, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Hillary, mishandling top secret, classified information. Despite Comey citing overwhelming evidence of criminal negligence and obstruction of justice, Clinton got off scot-free. Why? She was their favorite candidate. Her investigation was rigged from the get-go, the fix was in, even Page and Strzok admit it was run and rigged by Obama's DOJ and Loretta Lynch. What did she know? When did she know it? By the way, what did Obama know and when did he know it? Look at your screen. Watch it. We will roll it throughout the show. She got away with things that no other American would ever get away with. She mishandled top-secret intelligence, she violated clearly the Espionage Act with her private server, she obstructed justice by destroying 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing her hard drive with Bleach Bit, and having an aide destroying her phones and her BlackBerrys with hammers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This case must be reopened if we want equal justice to be served in this country. No American citizen, nobody would get away with any of these crimes that were clearly committed, the biggest slam-dunk case of obstruction I've ever seen in my life. Comey, too, he must be investigated for his handling of this rigged investigation. If he exonerated Clinton for political purposes, clearly that would be a felony. If he lied under oath, that is a felony. He needs to be investigated for knowingly, did he commit a fraud on the FISA court? It appears like he might have. Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, must also be investigated for her political interference in the Clinton investigation. Strzok and Page said she made every decision and they knew they would never go after Clinton. And don't forget about the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton, just the beginning. Now, during the very same month, Clinton exonerated, Comey's FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign, using op research from Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty dossier with paid lies, put together by a foreign national, Christopher Steele. If Clinton knowingly paid the foreign national for the anti-Trump dossier, by the way, that's a crime and a felony. Of course, we now know that the dossier was never verified and unverifiable because of Steele doesn't stand by his own dossier. And that means, well, didn't that stop the dossier somehow from ever being used before a FISA court as the bulk of evidence to obtain a warrant on an American citizen, to deny them his rights, his constitutional rights, and also dig down deep, right inside the heart of an opposition party candidate? Look at your screen again. Comey, McCabe, Yates, Rosenstein, all signed up on the FISA request, all must be investigated for committing fraud before a court. They must all be held accountable for their egregious, alleged crimes. It must be investigated. Comey also likely committed the serious crime when he intentionally leaked FBI memos about his conversations with the president. Why? To spark the special counsel investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's not all. When it comes to federal abuse of power, McCabe, Strzok, Page, all forced to resign in shame, 25 in all demoted, or resigned, or fired. All right. We have a lot more to get to, this is only the beginning. Joining us now, Gregg Jarrett, the title of your book says it all, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" Also, we are joined by Professor Alan Dershowitz, and also joining us, investigative reporter Sara Carter.

Here with reaction, Media Reporter for The Hill and radio talk show host on WOR, my affiliate great station in New York City, Joe Concha; and of course, journalist, former 60 Minutes Correspondent, Lara Logan, is with us. Thank you, both. Lara, we'll begin with you. Look at their reaction, it's interesting. I think people get it. I think Democrats don't get it. We'll see more overreach, more investigations, and of course, more socialism, which would destroy the country. Your reaction to all of this. LARA LOGAN, FORMER 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT: My first reaction, Sean, is that as a journalist, I mean, speculation is not what I do. Right? I prefer to focus on what I do know, and I'm always very conscious of what I don't know. And I want to give you like just a simple example. In some of the coverage that I think demonstrates where the media is culpable - for example, do you remember what all the headlines in the media frenzy around President Trump supposedly leaking classified information to the Russians at a meeting in the White House? Right? Except that no reporter actually appeared to look at what the law says about classified information and the President of the United States, not just this President, but every single President. The Commander-in-Chief under U.S. law is the only single individual who is active speaking about something is an active declassification. So you talk to anyone in the intelligence community who knows the law or anyone at all who knows the laws on classified information. They will tell you it's not possible for the President to leak. But that was used by the media and right across the spectrum. Every reputable newspaper and outlet in this country was hot and heavy on the President leaking classified information to the Russians as further evidence that he was somehow some kind of traitor and Russian agent. And to me, the most basic journalism, it only takes a couple minutes, to look online and see what the law actually says about this, and do some honest reporting. And I think for that, it's a dereliction of our duty as reporters.",

In terms of Mueller, in terms of that investigation with the Special Counsel, they hardly, by all accounts, leaked anything. So think about it. The pushback I saw today was, well, we had to pursue the investigation, we had to pursue the facts. But around collusion, if the Special Counsel isn't leaking, therefore this only leads to rampant, reckless speculation by people from sources that were providing information to them that was either bad or nefarious, and they wanted to believe what they were being fed.

And the entire media has egg on their face. And what are they doing now? They're not apologizing, they're not backtracking, they're not saying, \"Gosh, our facts were wrong.\" Instead, they're attacking. We're seeing every Democrat pivot to say, \"Oh, no, no, no.

Because they want the Democrat to win, they wanted Beto to beat me. Now that Beto is running against Bernie and against all the other leftists, now Reuters will report it. And it's - the media is in bed with the far left wing of the Democratic Party. But I'll tell you, this also reveals - I mean, you're talking about Prime Minister Netanyahu, who I know well and consider a friend, and Churchillian is exactly the right adjective for him. One of the things this reveals - listen, Beto is trying to appeal to the extreme left and the Democratic Party. And one of the ways you do that is by launching anti-Israel attacks. I was at the AIPAC conference this week. Not a single Democratic Presidential candidate came to the conference. And we saw just a couple of weeks ago, the House of Representatives couldn't pass a simple bill condemning anti-semitism. Well, I'll tell you, Sean, I've introduced a resolution in the Senate condemning anti-semitism. I think we need to take it up, and I think we need to put every senator on record. I hope the Democrats are willing to condemn anti-semitism, the kind of comments these freshman House members are making, things like \"it's all about the Benjamins,\" which is nothing but an anti-semitic trope. I also have legislation to formally recognize as a matter of statute the Golan Heights as part of Israel. This weekend, the President announced that he's going to do that. I've been urging him in the administration to do that for months. That is a tremendous victory for Israel and America.

      "utterance": "Great show. I saw your friend was in the news again tonight. A special Tucker headline, friend of yours. All right. Good show. Thank you. All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Buckle up, we have a lot of work to get going on and get started on. The Mueller witch hunt is over. Obamacare was just dealt a serious blow. Democrats are running scared from their Green New Deal of insanity. The wall in our southern border, guess what? I just got 57 miles longer, and the president wins again. Are you sick of winning? And the economy is booming. And this is been a major week for the country, one we will never forget. We are going to cover it all, and we will begin the process tonight of holding people responsible that were involved in the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal, in our history. Those that committed crimes that need to be investigated, the people who rigged an investigation, rigged a primary, tried to rig a general election. In other words, those people who used Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies from a foreign source with funneled money, leaked to influence you, the American people, head of that vote in 2016. Russian lies, fraud perpetrated on FISA courts, citizens denied basic fundamental constitutional rights, spying, infiltrating an opposition party in a presidential campaign, using Russian lies that Hillary paid for to bludgeon and attempt to remove a duly elected president. People that we entrust the most power to, they thought they knew better than you, then we, the American people. Tonight, we begin the process -- it is a process -- of getting the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and holding all of these people accountable for their actions. If we do not do it, it will happen again. And, plus, almost an unbelievable news development out of Chicago tonight, a miscarriage of justice has just taken place after some major, backroom, Chicago wheeling and dealing, alleged hate crime faker Jussie Smollett -- well, completely let off the hook for a mere $10,000. Now, the corruption in Chicago is a national disgrace. We are going to have an important mini monologue coming up on that. And the ramifications, oh, of the Covington kids, and the Smollett case, and how it is all intertwined in the psychotic, hate-rage of Donald Trump. But first, this is a new day for the country. President Trump was totally and completely cleared of all the Russian collusion lies and all the other fabricated allegations against him. No collusion, no obstruction of justice. The long-standing two-plus-year narrative of the media mob and the Democrats, it was nothing more than a hoax. It was contrived and built off irrational hate and in this psychotic rage perpetrated by those who first wanted to ever prevent Trump from becoming president but had an insurance policy to destroy his presidency in any event that he wins. At any cost, even if the heart and soul of this country was ripped apart in the process, and our Constitution. For years, you, the American people, you have been deliberately lied to. You have been deceived on a spectacular and frankly historic level. But this process of holding people accountable from the deep state to the media, to their friends in the Democratic Party, we will name every name, we will demand justice. We will call out every single solitary liar, con artist, who actively promoted a hoax, conspiracy theories, many for personal and political gain only, for power. This is not part of our mission going forward. Tonight, we start with the chief conspiracy theorist of all of them, starting at the top. NBC News, Tom Brokaw, are you proud of your network tonight? Rachel Maddow, the face of MSNBC, supposedly a news channel. Yesterday, prominently featured on the cover of \"The New York Post,\" along with the title \"Mueller madness: Who got it the most wrong?\" Well, to actually put up brackets of the media's numerous collusion conspiracy theorist. As you can see, oh, yes, she is the number 1 seed. By the way, you can see my filled out bracket on hannity.com. And you better believe she has earned that position. Night after night, never ending lies, one bizarre conspiracy theory after another. And she has been rewarded for being the number one liar, conspiracy theorist in America. Nobody ever has challenged her or vetted her or questioned her as to the depths and length she has sunk in this process, breathlessly suggesting that the Kremlin and Putin are controlling the White House, that Donald Trump is a Russian puppet, and Vladimir Putin is pulling all the strings in our very own federal government. Watch with your own eyes and see if you believe this."

      "utterance": "Maybe he has not really under audit. Like all of those little things might be true, OK, that would be interesting to know. I don't know that I would change the world that much, but what would change the world is if, you know, Russia was interfering in the election, and they weren't doing it on their own, and he was in on it. After all of the worry, we are actually about to find out if Russia maybe has something on the new president? We are about to find out if the new president of our country is going to do what Russia wants, once he is commander-in-chief of the U.S. military. We haven't ever had to reckon with the possibility that someone has ascended to the presidency of the United States to serve the interests of another country rather than our own. What's the corrective to that? How do you remedy that? These are no longer hypothetical questions. This is where we are. He received the order of friendship from Vladimir Putin personally, the highest civilian award that Russia gives to non-Russian citizens. Somehow, Rex Tillerson ended up as secretary of state under Donald Trump, who he had never met. Mueller is proceeding without being stymied, and he is proceeding at this kind of a pace, rolling out the stuff right now, everything is aiming right at the president personally and that's not to be very unsettling. The legal jeopardy here not only enters the president's immediate family, it also enters the White House."

      "speaker": "My question to viewers",
      "utterance": "how does it feel to be lied to day after day, hour after hour? Have you had enough? Do you really see what has gone on here? You know, have they backed up anything with evidence and proof, or has it just been speculation and rumors and innuendo and anonymous sources and reckless, nonstop speculation? This program, by the way, we welcome you with open arms. We have been right so many times, not because we have a crystal ball, this is Richard Jewell, this is Duke lacrosse, this is UVA, this is Cambridge police, this is also Trayvon and George Zimmerman, and Ferguson, and Baltimore, why are we right and they usually wrong? Why were they wrong on Smollett and the Covington kids? We don't rush to judgment. We believe in due process and the perception of innocence. Something they don't understand or seem to care about. But a much different story over there at NBC News. Despite Mueller's findings, Rachel Maddow still cannot let go that her collusion obsession, now claiming the attorney general of the United States is somehow complacent in another grand conspiracy to cover up obstruction of a crime that never took place. In spite of how much they really wanted it, for years, rather than retract, apologize, about the dishonest, reckless, irresponsible coverage, which clearly has destroyed her own credibility and the network's, they double town on stupid, more conspiracy theories, more lies. By the way, Andy Lack, Phil Griffin, are you proud of this? Really? You know, this is your brand, NBC News, complicit in lying to people for years. In fairness, NBC News did not act alone. And we got fake news CNN pushing the same Russia collusion hoax, every single minute of every hour of every day, for every month, for every year. Don Lemon among them, the walls are closing in on President Trump. CNN editor-at-large saying that Russia collusion was choking Trump's presidency. For two-plus-years, the collusion news network, except for the fact that they are actually not reporting any news, baseless speculation, hysteria, breathless reporting, all in an attempt to advance their political agenda and feed and insatiable hatred for all things Donald Trump. Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz claiming fake news CNN wouldn't even have him on the air because they didn't like his opinion. It was too fair. And yet despite being so wrong so often, there you got CNN fake news chief, the king of it all, Jeff Zucker, pretending, oh, I'm not embarrassed at all, telling \"The New York Times,\" oh, another line news network, we are not investigators, we're journalists. Our role is to report the facts as we know them, which is exactly what we did. It's pretty hard to seek facts when you are so blinded by hatred and rage. It's also nice to hear a rare moment of truth from Zucker. They don't actually investigate anything they report, they basically spread rumors, innuendo, maybe things they pick up on the Internet, Twitter, or maybe Facebook, or maybe Instagram, rumors to help their narrative, oh, like the Smollett case where the Covington kids. And today's narrative du jour, well, that's the Mueller report was totally clearing the president of any campaign collusion -- well, he doesn't actually do what I did, because in their fantasy world that they can't give up because then they would have to put aside their egos and their pride and admit, oh, guys like Sean Hannity were right and they were wrong. Instead, they just go on with a new one. And even though the attorney general stated clearly that Trump would not be charged with obstruction, Rod Rosenstein agrees with the analysis. A NewsBusters chronicles CNN fake news chanted what? A hundred twenty times, well, it doesn't exonerate -- that's what they tell their audience. Take a look, this is a 24-hour period."

His words carry tremendous weight. Remember, he accused the president of treason again and again, using that position and power to trash the president of the United States on the world stage, even suggesting again and again, treason, reporting only two weeks ago, Mueller would be handing down more indictments before his investigation concluded.

Its collusion in plain sight. Donald Trump at the end of July openly called the Russian intelligence to find Hillary Clinton's emails. Certainly his tweets do not seem like they're coming from a person of innocence and confidence. I don't think Robert Mueller wants to have the dramatic flair of the Ides of March when he is going to be delivering what I think will be his indictment, final indictments, as well as the report he gives the attorney general.

He is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. I think there is a question in terms of those who are on Mr. Trump's national security team, whether they can continue to serve in good conscience, an individual who basically betrays his nation. I called his behavior treasonous, which is to betray one's trust and to aid and abet the enemy, and I stand very much by that claim."

Brennan now said he had bad information -- you think? No, he lied. And tonight, it's to hold Brennan, Clapper, and all these others accountable, not just for the blatant lies. Let's forget about -- not forget about the major crimes they may have committed. Many, I think, did. During their time, high ranking deep state actors abusing the power we gave to them, which brings us back to how did this all start? How did we get to this point? Who must face the consequences for their illicit action surrounding the 2016 election? We don't fix it, it will happen again. July 15th, 2015, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Hillary, mishandling top secret, classified information. Despite Comey citing overwhelming evidence of criminal negligence and obstruction of justice, Clinton got off scot-free. Why? She was their favorite candidate. Her investigation was rigged from the get-go, the fix was in, even Page and Strzok admit it was run and rigged by Obama's DOJ and Loretta Lynch. What did she know? When did she know it? By the way, what did Obama know and when did he know it? Look at your screen. Watch it. We will roll it throughout the show. She got away with things that no other American would ever get away with. She mishandled top-secret intelligence, she violated clearly the Espionage Act with her private server, she obstructed justice by destroying 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing her hard drive with Bleach Bit, and having an aide destroying her phones and her BlackBerrys with hammers. This case must be reopened if we want equal justice to be served in this country. No American citizen, nobody would get away with any of these crimes that were clearly committed, the biggest slam-dunk case of obstruction I've ever seen in my life. Comey, too, he must be investigated for his handling of this rigged investigation. If he exonerated Clinton for political purposes, clearly that would be a felony. If he lied under oath, that is a felony. He needs to be investigated for knowingly, did he commit a fraud on the FISA court? It appears like he might have. Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, must also be investigated for her political interference in the Clinton investigation. Strzok and Page said she made every decision and they knew they would never go after Clinton. And don't forget about the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton, just the beginning. Now, during the very same month, Clinton exonerated, Comey's FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign, using op research from Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty dossier with paid lies, put together by a foreign national, Christopher Steele. If Clinton knowingly paid the foreign national for the anti-Trump dossier, by the way, that's a crime and a felony. Of course, we now know that the dossier was never verified and unverifiable because of Steele doesn't stand by his own dossier. And that means, well, didn't that stop the dossier somehow from ever being used before a FISA court as the bulk of evidence to obtain a warrant on an American citizen, to deny them his rights, his constitutional rights, and also dig down deep, right inside the heart of an opposition party candidate? Look at your screen again. Comey, McCabe, Yates, Rosenstein, all signed up on the FISA request, all must be investigated for committing fraud before a court. They must all be held accountable for their egregious, alleged crimes. It must be investigated. Comey also likely committed the serious crime when he intentionally leaked FBI memos about his conversations with the president. Why? To spark the special counsel investigation. And that's not all. When it comes to federal abuse of power, McCabe, Strzok, Page, all forced to resign in shame, 25 in all demoted, or resigned, or fired. All right. We have a lot more to get to, this is only the beginning. Joining us now, Gregg Jarrett, the title of your book says it all, \"The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump.\" Also, we are joined by Professor Alan Dershowitz, and also joining us, investigative reporter Sara Carter.

Here with reaction, Media Reporter for The Hill and radio talk show host on WOR, my affiliate great station in New York City, Joe Concha; and of course, journalist, former 60 Minutes Correspondent, Lara Logan, is with us. Thank you, both. Lara, we'll begin with you. Look at their reaction, it's interesting. I think people get it. I think Democrats don't get it. We'll see more overreach, more investigations, and of course, more socialism, which would destroy the country. Your reaction to all of this. LARA LOGAN, FORMER 60 MINUTES CORRESPONDENT: My first reaction, Sean, is that as a journalist, I mean, speculation is not what I do. Right? I prefer to focus on what I do know, and I'm always very conscious of what I don't know. And I want to give you like just a simple example. In some of the coverage that I think demonstrates where the media is culpable - for example, do you remember what all the headlines in the media frenzy around President Trump supposedly leaking classified information to the Russians at a meeting in the White House? Right? Except that no reporter actually appeared to look at what the law says about classified information and the President of the United States, not just this President, but every single President. The Commander-in-Chief under U.S. law is the only single individual who is active speaking about something is an active declassification. So you talk to anyone in the intelligence community who knows the law or anyone at all who knows the laws on classified information. They will tell you it's not possible for the President to leak. But that was used by the media and right across the spectrum. Every reputable newspaper and outlet in this country was hot and heavy on the President leaking classified information to the Russians as further evidence that he was somehow some kind of traitor and Russian agent. And to me, the most basic journalism, it only takes a couple minutes, to look online and see what the law actually says about this, and do some honest reporting. And I think for that, it's a dereliction of our duty as reporters."

But last night, Monday night, the fact that you more than quadrupled your competition on CNN, Tucker Carlson as well, and write down the line. And the fact that you are getting more than 4 million viewers and CNN couldn't even break 915,000. I think maybe that may be a preview of things to come that they've been promising - not all, but many people on those networks, whether it be CNN or MSNBC, have been promising a certain outcome or at least strongly hinting towards it, speculating about it, which does nothing for the eyes and minds by the way, for two years--"

And that's why maybe some people were - more people than usual were tuning out last night. But let's think about this for a second. In terms of Mueller, in terms of that investigation with the Special Counsel, they hardly, by all accounts, leaked anything. So think about it. The pushback I saw today was, well, we had to pursue the investigation, we had to pursue the facts. But around collusion, if the Special Counsel isn't leaking, therefore this only leads to rampant, reckless speculation by people from sources that were providing information to them that was either bad or nefarious, and they wanted to believe what they were being fed. Because if there were no facts out there around collusion because of no leaking, that's the only thing that could have happened. Bad speculation that led to all this mistrust that we're going to be seeing moving forward."

We've had now two years of this special prosecutor investigation. And during the entire time, virtually every Democrat and all the media has been breathlessly covering every minute of it, insisting collusion, collusion, collusion, collusion. Well, we now have the report from the Special Counsel. The Special Counsel concluded there was no evidence, zero evidence of collusion. That's a big deal. Not only that, but we also now know that both the Attorney General, Bill Barr, and the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, concluded that none of the evidence supports charges of obstruction for justice - obstruction of justice, which means everything the Democrats and media have been talking about for two years was lacking in a factual basis. And the entire media has egg on their face. And what are they doing now? They're not apologizing, they're not backtracking, they're not saying, \"Gosh, our facts were wrong.\" Instead, they're attacking. We're seeing every Democrat pivot to say, \"Oh, no, no, no. Never mind about collusion, never mind about crimes or evidence.\" And mark my words, Sean, the House Democrats are going to impeach the President anyway, not because of any evidence, not because of any crimes, but because of the fact that he is Donald Trump and they hate Donald Trump.

The reporter interviewed Beto on the record, and he confirmed it, but then they cut a deal and said, OK, we won't report on it until after the 2018 election. Why? Because they want the Democrat to win, they wanted Beto to beat me. Now that Beto is running against Bernie and against all the other leftists, now Reuters will report it. And it's - the media is in bed with the far left wing of the Democratic Party. But I'll tell you, this also reveals - I mean, you're talking about Prime Minister Netanyahu, who I know well and consider a friend, and Churchillian is exactly the right adjective for him. One of the things this reveals - listen, Beto is trying to appeal to the extreme left and the Democratic Party. And one of the ways you do that is by launching anti-Israel attacks. I was at the AIPAC conference this week. Not a single Democratic Presidential candidate came to the conference. And we saw just a couple of weeks ago, the House of Representatives couldn't pass a simple bill condemning anti-semitism. Well, I'll tell you, Sean, I've introduced a resolution in the Senate condemning anti-semitism. I think we need to take it up, and I think we need to put every senator on record. I hope the Democrats are willing to condemn anti-semitism, the kind of comments these freshman House members are making, things like \"it's all about the Benjamins,\" which is nothing but an anti-semitic trope. I also have legislation to formally recognize as a matter of statute the Golan Heights as part of Israel. This weekend, the President announced that he's going to do that. I've been urging him in the administration to do that for months. That is a tremendous victory for Israel and America. But we need to take up and pass my legislation to put in federal law that the Golan Heights is part of the nation of Israel."
