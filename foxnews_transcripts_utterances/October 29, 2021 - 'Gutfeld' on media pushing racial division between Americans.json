And then it turns out it's not your belly button, or anyone else's. The only thing that's not racist are actual racist. First, let's talk docents. Do you know what a docent is? I had no idea until now. A docent, however, is now racist. For it's the term that describes volunteer guides at museums. They're usually older white ladies who walk around telling you not to touch the nude sculptures. Like, how was I supposed to know? I mean, why go to the market? If you can't squeeze the fruit? Am I right Tyrus? Fruits not very big either. Some of these docents are actual donors to the museum. And I bet they're typical liberals, just because you don't see many Dale Earnhardt shirts at the museum of national history. But over at The Art Institute of Chicago, more than 100 docents were fired because they were not sufficiently diverse. Although, in Chicago, diversity means getting the right mix of people who've been shot, and people who haven't. Volunteers were fired because they were too white. And that's got to hurt being fired as a volunteer. You can't even collect unemployment in your face white privilege, but I'm all for it. I can't tell you how many times I thought, you know, I need a museum tour guide who looks just like me. I mean, I really feel marginalized. Where are they? It's a struggle for me. So, here is another example in which bozos adopt the rhetoric of inclusion to exclude others. I mean, these are experienced people who donated time and money to educate the public, and they're going to be hard to replace. And why? Let's be honest, who does all the volunteering? I'll give you a hint. You won't find them at a Jay Z concert or at a NASCAR race? No, it's mostly upper middle class, White women named Melinda and Dorothy who have -- who have time on their hands since Harry and Leo passed away years ago. Picture Janet Yellen, but with a woman's haircut. Men only volunteer when there's a gun to their head, probably because they held a gun to someone's head. Meaning, it's community service. And I tell you, picking up trash along a highway is no way to spend five Saturdays. I never should have murdered that weatherman. But if you tell me to bring an umbrella and it's doesn't rain, there is a price to be paid. So, diversity quotas end up harming those it's supposed to help. It's adopted the rhetoric of equity in exchange for competence. It's about making yourself feel better instead of making things better. It's like scratching a rash instead of applying the ointment. God I hope it's just a rash. As The Wall Street Journal writes, \"civic institutions have always relied on the volunteer work of women with enough public spirit to donate their time and money. And we'll miss them when they're gone.\" So, who's going to replace these women? Kat?",

I guess we'll find out when Joe Biden gets invited to their next funeral. Shout out to Robert Byrd. But David Duke must be pissed. He spent his life trying to be the face of white racism, and Condoleezza comes along to steal his thunder. So, why are black stealing the jobs of white bigots? Maybe this could be progress. I mean, if our white racists are so hard to find that we must recruit colorblind black leaders, how awesome is that? We killed racism just by confusing it to death.

And you hear nothing about this because the left can't deal with it. It's a real cultural shift, but they don't like it one bit. But look, a black guy beats a white woman with a song about a terrible old white president. When will he be called a white supremacist for that? Because over at the fake news sports site, Deadspin, they called Kyrie Irving and Dave Chappelle black pawns on a white chessboard. And why? Because they're black and share similar thoughts as whites. I know individual thought transcending identity groups, it's crazy. But Deadspin believes people of one color must think the same, which I think is racist. Fact is identity politics is now segregating not just people, but ideas, skills, and talents, which always ends in bad ideas, lack of skill and zero talent. I think that's the new slogan for CNN. But if you go to a museum, you got to ignore a white docent, even if they're good at it. If you're Condoleezza Rice, you best hold an opinion that other blacks have, especially famous black intellectuals like Joy Behar. Of course, thinking for yourself like Irving isn't really thinking through yourself if some d-bag at Deadspin thinks you sound white. And the same goes for Chappelle. Sure, he was ripping on whites and that was fine. But once he made fun of trans, he's not white himself. I tell you, you need a scorecard to keep up with whose racist and who is it? Maybe it's best to say that everything is racist. Finally, something we can all take part in.",

In return, they tell you what to do in your free time. Their big concern is some costumes can cause trauma. I get that. One time I saw a guy who came to my party is Debra Messing and I threw up. Actually, it turned out it was her. Of course, Michigan State's nickname is The Spartans, which could traumatize veterans of the Peloponnesian War. Anyway, the e-mail linked to an article titled costume selection matters, which claims \"misrepresentation and acts to dehumanize others have long been a way for certain groups to exercise racial superiority. Costumes can elicit trauma if they poke fun at the experience of historical harm, bigotry or displacement.\" School provides a list of questions to determine if a costume is OK to wear. What does my wearing of the costume convey? Does it challenge or misrepresent my value system? Might perpetuate harm or violence that a group has experienced? Does this costume reference a certain cultural identity? And if so, is it mine to claim? Well, that's a lot of questions. I hope I can still go as a slutty nurse. I fill it out nicely.

      "utterance": "That's right, everything is racist. Food, jokes, vaccines, pigeons. That weird feeling you get when you insert your finger into your belly button. And then it turns out it's not your belly button, or anyone else's. The only thing that's not racist are actual racist. First, let's talk docents. Do you know what a docent is? I had no idea until now. A docent, however, is now racist. For it's the term that describes volunteer guides at museums. They're usually older white ladies who walk around telling you not to touch the nude sculptures. Like, how was I supposed to know? I mean, why go to the market? If you can't squeeze the fruit? Am I right Tyrus? Fruits not very big either. Some of these docents are actual donors to the museum. And I bet they're typical liberals, just because you don't see many Dale Earnhardt shirts at the museum of national history. But over at The Art Institute of Chicago, more than 100 docents were fired because they were not sufficiently diverse. Although, in Chicago, diversity means getting the right mix of people who've been shot, and people who haven't. Volunteers were fired because they were too white. And that's got to hurt being fired as a volunteer. You can't even collect unemployment in your face white privilege, but I'm all for it. I can't tell you how many times I thought, you know, I need a museum tour guide who looks just like me. I mean, I really feel marginalized. Where are they? It's a struggle for me. So, here is another example in which bozos adopt the rhetoric of inclusion to exclude others. I mean, these are experienced people who donated time and money to educate the public, and they're going to be hard to replace. And why? Let's be honest, who does all the volunteering? I'll give you a hint. You won't find them at a Jay Z concert or at a NASCAR race? No, it's mostly upper middle class, White women named Melinda and Dorothy who have -- who have time on their hands since Harry and Leo passed away years ago. Picture Janet Yellen, but with a woman's haircut. Men only volunteer when there's a gun to their head, probably because they held a gun to someone's head. Meaning, it's community service. And I tell you, picking up trash along a highway is no way to spend five Saturdays. I never should have murdered that weatherman. But if you tell me to bring an umbrella and it's doesn't rain, there is a price to be paid. So, diversity quotas end up harming those it's supposed to help. It's adopted the rhetoric of equity in exchange for competence. It's about making yourself feel better instead of making things better. It's like scratching a rash instead of applying the ointment. God I hope it's just a rash. As The Wall Street Journal writes, \"civic institutions have always relied on the volunteer work of women with enough public spirit to donate their time and money. And we'll miss them when they're gone.\" So, who's going to replace these women? Kat?"

I guess we'll find out when Joe Biden gets invited to their next funeral. Shout out to Robert Byrd. But David Duke must be pissed. He spent his life trying to be the face of white racism, and Condoleezza comes along to steal his thunder. So, why are black stealing the jobs of white bigots? Maybe this could be progress. I mean, if our white racists are so hard to find that we must recruit colorblind black leaders, how awesome is that? We killed racism just by confusing it to death.

And you hear nothing about this because the left can't deal with it. It's a real cultural shift, but they don't like it one bit. But look, a black guy beats a white woman with a song about a terrible old white president. When will he be called a white supremacist for that? Because over at the fake news sports site, Deadspin, they called Kyrie Irving and Dave Chappelle black pawns on a white chessboard. And why? Because they're black and share similar thoughts as whites. I know individual thought transcending identity groups, it's crazy. But Deadspin believes people of one color must think the same, which I think is racist. Fact is identity politics is now segregating not just people, but ideas, skills, and talents, which always ends in bad ideas, lack of skill and zero talent. I think that's the new slogan for CNN. But if you go to a museum, you got to ignore a white docent, even if they're good at it. If you're Condoleezza Rice, you best hold an opinion that other blacks have, especially famous black intellectuals like Joy Behar. Of course, thinking for yourself like Irving isn't really thinking through yourself if some d-bag at Deadspin thinks you sound white. And the same goes for Chappelle. Sure, he was ripping on whites and that was fine. But once he made fun of trans, he's not white himself. I tell you, you need a scorecard to keep up with whose racist and who is it? Maybe it's best to say that everything is racist. Finally, something we can all take part in."

In return, they tell you what to do in your free time. Their big concern is some costumes can cause trauma. I get that. One time I saw a guy who came to my party is Debra Messing and I threw up. Actually, it turned out it was her. Of course, Michigan State's nickname is The Spartans, which could traumatize veterans of the Peloponnesian War. Anyway, the e-mail linked to an article titled costume selection matters, which claims \"misrepresentation and acts to dehumanize others have long been a way for certain groups to exercise racial superiority. Costumes can elicit trauma if they poke fun at the experience of historical harm, bigotry or displacement.\" School provides a list of questions to determine if a costume is OK to wear. What does my wearing of the costume convey? Does it challenge or misrepresent my value system? Might perpetuate harm or violence that a group has experienced? Does this costume reference a certain cultural identity? And if so, is it mine to claim? Well, that's a lot of questions. I hope I can still go as a slutty nurse. I fill it out nicely.

So, you're saying for dollar gas helps the poor. That makes as much sense as China being on the U.N. Human Rights Council. So, we fund the U.N., the U.N. makes videos telling us how to spend our money. So, we're spending our own money telling us how to spend our own money, which means it's time for the \"GUT-CHECK FACT CHECK.\" Yes, this is new. All right, first, dinosaurs can't talk. I mean, we don't have proof that they can't talk, but it's not like they left behind any audible books. And when the dinosaurs have been better off if they were looking for asteroids? That's what did (INAUDIBLE), not a Chrysler. We didn't kill them. We just use them for fuel after they're dead. Which gets to the real problem. You have to question the objectivity of a video when the producers are asking a dinosaur his opinion on fossil fuels. He's a fossil. He's the fuel, of course, he's going to be upset. That's like asking an illegal immigrant about the wall. So, I hereby give the video three Pinocchio intestines."
