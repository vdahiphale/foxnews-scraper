This is a much bigger issue than their cover-ups, payoffs and excuses. The media is supposed to be a watchdog for abuses of power.\" NBC Universal declined to comment to us today and referred us instead to a statement from June 2018 that said, quote, \"When MSNBC pursues any investigative story, our mission is always to be as thorough as we can to scrutinize sources and corroborate information before we report. Anything else falls short of our journalistic standards.\" Joy Reid also released a statement at that same time saying Abrams insisted that her allegations against both Simmons and Calloway be included in the piece and that NBC was unable to confirm significant aspects of claims against one of the men so therefore could not report on either. And Reid added, quote, \"Investigative reports like these take time and not surprisingly sometimes journalists get frustrated as well. I inappropriately shared that frustration privately with Sil Lai. I completely respect MSNBC's standards and practices.\" Another former NBC employee, producer Rich McHugh who work with Ronan Farrow has a very different view.",

Now, when you look at Taylor's testimony from yesterday and this is one of the - - you know, sort of more prominent pieces of it that has gotten a lot of attention. He says, \"Ambassador Sondland said, everything dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.\" And that he wanted President Zelensky in a public box to make a public statement about ordering such investigations.

That narrative that we heard from Bill Taylor yesterday, or Ambassador Taylor, that narrative was not consistent with other testimony we heard from two other witnesses, at least, two other witnesses. And it was not consistent with other cross-examination done by John Ratcliffe and others. And so, when we start to see those inconsistencies, we think that that's the important thing that for a full picture on an impeachment process that not only the American people.

And so, we want to hear from them -- it's in America, you should be able to face your accuser.

We -- this has never happened to someone who is in their first term and headed towards election. And that that's clearly unprecedented. But I want to know if these polls concern you, the new poll today from Quinnipiac shows 55 percent of those polled approve of the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. I should also point out this other poll from New York Times Siena that we showed last night, which is, you know, at this point, it's a little bit of an outlier. But I think, it's interesting because it's a battleground state poll. And it shows, 53 percent oppose impeachment and removal of the president. But you know, do you think you're losing the public argument on this because the president called for folks to get a lot tougher on your side?"

Number one, I assume that this means that both Erdogan and Putin are going to be responsible for ISIS and the ISIS prisoners in the territory that we're ceding to them. Number two, I worry about the Kurds. America made a commitment to our Kurds -- to our friend, the Kurds. You know people with good intentions make promises, people with character keep them. Now, the Kurds are our allies. America has always had a foreign policy with a serious moral component. And value number one is that friends don't let friends get massacred.

And I'm well aware that Turkey is a member of NATO. But the Kurds, we would not have defeated ISIS without the Kurds. And besides that, we made a commitment. If we don't keep our commitment to the Kurds, it would be morally wrong, but I wonder what Saudi Arabia and Israel and Jordan and other countries throughout the world to which we've made commitments are going to thank if we break our commitment to the Kurds."

Obviously, ISIS is a huge threat, but ISIS has been dealt with for the most part. Could they rise again? Yes, they could. And in that instance, we're going to have to deal with them. But I think people look and say why are we protecting that border? You know, some people say you know, that they'd like to see that same kind of commitment on our own border in terms of securing borders and they've had it.

And we keep -- we keep one country, Iran and others, from dominating the Middle East by playing off and balancing the three major powers in the Middle East against each other, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. And we're careful not to let any one of them get the upper hand because if they do get the upper hand we're going to have war in the Middle East. You know why we're going to have more war in the Middle East? Because Israel is going to start it. They're not going to sit there if Iran gets the upper hand and allow Iran to destroy them.

I would remind you that while President Clinton was not removed by the United States Senate, he was found guilty in a court of having lied under oath and lost his law license as a result of this. In retrospect, the Republicans probably would have been better off passing a censure motion much like it was done against Andrew Jackson and left it at that because it boomeranged on him in the 1998 midterms. And by 2000 -- by the 2000 election, the issue of impeachment for Bill Clinton was toxic, his favorabilities were up in the 60s. And you'll remember that George W. Bush never talked about it.

This is a much bigger issue than their cover-ups, payoffs and excuses. The media is supposed to be a watchdog for abuses of power.\" NBC Universal declined to comment to us today and referred us instead to a statement from June 2018 that said, quote, \"When MSNBC pursues any investigative story, our mission is always to be as thorough as we can to scrutinize sources and corroborate information before we report. Anything else falls short of our journalistic standards.\" Joy Reid also released a statement at that same time saying Abrams insisted that her allegations against both Simmons and Calloway be included in the piece and that NBC was unable to confirm significant aspects of claims against one of the men so therefore could not report on either. And Reid added, quote, \"Investigative reports like these take time and not surprisingly sometimes journalists get frustrated as well. I inappropriately shared that frustration privately with Sil Lai.

According to the Hill, several sources say in Hillary land say that it is in her heart of hearts. Clinton would love nothing more than to take on President Trump again. The New York Times adding, \"Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win they would consider entering the primary.\" Here now for Wednesdays with Watters is Jesse Watters, co-host of The Five and host of Watters World.

She won the popular vote, she got a ton of money, she has a political should. But, Martha, on the flip side, she is still crooked, her husband got me toed. And if she gets back and Bernie is literally going to go crazy. She is going to steal another primary from crazy Bernie. He's going to have another heart attack. Poor guy.

And if you look at the field, Biden can't draw a crowd and he is cratering. I guess Liz Warren can draw a crowd, but only in Manhattan. Bernie can only do it in Brooklyn. They can't go to Ohio, Florida, the Midwest and get 10,000 people. They just can't. So, you are looking at them and you got to think someone has got to save these people."
