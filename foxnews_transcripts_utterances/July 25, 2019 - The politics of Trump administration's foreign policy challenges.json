Let's bring in our panel, Tom Rogan, commentary writer for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" OK, Tom, your take. We'll start with Iran, but anything from the interview. TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I thought it was quite interesting there that Secretary of State Pompeo in your interview wanted to be very clear about that red line idea of Americans being in danger and basically that that would be the precipice for military force. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I do think what's interesting, though with the Europeans, as much as they are saying it is separate to the United States, their budding naval plan, and with the Europeans it's always let's see it before believing it, I do think because of Boris Johnson entering office and a desire to consolidate the relationship with President Trump, also to show the Europeans on Brexit that he's a tough negotiator, the British will boost their naval presence there. The French I think will do that as well. So even if it's two separate things, the geographic division of force, if you will, will allow that to be somewhat effective. I do think it's the final point, the more moderate elements around Hassan Rouhani, as much as he made those IRGC comments, we are open to negotiating, the Revolutionary Guard, they're still on the escalating cusp.",

And I like that in both cases. I thought it was interesting when he was kind of pushing back against some of the criticism that they haven't been belligerent enough with Iran. They're trying to get these other countries to join with them in making sure that these naval passages are secured, and there are some of these countries that think we've been too belligerent.

I'd be more concerned about the fact that China and North Korea showed quite a bit of growth in trade this year than that. It is totally reasonable that when people are getting ready to go to the table, they will let off some steam here and try and posture. Still, diplomacy seems to be a good way to get to our eventual goal of denuclearization.",

It didn't just say kind of if they hit one of ours, we'll fight back, but actually took the proactive step of flagging vessels that weren't ours with U.S. flag. And that doesn't seem to be contemplated. There's something, as Tom said, something more multilateral in store.

I think it's because actually the Revolutionary Guards don't quite know what to do. The dangling back and forth about whether they escalate -- they've shot down a drone. They haven't shot at an American jet yet. And it was interesting in that interview as well, he talked about assassinations.

Let's bring in our panel, Tom Rogan, commentary writer for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" OK, Tom, your take. We'll start with Iran, but anything from the interview. TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I thought it was quite interesting there that Secretary of State Pompeo in your interview wanted to be very clear about that red line idea of Americans being in danger and basically that that would be the precipice for military force. I do think what's interesting, though with the Europeans, as much as they are saying it is separate to the United States, their budding naval plan, and with the Europeans it's always let's see it before believing it, I do think because of Boris Johnson entering office and a desire to consolidate the relationship with President Trump, also to show the Europeans on Brexit that he's a tough negotiator, the British will boost their naval presence there. The French I think will do that as well. So even if it's two separate things, the geographic division of force, if you will, will allow that to be somewhat effective. I do think it's the final point, the more moderate elements around Hassan Rouhani, as much as he made those IRGC comments, we are open to negotiating, the Revolutionary Guard, they're still on the escalating cusp."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I was struck by the characterization by the secretary that when it comes to Iran and North Korea, they understand, the administration does, that there's going to be some steam that blows off, and they fire some things, they do some things, and they still are anxious to get them to the table. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes. And I like that in both cases. I thought it was interesting when he was kind of pushing back against some of the criticism that they haven't been belligerent enough with Iran. They're trying to get these other countries to join with them in making sure that these naval passages are secured, and there are some of these countries that think we've been too belligerent. So understanding that tension is key. With North Korea, a lot of angst about them shooting off some missiles. I'd be more concerned about the fact that China and North Korea showed quite a bit of growth in trade this year than that. It is totally reasonable that when people are getting ready to go to the table, they will let off some steam here and try and posture. Still, diplomacy seems to be a good way to get to our eventual goal of denuclearization."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Chuck, your take? CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": It's an interesting contrast, if I understand him correctly, between their approach and the approach 30 odd years ago when we had the tanker war in the Persian Gulf, and the Reagan administration actually put American flags on Kuwaiti vessels. It didn't just say kind of if they hit one of ours, we'll fight back, but actually took the proactive step of flagging vessels that weren't ours with U.S. flag. And that doesn't seem to be contemplated. There's something, as Tom said, something more multilateral in store. And I think that is a good tip off that with the administration wants to do is avoid a blow up with Iran, even as they are not letting Iran off the hook."

      "speaker": "ROGAN",
      "utterance": "I think President Trump has somewhat pared back, although it was noticeable again in your interview, Secretary of State Pompeo talking about they need to behave like a normal nation, funding Hezbollah, et cetera. President Trump seems to be more focused on the idea of just a nuclear agreement. I think the reason why we have seen this calibration though, it's not simply that President Trump is very hesitant of getting into another war, or conflict, even though it would be limited. I think it's because actually the Revolutionary Guards don't quite know what to do. The dangling back and forth about whether they escalate -- they've shot down a drone. They haven't shot at an American jet yet. And it was interesting in that interview as well, he talked about assassinations. That's a keyword for the Europeans, because that's where a lot of these assassinations and plots, the French, trying to blow up a conference. So the Europeans are aware that, frankly, it is not in anyone's interest to have tankers been disrupted."

It's all the same thing, which is -- and so this idea that it's a difference between impeachment and accountability investigations I think is overwrought. I think they all will continue, continue because it's really the main thing that they have going for them into the 2020 election."

You can almost see the kind of body language at the press conference, there was kind of a sag in Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler's shoulders because clearly -- although it had produced a lot of affirmation by Mueller that the president had been up to no good, it produced no great televised moment, which is kind of what they were looking for to energize the whole thing. And frankly, I think you just look at the calendar. There are about to go away for a month. They come back in September, and then that's practically a year from November, and impeachment would take months. The logic of it, just of the time and the schedule is starting to disappear."
