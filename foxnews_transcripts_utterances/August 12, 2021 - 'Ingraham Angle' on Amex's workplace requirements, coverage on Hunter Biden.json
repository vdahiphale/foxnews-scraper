The left isn't doing any of this because they're worried about Governor DeSantis, or because there are too few people vaccinated. And they're not instilling fear because they're still Americans who have questions about the vaccinations. The truth is, they do this even if everyone was vaccinated. They would do it in states where they control every aspect of government. They would do it and they do much more, if there were no Republicans at all. Why? Because their agenda is based on fear. Sure. Fear of COVID, but fear of climate change, fear of capitalism, fear of standards, fear of hard work, fear of religion, fear of your fellow Americans, fear of our history. They want to terrify our kids, to train them to feel helpless and afraid, to teach them that the world is a very terrifying place, and only the experts and big government can protect them.

They got rid of Trump. And now they want get want to get rid of you and steal the joy that your children deserve. History is repeating itself again. This is always where socialism ultimately leads, to misery and control. The socialists will always give special treatment to their friends and their cronies. It's all just a protection racket in the end. But in this society, everyone else will eventually be put up against a wall. It turns out, the old Obama-Biden hope and change message was a lie.

One of the top experts in the world, in fact, Alistair Monroe said he didn't understand why this panic was going on in the U.S. and only the U.S. The RSV wave is pretty much global. We've seen a huge - we sort of skipped the RSV season in the winter and we're now getting hit by it full force.

More than half of those children have been hospitalized.\" Phil, again, we're not - we don't - we're not being told whether the kids are being admitted sick with RSV, which again, it seems like that's the case, because the transparency doesn't really feed the panic that I think, sadly, some in our society want to keep going.",

Look, one of the things we know about pediatric hospitalizations with COVID and we've had multiple studies that have found this now over and over in multiple countries, a lot of them are incidental, which is to say children are there for some other reason, they broke a leg, whatever it is, we now test everyone who goes in the hospitals. They happen to test positive, they were asymptomatic. It was not the reason they were there. But it goes on the medical record, and it goes into the statistics that everyone sees. Now, it's - you can look at that and studies after the fact and kind of separate it. But it's much, much harder when they're in there for a respiratory virus and they have a coinfection that's never going to be separated out in this study, because how could you determine which virus is the reason they're there. But for children under five, based on everything we know about the respective viruses, the pathogenicity in these coinfected cases is almost definitely from the RSV. And there was an AAP study last year finding that 50 percent of pediatric COVID hospitalizations had coinfections with other common viruses. And so, I think it's almost certain that the - a very large number of the hospitalizations that are now being reported are RSV coinfections. And in fact, Laura, they may not even be that, they may be COVID negative RSV infections, because a lot of these articles are written in, sort of, crafty ways to make it seem like the children's hospitals are overflowing with COVID.

So there's a lot to unpack there. But as usual, the top line doesn't tell the whole story on this. Phil, thank you for looking into this. We appreciate it. And speaking of damaging our kids, even after parents voiced their concern over the last two days, the Loudoun County Virginia School Board just announced moments ago, they will allow transgender students access to school facilities in groups, such as sports teams that match their gender identities. This all comes just days after the American Academy of Pediatrics affirmed its support for adolescents to undergo gender transition, and for children to take hormones that block puberty and then blocked any dissenting view from appearing at that annual conference. Here now is Walt Heyer. His grandmother dressed him has a girl starting at age four. He transitioned at age 42, but has since detransitioned writing a book Trans Life Survivors. Walt, your reaction to what the school board tonight in Northern Virginia, kind of, ground zero of these culture wars and the American Academy of Pediatrics are doing. WALT HEYER, \"TRANS LIFE SURVIVORS\" AUTHOR: Yes, this is insane. It's child abuse, and that the hormone blockers, the surgeries, all the things they're doing to these young children have consequences. And the consequences are they're going to be destroying these young people's lives. In fact, recently, I worked with a boy who - his parents helped him get hormone blockers when he was 15. They nurtured and encouraged him to all the way up till he was 18. They allowed him to have all these surgeries when he was 18, and, \"transition to female\". He contacted me when he was 19 years old. And he says, I feel like a Frankenstein monster. I want my life back. Walt, can you help me? I get these messages from people at sex change regret all the time, because the harmful effects, the consequences of what they're doing to these children is actually barbaric. We shouldn't be cutting off young girls' breast, we shouldn't be giving them hormone blockers that were never intended to be used for people to transition. This is absolutely insane. And I am just totally puzzled as to why more people aren't standing up and shouting out. There's a lot of parents now we're starting to get words out and stop this nonsense. People do not change genders. Hormones do not change you from a man to a woman. Surgery doesn't change you from a man to a woman. The only thing you can do is make yourself look like you changed.

Trump in the red states reopened the economy causing unemployment to plunge down to 6.3 percent in January when Trump left office. But under Biden, unemployment has only fallen 0.9 points. And before the pandemic, median household income, remember, it went up $5,000 during Trump's presidency, and unemployment was at historic lows. Joe, you may be fooling the rest of the press, but not THE ANGLE. Now, it's easy to understand why Biden has to resort to the shameless lies when you look at his latest poll numbers. For the first time, Biden's job approval rating has fallen to 50 percent on the RealClearPolitics average of polls. And his disapproval keeps climbing up, breaking through 45 percent this week. Here to analyze what this means is Tom Bevan, President and co-founder of RealClearPolitics. Tom, given today's inflation numbers, it appears that the runaway spending Joe Manchin said it's irresponsible, what we're seeing with the $3.5 trillion proposed agreed to in the Senate, the framework. How to Republicans capitalize on this for the midterms?",

Food, gas, that hit people - they see it in their pocketbooks on a daily basis. That's going to form the backbone and the basis for Republican attacks leading into the 2022 midterms. And it was interesting that Biden really tried to address those, as you mentioned, almost like he was speaking specifically to Joe Manchin, because Joe Manchin, obviously, released his statement saying he's concerned about inflation and putting another $3.5 trillion dollars in spending on tap is not the way to curb inflation.

The left isn't doing any of this because they're worried about Governor DeSantis, or because there are too few people vaccinated. And they're not instilling fear because they're still Americans who have questions about the vaccinations. The truth is, they do this even if everyone was vaccinated. They would do it in states where they control every aspect of government. They would do it and they do much more, if there were no Republicans at all. Why? Because their agenda is based on fear. Sure. Fear of COVID, but fear of climate change, fear of capitalism, fear of standards, fear of hard work, fear of religion, fear of your fellow Americans, fear of our history. They want to terrify our kids, to train them to feel helpless and afraid, to teach them that the world is a very terrifying place, and only the experts and big government can protect them.

We are the only country in the world that is in a panic over children and COVID right now to the extent that experts internationally are puzzled as to why this is happening in the U.S. when COVID has taken over every western country. One of the top experts in the world, in fact, Alistair Monroe said he didn't understand why this panic was going on in the U.S. and only the U.S. The RSV wave is pretty much global. We've seen a huge - we sort of skipped the RSV season in the winter and we're now getting hit by it full force. But the U.S. seems to be the only country where the fact that children's hospitals are full is being used as an excuse to scare people about COVID, instead of explaining that they're overwhelmingly full with RSV patients. So that dishonesty seems to be unique to the United States right now."

More than half of those children have been hospitalized.\" Phil, again, we're not - we don't - we're not being told whether the kids are being admitted sick with RSV, which again, it seems like that's the case, because the transparency doesn't really feed the panic that I think, sadly, some in our society want to keep going."

    {
      "speaker": "KERPEN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look, one of the things we know about pediatric hospitalizations with COVID and we've had multiple studies that have found this now over and over in multiple countries, a lot of them are incidental, which is to say children are there for some other reason, they broke a leg, whatever it is, we now test everyone who goes in the hospitals. They happen to test positive, they were asymptomatic. It was not the reason they were there. But it goes on the medical record, and it goes into the statistics that everyone sees. Now, it's - you can look at that and studies after the fact and kind of separate it. But it's much, much harder when they're in there for a respiratory virus and they have a coinfection that's never going to be separated out in this study, because how could you determine which virus is the reason they're there. But for children under five, based on everything we know about the respective viruses, the pathogenicity in these coinfected cases is almost definitely from the RSV. And there was an AAP study last year finding that 50 percent of pediatric COVID hospitalizations had coinfections with other common viruses. And so, I think it's almost certain that the - a very large number of the hospitalizations that are now being reported are RSV coinfections. And in fact, Laura, they may not even be that, they may be COVID negative RSV infections, because a lot of these articles are written in, sort of, crafty ways to make it seem like the children's hospitals are overflowing with COVID. But really they're overflowing with RSV."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and a lot of the pediatric specialists quoted and these many articles about RSV say that because the kids were kept out of the general population for the last 18 months in many cases, that also affected their immune systems, or immune responses, and that could have had the delaying effect of the RSV cases now flooding the hospitals. So there's a lot to unpack there. But as usual, the top line doesn't tell the whole story on this. Phil, thank you for looking into this. We appreciate it. And speaking of damaging our kids, even after parents voiced their concern over the last two days, the Loudoun County Virginia School Board just announced moments ago, they will allow transgender students access to school facilities in groups, such as sports teams that match their gender identities. This all comes just days after the American Academy of Pediatrics affirmed its support for adolescents to undergo gender transition, and for children to take hormones that block puberty and then blocked any dissenting view from appearing at that annual conference. Here now is Walt Heyer. His grandmother dressed him has a girl starting at age four. He transitioned at age 42, but has since detransitioned writing a book Trans Life Survivors. Walt, your reaction to what the school board tonight in Northern Virginia, kind of, ground zero of these culture wars and the American Academy of Pediatrics are doing. WALT HEYER, \"TRANS LIFE SURVIVORS\" AUTHOR: Yes, this is insane. It's child abuse, and that the hormone blockers, the surgeries, all the things they're doing to these young children have consequences. And the consequences are they're going to be destroying these young people's lives. In fact, recently, I worked with a boy who - his parents helped him get hormone blockers when he was 15. They nurtured and encouraged him to all the way up till he was 18. They allowed him to have all these surgeries when he was 18, and, \"transition to female\". He contacted me when he was 19 years old. And he says, I feel like a Frankenstein monster. I want my life back. Walt, can you help me? I get these messages from people at sex change regret all the time, because the harmful effects, the consequences of what they're doing to these children is actually barbaric. We shouldn't be cutting off young girls' breast, we shouldn't be giving them hormone blockers that were never intended to be used for people to transition. This is absolutely insane. And I am just totally puzzled as to why more people aren't standing up and shouting out. There's a lot of parents now we're starting to get words out and stop this nonsense. People do not change genders. Hormones do not change you from a man to a woman. Surgery doesn't change you from a man to a woman. The only thing you can do is make yourself look like you changed. There are no such thing as people transitioning."

      "utterance": "OK. Here's the reality. Unemployment peaked at 14.8 percent in April of 2020. Economists thought it was going to stay high for a long time. But what happened? Trump in the red states reopened the economy causing unemployment to plunge down to 6.3 percent in January when Trump left office. But under Biden, unemployment has only fallen 0.9 points. And before the pandemic, median household income, remember, it went up $5,000 during Trump's presidency, and unemployment was at historic lows. Joe, you may be fooling the rest of the press, but not THE ANGLE. Now, it's easy to understand why Biden has to resort to the shameless lies when you look at his latest poll numbers. For the first time, Biden's job approval rating has fallen to 50 percent on the RealClearPolitics average of polls. And his disapproval keeps climbing up, breaking through 45 percent this week. Here to analyze what this means is Tom Bevan, President and co-founder of RealClearPolitics. Tom, given today's inflation numbers, it appears that the runaway spending Joe Manchin said it's irresponsible, what we're seeing with the $3.5 trillion proposed agreed to in the Senate, the framework. How to Republicans capitalize on this for the midterms?"

      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, REALCLEARPOLITICS CO-FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "Oh, well, Republicans are already mobilizing to use inflation as one of the main weapons and the Fox News poll that just came out earlier tonight shows that it is now among the top concerns along with the pandemic, but inflation and the rising prices that we see, you mentioned, particularly, the categories that are sort of those kitchen table issues, right. Food, gas, that hit people - they see it in their pocketbooks on a daily basis. That's going to form the backbone and the basis for Republican attacks leading into the 2022 midterms. And it was interesting that Biden really tried to address those, as you mentioned, almost like he was speaking specifically to Joe Manchin, because Joe Manchin, obviously, released his statement saying he's concerned about inflation and putting another $3.5 trillion dollars in spending on tap is not the way to curb inflation. It's a way to put more gas on the fire."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

That is - I mean, I wonder he went on to talk. And it also revealed other concerns. His job performance on the economy, 49 percent disapprove, 47 percent approve. More than anything else you've seen, Tom, in the polling, is that not significant, only seven months in, almost eight months into Biden's administration?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Right. Because economy is usually - always a top concern of voters. And it's an issue that motivates voters and sends them to the polls more so than any other issue. Inflation is going to be concerned. Another one that's on that list, Laura, that is becoming a problem for the Biden administration is crime. And to the extent that crime exists not just in the cities, but spills over and becomes an issue in the suburbs, which is a place where Republicans are looking to regain some of the ground that they lost last cycle. That could be a potent issue for the GOP as well."

He's down in the 30s, mid 30s on the issue and it's been a problem right from the beginning. So it will motivate Republicans in the midterms. And again, that's - when it comes to turnout, could be significant."

This was either sloppiness or a drug intoxication where he, in one case, two cases, maybe three cases, he allowed people from foreign governments to have access to most intimate exchanges, emails from his whole family, including vice president and now President Biden. I don't think we've ever had anything like that. And it's very ironic because the media is quiet, Laura, and this is a media that took two years to convince us of a nonexistent Russian collusion hoax. So we know they are interested in Russians, but they're not interested in this security leak. And finally, don't you think it's kind of strange that Hunter Biden is well beyond Billy Carter or Roger Clinton, and all of these email transmissions, he keeps complaining about that big guy, Mr. 10 Percent. Nobody appreciates what I've done. And so after all of these embarrassing things, he starts up his art phony scam, where with no talent he's trying to peddle $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 and $500,000 paintings to, quote-unquote, anonymous buyers. It's almost as if he is saying to his family, I'm going to keep on doing this because I was never appreciated for the sordid bag money work I had to do to subsidize these lavish lifestyles that you guys didn't earn on your salaries. And if you keep pressing me, I'm going to pull this whole temple down on top of us, because what else could explain this serial pattern of recklessness?"

Like the mystery of Hunter Biden's multiple laptops, no one questions this behavior, or even has any interest in showing it. The man is wandering around, he can't find the door, he can't find the path. But clearly the DNC understands what time it is. They are launching a new \"Build Back Better\" bus tour. It's hitting 10 states without Biden. Surrogates like Terry McAuliffe will give Democrats credit for the infrastructure bill and attack Republicans. This reminds me of the Stevie Nicks tour.
