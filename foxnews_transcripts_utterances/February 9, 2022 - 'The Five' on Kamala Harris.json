And less hypocrisy from the Democrats, can't stop breaking their own pandemic rules while demanding everybody else follow them. Stacey Abrams causing a huge uproar over this photo in a room full of young masked children. And after she got caught, Abrams deleted the tweet and then used Black History Month to deflect from the criticism. And the dishonesty doesn't end there. Squad member Jamaal Bowman the New York City Mayor Eric Adams both caught maskless after telling everybody to follow the rules and doubling down on mask mandates for schools. But New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy offering his party a breath of fresh air announcing his state will finally end its school mask mandate in a return to normalcy. Another states like Delaware and Connecticut are following suit but the White House is remaining defiance.",

If you take out all the -- if you put the context back in, it actually looks less bad. But miraculously it looks terrible without context. That's how it works. I loved how there was a guy named Don Winslow who condemned Rogan over this until they went into his novels and found out how many times. And they posted every time Don Winslow had used the n-word.

They may have started it and wanted to do this from the get-go saying let's set up a GoFundMe that ahead of time, we'll reach out to the truckers, and then we'll send them money here or there. I didn't see anyone doing this in any other platform or for any other group or organization that was questionable. Last week, we talked about Black Lives Matter. We talked about the fact that no one's in charge of $60 million and nobody dares touch that money. But now we've got money for the freedom convoyed that hard working people are giving to them -- how dare you? And I'll tell you what. There is no prosecution that will be too tough for these people because they don't deserve that money. They don't deserve access to business at this sort. They should be shut down.

You know, here, one of the things that the climate people always do is they block traffic, and it just makes everybody so mad. And so, there's a law of diminishing returns. But what I think happened here is the groundswell of support was so overwhelming that it's not like it's super organized that they wanted to shut down Ottawa and make people not be allowed to get to work or anything.

I don't think Stelter and Acosta give a damn about the n-word. They just want that scalp because CNN is dying. They are losing it. And they tried. They tried to bring Joe down and they couldn't do it. The thing is when you look at the Rogan montage, it looks bad but it's designed to look that way. If you take out all the -- if you put the context back in, it actually looks less bad. But miraculously it looks terrible without context. That's how it works. I loved how there was a guy named Don Winslow who condemned Rogan over this until they went into his novels and found out how many times. And they posted every time Don Winslow had used the n-word. I thought that was great. I've noticed that there aren't a lot of blacks carrying about this story. It's only white liberals and white leftists who want to bring down Rogan. I think maybe it's because blacks see that the word is being used as a tool. Not the word being offensive itself but the fact that this is -- this is manufactured for a different mission than the rejection of the word. It's about going after somebody. Or else they would've included the context. Why didn't you include the context?"

So, we're made of flesh which means we make mistakes. I listened to him just now and I listened him before. And you know, I accept the fact that he believes it was wrong. He also believes it might have been a set up, and he thought it looked, he used the word, to say a powerful adjective, to say horrible. Now I'm also want to believe that cancel culture as I have said before has gone way too far. I encourage open, robust, argumentative as long as there is civil debates and conversations. And as long as there is no malice involved or in one's words, and you have to be willing if you're going to have that happen, some people may make mistakes and how they convey themselves. As long as you learn from it and you accept -- you are sincere in your apology and we had the situation last week with Whoopi Goldberg, I think she really learned that the Jewish people are a race. And you are not annihilating a race on Holocaust. We can say that well she should have known which she didn't. I think Joe Rogan, I don't think he'll use the n-word again on his podcast. I think it's important for him to understand why not. You don't excuse those kinds of things. You try to teach I thought he used teachable moment, which I thought was the right way to describe it.

So, I thought what came out of this that was most impactful for Democrats, Republicans the like in Congress.

This is a larger issue and I think sometimes politics creeps and everything. It's certainly creeping into this with both of the parties.

They have figured out a way to become completely -- well, 52 percent of their energy is -- comes from Russia and they didn't think that was going to be a problem? I thought today that when all off is there with the President basically saying, oh, yes, we're going to have a lot of wind and we're going to be completely fossil fuel-free by 2045. Like, just like such pipe dreams. In the meantime, you have people who are actually really worried about what could happen. And I think that this is a real wake-up call for America as well to think about our own energy independence and the policies that we are putting in place. It takes a long time for these companies to invest in order to go after more energy. And if you had this -- when you had the change in administration, that's when the first things that they signaled is that America wants to be like Germany when it comes to energy.

We've seen this already in investment when it comes to either the support of Israel or support of fossil fuel companies. And you start to see somebody like -- you know, what if some -- I'm not going to use -- I don't want to name one of the companies, but you can imagine like, this bank or this type of service decides actually, because you're a registered Republican, you're no -- you're no longer welcome here. Because that -- all of those platforms are supposed to be neutral. To what Greg was saying about the protests. You know, here, one of the things that the climate people always do is they block traffic, and it just makes everybody so mad. And so, there's a law of diminishing returns. But what I think happened here is the groundswell of support was so overwhelming that it's not like it's super organized that they wanted to shut down Ottawa and make people not be allowed to get to work or anything. It's just it got so big. And now you see there's one forming in the United States, and France, and Germany and probably elsewhere where these mandates remain."

In an amazing act of heroism, Corporal Annette Goodyear of the Northeast Police Department risked her life for a student crossing the street in Maryland. Just watch as she bravely pushes a young girl out of the way of a car speeding to the crosswalk, putting herself in harm's way instead.
