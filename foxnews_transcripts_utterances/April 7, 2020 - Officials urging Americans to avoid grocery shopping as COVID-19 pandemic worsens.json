We are following all these fast-moving coronavirus developments, not the least of which is this concern that cases in the U.S. are now eclipsing those abroad, particularly in Italy.

Again, in New York, the epicenter of all of this, that has been the focus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } To Bryan Llenas with the latest outside the USNS Comfort -- Bryan.",

The three-day average in terms of the number of hospitalizations in New York is down and discharges from the hospitals here are up. Take a look at the numbers, 17,000 total hospitalizations in New York, over 656 new hospitalizations in one day yesterday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That number is up.

The total number of deaths in New York is now at an astonishing 5,489. Tragically, in the last 24 hours, 731 New Yorkers have died. That is the largest one-day increase in deaths that we have seen. Now, the governor did say that it's a lagging indicator.

A Merchant Mariner tested positive for COVID. They were not part of the medical personnel. We're told that person is now in a cabin and isolated. They had no contact with the patients. They had no contact at all. And they are now an isolation away from the crew members. People -- the crew members that were in contact with this particular crew member have also been put -- had been tested and put in isolation out of an abundance of caution. But, remember, Comfort is now taking on COVID-19 patients. And as a result, they have reconfigured the ship, Neil. It is now 500 beds, instead of 1,000. That is able -- there -- they did that so that they can create a red zone and a green zone, a red zone that is strictly for COVID-19 patients and the personnel taking care of them, a green zone for the crew that is not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They are doing everything that they can to make sure that there is not an outbreak on board. And as part of that protocol, 800 of the medical personnel on board the Comfort, Neil, are now staying at a local hotel that's just for them. They will be taking a bus directly to the Comfort every single day, that way that they can increase social distancing on board. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we shall see how many patients will be taken on board the Comfort.

He is still there. And that's because yesterday his symptoms had worsened and he had started to suffer breathing difficulties. According to The London Times, he required around four liters of oxygen. For comparison, an average COVID ICU patient requires 15 liters. So that again is a positive sign. But, yesterday -- or, rather, today, the Cabinet met at Downing Street without him to continue discussing the coronavirus response. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is now the acting prime minister, though he today was in pains to say that he was merely carrying out instructions that Johnson had given him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The U.K., unlike the U.S., doesn't have a written Constitution. It doesn't have a formal line of succession. Dominic Raab was only announced last week, when Boris Johnson started showing symptoms. And so when it comes to those big questions, those big decisions, like the nuclear deterrent or others, the cabinet style here needs a strong leader. So the big question, how long is Boris Johnson going to be in hospital? When can he get back to Downing Street, Neil?",

There is general agreement that more money should be thrown at this, that small businesses are the hardest-hit. We reported first last week that there was going to be another leg to the program, billions of dollars. We did that on your show and on \"Claman Countdown.\" But one thing that hasn't been dealt with -- and this is key -- is the bureaucracy to get the money to the small businesses. And I'm telling you, Neil, I know there's $70 billion that's been handed out. I don't know a single small business person that has the money. I mean, nobody is saying that they have sent me the money. Most -- we're getting numerous complaints that small businesses can't get the money, can't get the money, that -- and the banks are blaming the Small Business Administration for a bureaucratic bottleneck, because they don't know how to -- they don't have the infrastructure to process the loans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The banks are blaming -- the clients are blaming some of these banks for finding reasons not to give them the loans.

Because of that scandal involving creating the faulty checking accounts, work with -- listen to me here. The bank is saying, because of that scandal and some requirements, its capital requirements stemming from that, they cannot make loans, these loans, to their small business customers, which is the oddest thing in the world. So this thing is basically a mess. Again, they were trying to do something really big, really fast to help an economy that really needed it. And particularly small businesses represent about 50 percent of the work force. And, as you know, they're getting crushed by the recession that is -- that is related to the coronavirus shutdowns and lockdowns. But, again, it wasn't well-thought-out. The Small Business Administration, if you listen to the banks, just it -- they cannot process these loans.

And, outside, there are handwashing stations and signs asking anyone with symptoms not to enter. Some voters here in Wisconsin tell us these extra measures are enough to keep them safe. Others we have talked here on the ground have some strong words for their elected leaders on both sides.",

Was this January? Was this later in the month, perhaps even early into March? That still has to be drilled down upon. But I can certainly tell you this. At least based on conversations I have had both on air and off air, the real sense at the White House is, you're right. The World Health Organization and the Chinese do bear some responsibility in this. But I don't think -- and, again, this is just based on nothing more than anecdotal conversations that I have had with senior administration officials -- they don't believe that this is something that they can wholesale say, somebody else should have done more. They recognize, and obviously so, that they could do more earlier, but no one -- and I think it's also fair to say, did anyone really know the extent to which this would turn out?

That was really the bulwark as far as the relationship is concerned from the White House's perspective from the outset, going all the way back to the trade deal. And so is it fair to suggest that perhaps Navarro was so deep in the weeds on that, that maybe he wasn't being heard properly, or certainly not in a more fulsome manner by others at the White House? That's entirely possible. But I imagine you're going to get some pushback on that, mostly because the belief is, the action the president took in shutting down flights from China, and being very aggressive in that posture, does underscore this idea, Neil, that they took this very seriously from the outset.",

But you can't blame one without at least discussing the other. And when it comes to the clumsy rollout of the Small Business Administration loan-giving computerized process, you can't say that a lot of greater good has come of that, and so some snafus are an order, when you said just the opposite when they rolled up the Affordable Care Act.

And at the corner of Wall and Broad, after a close to 1,000-point gain, after a 1,600-point gain yesterday,a bit of a sell-off today, when all was said and done. But, again, we were up 1,600 points.

Today, more data that could support that. The three-day average in terms of the number of hospitalizations in New York is down and discharges from the hospitals here are up. Take a look at the numbers, 17,000 total hospitalizations in New York, over 656 new hospitalizations in one day yesterday. That number is up. But, again, the three-day average is down. There have been 89 new ICU admissions over the last 24 hours. That is the lowest number in the past 17 days. The bad news, that's the deaths. The total number of deaths in New York is now at an astonishing 5,489. Tragically, in the last 24 hours, 731 New Yorkers have died. That is the largest one-day increase in deaths that we have seen. Now, the governor did say that it's a lagging indicator. Many of these people were hospitalized last week, and they had been on ventilators and now they're being counted as part of the death toll. Back here at the Comfort, yesterday, a crew member tested positive for COVID-19. A Merchant Mariner tested positive for COVID. They were not part of the medical personnel. We're told that person is now in a cabin and isolated. They had no contact with the patients. They had no contact at all. And they are now an isolation away from the crew members. People -- the crew members that were in contact with this particular crew member have also been put -- had been tested and put in isolation out of an abundance of caution. But, remember, Comfort is now taking on COVID-19 patients. And as a result, they have reconfigured the ship, Neil. It is now 500 beds, instead of 1,000. That is able -- there -- they did that so that they can create a red zone and a green zone, a red zone that is strictly for COVID-19 patients and the personnel taking care of them, a green zone for the crew that is not. They are doing everything that they can to make sure that there is not an outbreak on board. And as part of that protocol, 800 of the medical personnel on board the Comfort, Neil, are now staying at a local hotel that's just for them. They will be taking a bus directly to the Comfort every single day, that way that they can increase social distancing on board. So we shall see how many patients will be taken on board the Comfort. So far, there are 44 at this time -- Neil."

And we're told that he had earlier received oxygen, no need of a ventilator at this time. But a lot of people want to know, how's he doing?

      "speaker": "BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good afternoon, Neil. Yesterday, when this news broke that he had gone to the ICU, there were shockwaves across the U.K., there was a degree of panic, because it appeared as if his health had taken a turn for the worse very quickly. We now know that he has at least stable, he's in good spirits. He is in hospital. And, as you say, he is not on a ventilator. So that is important to mention, the government really pushing that line. But he did spend the night in intensive care. He is still there. And that's because yesterday his symptoms had worsened and he had started to suffer breathing difficulties. According to The London Times, he required around four liters of oxygen. For comparison, an average COVID ICU patient requires 15 liters. So that again is a positive sign. But, yesterday -- or, rather, today, the Cabinet met at Downing Street without him to continue discussing the coronavirus response. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is now the acting prime minister, though he today was in pains to say that he was merely carrying out instructions that Johnson had given him."

And some now arguing that the prime minister's health shouldn't be a private issue. It is very much in the public interest. And also a lot of unanswered questions now about the line of succession. The U.K., unlike the U.S., doesn't have a written Constitution. It doesn't have a formal line of succession. Dominic Raab was only announced last week, when Boris Johnson started showing symptoms. And so when it comes to those big questions, those big decisions, like the nuclear deterrent or others, the cabinet style here needs a strong leader. So the big question, how long is Boris Johnson going to be in hospital? When can he get back to Downing Street, Neil?"

If it could happen to someone like that, could it happen to me, let alone the stars who have been afflicted with this, from Tom Hanks to a host of others? Let's get the read on all this. Dr. Feranmi Okanlami, COVID-19 expert, very, very big in the medical community, Michigan Medicine hot line, so much more. Doctor, thank you for taking the time. It is jarring when we see someone of that heft have to succumb to this, go to intensive care, and get treatment. Hopefully, he will be OK. But it is a stark reminder to folks, don't take it lightly.

And I think that hopefully, when they have public figures like Prime Minister Johnson, it shows that it's really some of our most vulnerable populations that we often don't think about, such as people with disabilities, chronic illnesses and people of color, really everybody that is being affected by this, but some people disproportionately."

    {
      "speaker": "OKANLAMI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's something that a lot of people have been doing a lot of work to discuss this. It's that there are certain populations that have not necessarily always had the same access to care, and therefore when there are things that then are subjected to our most vulnerable, the people that were already at highest risk are then going to continue to be at highest risk.

But we have also heard of some 50-some-odd cases of people who had contracted the virus, then got out of it, tested negative, and then got it again. It seems a little weird to me, but can you explain how that happens? And is that a worry?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OKANLAMI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the most important thing at this point is that, if somebody is symptomatic, given what our president has been rightfully saying to do, we should be sheltering in place. So, if you have symptoms, you shouldn't be out and about, and you should do your best to try to stay away from individuals. I think that then the symptoms that people have and how they're manifest is what we should be doing a good job of taking care of. And then if people like Prime Minister Johnson, if he needs to go into the hospital, whether you're COVID-positive or whether it's that you have something else, I think we need to take care of those issues. But the testing and the result of the tests, I think that's had a lot of attention, but truly managing the symptoms that people have and being able to take care of folks, I think that's what the focus should be on."

I have been pursuing this on a lot of my shows with a lot of smart folks like you. What would you be comfortable? One of the definitions of revisiting this is 14 straight days of a decline in the rate of increases in cases and/or deaths. It doesn't mean that it would be the decline in cases, but decline in the rate of increase. Would you feel comfortable seeing 14 straight days of something like that to revisit, let's say the end of the month, if we have something approaching that, to ease up on these stay-in-place restrictions?"

And so I think that I respect all of the work that all of the public health officials have been doing to give us the most up-to-date guidelines that they can. So, I think that we are working hard. A lot of people around the country and world are working hard together, including a strong group of people at Michigan Medicine, to try to provide the most up-to-date information as to what it is that we can expect, because, as you see it in this process, there are things that we said a week or two ago about what we should expect and what we should do that are different today. So I think that, once again, as we get more information and as we see people starting to improve, I think that we will probably get some updates as to when it's appropriate or when it's safe to then relax on some of these shelter-in-place mandates and guidelines and recommendations."

There's this idea of a sustained reduction in the increase in cases for at least 14 days. They also must be able to prove that states are able to test everyone who has symptoms, to the point nationally that this can be tested to the point of 750,000 a week, at a minimum, and, finally, that hospitals must be able to track all patients requiring hospital -- hospitalization without taxing their facilities to the brink. All three of those in place, then maybe people can start leaving their place or their homes or start moving in that direction. China did so today, officially unlocking down, if you will, the Wuhan province, where you might recall all of this started a few months ago. It represented most of the 60 million Chinese who were effectively quarantined and cut off from the rest of the world. Today, they're free men and women. And a lot of them, we're told, were shopping. Stay with us. Right now, we're told about $130 to 150 billion bucks of that money, that roughly $360 billion, has already been allocated, bumps along the way, some computer problems along the way.

The first loan went out on Friday. That was just four days ago. But, already, take a look at this. The president says more than $70 billion of the total $349 billion in the PPP, that Paycheck Protection Program, already spoken for. Those loans have gone out to more than 260,000 small businesses, which the SBA estimates has saved around six million jobs. So you can see why there is now bipartisan consensus that that program needs a bit more funding. And during that meeting, President Trump put a price tag on it, $250 billion. Listen to this."

They're going to do another $250 billion now. But here's the problem, Neil. And I think this is basically what I have been reporting since last week -- or the last two weeks, actually. There is general agreement that more money should be thrown at this, that small businesses are the hardest-hit. We reported first last week that there was going to be another leg to the program, billions of dollars. We did that on your show and on \"Claman Countdown.\" But one thing that hasn't been dealt with -- and this is key -- is the bureaucracy to get the money to the small businesses. And I'm telling you, Neil, I know there's $70 billion that's been handed out. I don't know a single small business person that has the money. I mean, nobody is saying that they have sent me the money. Most -- we're getting numerous complaints that small businesses can't get the money, can't get the money, that -- and the banks are blaming the Small Business Administration for a bureaucratic bottleneck, because they don't know how to -- they don't have the infrastructure to process the loans. The banks are blaming -- the clients are blaming some of these banks for finding reasons not to give them the loans. And there's one other odd thing. As you know, Wells Fargo is maybe one of the -- is one of the top five banks in the country, maybe the world. Because of that scandal involving creating the faulty checking accounts, work with -- listen to me here. The bank is saying, because of that scandal and some requirements, its capital requirements stemming from that, they cannot make loans, these loans, to their small business customers, which is the oddest thing in the world. So this thing is basically a mess. Again, they were trying to do something really big, really fast to help an economy that really needed it. And particularly small businesses represent about 50 percent of the work force. And, as you know, they're getting crushed by the recession that is -- that is related to the coronavirus shutdowns and lockdowns. But, again, it wasn't well-thought-out. The Small Business Administration, if you listen to the banks, just it -- they cannot process these loans. And no one thought that through when they started throwing money at the problem -- back to you."

So they are taking steps to do that very thing. Take a look at what they're doing right now. One of the things they're doing is making sure they take the temperatures and make personal protective equipment available to Walmart employees. They're also putting sneeze guards up at the checkout locations. They're limiting capacity in the stores. It's a one person in, one person out at times, 20 percent capacity, and reducing the hours to make more time for sanitizing and cleaning. We have got pictures inside this Walmart. This is the one where the two workers worked that lost their lives to the virus. As perhaps you can see, it's one of the Super Walmarts, has food as well. It's fairly well-stocked. And there is sanitizing that you can see going on during the day, as employees and shoppers are in there. In addition, they have now placed on the floor little spacers to make sure, when you're standing in line, that you don't stand too close. They are also -- I should point out they haven't implemented this store-wide yet, but they are going to start trying to do one-way aisles, so that people don't kind of crash into each other as they come down the aisle together, don't get too close. As to the wrongful death suit. The company has said that it certainly mourns the loss of the employees, one of them a 15-year Walmart employee. And they also point out, though, in terms of this store, last week, it passed a third-party safety and environmental protection assessment, as well as passing a health department inspection.

Designate one person to go out, do the shopping, do enough shopping for two to three weeks, so that you minimize the outdoor exposure, minimize picking up the virus, minimize bringing it back to the entire family. So it's a matter of staying at home to help prevent the spread of this virus, because it's a very highly infectious and contagious virus. And it's a very wicked virus that is causing a lot of lung damage and putting a lot of people in the hospitals. And I'm seeing that firsthand, so these little minor steps that we can take to help save lives."

That's -- that -- I see a lot of that. One of my patients, I was stunned and shocked to hear that he ended up being put on a ventilator and lost his life. I wasn't expecting that. So, I would like to see prolonged, sustained reduction in all of those situations, on top of making sure that hospitals can handle the load, if there's any further mini-peaks are mini-outbreaks. And that's why the mayor in L.A., he's -- this week is very critical for them. They don't want to become like New York or Italy or China, where we'd have to depend on ventilators and be fearful of the lack of ventilators. But I think two weeks is not long enough to determine if we can relax the guidelines. I would be more happy with at least a month of prolonged, sustained reduction in the number of cases, to the point where it's back in the single digits. Don't want any double digits."

So distancing is going to continue for a period of time. So, when I take a look at restaurant bars and those types of business models, even casinos, we have to spread our seating, so that there's a comfort for people to come inside of our businesses. When we do the math and I look at different floor plans, Neil, it's a loss of between 30 and 60 percent capacity, based upon the configuration of the business. So if we lose that amount of seating, imagine a restaurant does 100 lunches in an hour, and now they lose 30, 40, 50 percent of their capacity. That hour is worth half of what it was to them. So there's a new way of doing business, Neil. Lunch now has to be three hours, so that I can get those 100 people in over a longer period of time. I have got to adjust the way I'm doing business to compensate that. But at the end of the day, capacity goes down in every -- I call it LBE business, location-based entertainment. In any location-based entertainment business, whether it's a bowling center, a movie theater, Broadway, a restaurant, a bar, a nightclub, capacity is going to change going forward.

A luxury dining restaurant, in theory, an upscale restaurant, is spread a little more in the first place, Neil, so they would lose less when they spread a little more. But there are changes that even New York City could make. For example, what if they allow more sidewalk seating, so that a bar can add 20 percent more seating out front, or a restaurant can? That's an interesting solution. So, we take a look at Times Square and certain areas in Manhattan, where they have created mall streets, where businesses can do more revenue outside. I think that cities can start to make changes like that, Neil. And the way we market has to change. Meal periods need to be longer now. I could do early-bird lunch specials at 11, late-bird lunch specials after 1:00. I got to spread my business, so I can use the reduced capacity that I have over a longer period of time."

And it looks like the World Health Organization was parroting their propaganda. So that's what we do know. But one thing is for sure.

      "utterance": "All right, well, you can't have it both ways. And with all respect to the fine senator, if you are arguing that something wasn't communicated via the World Health Organization, well, something wasn't communicated from the White House. Now, if it ever reached the level of the president, we don't know. We do know that the warnings were put out and the suspicions about China were put out by no less than Peter Navarro. As this gains traction, a lot of questions to answer, who knew what and when. It won't solve or address any of the problems that have happened since, but is it fair to just criticize the World Health Organization? Anyway, let's get the latest from Kevin Corke on this. So, Kevin, the big question then becomes how much of an issue this becomes at not only the health task force briefing, but other briefings going forward."

      "speaker": "KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think you hit on a couple of very important questions. Number one, to use the old adage in Washington, what did you know and when did you know it? But I think, more importantly, Neil, here is, the White House needs to come to grips or come to terms with this idea that they were warned, at least internally. Now, was this February? Was this January? Was this later in the month, perhaps even early into March? That still has to be drilled down upon. But I can certainly tell you this. At least based on conversations I have had both on air and off air, the real sense at the White House is, you're right. The World Health Organization and the Chinese do bear some responsibility in this. But I don't think -- and, again, this is just based on nothing more than anecdotal conversations that I have had with senior administration officials -- they don't believe that this is something that they can wholesale say, somebody else should have done more. They recognize, and obviously so, that they could do more earlier, but no one -- and I think it's also fair to say, did anyone really know the extent to which this would turn out? And I think that's a fair question as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you know, Kevin, whether Navarro, in the middle of this trade imbroglio with the Chinese, was distracted, and his points were maybe ignored because they were focused on a trade deal with China, getting that done, these other warnings seemed aberrant to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CORKE",
      "utterance": "I don't think that is too far afield, to be honest with you. And, in fact, if you listen very carefully -- and I know you do -- this is more for the folks at home -- if you listen to what the president was saying in his response to a question from a journalist from China yesterday, he immediately pivoted back to trade, what the Chinese will do, what they may or may not purchase. That was really the bulwark as far as the relationship is concerned from the White House's perspective from the outset, going all the way back to the trade deal. And so is it fair to suggest that perhaps Navarro was so deep in the weeds on that, that maybe he wasn't being heard properly, or certainly not in a more fulsome manner by others at the White House? That's entirely possible. But I imagine you're going to get some pushback on that, mostly because the belief is, the action the president took in shutting down flights from China, and being very aggressive in that posture, does underscore this idea, Neil, that they took this very seriously from the outset."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, just to put this in perspective, we did notice that a lot of people were focusing their time and energy on blaming the World Health Organization for covering up for China, for saying that they knew what was going on in China. There's no proof of that. But, of course, if -- there's also no proof to say how high up Peter Navarro's concerns about a possible Chinese virus could go, whether it made it to the president. But you can't blame one without at least discussing the other. And when it comes to the clumsy rollout of the Small Business Administration loan-giving computerized process, you can't say that a lot of greater good has come of that, and so some snafus are an order, when you said just the opposite when they rolled up the Affordable Care Act. Whether Democrats mean to do some good or Republicans mean to do some good, you can't pick and choose your sinners and saints."
