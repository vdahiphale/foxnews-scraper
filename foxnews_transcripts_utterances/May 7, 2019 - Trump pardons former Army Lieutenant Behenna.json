Welcome to “Hannity.” Buckle up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Subpoenas, threats of contempt, calls for impeachment of pretty much everyone, and, oh, yes, obsessive hysteria over decades-old tax documents that reveal nothing new and absolutely nothing illegal. And the media's going nuts again. Oh, that's right, because Mueller didn't come out the way they want. Let's move onto the next conspiracy theories. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And speaking of which, maybe Hillary Clinton colluded with China to release them, because she said, China, I hope you're listening, release the tax returns.

Donald Trump's still a billionaire. Yes, he's still president. We all knew that what happened in New Jersey in the casino business, yes, it kind of went south. Businesses fail every day. The Trump Organization is still an overwhelming American success story. But this kind of vitriol just represents what the Democratic Party has become. Tax -- you know, we're going to get that for the next two years. We need the special counsel. Mueller, we need tax experts. You know, this is a political cabal filled with sore losers that are now bordering on rage psychosis that couldn't accept the results of the 2016 election, now refusing to accept the results of Mueller's investigation, and now more unhinge than ever. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, tonight, after more than being cooperative in a broad 22-month witch hunt, the president is rightly saying enough is enough and he's putting his foot down. Remember, he didn't say or use executive privilege one time. He allowed everybody in the White House to talk to the special counsel, 1.5 million documents. This week, the White House did order, finally fighting back, former counsel Don McGahn with a not to comply order as it relates to the congressional subpoena. After all, it was already interviewed by Robert Mueller for a whopping 30 hours. The guy is talked out. He has nothing left to say. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And meanwhile, under threat of contempt to Congress, the Attorney General Barr is refusing to release the full, unredacted version of the Mueller report to congressional Democrats because he's actually following the law and because the law was passed by Democrats. Barr, by the way, was not required to release one single letter, no word, no phrase, nothing of the Mueller report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the only redactions to the full report include, oh, grand jury information, language pertaining to ongoing cases, investigatory sources and methods. Can't let that out anyway. And according to Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, the White House might order the DOJ to block Robert Mueller from testifying on the Hill. It's kind of disappointing -- I got a lot of questions for Mueller. Why did he appoint Andrew Weissmann and a band of Democrats, and let's see, people that withheld exculpatory evidence in the past, the people that represented Hillary Clinton, nobody that donated to the Republicans? I'd like a few of those questions. Why did Robert Mueller not touch Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier? I know he was busy. He was looking into FARA violations, the bad loan applications, incomplete tax returns, taxi medallions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, he's too busy to investigate Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies and propaganda to impact the 2016 election which was part of the mandate of what he was supposed to be doing, not taxi medallions or FARA violations.

He told the Kathleen Kavalec, the deputy assistant secretary of state, on October 11th, 2016, that his client who he identified as someone recurrently hacked -- the Democratic National Committee -- needed to get this information, was keen on getting this information out before election day.

Rod Rosenstein said, an official who signs off on a FISA request, must swear the information used in that is true and correct or there are severe consequences. And Kevin Brock, the former assistant director of intelligence at the FBI, put it this way: James Comey is in trouble, he knows it. The 25-year FBI vet believes that Comey's flurry of public activity shows that he is desperately trying to shake the narrative. But at the end of the day, truth is more important than any spin of Jim Comey. Comey did not want Trump to become president, hated him.

      "utterance": "That was a good laugh. All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Buckle up. Subpoenas, threats of contempt, calls for impeachment of pretty much everyone, and, oh, yes, obsessive hysteria over decades-old tax documents that reveal nothing new and absolutely nothing illegal. And the media's going nuts again. Oh, that's right, because Mueller didn't come out the way they want. Let's move onto the next conspiracy theories. And speaking of which, maybe Hillary Clinton colluded with China to release them, because she said, China, I hope you're listening, release the tax returns. And there they are in the \"New York Times.\" I know facts are hard things for some people on the left and the media mob to understand. Donald Trump's still a billionaire. Yes, he's still president. We all knew that what happened in New Jersey in the casino business, yes, it kind of went south. Businesses fail every day. The Trump Organization is still an overwhelming American success story. But this kind of vitriol just represents what the Democratic Party has become. Tax -- you know, we're going to get that for the next two years. We need the special counsel. Mueller, we need tax experts. You know, this is a political cabal filled with sore losers that are now bordering on rage psychosis that couldn't accept the results of the 2016 election, now refusing to accept the results of Mueller's investigation, and now more unhinge than ever. So, tonight, after more than being cooperative in a broad 22-month witch hunt, the president is rightly saying enough is enough and he's putting his foot down. Remember, he didn't say or use executive privilege one time. He allowed everybody in the White House to talk to the special counsel, 1.5 million documents. This week, the White House did order, finally fighting back, former counsel Don McGahn with a not to comply order as it relates to the congressional subpoena. After all, it was already interviewed by Robert Mueller for a whopping 30 hours. The guy is talked out. He has nothing left to say. And meanwhile, under threat of contempt to Congress, the Attorney General Barr is refusing to release the full, unredacted version of the Mueller report to congressional Democrats because he's actually following the law and because the law was passed by Democrats. Barr, by the way, was not required to release one single letter, no word, no phrase, nothing of the Mueller report. And the only redactions to the full report include, oh, grand jury information, language pertaining to ongoing cases, investigatory sources and methods. Can't let that out anyway. And according to Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, the White House might order the DOJ to block Robert Mueller from testifying on the Hill. It's kind of disappointing -- I got a lot of questions for Mueller. Why did he appoint Andrew Weissmann and a band of Democrats, and let's see, people that withheld exculpatory evidence in the past, the people that represented Hillary Clinton, nobody that donated to the Republicans? I'd like a few of those questions. Why did Robert Mueller not touch Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier? I know he was busy. He was looking into FARA violations, the bad loan applications, incomplete tax returns, taxi medallions. So, he's too busy to investigate Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies and propaganda to impact the 2016 election which was part of the mandate of what he was supposed to be doing, not taxi medallions or FARA violations. Watch this."

It's always about scoring cheap political points with their radical base. Well, let's look at a new poll. Fifty-seven percent of Democrats believe President Trump is guilty of treason. They've been lied to every second, every minute, every hour of every day on every news channel except prime time here. So, what do you expect? Of course they're going to believe that lie. According to multiple surveys, vast majority of these Democrats are -- Americans, though, they're against impeachment. Without a doubt, the far left, socialist, extreme, Democratic socialist party, they are out of touch with truth and reality and can no longer accept basic fundamental truths. Same reason why so many Trump haters are refusing to admit a simple disturbing truth as well -- the Trump campaign was spied on. It happened. And tonight, as Byron York pointed out, it's not a question of whether spying took place. Question is, how much spying and by how many people? Now, even former national intel director turn fake news CNN hack, James Clapper, begrudgingly admits this simple truth, looks like spying to me. Well, it was spying. Take a look."

When our federal government sends in undercover agents, oh, like a hot blonde bombshell that's really flirtatious and makes herself available to George Papadopoulos for the purpose of extracting information out of him, yes, that's called spying. When our own FBI uses a series of secret informants to set up meetings and then surveilled Trump campaign aides and trapped them into saying things that they can't say because they don't know, that would be spying. And when Carter Page -- he's going to join us in a moment -- had his calls and e-mails tapped by our own federal government after they committed a massive FISA fraud with the bulk of the application and information being Hillary's Russian dossier, that would be spying, too. What's worse, the basis for that spying was Hillary and her dirty Russian dossier, a document Comey and others signed off on. You know, at the top of a FISA warrant -- I just learned this today -- it says verified. Hmm, it was never verified. It's unverifiable. This document totally unverified. \"New York Times\" even suggesting all of it, paid for by Hillary, may have been Russian disinformation from the get-go. And thanks to a brand new breaking report from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, we now have one more piece of damning evidence that the Obama administration knew that the dossier was a fraudulent political hack job well before Comey used it, and they used it for the basis of the FISA application. And according to John Solomon, ten days before that first FISA request, in October 2016, the author of that dossier, Christopher Steele, confessed to Obama's deputy assistant secretary of state, quote: His research was political and facing an election day deadline. State Department memorialized this conversation in a written statement which was subsequently hidden from Congressman Devin Nunes during the course of his entire House Intel investigation. The shocking revelation shining light on a series of texts between FBI officials Page and Strzok that referenced in an effort to speed up the completion of the FISA request likely used against Carter Page. We're going to get back to my monologue on this and hear from Carter Page in a minute. But first, to break down all this new information, investigative reporter, he's from \"The Hill\". He's been here from the get-go on exposing a lot of this, John Solomon. Wow. Let's see, Steele stunning pre-FISA confession. Informant needed Trump dirt before the election. It was a deadline to Hillary's lies."

Not an intelligence mission, a political mission. He told the Kathleen Kavalec, the deputy assistant secretary of state, on October 11th, 2016, that his client who he identified as someone recurrently hacked -- the Democratic National Committee -- needed to get this information, was keen on getting this information out before election day. That's the clearest sign that this was a political dirty trick, political opposition research.

They tell the FBI, this is ten days before they get the first warrant application verified.

We now know that the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele, was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. He was not a reliable informant for the FBI. He was trying to destroy Trump because he was paid by the Democrats to take Trump down. They knew all of this. They should have known all of this before they applied for the warrant.

Just yesterday, we showed you crazy Uncle Joe claiming conservatives want to bring back Jim Crow laws using some of the same lines from the old Clinton playbook. Even The New York Times, they're taking notice, writing a new piece. So, 2020 Biden has given Democrats a little 2016 Clinton flashbacks, especially as Biden is already running scared like having to walk back his comments on China, among a host of other issues, including his treatment of Anita Hill. And now, all of this could create a huge pathway for new crop of even more radical Democrats like media darling Mayor Pete who is ramping up his attacks on Christian values and conservatives.

There is - he was very attractive, very - he is an articulate guy and he deserves a second look. But he is desperate to get the African-American vote. He has zero African-American support. He knows South Carolina is up after Iowa and New Hampshire. He knows he needs the African-American vote to get the Democratic primary. He's desperate; he is flailing around. He's trying to redefine himself as the guy who didn't fire in 2007 the black Police Chief of South Bend, Indiana, which he did. And that's the deficit he's trying to overcome, Sean."

President Trump, he just pardoned an Iraqi veteran convicted of killing a suspected Al-Qaeda terrorist, former army first lieutenant Michael Behenna. He will join us exclusively, share that story. You won't see this anywhere else. You want to see this next."

      "utterance": "Yesterday, President Trump, he pardoned ex-army first lieutenant Michael Behenna who was convicted in 2009 of killing a suspected Al-Qaeda terrorist in Iraq. Behenna originally received a sentence of 25 years in prison for unpremeditated murder on a combat zone. But they were concerns about how the trial court addressed his self-defense claim and in announcing the pardon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders mentioned broad support from Behenna saying, \"from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, the public.\" He is now here to tell his story in his own words and react to today's news along with his parents, Vicki and Scott. Good to see you all. Let me start, if you don't mind, you were - Michael, you wanted to serve your country, correct?"

After he heard my story, he went back to the prosecutors and did a demonstration to them in the room and told them -- or he -- I'm sorry. Let me back up. Once I told my story, he had -- he had told the prosecutors, that's exactly what I told you yesterday. Because he had did a demonstration for the prosecution team the day before, the day before he heard my testimony."

Why would -- why would we send brave men and women - and I got to believe, Vicki and Scott, you sent your son and he's willing to risk his life for his country, and he has to defend himself. Now, we're going to second guess his decision. We have exculpatory evidence and they withheld it? How does that make a mother and father feel?"

      "utterance": "Well, I can just tell you from my perspective, being a federal prosecutor for over 25 years, it was something I'd never witnessed before. It was a trial where the forensic evidence was not introduced by the prosecution, but by the defense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "It was withheld on purpose, ma'am. With all due respect, I'm going to be a little more blunt. They knew it. They didn't bring it up."

      "speaker": "VICKI BEHENNA",
      "utterance": "Well, they definitely should have told, they have an ethical and constitutional responsibility to turn that evidence over once a forensic expert says that he doesn't believe their theory of an execution is accurate."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And Scott, as the father of Michael, an American hero, I got to imagine your son in eleven or (ph) for five years for something he was unjustly convicted of, I bet you have real anger issues with the people that did that because I know as a father, I would."

      "utterance": "It's hard, Sean. You know, five years passes very slowly in a prison. And we were fortunate to visit him very often which helped quite extensively, but you're right. I mean we were initially very angry. But you focus your attention on helping him and that's what we've tried to do for all these years, with all the support. You mentioned AG Hunter and President Trump, finally coming through. This is amazing day, exciting day."

      "speaker": "BEHENNA",
      "utterance": "It was -- it was totally unexpected. And I want to -- I want to personally thank President Trump and this is something he didn't have to do. I'm just grateful that he even considered my pardon petition. And it was one of the happiest moments of my life."

All of these guys that served this country, rules of engagement and we second-guess them from the comforts of our living room or some office in DC? That has got to stop.
