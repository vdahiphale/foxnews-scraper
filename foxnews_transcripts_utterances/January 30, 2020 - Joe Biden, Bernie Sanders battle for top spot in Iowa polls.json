So it could be a long night, but I do thing -- I believe that Mitchell McConnell has steered the Republicans in a way that they will be able to finish this by late Friday night, maybe early Saturday morning. It could be a really late night or an early morning, depending on your perspective. I have been surprised that nobody has brought up the fact that in December, just a month ago, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, they finally released their money and loans to Ukraine. And if you look at the reason that they were holding it back or like they were concerned about it, it was all about corruption. So that isn't a surprise. So it's not a surprise either that John Bolton, the National Security Advisor, would go on Radio Free Europe and talk about corruption in Ukraine because it was a well-known thing. I would also point out that Senator Alexander from Tennessee was considered somebody who has got this great reputation and he doesn't want to sully that and he's got -- he's retiring at the end of this year, so maybe the Democrats thought he would vote for impeachment. Over the past two days, unless I have missed something in the last little bit, he hasn't asked a single question, which makes me think he has all the information that he needs and the Democrats have failed to force a vote on witnesses.

Maybe a couple, but I think that especially for the people we've been talking about that might possibly vote to see additional witnesses. I think that they have not been persuaded just from reading the tea leaves from what they are saying. You see that Susan Collins is frustrated because Adam Schiff won't actually answer that question that she put forward. So I think there's a lot of frustration. Plus, I also think this. The Democrats are being extremely political. Speaker Pelosi today said that acquittal is not legitimate without a trial with new witnesses. So they want to go into the election season saying he was impeached and that's for life. And it doesn't matter that he was acquitted because it wasn't a fair trial because Republicans covered it up. And this could be right. They did from the beginning when they pulled that lawsuit from Superman, the deputy to Bolton, because they didn't want to actually have the president be affirmed in his executive privilege claims. So now they can just there was obstruction. And -- but I do want to ask other thing because I didn't get a chance in the previous block. Can I ask a hypothetical? If we, as a people, had found out that President Obama was asking a foreign government for help in a corruption scheme, but it just happened to be that that scheme involved Donald Trump, but that would be in the national interest.

I think to myself, if that's the case, if Bolton is exonerating the president, why wouldn't the president and his team want Bolton to come before the American people, before the impeachment trial and testify? But, of course, we all know that's not the case. He doesn't want Bolton anywhere near this. He, in fact, is putting up every roadblock to stop Bolton from testifying. And he continues to refuse to release any material. So this is all showmanship, and he is terrific at showmanship. Donald Trump can put on a show. But in terms of protecting the American Constitution, in terms of stopping us from becoming a monarchy with a king that answers to no one. You know I just wonder what is going on in this country."

He beat Jim Rogan in his district to become a Congressman because of his outrage over Bill Clinton's impeachment. So obviously, the arguments that he made he is now arguing against his own logic. And I understand positions can evolve. And certainly, it's been 20 years since he ran for that office and he's been stinking up Congress ever since. However, John Bolton can't have it both ways. He can't be a patriot and a compromise or at the same time. So it's one of the other. And I actually wouldn't mind hearing from John Bolton. I want to know how he can square some of the salacious things that he has reportedly written in this book with, you know saying the president was warm and cordial. So either he was -- he is not a patriot and he was just disseminating propaganda on behalf of the president because he's totally compromised himself or somewhere in here he's lying."

      "utterance": "Then they'll have a vote. So -- and the vote will be where -- it's kind of -- it's like a technical thing. You have this gateway vote so see if there's going to be witnesses, if it's clear that's going to fail I think there will be a motion to have the acquittal vote and there's some amendments. So it could be a long night, but I do thing -- I believe that Mitchell McConnell has steered the Republicans in a way that they will be able to finish this by late Friday night, maybe early Saturday morning. It could be a really late night or an early morning, depending on your perspective. I have been surprised that nobody has brought up the fact that in December, just a month ago, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, they finally released their money and loans to Ukraine. And if you look at the reason that they were holding it back or like they were concerned about it, it was all about corruption. So that isn't a surprise. So it's not a surprise either that John Bolton, the National Security Advisor, would go on Radio Free Europe and talk about corruption in Ukraine because it was a well-known thing. I would also point out that Senator Alexander from Tennessee was considered somebody who has got this great reputation and he doesn't want to sully that and he's got -- he's retiring at the end of this year, so maybe the Democrats thought he would vote for impeachment. Over the past two days, unless I have missed something in the last little bit, he hasn't asked a single question, which makes me think he has all the information that he needs and the Democrats have failed to force a vote on witnesses. And that is a contrast with the media says. The media always says Republicans don't have enough votes to block witnesses. No, it's actually that the Democrats haven't been able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and force a vote and force a vote --"

Dershowitz said you can't be impeached for doing something in the national interest if it also helps your re-election, because everything you do that is good helps you in a re- election. So if you -- impeachment about this, which is about investigating corruption in the Ukraine, you could just as easily impeach him for introducing a Middle East peace plan or a trade deal, because that also helps his personal interests."

Now, if a space alien came down and said I see two sides. One side says impeach. The other side says acquit. What is the difference? One has been saying impeachment for three solid years. That is the difference. So that explains the emotion. That explains the hyperbole, because they put years into this. This is a sunk cost that they can't let go. Now, Juan, I know what you're going to say so I'm going to pre-empt you."

Dershowitz says that if you can impeach over obstruction of justice, which is vague, that gives the Congress too much power. Every Congress now can impeach the president at a whim and the president becomes a puppet. The other side says if you don't impeach him, Trump is a tyrant and a king. So you see how the argument is exactly equal. The only difference is one has been doing it for three damn years."

You need to ignore the hyperbole, because the hyperbole is a sign that they are tied up in knots over this. And this is the only thing they have left is Bolton. And so they're going to keep saying oh my god, you don't call witnesses. Oh, this is going to be historic. We're going to be talking about this political suicide. No, because even if the call witnesses, they're going to say now you are trying to drag out the election and you're going to try to keep our candidates busy. They are always going to find something. They hate you at the start. They're going to hate you at the middle, and they're going hate you at the end. So stop thinking about if you're going to hurt their feelings.

But we do have the Republicans that were part of the hearings in the House. And I think about Mike Johnson from Louisiana who knew that case backwards and forwards. And I would say that on the merits, somebody like that says they haven't proven beyond a reasonable doubt. They do not have a case. And it is not all political for all of them. Maybe a couple, but I think that especially for the people we've been talking about that might possibly vote to see additional witnesses. I think that they have not been persuaded just from reading the tea leaves from what they are saying. You see that Susan Collins is frustrated because Adam Schiff won't actually answer that question that she put forward. So I think there's a lot of frustration. Plus, I also think this. The Democrats are being extremely political. Speaker Pelosi today said that acquittal is not legitimate without a trial with new witnesses. So they want to go into the election season saying he was impeached and that's for life. And it doesn't matter that he was acquitted because it wasn't a fair trial because Republicans covered it up. And this could be right. They did from the beginning when they pulled that lawsuit from Superman, the deputy to Bolton, because they didn't want to actually have the president be affirmed in his executive privilege claims. So now they can just there was obstruction. And -- but I do want to ask other thing because I didn't get a chance in the previous block. Can I ask a hypothetical? If we, as a people, had found out that President Obama was asking a foreign government for help in a corruption scheme, but it just happened to be that that scheme involved Donald Trump, but that would be in the national interest. But it would also help him politically because it might have helped Hillary Clinton. Would our position then be what Alan Dershowitz is saying is that well, that's cool."

Thanks to New York's new bill reform law, six people are free after they were busted for allegedly running a $7 million drug trafficking ring which included over 75,000 envelopes of heroin and fentanyl. This coming is as New York City's top cop is voicing his concerns over the new bail law saying it is leading to a major increase in crime. Jesse, does crime pay?"
    },

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

That's the only incentive they have they're showing up at the court date. And if you don't have that incentive, you're going to be a flight risk and then you get -- the cops going to hit you with the blue light, you're going to flee, high-speed chase and then innocent people are at risk when you -- when you elude police. Not only this, you had another guy, a Colombian national, illegal immigrant busted with heroin -- with fentanyl in it, and now he's out. And then you had another woman, anti-Semitic attack in Brooklyn on three women, goes in, no bail gets out, attacks another woman in the next day."

You have aggravated assaults on a child, aggravated harassments, prisoner escape, rapes, riots, robberies, and vehicular manslaughter. So I don't know why you'd handcuff a judge that knows criminality better than Andrew Cuomo. Andrew Cuomo is going to have to rewrite this now."

It passed in a Republican administration, in a Republican- controlled Congress. Jared Kushner was pushing that. Obviously, in New York State, a lot of people feel we have not found the sweet spot. How do you do that?"

    },

      "speaker": "KENNEDY",

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. That's what I point to you. But the point that I was trying to make is that overwhelmingly, the statistics indicate that people who go out on bail show up for their trial, and the big problem is you get overcrowding in jails with people who are being unfairly held because they don't have some money."

    },

      "utterance": "I think we're being way too diplomatic here. You can -- I don't think you can find a bigger cause and effect right now. You just said got rid of the detainment until bail and what is it, robberies up 33 percent, grand larceny, auto theft up 63 percent over the year -- on year after this laws in. And people are just like, oh you know -- you know, fentanyl dealers."

The reason why -- so they took the discretion out of the judge. The judge can't do anything. So now you just have to wave them through. I mean this is -- it's not going to matter until the citizens speak up and then -- or maybe to the mayor or to the governor, money starts leaving this -- leaving the state because tourism will suffer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "Well, OK, but there are people who say that these are trends, but they -- you have to have a longer-term in order to really assess the effect that it's going to have. If crime is spiking over a couple weeks, that's bad, but if not --"

That prompted daddies around the country to share pictures of themselves with their daughters with the #GirlDad. Here's Russell Wilson and his daughter, Michael Strahan and his daughters.
