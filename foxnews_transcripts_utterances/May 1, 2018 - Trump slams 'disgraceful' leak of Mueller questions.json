To me, this is like -- this is a range of topics that we want to go over with him. And, yes, many of these could be a wolf in sheep's clothing, as the James Trustee who's the lawyer on the 2 o'clock show today was saying that, yeah, this could end up being something where you don't want to have your client do an interview.

I think Trump should say, you know, we'll answer these things in writing, and then just beat people over the head with this stuff. Because, the fact is, when you look at what's going on in the world, what's missing? What are we not seeing now that we used to see doing The Five? ISIS videos. Almost every week we saw an ISIS video. For months, we talked about the nuclear threat of North Korea. These are two existential threats that are missing from our newsfeed. And I do think the media is completely unprepared to report Trump's successes. They don't have that in their toolbox. You have two major things missing and you don't know what to report, so you focus on pornography and your focus on collusion. Collusion, which is falling apart and has been falling apart, now it's going to become about obstruction, but they don't have that in their toolkit, so they're left doing this.

Why is this criminal? That act isn't been use for two centuries. Look at the Comey stuff. It's about his dinners, his phone calls, what he was thinking when he fired Comey. It's about a thought crime. You have to -- in order to charge obstruction, you have to show corrupt intent. Now, if Hillary Clinton deleted 30,000 emails after they were subpoenaed, and Comey couldn't find intent there, I don't see how they can find that with President Trump.

And the media breathlessly covers it, because we're just suckers for outrage. But as always, the cultural appropriation offense is a sham. The idea that it's racist to incorporate something from another culture is so morally bankrupt it's actually deadly. Over time, healthy people adopt practices that enhance their lives, meaning they steal good things, not the bad. But all things come from somewhere else. So appropriation isn't just a complement to a culture, it's how civilizations thrive. Do you wear pajamas? If you're not an Indian Muslim, you're racist. Pajamas originated from Indian Muslims. And God forbid the sheets you sleep on are of Egyptian cotton. Do you eat yogurt? I bet a lot of social justice warriors do. How racist is that to appropriate the diet of Central Asian herdsmen from 6000 B.C.? Do you walk upright? How dare you steal the practice initiated by Ardipithecus ramidus, the earliest hominid from Ethiopia. In sum, if you live your life by avoiding cultural appropriation, you'd have no life whatsoever.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" What does Robert Mueller want to ask President Trump? Well, dozens of questions are now out in the public for the world to see. Questions that were reportedly read to the president's legal team in March that leaked to the media, the president called the leaks disgraceful in the tweet. Sarah Sanders directed questions to Mr. Trump's legal team at the briefing earlier, but her deputy, Raj Shah, had this to say."

There's been over a year of investigation. There're been dozens of witnesses, thousands of documents, millions, actually, of pages of documents provided, and zero evidence. Not a shred of evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government."

They're really designed to let him ramble and talk, and I suspect that's the strategy of the special counsel because they know that, maybe, President Trump's weakness, if they were to ask him direct, tough questions to which he can answer yes or no, that might not give them the advantage they're seeking."

But, I do think that yes, the questions were open-ended. As I understand it, it's really unusual for anyone to be given a list, especially 44 questions, or 49, however many it was, beforehand. I could see why they're open-ended, because if you started providing all the questions that you would want a yes or no answer to, then, of course, that would look a little weird too. To me, this is like -- this is a range of topics that we want to go over with him. And, yes, many of these could be a wolf in sheep's clothing, as the James Trustee who's the lawyer on the 2 o'clock show today was saying that, yeah, this could end up being something where you don't want to have your client do an interview. I think that that's possibly was strategy behind the leak. I don't think this leak came from the Mueller team. I do think it came from somebody either associated with the legal team or something like that. To say, you know what, get it out there. Let everybody start talking about it. And then, either, for the lawyers to be able to say, see, Mr. President, everybody thinks that you shouldn't do an interview with Mueller. And try to get him to agree."

But it might be a treasure trove for Republicans, because this -- if you're going to be counting on winning the house, I don't know if this Russian stuff is actually going to help you. I think over time this is becoming a squalid distraction. And the more insane it gets, I think, the more it actually helps Republicans. I think Trump should say, you know, we'll answer these things in writing, and then just beat people over the head with this stuff. Because, the fact is, when you look at what's going on in the world, what's missing? What are we not seeing now that we used to see doing The Five? ISIS videos. Almost every week we saw an ISIS video. For months, we talked about the nuclear threat of North Korea. These are two existential threats that are missing from our newsfeed. And I do think the media is completely unprepared to report Trump's successes. They don't have that in their toolbox. You have two major things missing and you don't know what to report, so you focus on pornography and your focus on collusion. Collusion, which is falling apart and has been falling apart, now it's going to become about obstruction, but they don't have that in their toolkit, so they're left doing this. And what's the end result? I don't know really what they want. I've talked about impeachment. But if you impeach a president in the middle of some really historic achievements, history will not be kind to you. The voters will not be kind to you. No one will be kind to you."

They asked one question. Did you discuss pardoning Flynn? Is that illegal to discuss pardoning somebody? Where is that going? I mean, this is -- it's an obstruction case, let's be honest with you. Again, the hat jack, that's what they're going after Flynn for. You can't as a transitional officer talk to counterpart in Russia a month before your boss is sworn in? Every administration does that. Why is this criminal? That act isn't been use for two centuries. Look at the Comey stuff. It's about his dinners, his phone calls, what he was thinking when he fired Comey. It's about a thought crime. You have to -- in order to charge obstruction, you have to show corrupt intent. Now, if Hillary Clinton deleted 30,000 emails after they were subpoenaed, and Comey couldn't find intent there, I don't see how they can find that with President Trump. Sessions, they're asking about Jeff Sessions. You know, when he tweeted he wasn't tough enough on Hillary, what did you mean by that? I mean, it sounds like -- it's like a therapist in a room with a client. They don't sound like -- they're trying to get into the mind of the president, and that's a dangerous place to be for a number of reasons, especially when you're trying to prosecute these thought crimes, these process crimes, like a perjury or an objection. Look at the collusion case. It's about the meeting at Trump Tower. Remember, this lawyer comes in, says she has dirt on Hillary, she ends up having nothing, wants to discuss adoption, and they kicked her out of Trump Tower in 15 minutes. But guess what, right before she goes into Trump Tower, she meets with the founder of Fusion GPS, the guy behind the dossier. Who else granted her."

He hasn't even interviewed her yet. So, the only thing that I don't understand is they're asking a question about Manafort, and, you know, maybe he reached out to the Russians or the Russians reached out to them. That's new information that I hadn't seen. That's pretty alarming. But most of these questions, a danger zone."

And so, you had John Dowd who was the president's lawyer saying don't ever talk to this guy. This will trip you up. We know you're given to hyperbole and sometimes that fabrication, and then you will be caught up in some kind of lying thing. Don't do it. Trump was not listening to Dowd. Dowd exits. In comes Rudy Giuliani, who last week met with Mueller, has worked with Mueller in the past. Lots of talk today about who leaked this, and I'm sorry to say that much of it is about Rudy Giuliani as the new guy, the new player on the block. And what would Giuliani's intent be in leaking this document? I think you heard earlier some of my colleagues here say they think it's an effort to put pressure on Trump, so that Trump says, oh, I'm disgusted with all of this. I'm never going to do this. If I add that several lawyers are saying today that if, in fact, it was Trump or Trump's surrogate who leaked this that that may, in fact, contribute to an obstruction of justice case. So, I mean, it gets crazy. It does gets crazy. But, the idea is that the majority does of the questions do relate, as you were saying, Jesse, to obstruction of justice. It's not to say that it's the effort to try to prove collusion is now defunct. To the contrary, as you point out, there's the outreach element, Paul Manafort's outreach. There's the question about Flynn having discussions with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador."

So, what you're also seeing is that people are saying, you know, if Trump leaked it, there's a problem. If Trump leaked it, then where do we go with this?

Here's Congressman Maxine Waters, no relation, quote, sometimes Kanye West talks out of turn, and perhaps, sometimes, he needs some assistance in helping him to formulate some of his thoughts. We don't think that he actually means to do harm, but we're sure he really understands the impact of what he saying -- not sure. I think, maybe, he should think twice about politics, and maybe not have so much to say. So, Greg, I have to start with Maxine here. Has trouble formulating his thoughts?"

He actually left the box that she wanted him in, and she's saying you really shouldn't do that. You should really say exactly what we expect you to say, and that's what happened, same thing with Roseanne. The reason why people are upset is because -- it's not like the liberal -- it's not like liberal celebrity is pushing climate change on you, right? Everybody gets that. Once a celebrity says something that is not part of the liberal world, all hell breaks loose. And it's because they're actually leaving their bubble. So, they get -- if you saw Kanye West right now -- today on TMZ with him, and Candace Owens was there, it was insane how they treat -- it was like -- it was one of the most vibrant discussions and it's necessary to hear this stuff because you don't hear it because the entertainment industry is so uniform and they expected to live by a certain kind of belief system. And so, it's refreshing. And I thought that the way she swore -- you know, I don't like people swearing for the sake of swearing, but that was very natural."

And then, you say, oh, but it's about blacks all thinking in the box. Do you think black people can't think for themselves and don't have the capacity to say is this good for our community? Is this good for me and my family? Of course, people can. But people come to that, and the basis of real substantive action, taken or not taken, by the person you're discussing, Donald Trump. So, I think it's kind of insulting to black Americans to say, oh, Kanye says something and now, oh, gosh. All the -- all the Trump -- we're Kanye's fan.

People care about safe communities and their children being able to go to school. They care about being able to buy groceries at the end of the week, and celebrate family birthdays and things like that. That's what everybody cares about universally.

And in a little over an hour from now, the Fox News Channel will kick off our first debate of the midterm election season in the battleground state.

So clearly, they've all tried to be distinctive on this. And Patrick Morrisey, as you say, has a reputation for having gone after some of these companies, but he's had a complicated background.

This, according to the media, sparked outrage over cultural appropriation. First, always beware of such B.S. Stories like this are based on some weenie faking offense. And the media breathlessly covers it, because we're just suckers for outrage. But as always, the cultural appropriation offense is a sham. The idea that it's racist to incorporate something from another culture is so morally bankrupt it's actually deadly. Over time, healthy people adopt practices that enhance their lives, meaning they steal good things, not the bad. But all things come from somewhere else. So appropriation isn't just a complement to a culture, it's how civilizations thrive. Do you wear pajamas? If you're not an Indian Muslim, you're racist. Pajamas originated from Indian Muslims. And God forbid the sheets you sleep on are of Egyptian cotton. Do you eat yogurt? I bet a lot of social justice warriors do. How racist is that to appropriate the diet of Central Asian herdsmen from 6000 B.C.? Do you walk upright? How dare you steal the practice initiated by Ardipithecus ramidus, the earliest hominid from Ethiopia. In sum, if you live your life by avoiding cultural appropriation, you'd have no life whatsoever.

I have a very nice black dress kind of like that, that was made. It's silk and has a little bit of a pattern on it. So why wouldn't she -- she wanted to choose it because she thought it was a beautiful dress, and she wanted to have a special night and look great. I don't know. It's hard, because people impugn motives perhaps, on her that she wasn't thinking about."

The late-night hosts however, different story. They've rushed to Michelle Wolf's defense. STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS'S \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": This was a roast, and you're the ones who hired Michelle Wolf. Being mad at her for doing her job is like accusing a valet of briefly stealing your car. JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, ABC'S \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!\": You know, they hire these comedians because they're edgy, and then they get mad when they're edgy at the thing. SETH MEYERS, NBC'S \"LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS\": You hired her. That's like a parent sending an email saying, \"Yesterday's birthday was meant to celebrate Kevin turning 6 years old. Unfortunately, the stripper's dance routine was not in the spirit of the party.\""

The White House Correspondents' Association, it was an incredibly cowardly move on their part. They hired her. They knew what she was about to do. They wanted an edgy -- they wanted shock. And they've done this. And then they distanced themselves. It's just completely -- it's cowardice. And you know what? The next person that's asked to do it is going to have to formulate, you know, this occurrence. Like, \"Should I skip it because what if I go too far? Will they have my back?\" The interesting, though, is the same group of people that defended the comic didn't defend Kanye, which tells you who's more daring."

It's sort of like I do feel like we that do live television are sometimes more willing to come to the defense of people who maybe make a mistake live on air, because you just know what it's like. So I think that it's appropriate for them to defend her."

But I still take it back to the actual event, what transpired, what happened. Unkind, the mean-spirited things that were said, the bullying of Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And, you know, I'm still very upset about what happened there. I get that the comedians are coming to the defense, you know, of Michelle. OK, that's what they do, because they have to protect sort of their genre, what they do, their type of comedy. And a lot of it is very anti- you know, President Trump. Very much, like, negative, holding up severed heads. The Shakespeare in the Park stuff. Just a very intense level of, you know, vitriol that really doesn't show any kind of respect for -- you know, for the office of the presidency or for the women that work for him, quite frankly."
