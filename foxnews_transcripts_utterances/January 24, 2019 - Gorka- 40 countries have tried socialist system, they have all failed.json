      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Great to see you. Great show as always. Thank you. Welcome to “Hannity.” if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Your way of life in this country is under attack. Our crisis at our southern border is real, dangerous, and serious. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And on Monday, Border Patrol agents, they apprehended over 100 Central Americans attempting to climb over a section of the border wall. This in Huma, Arizona, and meanwhile, radical far left socialists, they have now taken control of the Democratic Party. They use the support border security. Now, it's about free markets, private industry, the American Dream vilified by many members on the left. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the hate Trump media, along with their friends in Hollywood, literally want to block you -- I know this is all most hard to believe, the American people, from wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, or showing support for President Trump. We're going to cover all of this on tonight's HANNITY Watch, on a rise of radical socialism, including, we have a brand-new segment we'll be debuting tonight called \"Villain of the Day.\" These people deserve it. This will shock your conscience. But, first, we start at the very top, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now for weeks, the speaker trying to play petty, political games with this nation any State of the Union on the president -- by the way, what is she fighting for? The president's fighting life and death. The president is fighting safety and security. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, she has barred the president from performing his constitutional duty in the House chamber, making her the first speaker in U.S. history to ever do so. She refused to compromise on budget negotiations, wouldn't even come to the table to talk about any kind of deal. She has been too busy on a luxurious vacation, other Democrats on a lobbyist paid junket, again, luxurious locations and resorts, planning taxpayer-funded excursions around the globe. And to even talk to the president, offer dramatic compromises, things she has that over the years she wants, she has no time for that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But tonight, the president goes above her bitter, petty, partisan gamesmanship. He postponed the State of the Union. Some seemed upset by this, they wanted him to go to an alternative location, but I think it is a bad idea. Why? Because the president, to give up the grandeur, giving the State of the Union in the House chamber, \"Mr. Speaker, the president of United States.\" That is a powerful moment. You have congressmen and women and senators, literally staking out their seats so they can shake the president's hand 14 hours ahead of time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No other place can match that symbolic location, the grandeur, and this president deserves nothing less. And I'm sure that will happen in the near future. This is about so much more than politics. This is about your safety, your security. This is about the safety of the country, and literally life-and- death. Now, this is about a president fulfilling a promise to secure our southern border. This is about saving American lives that are impacted by gangs, cartels, drugs, violence. It is life-and-death. People are dying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ninety percent of that heroin that gets into this country comes from that border. It's about 10,000 new migrants now obtaining visas from the government of Mexico to travel through the country in order to make their way north into our country, because we have unsecured borders. Now when the U.S. government is reopened, the president will hold a State of the Union where it belongs, in the House chambers, with members of both parties, hopefully, president. In the meantime, the shutdown does continue, the president has been unrelenting, fighting to make the country safer. Democrats continue to feed their insatiable appetite, this pathological hatred, this division that they have, and of course, it is always about a desire for power. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And breaking tonight, the White House is reportedly now drafting a national emergency order, and allocating $7 billion for that wall that would require zero congressional approval. And today, the president reassured Americans that he will get guaranteed funds for the wall one way or another. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

I have other alternatives if I have to, I will use those alternatives if I have to. But we want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country.

The White House doors are wide open, he is willing to compromise as he has shown time and again. He is even willing to take a prorated funding rate for the wall for a short period of time. Give Congress another chance to do their job and find a resolution. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But if the stalemate continues, it is obvious, Democrats refuse to come to the table. The president is clear, he will declare a national emergency and solve the problem himself. It may take time to fight in the courts, but in my opinion, he will win. By the way, that will happen. Unfortunately, as we showed you last night, Nancy Pelosi seems to be standing for nothing but being against us before. In the height of budget negotiations, she and other top Democrats, they tried to slip away for the seven days oversee junket courtesy of you, the taxpayers. And, of course, nothing new for Pelosi, look at this. According to Judicial Watch, during her last term as speaker, she racked up a massive travel bill. With the U.S. Air Force, over a two year period, she spent more than $2 million of your money on air travel, 100,000 of which was in-flight expenses. That means food and booze, all of the politicians working so hard, like half of the year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, thankfully, the president put the kibosh on her most recent overseas junket, and today, we did send FOX News contributor, our friend Lawrence Jones, to the streets of New York City to see what Americans really think about the radical, extreme, socialist, Democratic speaker, Nancy Pelosi, at her so-called leadership. Let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Obamacare resulted in ballooning health care costs, out-of-control premiums, limited choices, lost doctors. But that is really the tip of the iceberg. A brand-new foxnews.com article points out false promises that socialists made throughout history. Look at Hugo Chavez, remember he promised the people in Venezuela universal health care? Now, Venezuela has virtually no basic health care supplies at all. Lenin, remember him? He proposed to provide bread and a land to the Soviet Union's poor. Following that redistribution scam, well, the famine killed 5 million people. India's first socialist prime minister promised an end to poverty. To this day, India's wealth disparity, rampant poverty, is worse than almost any place else in this world. Let's not forget Chairman Mao, great leap forward, that redistribution plan resulted in the deaths of 45 million people. Socialism is deadly. Socialism causes poverty, can be evil.

But when you see someone like Nancy Pelosi or a mainstream democrat, acquiesce to people like her, it really starts to worry you when the majority of the country seems to be leaning in that direction, specifically millennials, which is soon to be the biggest generation ever in our nation.

The black Hebrew Israelites taunting those kids. Sick, vicious, racial slurs, vulgar language, calling them \"future school shooters.\" And of course, the deranged left, they refused to confront the facts, they're continuing their sick attacks. For example, look at actress Alyssa Milano, writing in a new piece that anyone that wears a MAGA hat, Make America Great Again hat, identifies with \"White supremacy and misogyny,\" and that their new white hoods. Really? It gets even worse. New York Times publishing an article this week where Reporter John Eligon downplays the hate spewing from the black Hebrew Israelites that started it all, even going so far as to describe them as, \"Sidewalk ministers who use confrontation as their gospel.\" And before writing about their \"Attention-grabbing tactics,\" now attorney Robert Barnes, who is representing some of those students, says he is providing a Friday deadline to allow any defamatory, libelous comments about these students to be corrected, and cited - by the way, posts by Reza Aslan, Maggie Haberman, that have yet to be retracted. But here's a bigger question for Ms. Milano and others. If you really care about misogyny, homophobia, racism, why are you silent when it comes to that radical hate group, which, as we've explained, has a long history of bigotry? Here's the reality. The MAGA movement, big tent, all inclusive, it's about making this country great again under the President you loved. Obama, 13 million more Americans - that's right - food stamps, 8 million more in property. We told you that, but you forgot. Now millions out of poverty and off of food stamps, more jobs, the lowest - we have a million more jobs than we have people to fill them right now in America. Amazing! And by the way, it is rooted in compassion, standing up for the forgotten men and women in this country that were nearly destroyed under the Obama policies. It's getting big results. For example, just show today's new data, jobless claims, the lowest they've been since 1969. And remember, unemployment, record low for almost every demographic group in the country. We have talked about this many, many times. And it's continuing to work. Wage growth is the best in a decade. Remember, under Obama, we had millions more in poverty, homeownership rate dropped to the lowest in 50 years. It was the worst recovery in - since the 1940s. By the way, he added $10 trillion to our debt. Those were the people that were marginalized. Socialism failing. The millions more who want food stamps, looking for a way out, and they found it under Donald Trump, which is why on this show we push for, yes, conservativism, because it works. Deregulation, the economy opens up, jobs, opportunities created, fighting to keep factories and all the building going on in America, job creation in America, manufacturing centers in America, common sense immigration to allow law-abiding people to pursue a better life while keeping us safe and secure. Market-based health care reforms at lower cost, increased access to care. Oh, like concierge service for every American when you have these health care co-ops or health care savings accounts.

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker. Great to see you. Great show as always. Thank you. Welcome to “Hannity.” Your way of life in this country is under attack. Our crisis at our southern border is real, dangerous, and serious. And on Monday, Border Patrol agents, they apprehended over 100 Central Americans attempting to climb over a section of the border wall. This in Huma, Arizona, and meanwhile, radical far left socialists, they have now taken control of the Democratic Party. They use the support border security. Now, it's about free markets, private industry, the American Dream vilified by many members on the left. And the hate Trump media, along with their friends in Hollywood, literally want to block you -- I know this is all most hard to believe, the American people, from wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, or showing support for President Trump. We're going to cover all of this on tonight's HANNITY Watch, on a rise of radical socialism, including, we have a brand-new segment we'll be debuting tonight called \"Villain of the Day.\" These people deserve it. This will shock your conscience. But, first, we start at the very top, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now for weeks, the speaker trying to play petty, political games with this nation any State of the Union on the president -- by the way, what is she fighting for? The president's fighting life and death. The president is fighting safety and security. Well, she has barred the president from performing his constitutional duty in the House chamber, making her the first speaker in U.S. history to ever do so. She refused to compromise on budget negotiations, wouldn't even come to the table to talk about any kind of deal. She has been too busy on a luxurious vacation, other Democrats on a lobbyist paid junket, again, luxurious locations and resorts, planning taxpayer-funded excursions around the globe. And to even talk to the president, offer dramatic compromises, things she has that over the years she wants, she has no time for that. But tonight, the president goes above her bitter, petty, partisan gamesmanship. He postponed the State of the Union. Some seemed upset by this, they wanted him to go to an alternative location, but I think it is a bad idea. Why? Because the president, to give up the grandeur, giving the State of the Union in the House chamber, \"Mr. Speaker, the president of United States.\" That is a powerful moment. You have congressmen and women and senators, literally staking out their seats so they can shake the president's hand 14 hours ahead of time. No other place can match that symbolic location, the grandeur, and this president deserves nothing less. And I'm sure that will happen in the near future. This is about so much more than politics. This is about your safety, your security. This is about the safety of the country, and literally life-and- death. Now, this is about a president fulfilling a promise to secure our southern border. This is about saving American lives that are impacted by gangs, cartels, drugs, violence. It is life-and-death. People are dying. Ninety percent of that heroin that gets into this country comes from that border. It's about 10,000 new migrants now obtaining visas from the government of Mexico to travel through the country in order to make their way north into our country, because we have unsecured borders. Now when the U.S. government is reopened, the president will hold a State of the Union where it belongs, in the House chambers, with members of both parties, hopefully, president. In the meantime, the shutdown does continue, the president has been unrelenting, fighting to make the country safer. Democrats continue to feed their insatiable appetite, this pathological hatred, this division that they have, and of course, it is always about a desire for power. And breaking tonight, the White House is reportedly now drafting a national emergency order, and allocating $7 billion for that wall that would require zero congressional approval. And today, the president reassured Americans that he will get guaranteed funds for the wall one way or another. Let's take a look."

      "utterance": "Well, one of the ideas suggested is they open it, they pay a sort of prorated down payment for the wall, which I think the people agree that you need, you need the wall. I have other alternatives if I have to, I will use those alternatives if I have to. But we want to go through the system. We have to have a wall in this country. We have criminals pouring into our country. We have no choice but to have a wall or a barrier. If we don't have that, it is just not going to work."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Again, I asked, what is Nancy Pelosi fighting for? What is in the best interest of the country? Now, President Trump remains ready, willing to negotiate with Democratic leadership. The White House doors are wide open, he is willing to compromise as he has shown time and again. He is even willing to take a prorated funding rate for the wall for a short period of time. Give Congress another chance to do their job and find a resolution. But if the stalemate continues, it is obvious, Democrats refuse to come to the table. The president is clear, he will declare a national emergency and solve the problem himself. It may take time to fight in the courts, but in my opinion, he will win. By the way, that will happen. Unfortunately, as we showed you last night, Nancy Pelosi seems to be standing for nothing but being against us before. In the height of budget negotiations, she and other top Democrats, they tried to slip away for the seven days oversee junket courtesy of you, the taxpayers. And, of course, nothing new for Pelosi, look at this. According to Judicial Watch, during her last term as speaker, she racked up a massive travel bill. With the U.S. Air Force, over a two year period, she spent more than $2 million of your money on air travel, 100,000 of which was in-flight expenses. That means food and booze, all of the politicians working so hard, like half of the year. Now, thankfully, the president put the kibosh on her most recent overseas junket, and today, we did send FOX News contributor, our friend Lawrence Jones, to the streets of New York City to see what Americans really think about the radical, extreme, socialist, Democratic speaker, Nancy Pelosi, at her so-called leadership. Let's take a look."

And that brings us to tonight's \"Hannity Watch,\" report on the 2020 race, we see nearly every single Democrat announcing her candidacy, the first thing they do, I've got to apologize for this position I had that may sound conservative, or you will hate me. You have Kirsten Gillibrand, she apologized from, one, supporting the Second Amendment. Then you have Tulsi Gabbard apologizing for the mixed track record on social issues, yet somehow we're still waiting on Elizabeth Warren's apology for faking and benefiting from a lie and saying she is a Native American. Warren did, however, find time to propose brand-new taxes, right there, check it out. She is always finding new and creative ways to pick your pocket and penalize Americans that she describes as wealthy. Somehow, she wants to take that money and redistribute it. Meanwhile, one of Warren's 2020 primary opponents, Senator Kamala Harris is spending her time raising an enormous amount of money, buying up all of the Facebook ads that she can find, and of course, trashing the president. She wants him to open up Trump Tower as a shelter to the victims of the shutdown. There are other people that own those units, he actually sold them. They are not his. Take a look."

I think Nancy Pelosi is pouting, I think the Democratic Party is pouting, but I also think they are taking a moment from the American people, from the president, to lay out to the agenda, what has been able to accomplish, what he hasn't been able to accomplish and have that dialogue. But I don't think Democrats are interested in this. What they had failed to tell us, what was the pivot? 2006, you are for the wall, you prefer fencing, but you changed.

Ninety percent of heroine, we have drug trafficking, human trafficking, cartels, gang members. We have 4,000, homicides.

That's all I heard for a couple of years. But now, we've got to Nancy Pelosi, she won't take a meeting. She shuts down the debate. Remember when she took the gavel back when McCarthy handed it to her, and said they were going to be open and transparent, they were going to be like a town hall on the floor of the House?

But 2020 is going to be different. Now, they are going to try and really out-resistance each other, to the point where they are going to go so far to the left, how are the people going to perceive Donald Trump, straight up, why he is fighting? He is fighting for life and death. He's fighting to stop drugs, violence, cartels, gang members, and all of these problems that are caused by having open borders.

You know, AOC, she voted against Nancy Pelosi's funding package because it had money in there for ICE. That is how radical left these people are. Open borders, they want to tear down that wall. They don't want the Immigration Customs Enforcement. But the American people do, that is why the president needs to stay the course, keep making the case. And let's be for what the border patrol wants. That's what the men and women who served on the border need.

Breaking today, U.S. jobless claims -- they are now at their lowest level since 1969. Perspective, the Mets won the World Series. Low regulation, biggest tax cut in history, private enterprise, capitalism, free markets, low taxes, it works. We now have record low continued unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, and our vets are going back to work. Meanwhile, the socialist country of Venezuela tonight is in a full collapse, now watching the chaos and madness unfold, it is very important, especially in light of the new, radical, extreme socialist Democratic Party in this country that want some of the exact same policies adopted here. Remember after eight years of Obama? Spread the wealth around, remember that comment, Joe the Plumber? Thirteen million more Americans, after eight years of Obama, on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. We have the lowest homeownership rate in 51 years. He doubled the national debt, and accumulated more debt than any other president before him combined. It wasn't good for the economy. Now, the forgotten men and women, off of food stamps, back in the workforce in record numbers. In Venezuela today, you have hyperinflation, food shortages, ongoing public health emergencies, rampant violence, all causing the country's people to take to the streets, in yet another day of very tense protests. The United States, Canada, others, are now backing the presidency of the opposition leader to the Maduro socialist regime after a corrupt, rigged elections gave Maduro yet another term. Here's what President Trump had to say about this ongoing crisis in Venezuela under socialism yet again. Take a look."

That's right, de Blasio, Comrade de Blasio in New York said, it's a lot of wealth in New York, just in the wrong hands. He wants to take it and give it away. Socialism always collapses, but for some reason, the new star, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party in Washington, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, wants to bring parts of the system, a lot of the system, to the U.S. In fact, she is so supportive of Venezuela's socialist regime that she is going against our own state department and actually backing the murderous dictatorship of the socialist, Nicolas Maduro."

That is why she secured powerful memberships on, let's see, oh, oversight, and the Financial Services Committee. Uh-oh. Speaker Pelosi literally doing every thing she can to appease the Democrats' rising star. Today, she was the only Democrat to vote against the bill to reopen the government because it funded ICE, the people that risk their lives to protect us. She wants all immigration enforcement abolished. And remember, she referred to climate change as this generation's World War II. My father fought in World War II, no. She said the world is going to end in 12 years if her green new deal doesn't go into effect. So, it is a Scary-o-Cortez. Trying to scare and frighten everyone. The world is ending at 12 years. She also wants to nationalize health care, energy companies, any other private enterprise that dares get in the way of her vision of this socialist utopian redistribution. Sound familiar? Because President Obama's plan to provide health care for all, remember, keep your doctor, keep your plan, save less -- a lie, never happen. The opposite happened. Obamacare resulted in ballooning health care costs, out-of-control premiums, limited choices, lost doctors. But that is really the tip of the iceberg. A brand-new foxnews.com article points out false promises that socialists made throughout history. Look at Hugo Chavez, remember he promised the people in Venezuela universal health care? Now, Venezuela has virtually no basic health care supplies at all. Lenin, remember him? He proposed to provide bread and a land to the Soviet Union's poor. Following that redistribution scam, well, the famine killed 5 million people. India's first socialist prime minister promised an end to poverty. To this day, India's wealth disparity, rampant poverty, is worse than almost any place else in this world. Let's not forget Chairman Mao, great leap forward, that redistribution plan resulted in the deaths of 45 million people. Socialism is deadly. Socialism causes poverty, can be evil. It has never worked. It never will work. Here with reaction is \"The Relatable\" podcast host, Allie Beth Stuckey, and the host of \"America First\" on the Salem Radio Network, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Dr. Gorka, you know firsthand as a world traveler, socialism when tried, has failed. Obama tried, he wanted to redistribute the wealth. His policies, stifling regulation, high taxes, redistribution, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. It doesn't work."

I think it is very telling that she has these latent totalitarian tendencies whereby she thinks the people's will in Venezuela should be ignored, and Maduro's regime should be recognized. Can you imagine, Sean, if in the last six days, the media had paid as much attention to Venezuela as they did to the fake news about the Catholic Covington schoolboys being racist? If they had actually told the truth about Venezuela, nobody in America would wish what this woman wishes to put upon us. Forty countries have tried this, it has all failed.

But when you see someone like Nancy Pelosi or a mainstream democrat, acquiesce to people like her, it really starts to worry you when the majority of the country seems to be leaning in that direction, specifically millennials, which is soon to be the biggest generation ever in our nation. But Nancy Pelosi understands that she has to acquiesce to the far left radical open border, socialist Democrats, or else Democrats aren't going to stay in power because people are looking to people like Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders to be the future of this country, unfortunately."

The black Hebrew Israelites taunting those kids. Sick, vicious, racial slurs, vulgar language, calling them \"future school shooters.\" And of course, the deranged left, they refused to confront the facts, they're continuing their sick attacks. For example, look at actress Alyssa Milano, writing in a new piece that anyone that wears a MAGA hat, Make America Great Again hat, identifies with \"White supremacy and misogyny,\" and that their new white hoods. Really? It gets even worse. New York Times publishing an article this week where Reporter John Eligon downplays the hate spewing from the black Hebrew Israelites that started it all, even going so far as to describe them as, \"Sidewalk ministers who use confrontation as their gospel.\" And before writing about their \"Attention-grabbing tactics,\" now attorney Robert Barnes, who is representing some of those students, says he is providing a Friday deadline to allow any defamatory, libelous comments about these students to be corrected, and cited - by the way, posts by Reza Aslan, Maggie Haberman, that have yet to be retracted. But here's a bigger question for Ms. Milano and others. If you really care about misogyny, homophobia, racism, why are you silent when it comes to that radical hate group, which, as we've explained, has a long history of bigotry? Here's the reality. The MAGA movement, big tent, all inclusive, it's about making this country great again under the President you loved. Obama, 13 million more Americans - that's right - food stamps, 8 million more in property. We told you that, but you forgot. Now millions out of poverty and off of food stamps, more jobs, the lowest - we have a million more jobs than we have people to fill them right now in America. Amazing! And by the way, it is rooted in compassion, standing up for the forgotten men and women in this country that were nearly destroyed under the Obama policies. It's getting big results. For example, just show today's new data, jobless claims, the lowest they've been since 1969. And remember, unemployment, record low for almost every demographic group in the country. We have talked about this many, many times. And it's continuing to work. Wage growth is the best in a decade. Remember, under Obama, we had millions more in poverty, homeownership rate dropped to the lowest in 50 years. It was the worst recovery in - since the 1940s. By the way, he added $10 trillion to our debt. Those were the people that were marginalized. Socialism failing. The millions more who want food stamps, looking for a way out, and they found it under Donald Trump, which is why on this show we push for, yes, conservativism, because it works. Deregulation, the economy opens up, jobs, opportunities created, fighting to keep factories and all the building going on in America, job creation in America, manufacturing centers in America, common sense immigration to allow law-abiding people to pursue a better life while keeping us safe and secure. Market-based health care reforms at lower cost, increased access to care. Oh, like concierge service for every American when you have these health care co-ops or health care savings accounts. Joining us now, former Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino; nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Larry Elder. OK. A hat?"

So it's not just that we're at historic rates of black unemployment being at its lowest, it's that the disparities are shrinking too. This is a fake story about the MAGA hats.

The Hill's John Solomon new report just out detailing FBI General Counsel James Baker's unusual interventions in the Russia probe. Also our own Gregg Jarrett has an article on foxnews.com about testimony that shows even more FBI and DOJ misconduct that was part of the effort to hurt Donald Trump. And joining us now, The Hill's investigative columnist, John Solomon; and the author of the number one best seller The Russia Hoax, Fox News analyst, Gregg Jarrett. Gregg, we'll start with you. This is important what you found out."

      "utterance": "Yes. I was able to confirm the testimony of a top FBI lawyer by the name of Trisha Anderson, who told Congress last August that Sally Yates, then the Deputy Attorney General, and Andrew McCabe, the Deputy FBI Director, did a line-by-line examination and review, and their own independent review, of the FISA application to spy on the Trump campaign, which means that they were involved in an egregious abuse of power because none of the information contained was verified, and that is a direct violation of FBI regulations. And they were perpetrating a fraud on the FISA court, which could be several different felonies as well. Six different felonies."

In October, he asked to review the FISA warrant, which is unusual. The General Counsel normally doesn't review them. And then after the FISA warrant is issued, he walks in some more information, a new version of a Steele dossier that he got from a liberal reporter named David Corn. These are three - by his own admission, these are unusual things he did. Three extraordinary interventions by the FBI General Counsel. On top of Bruce Ohr's unusual intervention that we talked about, the State Department's unusual intervention, John Brennan's unusual intervention. There were an awful lot of political people that were intervening in this case. It's an--"

It's a lot of fun. A bunch of FBI agents called me after this story came out tonight, and one of them very highly decorated, deep in the NSA program, said this. After reading this, there must have been a new division in the FBI called the leakers, liars, and lawlessness group. And that's--"

We're going to crown a new villain. Tonight, it's not hard. Look there. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, the New York State legislature. Many of you won't believe this. This week, the State of New York legalized late-term abortions, up to the ninth month. That will be called infanticide. Those are children that are viable to live on their own. That makes him the Villain of the Day, and he should be ashamed of himself. Before we go tonight, we want to hear from you. Have something to tell us that we covered? @seanhannity on Twitter, and of course, hannity.com, where it says Right Sean. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues.
