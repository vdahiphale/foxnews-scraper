Rouhani tweeting this. Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. Never threaten the Iranian nation.

There are threats of retaliation, there are threats of revenge, there are threats to shed American blood. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've heard it from their political leaders, we've heard it from their military leaders, we heard it again today during the funeral of Qasem Soleimani in Tehran. Over a million people, they say turned out to mourn him and they say they are going to attack the U.S. homeland. They've said they're going to attack the White House, Saudi Arabia, ships in the Persian Gulf, U.S. embassies as well as numerous other facilities. They also said they are going to attack and target President Trump himself and they put an $80 million bounty on his head and they then had to ask the crowd if they would donate $1 - a dollar each to finance that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We also hired from Soleimani's successor. His name is Esmail Ghaani. He's been in command of the Quds force since 1997. He was in charge of their Afghanistan operations and critically, he said he was going to continue Soleimani's legacy of harnessing proxies around the region, using them to wield Iran's power and today he spoke to the leader of Hamas, a worrying sign that the two might be planning something together. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The other big announcement out of Iran today that they would no longer abide by limits set by the 2015 nuclear agreement, that they would start enriching uranium, they would start breaking the centrifuge levels so they would start collecting material to build an atomic weapon. They have always wanted that bomb. They now seem on a path to try and get it. 7 to 11 months is what experts estimate it might take them to break out. And in the middle of all these tensions the U.S. is now scaled back its operations in Iraq to boost its defensive measures. They've also dispatched another 3000 troops on top of the 750 who have already gone to Kuwait as a precaution. From a U.S. perspective though, an official has said that will be no more U.S. strikes unless Iran does something that warrants it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And on Sunday night, there was that vote, that vote by the Iraqi parliament that said, all U.S. troops must leave Iraq. It's a non-binding vote. There a few more stages for its pass through but it is a worrying sign of how conflicted Iraq is and certainly how tense the whole region is. Martha.",

And it's actually I think pretty gross to see this entire line of argument. If Warren wants an answer to the question that she posted, why now, the answer is Iranian behavior and events.

We talk about risking war and that was part of Elizabeth Warren's answer there. You know, why are we getting closer to war? The Iranian regime has been waging war on Americans now for years. Soleimani himself was responsible for the deaths at least 600 Americans over the course of years. And I think that there was a sense within the regime that they could continue to act with impunity and President Trump eventually disabuse them of that notion in a very shocking and bracing way.

There are threats of retaliation, there are threats of revenge, there are threats to shed American blood. We've heard it from their political leaders, we've heard it from their military leaders, we heard it again today during the funeral of Qasem Soleimani in Tehran. Over a million people, they say turned out to mourn him and they say they are going to attack the U.S. homeland. They've said they're going to attack the White House, Saudi Arabia, ships in the Persian Gulf, U.S. embassies as well as numerous other facilities. They also said they are going to attack and target President Trump himself and they put an $80 million bounty on his head and they then had to ask the crowd if they would donate $1 - a dollar each to finance that. We also hired from Soleimani's successor. His name is Esmail Ghaani. He's been in command of the Quds force since 1997. He was in charge of their Afghanistan operations and critically, he said he was going to continue Soleimani's legacy of harnessing proxies around the region, using them to wield Iran's power and today he spoke to the leader of Hamas, a worrying sign that the two might be planning something together. The other big announcement out of Iran today that they would no longer abide by limits set by the 2015 nuclear agreement, that they would start enriching uranium, they would start breaking the centrifuge levels so they would start collecting material to build an atomic weapon. They have always wanted that bomb. They now seem on a path to try and get it. 7 to 11 months is what experts estimate it might take them to break out. And in the middle of all these tensions the U.S. is now scaled back its operations in Iraq to boost its defensive measures. They've also dispatched another 3000 troops on top of the 750 who have already gone to Kuwait as a precaution. From a U.S. perspective though, an official has said that will be no more U.S. strikes unless Iran does something that warrants it. And on Sunday night, there was that vote, that vote by the Iraqi parliament that said, all U.S. troops must leave Iraq. It's a non-binding vote. There a few more stages for its pass through but it is a worrying sign of how conflicted Iraq is and certainly how tense the whole region is. Martha."

Sending more and more troops to the region, further escalating tensions and designating Iran's military as a terrorist organization, further escalating this conflict with Iran.

That means they're closer to developing a nuclear weapon capability, putting us and the world at risk and number two, because our forces in Iraq for example are no longer going to be focusing on defeating and ensuring that Al-Qaeda and ISIS are not allowed a resurgence, the Commander - our commander there yesterday just said, we're not doing that anymore because now our troops have to focus on Iran allowing ISIS and Al-Qaeda to create and mount a resurgence that further puts our national security at risk."

But here's the key that as Commander-in-Chief, the Commander-in-Chief should not be making decisions based on who is a bad guy or even who has blood on their hands. The Commander-in-Chief needs to make a decision about what is in the best national security interests of our country and I just gave you the two biggest examples of how Trump's decision has undermined our national security and made the American people less safe. That is at the crux of what is wrong with the decision that Donald Trump made and why it's so critical that we have a Commander-in-Chief who has experience and understanding in both foreign policy and our national security to make - and with the foresight to see what the consequences of those decisions will be.

For months now Iran has been escalating its aggression against the United States and our partners, bombing ships that are in the Persian Gulf, attacking unmanned aircraft of ours back in June, striking Saudi Arabian oil fields and increasing the pace and the scale of their attacks against our troops in Iraq. Couple of Fridays ago an American was killed. President made it clear from the very beginning that if Iran killed an American, they would pay severe consequences. That's exactly what happened last week when he ordered the death of Qasem Soleimani. Let's remember who he was as well. He's been the terror mastermind of Iran for decades. He has the blood of thousands of Americans on his hands. So we didn't just get vengeance and justice for all those Americans who died at his hands and for their families but we also made America safer in the future as well."

Donald Trump showed just last week what happens when you kill a single American. He would order the killing of your terror mastermind. Let's remember Qasem Soleimani was flying from Lebanon where he had been visiting with Hezbollah, his terrorist proxy there into Iraq. He was killed at the Baghdad International Airport, not with an Uber driver but with the head of Hezbollah in Iraq as well. They were plotting to kill more Americans in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. That's the lesson that Ayatollah needs to take away from this. The President nor I nor many other Americans want to start another war but we aren't going to let Iran wage a proxy war against us without fighting back."

When I was in the army we prepared every day to be on that to our recall to be deployed anywhere within 24 hours to hot spot around the world. They're not going to the Middle East to be an advance force, to invade Iran or to occupy Iran as we saw in Afghanistan or Iraq in the last 20 years. They're going simply to augment our defenses, to be prepared for any strike and hopefully this to deter such strikes. You wouldn't expect the President to make those decisions in long consultation with Congress.

It would take four Republicans to move the needle here. Joining me now Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst. So you know, it's interesting because we're in the middle of all of this Iran news, right? And then all of a sudden John Bolton comes out and raises his head and his hand and says well, if I'm subpoenaed by the Senate, I actually would talk. I would come in and testify and tell my story and just to remind everybody, this is the National Security Adviser who said that he believed that you know, Rudy was a hand grenade that was going to blow them all up and that he didn't want to have anything to do with the Ukrainian drug deal, he called it."

This is a religious leadership dictatorship that is really on the brink in a way that they haven't been for a long time. And in fact, the last time they were on that brink was 2009, when a lot of people feel there was an ability for the Obama administration to have pushed a nudged a little bit to have given these people a chance of freedom and didn't take advantage of it.

And in it, you said, once this round of tensions subsides either in a new relationship or with the current Iranian regime or its successor government, which is another interesting idea, because maybe there's a room for a shake-up there which I think a lot of the protesters would like to see happen -- it's time for us to turn our resources from the Middle East to Asia. What do you mean?"

So, they've been killing each other at least at their throats for decades, and centuries, and millennia. So, we don't need their royal anymore. And the big game changer is because of our energy independence. You know, two or three years ago we would have that conversation and we would have said what we have to say in the Middle East --"

Before I let you go, I want to ask you one quick question about John Bolton because a lot of folks out there seem to think that this news is seismic. This is the political headline. Bolton curveball threatens to upend the impeachment trial. And here's a little bit of the reaction on TV. Watch."

He kicks them one more time on the way out the door and that's what he did to Bolton. Now we know John Bolton, we worked with him, he's not going to win miss congeniality. And so, I worry that what he might say could embarrass the president. I don't think the president did anything illegal. I think the president talks a lot but I think if you look at his actual what he does, what are his deeds, I don't think he has done anything illegal. Maybe a little bit inappropriate but nothing that rises to the level of an impeachment. And when I listen to these people, you know, Judge Mukasey said, what these people are, they're just sitting around inhaling their own exhaust fumes and getting high on them."

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "No, it's embarrassing and it's reckless. There's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that this was done for political reasons. Elizabeth Warren, I understand put out a tweet early on calling Soleimani a murderer and that became a problem for her on the left and so she had to backtrack and basically walk it back and direct all of her rhetorical fire at President Trump which I think is not what a statesman or statesperson would do. And it's actually I think pretty gross to see this entire line of argument. If Warren wants an answer to the question that she posted, why now, the answer is Iranian behavior and events. They provoked, they escalated, we drew a red line. And unlike other presidents, this president actually enforce this one and it's not a mystery. And this conspiracy theory I think with no evidence is irresponsible."

So, I mean, on that level, I think guy is right. Now there is precedent. Obviously, people point at President Clinton and some of his behavior in terms of going to war during the impeachment process back in '99. But even in that regard, the question, the serious question to my mind is, Mr. President, speaking of President Trump, do you understand the consequences? What is -- where are we going? How do we say to the American people that this is in our best interest at this time and in fact, this is going to somehow de-escalate tensions? To the contrary, it's escalated tensions, we are sending troops now to the Middle East. This is a president --"

Yes, but in the context of all of this escalation, the president, you know, against the wishes of some other members of Congress and the Senate decided not to take kinetic action after the Saudi oil tankers were hit. And then he said, you know, this is about American lives. And if you cross that line you are going to have huge hell to pay."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

In this case, and I think this is something that previous presidents across political lines have faced, Martha, and they have decided that unless you are ready to come to terms with the consequences of potential war, starting war not just between U.S. and Iran, but Saudi Arabia, Iraq, all the kind of demonstrations we've seen, that you don't do this kind of thing on an impetuous basis. You have to think about it."

There is a lot of reporting about how this was an option on the table for weeks that the president had declined to act on previously. And then with yet another provocation following the death of an American, wounding four others, eventually the president got to the end of his rope. And I think that that's what's important here. We talk about risking war and that was part of Elizabeth Warren's answer there. You know, why are we getting closer to war? The Iranian regime has been waging war on Americans now for years. Soleimani himself was responsible for the deaths at least 600 Americans over the course of years. And I think that there was a sense within the regime that they could continue to act with impunity and President Trump eventually disabuse them of that notion in a very shocking and bracing way. And certainly, I hope they are paying attention because the president made it clear at some point he's not going to mess around anymore."

What are the consequences? And I think lots of Americans given the administration's willingness to play with facts and tell lies, that people are questioning what's the credibility of the evidence because Soleimani has been a danger to Americans all along, but is he worth a war? I think President Trump said earlier no."
