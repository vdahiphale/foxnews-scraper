But I would also add this, Charles. If he wants to help the GOP win the House back -- the GOP lost four House seats in 2018 in Orange County alone. And if he wants to end the stupidity that we saw today with the Lewandowski hearing, then this collusion and impeachment forever with the Democratic House, he has to help Republicans win the House back in 2020.

And then he does have to worry about those seats. It was seven seats that Republican loss -- Republicans lost, over half their delegation, clean sweep for Democrats in Orange County. They proceeded through California with Serena Williams-like dominance. And in order to win back the House, which is a long shot at best, they are going to have to be competitive, but be careful, because, in California, it is deeply blue.

There are other states, though, where he can do it. I mean, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton only won by less than 3,000 votes. Nevada, Maine, about 20,000 votes. Those, I think, possibly winnable, California not so much. But it is interesting what he's doing in California. He actually sent some officials there ahead of him that talked to state and city officials and homeless reps about the homelessness problem in California. And it was something he was asked about today on Air Force One on his way to California. And he said he's been talking to Ben Carson, HUD secretary, about it, and they plan to do something about it. And what's interesting is, he mentioned that a lot of people, even foreigners, move to San Francisco, move to Los Angeles, because they want a better life there, and then they're finding that these homeless in camps with tents are making it difficult.

And although the U.S. and Israel were the first countries to essentially deploy them legally in the global war on terror, Iran, China, Russia have gotten into the game aggressively. And the reason why is, because, like we have seen with how the Americans and how we use them in Israel against terror targets for strategic strikes, they're very cheap. The cost of innocent life is much lower than it would be, say, flying an F-16 over a target. The training is much more significantly reduced, and that it not only saves lives and reduces risks to the soldiers who are operating them, but you can essentially suicide target these drones, the way they were used in conjunction, Charles, with cruise missiles.

And so they're very accessible. And the fact is, is that explosives with very little amount of training can be attached to these drones. And they can be used to target civilians. They can be used to target our oil fields here. They can be used to target nuclear facilities. And the truth is, is that you actually need Russian and U.S.-grade anti- missile defense systems to have the radar capability to be able to essentially catch these drones before they enter a certain proximity to your airspace, similar to LAX or Boston Airport. You need sophisticated radar technology to be able to spot these things to defend and thwart them. So they're really dangerous. And it's definitely something that I think all of the U.S. government agencies should not only be looking at in terms of technology to beef up all of our national security interests, but to make sure that our law enforcement agencies have this technology as well, because these things can be targeted at a mall.

So, really, any kind of military action where we would bomb or target targets in a foreign land would have to be approved by Congress in advance. They don't just happen. Presidents can respond in self-defense, but we're talking about days to weeks later. And this wasn't an attack really on the U.S., remember. It was an attack on Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is saying that the weapons are Iranian. And I really trust that that probably is going to be true. But the question of where the attack came from, whether it came from Iran or whether it came from Iraq or it came from Yemen, I don't think I have seen incontrovertible evidence yet. People are leaning one way or the other. But, really, I think there needs to be a thorough investigation of this. And if the U.S. is going to ally with Saudi Arabia and join a war with Iran, that's a big step. And Congress needs to debate this.

I have been a proponent of diplomacy, but Iran escalating this in this fashion, even if it's only Iranian weapons used by somebody else, Iran is still allowing these weapons to get into the hands of people who are now attacking Saudi Arabia outright. Yes, it's become very, very difficult to find a peaceful solution. But it doesn't always mean that it's the U.S. that has to get involved, that the U.S. has to be bombing other countries."

However, I don't blame the White House and I don't blame the DOJ for trying to frustrate the investigation of the president, because we don't know what that investigation is. Stated differently, if the Congress decides they want to impeach the president, there are no privileges. Until they do that, they're going to get this resistance. There's absolutely no obstacle to Congress getting its hands on whatever it wants from the president once it decides to impeach. But as Congressman Brindisi nicely pointed out, the Democrats are schizophrenic on this. Ms. Pelosi doesn't want it to happen because she knows it's going to be a backlash. She's got 50 or 60 hard-core lefties who hate the president, who have districts where they want them to do it. She's trying to walk that narrow line. It doesn't work."

Our monetary system is so complex. And all behind-the-scenes work, we usually never even notice it, it's flawless. But, today, the Fed actually had to intervene and pump in about $65 billion into the system, so banks could clear trades. And, again, it's not because there's a meltdown happening or something very unusual happening. It's really because it indicates that there really isn't enough cash in the system.

We have Mario Draghi saying negative interest rates are great, and that they're going to continue. They're going to pump in billions of dollars into their economy. Could Jay Powell be swayed by that?"

And that's what he is hoping to raise out there. But this whole issue of the popular vote, we have to remember Republicans have only won two of the last eight popular votes. And I think this has been a sticking point with Trump. People have tried to delegitimize his 2016 win by saying, well, he didn't win the popular vote, which is, of course, absurd. And I think he wants to make 2020 definitive. He wants to expand on his Electoral College both. That's why it was in New Mexico. And he wants to win the popular vote. But I would also add this, Charles. If he wants to help the GOP win the House back -- the GOP lost four House seats in 2018 in Orange County alone. And if he wants to end the stupidity that we saw today with the Lewandowski hearing, then this collusion and impeachment forever with the Democratic House, he has to help Republicans win the House back in 2020. And for that to happen in California, he has to be present. He has to have a presence for them to be able to win those seats. And I think that's why he's there."

Laura, what do you make, though, of President Trump? It's not just New Mexico, but he's been in several states that he did not win last time. And his campaign seems to be very confident that he can win them this time around."

      "utterance": "Well, I tell you one thing. He better worry about that Electoral College vote, because his popularity is declining. By coming to California, it is correct, he's going to vacuum up $15 million, get that payback for the tax cuts from the wealthy donors that he gave them to. And then he does have to worry about those seats. It was seven seats that Republican loss -- Republicans lost, over half their delegation, clean sweep for Democrats in Orange County. They proceeded through California with Serena Williams-like dominance. And in order to win back the House, which is a long shot at best, they are going to have to be competitive, but be careful, because, in California, it is deeply blue. And every time Trump comes here, it energizes the Democratic base, driving them to turn out, and driving them to resist his presidency, as they have done from the beginning."

      "utterance": "Yes. You know, when I went to The L.A. Times to see what they were reporting about Trump's trip to California, the lead stories were all about the protesters who had assembled to meet him, yes. But I think California, I mean, he lost there by over four million votes. That's -- that's more than the three million nearly in total that he lost by to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. There are other states, though, where he can do it. I mean, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton only won by less than 3,000 votes. Nevada, Maine, about 20,000 votes. Those, I think, possibly winnable, California not so much. But it is interesting what he's doing in California. He actually sent some officials there ahead of him that talked to state and city officials and homeless reps about the homelessness problem in California. And it was something he was asked about today on Air Force One on his way to California. And he said he's been talking to Ben Carson, HUD secretary, about it, and they plan to do something about it. And what's interesting is, he mentioned that a lot of people, even foreigners, move to San Francisco, move to Los Angeles, because they want a better life there, and then they're finding that these homeless in camps with tents are making it difficult. And I wonder if that was a play for some more donor money right before he goes, but I think Ben Carson is not looking for donor money, and he is going to look into that problem."

But that homelessness, the crisis in California is an ugly problem that I hope the White House does get more involved in. The other pushback, Ned, is Hollywood, and Hollywood taking this on. It's so interesting, because at least once a year, we get this sort of McCarthy -- McCarthy movie out of Hollywood at least once a year. But now they're sort of taking on the spirit of Senator McCarthy with lists of donors, and they want to go after them and make their names public. What do you make of all of that?"

It's going to blow Debra Messing's his mind and Eric McCormack and Rob Reiner, all of these people. But I think that's also a little bit extra for Trump to be out there, to be able to rub it in their face and say, I'm here, I'm raising money. And I will say this, Charles. Just to clarify, I don't think Trump has to try and compete in all of California to win more votes for the popular vote. He's got to play in Southern California."

So he might have to expand the map, because Pennsylvania is not looking really good right now. Wisconsin isn't looking good right now. Minnesota certainly isn't looking good right now. I mean, so he's going to have to look across the map to try to pull off a victory here because his popularity is declining. There's a shaky economy on the horizon. Americans aren't confident for the first time. For the first time, they are not confident in his ability to handle the economy. And more Americans believe that he's doing a disservice to the economy than believe that he is strengthening it. That's a Quinnipiac poll just out this week.

To a Republican on that committee, Florida Congressman Greg Steube. Congressman, thanks for joining us. I was shocked to read this morning that Jerry Nadler wanted no part of this.

It's just sad that we have gotten to a place in American politics where people can just make an accusation with no basis, no evidence, no facts to back it up, and then, suddenly, it becomes a narrative to the point where The New York Times is retracting their story, and the justice doesn't even have the opportunity for due process to defend himself. The witness that apparently this happened to is saying that she doesn't remember it happening. The other people that were there says they don't remember it happening.

And that's what we're -- we're talking about. So, for two years, we dealt with this next from the mainstream media and the left that there was this collusion with the Trump campaign. And after 22 months of investigation, oh, find out there is no collusion whatsoever and no evidence of collusion. So any time they have anything that they can make people look negative that are conservatives, they're going to take that opportunity to do it.

I'm reading headlines out of this, and it's like the hearing descends into chaos and the personal, vitriolic attacks, very little questioning.

And then after he agreed to show up here voluntarily, he was subpoenaed by the chair. So it's just -- I think people are sick and tired of these political games. They're sick and tired of these narratives. They know that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Yet the Democrats have no other thing that they can talk about, because they don't want to talk about their policy narratives.

If you're going to vape, don't purchase anything off the streets, don't modify the vaping products that you have. And if you want to quit, talk to your doctor.

And, if so, how vulnerable are we?"

      "speaker": "AARON COHEN, SECURITY ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, the drones are very sophisticated, Charles. We're not talking about Toys 'R' Us remote control helicopters anymore. This technology has been around since I'm going to say about 2000-2001. It was -- started to be developed by the United States and Israel in the late '90s. And although the U.S. and Israel were the first countries to essentially deploy them legally in the global war on terror, Iran, China, Russia have gotten into the game aggressively. And the reason why is, because, like we have seen with how the Americans and how we use them in Israel against terror targets for strategic strikes, they're very cheap. The cost of innocent life is much lower than it would be, say, flying an F-16 over a target. The training is much more significantly reduced, and that it not only saves lives and reduces risks to the soldiers who are operating them, but you can essentially suicide target these drones, the way they were used in conjunction, Charles, with cruise missiles. And so there were about 500 attacks that were launched simultaneously, and they're very devastating."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COHEN",

And you can, essentially, for less than 1,000 bucks, walk in and buy one of these drones. The paparazzi in Hollywood use them to film celebs, to capture photos of celebrities now. And so they're very accessible. And the fact is, is that explosives with very little amount of training can be attached to these drones. And they can be used to target civilians. They can be used to target our oil fields here. They can be used to target nuclear facilities. And the truth is, is that you actually need Russian and U.S.-grade anti- missile defense systems to have the radar capability to be able to essentially catch these drones before they enter a certain proximity to your airspace, similar to LAX or Boston Airport. You need sophisticated radar technology to be able to spot these things to defend and thwart them. So they're really dangerous. And it's definitely something that I think all of the U.S. government agencies should not only be looking at in terms of technology to beef up all of our national security interests, but to make sure that our law enforcement agencies have this technology as well, because these things can be targeted at a mall. They can be targeted at any crowded area. So they're very dangerous."
