This time for financial disclosure forms obtained by Fox News that show he invested in oil companies prior to becoming President Biden's climate envoy. Republicans are calling out the Biden administration's embrace of the 1619 Project, labeling it divisive nonsense and an attempt to rewrite history, tonight's supersized power panel debates. Plus, two of the richest people in the world engaging in a salacious Twitter war over NASA's Lunar Lander contract with a word tonight that NASA has now suspended its contract offer until it can resolve two protests over the award. Former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine joins us live. But we begin tonight with John Kerry back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. White House Correspondent Kevin Corke has the latest tonight. Good evening, Kevin.",

Prior to becoming the Biden administration's climate envoy shouldn't disabuse anyone of the notion that the investments themselves by their very nature may be seen as dubious by some especially given his position and his possible influence and how that might shape U.S. energy policy. Here is financial disclosure forms which were obtained, as you pointed out, by Fox News show that the former Secretary of State was financially invested in numerous oil companies including Duke Energy, Cimarex, Dominion Energy, Exelon Corporation, and Valero Energy. Now, the financial forum show that Kerry's total investments were valued somewhere between $4.2 and $15 million, which he reported liquidating last month. Now, the State Department told Axios, which first reported about the financial disclosure that the climate czar has divested from all assets that could pose conflicts of interest. Kerry has signed an ethics pledge, stating he will not take part in decisions involving his former clients and employers. However, given the number of major corporations that have paid him, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in some cases like Bank of America, millions of dollars over the past year, watchdog groups no doubt will be scouring the legislative fine print to make sure that none of his past benefactors directly benefit or indirectly benefit from the U.S. energy policies steered by Kerry. Now, do keep this in mind. The disclosures come late in a week that also saw Kerry deny having ever discussed Israeli airstrikes in Syria with Iran Foreign Minister after the Times reported or suggested that he certainly had done that. And for the record, here is huge stock portfolio largely held in a trust affiliated with his wife to raise a Heinz carry core. She's the heiress to the Heinz food processing fortune. It's just another one of those hiccups that happens early. Kristin, in and administration sometimes you can weather the storm but sometimes the hits just keep on coming.",

A Bloomberg report says that due to the recent increased popularity in fried chicken sandwiches during the pandemic, I did not know that was a thing, coupled with a lack of workers available and meat processing plants that the poultry demand is outweighing its availability. And this pool season opens, chlorine may be scarce. The pandemic is being blamed yet again, as many Americans installed pools last year while stuck at home and a large chemical plant fire in Louisiana last summer has thrown off the supply chain. And finally, this is some good news. Disneyland in California has reopened for the first time in over 400 days. Gates opened at 9:00 am and some are camped out in line as early as 2:30 in the morning, waiting for their chance to finally enjoy the attractions.

Well, Republican criticism of a new Department of Education proposal to focus U.S. history through the lens of race and slavery is drawing criticism in the mainstream media today. Reuters describing GOP objections to the curriculums linked to the controversial 1619 Project is Republicans asking Biden to withdraw divisive proposal to teach more black history. So, let's bring in Democratic Strategist and former Clinton Adviser Richard Goodstein, West Point Grad and Army Veteran Jeremy Hunt, Host of the \"Jason in the House\" podcast Jason Chaffetz, and a Former Member of the 1776 Commission, Peter Kirsanow. All right. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with us late on a Friday night. And, Peter, I'm going to start with you because you are a member of the commission that President Biden disbanded through executive order once he took office. So, what do you think of this latest development? PETER KIRSANOW, FORMER MEMBER OF THE 1776 COMMISSION: Well, I think that Senator McConnell's love letters are right on point. And I think that the Biden administration is being disingenuous. The critical race theory in 1619 projects are a historical, in some respects, they're really insane. They're very dumb. But most importantly, they're pernicious. I can't think of a greater threat, a greater internal threat to the United States of America since the Civil War. And that's not an understatement. Like, I've been in Civil Rights Commission for more than 20 years now, longest serving member, I've never seen anything quite like this. You talk to parents across the country, talk to kids across the country, they're being told that, you know, we're they're being judged on the basis of the color of their skin, not the content of their character. They've been told their oppressors. It's invidious. It's inherently anti-American. And, you know, the proposed rule by the Biden administration gives priority funding to 1619 Project and to critical race priority funding nearly $6 billion-dollars-worth and no school district is going to reject that, in fact, thousands have already embraced teaching critical race theory. Parents understand what's going on right now, and that's why there was an uproar. There are lawsuits being filed and challenges across the country.",

But Malone argues that he should never have been fired for what he considers exercising his First Amendment rights. So, let's start an argument with civil rights attorney Robert Patillo and Washington Times legal affairs reporter and attorney, Alex Swoyer. All right. I mean, this is a classic First Amendment case, freedom of speech. Let's start with this Exhibit A right here because this is the offending tweet that got the coach in so much trouble. And he deleted it after 30 minutes important to point out. But he said that, quote, \"Congratulations to the state of Georgia and Fat Albert Stacey Abrams, because you have truly shown America the true works of cheating in an election again. Enjoy the buffet, big girl, you earned it, hope the money was good. Still not governor.\" I mean, I think we can all agree that that is not a very nice tweet. But did he deserve to get fired for it?

And so, I think that that, sort of, precedent helps the coach here. Also, in the school speech cases, courts generally look to see if there was a substantial disruption in the classroom or the school environment.

And he pointed to President Taft, who was apparently over 300 pounds and got stuck in a bathtub at the White House, how that became a running joke in the political environment.

How to tell if someone without a mask is vaccinated? Why can't a vaccinated person do without a mask altogether when there is such a low chance of getting sick or spreading the virus? Then the president added to the confusion when he spoke to Congress this week, because though he said we should come together and replace fear with hope, he continued to sound divisive by not acknowledging the successful work of the prior administration in bringing these vaccines so quickly and effectively to market. Or the positive example that states like Florida and Texas have now shown by fully reopening with a continued decline in case rates and death since January.

The very close call that those astronauts inside the Dragon capsule that launched last week, close call to some space debris. And this is -- we don't know exactly where that debris specifically came from. But this is another area where Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are fighting it out, both trying to launch tons and tons of satellites into low Earth orbit, which is creating those kinds of conditions, those dangerous conditions that we saw this week.",

A Morgan Stanley says that that market could be as big as $400 billion by the year 2040. That means there's lots of opportunity there. It also means that we have to do two things. Number one, we have to be safe in space. And so, we need to make sure that the United States government, through its regulators, the FCC, and also members of Congress need to get active here and start saying, what do we need to do to be safe? And we need to make sure that there is access to low Earth orbit for a lot of different companies. We have to make sure that there is competition. I've always said the only thing worse than a government monopoly is a private monopoly that the government is beholden to. And so, we have to prevent that from happening for anybody. We need competition in the marketplace. But there's a lot of opportunity here for a lot of different companies to provide internet broadband from space. And I think that's going to be good, not just for the United States of America, but lifting people out of poverty, providing education all around the world. Mobile Banking, for example, telemedicine. Remember, 50 percent of the world isn't connected right now. So, when we can start connecting people, it's going to be transformational in a positive way. And I'm very excited about it. There's lots of room for everybody, but we have to do the right things from a government perspective.",

Prior to becoming the Biden administration's climate envoy shouldn't disabuse anyone of the notion that the investments themselves by their very nature may be seen as dubious by some especially given his position and his possible influence and how that might shape U.S. energy policy. Here is financial disclosure forms which were obtained, as you pointed out, by Fox News show that the former Secretary of State was financially invested in numerous oil companies including Duke Energy, Cimarex, Dominion Energy, Exelon Corporation, and Valero Energy. Now, the financial forum show that Kerry's total investments were valued somewhere between $4.2 and $15 million, which he reported liquidating last month. Now, the State Department told Axios, which first reported about the financial disclosure that the climate czar has divested from all assets that could pose conflicts of interest. Kerry has signed an ethics pledge, stating he will not take part in decisions involving his former clients and employers. However, given the number of major corporations that have paid him, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in some cases like Bank of America, millions of dollars over the past year, watchdog groups no doubt will be scouring the legislative fine print to make sure that none of his past benefactors directly benefit or indirectly benefit from the U.S. energy policies steered by Kerry. Now, do keep this in mind. The disclosures come late in a week that also saw Kerry deny having ever discussed Israeli airstrikes in Syria with Iran Foreign Minister after the Times reported or suggested that he certainly had done that. And for the record, here is huge stock portfolio largely held in a trust affiliated with his wife to raise a Heinz carry core. She's the heiress to the Heinz food processing fortune. It's just another one of those hiccups that happens early. Kristin, in and administration sometimes you can weather the storm but sometimes the hits just keep on coming."

A Bloomberg report says that due to the recent increased popularity in fried chicken sandwiches during the pandemic, I did not know that was a thing, coupled with a lack of workers available and meat processing plants that the poultry demand is outweighing its availability. And this pool season opens, chlorine may be scarce. The pandemic is being blamed yet again, as many Americans installed pools last year while stuck at home and a large chemical plant fire in Louisiana last summer has thrown off the supply chain. And finally, this is some good news. Disneyland in California has reopened for the first time in over 400 days.

Well, Republican criticism of a new Department of Education proposal to focus U.S. history through the lens of race and slavery is drawing criticism in the mainstream media today. Reuters describing GOP objections to the curriculums linked to the controversial 1619 Project is Republicans asking Biden to withdraw divisive proposal to teach more black history. So, let's bring in Democratic Strategist and former Clinton Adviser Richard Goodstein, West Point Grad and Army Veteran Jeremy Hunt, Host of the \"Jason in the House\" podcast Jason Chaffetz, and a Former Member of the 1776 Commission, Peter Kirsanow. All right. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with us late on a Friday night. And, Peter, I'm going to start with you because you are a member of the commission that President Biden disbanded through executive order once he took office. So, what do you think of this latest development? PETER KIRSANOW, FORMER MEMBER OF THE 1776 COMMISSION: Well, I think that Senator McConnell's love letters are right on point. And I think that the Biden administration is being disingenuous. The critical race theory in 1619 projects are a historical, in some respects, they're really insane. They're very dumb. But most importantly, they're pernicious. I can't think of a greater threat, a greater internal threat to the United States of America since the Civil War. And that's not an understatement. Like, I've been in Civil Rights Commission for more than 20 years now, longest serving member, I've never seen anything quite like this. You talk to parents across the country, talk to kids across the country, they're being told that, you know, we're they're being judged on the basis of the color of their skin, not the content of their character. They've been told their oppressors. It's invidious. It's inherently anti-American. And, you know, the proposed rule by the Biden administration gives priority funding to 1619 Project and to critical race priority funding nearly $6 billion-dollars-worth and no school district is going to reject that, in fact, thousands have already embraced teaching critical race theory. Parents understand what's going on right now, and that's why there was an uproar. There are lawsuits being filed and challenges across the country."

Let the money flow to the kids. Let these happen at the state level with the local parents, teachers, educators, and school boards. That's the way this should happen. But I'm going to take the education secretary at his word, if that's true, if they're not going to, at the federal level, engage in the curriculum, then there's no need to actually pass along the money and there should be no requirement from the Department of Education. So, Democrats will argue, oh, it's such a small amount of money. That's always their excuse. But it is fundamentally wrong. Mitch McConnell is right. And let's get rid of the Department of Education.

No, it's all about what you look like. And it's so annoying, because they really depend on parents being disengaged out of the loop not knowing what's going on.

He was rushed to the hospital where the doctor carefully pulled the barb out, and amazingly, the dark Miss Chester's brain and vital nerves by this much. And now, a dangerously close look inside a volcano an active crater in Iceland spotted spewing lava by a drone when suddenly the footage begins to kind of glitch as the drone itself melts. The Icelandic Meteorological Office said that the eruption remains stable, but that they continue to monitor the site. And the chinchilla named Philly from Philly, living his best life right there. The cute little guys seen here in a video now gone viral getting pampered. The dense coat of a chinchilla. It's not meant to get wet because it can be hard to get completely dry. So, that's why chinchillas take dust baths as opposed to water baths. And there's your fun fact for the night. See you learn something. Moving on to a pretty scary scene in Southern California where a double tanker Big Rig hauling a load of 8,000 gallons of diesel fuel overturned on a freeway. According to the Los Angeles Fire Department, the spilling diesel fuel was contained, but about 200 gallons of liquid may have entered the storm drain system before they were able to arrive on scene. And finally, a pair of pups caught red handed at the scene of the crime when their owners busted in on them obliterating the living room couch. And I mean just look at those guys. They were just having fun. So, let's just send in some to a long walk and lots of treats for looking so cute. And if you have a video you want to share tweet us @FoxNewsNight or @KristinFisher. Breaking tonight, police make a disturbing discovery in a quiet Houston neighborhood. 90 migrants packed into a two-story house, some of them showing symptoms of COVID-19.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "All right. It is time now for \"Night Court.\" A former college football coach who was fired for incendiary tweets about Georgia politician Stacey Abrams, is suing to get his job back. Chris Malone says that he was forced to resign earlier this year as the Chattanooga Mocs' offensive line coach for comments that the school says do not represent the values of its football program. But Malone argues that he should never have been fired for what he considers exercising his First Amendment rights. So, let's start an argument with civil rights attorney Robert Patillo and Washington Times legal affairs reporter and attorney, Alex Swoyer. All right. I mean, this is a classic First Amendment case, freedom of speech. Let's start with this Exhibit A right here because this is the offending tweet that got the coach in so much trouble. And he deleted it after 30 minutes important to point out. But he said that, quote, \"Congratulations to the state of Georgia and Fat Albert Stacey Abrams, because you have truly shown America the true works of cheating in an election again. Enjoy the buffet, big girl, you earned it, hope the money was good. Still not governor.\" I mean, I think we can all agree that that is not a very nice tweet. But did he deserve to get fired for it? Alex, make your case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALEX SWOYER, WASHINGTON TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS REPORTER",
      "utterance": "I actually think both the law and the facts are on the coach's side, if he was commenting on a political matter, and courts have been protective of political speech, they've also been protective of the teacher's First Amendment right. In fact, the Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that a teacher didn't lose his First Amendment, when he had a letter to a newspaper published that he was critical of the school board, and its funding for athletics. And so, I think that that, sort of, precedent helps the coach here. Also, in the school speech cases, courts generally look to see if there was a substantial disruption in the classroom or the school environment. And there's nothing in the record about this, because as you mentioned, the tweet was only up for 30 minutes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "Yes. It wasn't a ton of time, but certainly didn't say some nice things. So, let's get the other side. This is what the school thinks about this. This is Exhibit B. Pop it up. And, Robert, I'll get your take on the other side of this. So, this is from head coach Rusty Wright, and he says, \"What was posted on social media by a member of my staff is unacceptable, and not any part of what I stand for what Chattanooga football stands for. Life is bigger than football. And as leaders of young men, we have to set that example, first and foremost. With that said, effective immediately, that individual is no longer part of my staff.\" So, Robert, make your case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT PATILLO, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, let's understand, this is not a First Amendment issue. The First Amendment protects you from governmental interference, and your right to freedom of speech. This is an employment issue. So, it's governed by your employment contract with the employer. If he violated the terms of that contract in a way, which is deemed to be a fireable offense, then he is terminated or he's forced to resign. That is it. And this is not even a First Amendment issue primarily because if you read the pleading, I've never read a pleading that has cartoons and pictures and fat jokes in it. So, I think that you can't really take this seriously as a pleading in the first place, because he's not even going by the contract that he has with the school. Rather, he is simply making a more of his arguments and jokes about William Howard Taft. It's a very strange pleading in its totality."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "So, Alex, who do you think has the stronger case here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWOYER",
      "utterance": "Well, I do think that the man has precedent on his side. And as Robert noted, there were cartoons included in the complaint. And what he was basically saying in his lawsuit is that his -- what he was making was a fat joke. And that those -- although those are offensive, they're not illegal. And he pointed to President Taft, who was apparently over 300 pounds and got stuck in a bathtub at the White House, how that became a running joke in the political environment. As well as most recently, former President Donald Trump had a lot of jabs at him for his weight and his skin color being orange. So, he says that this is just part of the political environment and it's protected speech."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "Robert, do you think that this matters at all that this tweet was sent out in the middle of those Georgia Senate runoffs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, no, because, again, this is an employment issue. So, it'd be one thing if the government came to his house and arrested him because of his tweet or if his bank accounts were frozen because of this tweet. It's an employment issue. And if the employer deems that you've done something inappropriate, that is all that is needed under his contract with the school in order to be terminated. So, unless he wants to be independently employed football coach, he teaches his own camp, if he wants to do that and don't want to abide by anybody else's rules, then by all means, you can tweet whatever you feel like. But if you're going to be employed by another individual, if you're going to be affecting recruiting, you're going to be affecting scholarships, you're going to be affecting state funding by your tweets, then you have to abide by their rules."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "So, Alex, what do you think this means for this coach's future employment? I mean, is this going to really hurt him get a job elsewhere?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWOYER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's really -- it's really a sad situation. Apparently, he's been a coach for more than 20 years, and to have a tweet that was up for 30 minutes, destroy your career, and your future would be just -- a sad situation. And, of course, I think this is something we can all learn from. I -- we've mentioned earlier about Donald Trump and jobs about his weight. I think it's curious to find out if there was sort of professors or teachers in the political environment, making those sort of comments but yet keeping their jobs. So, I'm not sure. I think that he's going to end up winning this, whether he has to appeal it or not. So, we'll see. He might end up being reinstated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "You know, one thing I've learned, I think very few good things can come from posting anything on Twitter. It's a lesson. Folks have had to learn the hard way. But, Robert, I'll give you --"

How to tell if someone without a mask is vaccinated? Why can't a vaccinated person do without a mask altogether when there is such a low chance of getting sick or spreading the virus? Then the president added to the confusion when he spoke to Congress this week, because though he said we should come together and replace fear with hope, he continued to sound divisive by not acknowledging the successful work of the prior administration in bringing these vaccines so quickly and effectively to market. Or the positive example that states like Florida and Texas have now shown by fully reopening with a continued decline in case rates and death since January. President Biden continued to spread confusion by not leading by example, by wearing a mask outside or even inside at Congress when the CDC's own new guidelines told him neither was necessary since he was vaccinated."

We've got others out there that are competing, you know, to provide services to NASA. And they're fighting in order to -- in order to get a NASA contract. I think it's wonderful for space exploration. It's great entertainment and it's good for the United States of America."

Now, we've got these two billionaires, and as you said, other industry titans duking it out. But it's that same kind of competition that's making space so exciting again. In terms of this Lunar Lander contract, we had some big news tonight. It sounds like Jeff Bezos' complaint is actually having an impact. NASA announcing today that it's suspending that contract with SpaceX. How do you think this is going to shake out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIDENSTINE",

When we had a contract back in 2014, to launch crew to the International Space Station, there was a -- there was a protest then as well and so, the contract got suspended. But in a matter of weeks, it continued to move forward. I don't know how this will turn out. I do know that I trust, the judgment and the capabilities of the professionals at NASA. But the important thing is this, there is a process here. And that is -- that is what we are going through is it -- I say we -- I'm not at NASA, I haven't been there for three months. But I -- we the United States of America, how about that? There's a process. And in the end, this process will result in an outcome that everybody is going to have a lot of confidence in. So, it's really a good thing, and we'll see where it ends up."

    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And the irony here, Bezos using a very similar argument to the one that Musk used in order to fight the United Launch Alliance and gain some of those contracts. So, it's really kind of coming full circle here, which is interesting to see. I want to talk to you about one other thing. The very close call that those astronauts inside the Dragon capsule that launched last week, close call to some space debris. And this is -- we don't know exactly where that debris specifically came from. But this is another area where Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are fighting it out, both trying to launch tons and tons of satellites into low Earth orbit, which is creating those kinds of conditions, those dangerous conditions that we saw this week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIDENSTINE",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's absolutely right. I want to be clear, there is a huge market for basically internet connectivity from space. A Morgan Stanley says that that market could be as big as $400 billion by the year 2040. That means there's lots of opportunity there. It also means that we have to do two things. Number one, we have to be safe in space. And so, we need to make sure that the United States government, through its regulators, the FCC, and also members of Congress need to get active here and start saying, what do we need to do to be safe? And we need to make sure that there is access to low Earth orbit for a lot of different companies. We have to make sure that there is competition. I've always said the only thing worse than a government monopoly is a private monopoly that the government is beholden to. And so, we have to prevent that from happening for anybody. We need competition in the marketplace. But there's a lot of opportunity here for a lot of different companies to provide internet broadband from space. And I think that's going to be good, not just for the United States of America, but lifting people out of poverty, providing education all around the world. Mobile Banking, for example, telemedicine. Remember, 50 percent of the world isn't connected right now. So, when we can start connecting people, it's going to be transformational in a positive way. And I'm very excited about it. There's lots of room for everybody, but we have to do the right things from a government perspective."

I think they have the -- probably the most unique and the best intellectual property to actually, you know, provide more throughput, more bandwidth at a lesser cost. So, there's opportunity here for a lot of different companies. And over time, we'll see what happens. But competition is a good thing. We need to ensure that it stays there. And we need to make sure that space is safe."

The International Space Station, we celebrated 20 years of its active service in November of last year. We have to make sure that when it comes to the end of its useful life, there is a replacement. We need commercial space stations, maybe even multiple or even a dozen or so commercial space stations. We cannot cede to China or any other country, low Earth orbit.
