In fact, there is already some suggestions that this relationship is bearing fruit. Earlier today, the French president, along with President Trump, talking a lot about Iran and in fact making some progress on that. Remember the president has been talking about pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal brokered by Barack Obama. The Iranian foreign minister over the weekend had threatened that if that happened, Iran is going to speed up its nuclear activities. Well, today what we saw was a bit of a compromise. President Trump talking tough on Iran, warning them that they will face severe consequences like they have never seen before if they keep up this tough talk, if they restart their nuclear program. What the French president tried to do in the side of this emerging friendship, he said look, instead of just pulling out of the deal, let's try to find another way. Let's reshape this nuclear deal to address some of President Trump's concerns. So, contrary to the idea that he's acting unilaterally, in fact, they seem to be coming together on this important issue of Iran.

Now for tonight's \"Angle.\" The Trump administration takes the caravan to court. No doubt you've heard about the caravan of illegal immigrants moving north through Mexico. According to \"The New York Times\" over 100 have already made it to the U.S. border. The caravan started out with more than 1,000 people. It is now down to about 500 or so. Now, some of these migrants have told reporters that they planned to find ways to get across the U.S. border. Now, most of them are from Honduras, so many are expected to apply for asylum supposedly to escape violence at home. Well, anticipating that, the Trump administration is sending additional ICE attorneys, Justice Department judges, and also prosecutors to make sure the caravan asylum cases will be, quote, \"adjudicated promptly.\" But we have also learned, this is curious, that American attorneys have traveled southward to meet with migrants to instruct them on their rights to apply for asylum here in the United States. We did some digging, and according to reports, two of these lawyers are Allegra Love of Santa Fe Dreamers Project, and Marie Vincent, who also works for a small 5O1C3 organization. Vincent has said that many of the migrants are strong candidates for asylum because they are fleeing political persecution or violent gangs were threats over their gender or sexual orientation. But for asylum eligibility, according to Section 1208 of the Title 8 Code of federal regulations, attorneys have to establish that their client has, quote, \"reasonable fear of persecution.\" And that is what Democrats and the media have been claiming, that these are political refugees escaping violence and yes, persecution. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The problem for the attorneys helping the members of the caravan could be the U.S. law, the code Section 1324, excuse me of Title 8, which makes it an offense for any person who encourages or induces an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, enter your residence is or will be in violation of law. So, the question is when does advocacy for illegals and up crossing the line to committing a 1324 offense, interesting legal question.

Here's the other problem for these lawyers. Most of the people in this caravan, as I said, are from Honduras. Well, a poll conducted by a Jesuit research group found a whopping 83 percent of Hondurans were considering migrating to the United States were motivated by purely economic reasons. In other words, they simply wanted to move to a wealthier country with better economic opportunities. Only 11 percent said they wanted to leave due to violence and insecurity. So, given that poll, immigration judges have to be really skeptical about these asylum claims. And if these claims, a lot of them are bogus, as I assume most of them are, what does that say about the attorneys themselves? Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, remember, he was called a fixer. Well, what would you call members of the American BAR who arguably connive with their clients to board or get around U.S. immigration law or at least gain it? How many of these migrants know exactly what to say to asylum judges? Well, it's a must like when you hear this, they are almost working off of the same script. How would they all know to say the same thing? Huh. Well, the president is doing the right thing. He is heading the caravan off of the past. This is what he tweeted yesterday. He said, \"I have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country.\" Another tweet wrote, \"Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the United States. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA agreement.\" Well, the plan is to detain any asylum-seekers until their hearings. The others will be prosecuted for illegal entry, and I say good. Catch and release does not work. The Trump administration said they were ending it. It must be ended now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There can be no more catch and promise you will show up for your asylum hearing because as we know, and we have discussed this many times at \"The Angle,\" the vast majority of those asylum-seekers never show up at their hearings. They disappear into society. Trump is right. Partnering with Mexico to stop the flood of immigrants to pouring through Mexicans southern border. Tying it to trade might be the only thing we can do. Might be -- if you can see building the wall is more necessary than ever, you must be blind. The president should also put Honduras on notice that this virtual invasion has to stop. It's not virtual. It's a real invasion. Even if that means things don't change, threatening to suspend foreign aid, which Honduras testily needs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It would also help if we got our own house in order and stopped the abusive asylum and the process of applying and facilitating it by American lawyers. More has to be done there. So-called asylum-seekers all get their day in court, but for the American citizen? Security and justice always seemed delayed. And that's \"The Angle..\" Joining us now for reaction here in studio is Andrew Arthur with the Center for Immigration Studies, and immigration attorney, Allen Orr. All right. Gentlemen, great to have you on. This is a big deal I think because we have now seen large groups of people, not just one group but several groups over the last four or five months begin to move north through Mexico all the way to the U.S. border. This latest group is due to arrive any day now. What is the immigration system in our country supposed to do when we have masses of humanity rushing the border and having their actions facilitated in part by U.S. lawyers? Allen, you are an immigration attorney. They are flying down there, at least the two we have been able to identify, and apparently, they are representing hundreds of people.

The president is now the leader on the world stage. That we knew he would be. The French president departs tonight, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives on Friday. Potential historic meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un over North Korea's nukes is imminent. So, how different reality is from what the so-called experts predicted not so long ago. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, D—CONN.: This administration may be just a series of flip-flops, waivers on foreign policy for four years.

And President Trump, contrary to what critics have been saying, was very direct and saying look, we are going to build on this friendship, that God needs to bless this alliance, he said, because we are going to do great things together. In fact, there is already some suggestions that this relationship is bearing fruit. Earlier today, the French president, along with President Trump, talking a lot about Iran and in fact making some progress on that. Remember the president has been talking about pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal brokered by Barack Obama. The Iranian foreign minister over the weekend had threatened that if that happened, Iran is going to speed up its nuclear activities. Well, today what we saw was a bit of a compromise. President Trump talking tough on Iran, warning them that they will face severe consequences like they have never seen before if they keep up this tough talk, if they restart their nuclear program. What the French president tried to do in the side of this emerging friendship, he said look, instead of just pulling out of the deal, let's try to find another way. Let's reshape this nuclear deal to address some of President Trump's concerns. So, contrary to the idea that he's acting unilaterally, in fact, they seem to be coming together on this important issue of Iran. Listen to the toast from President Macron tonight."

Now for tonight's \"Angle.\" The Trump administration takes the caravan to court. No doubt you've heard about the caravan of illegal immigrants moving north through Mexico. According to \"The New York Times\" over 100 have already made it to the U.S. border. The caravan started out with more than 1,000 people. It is now down to about 500 or so. Now, some of these migrants have told reporters that they planned to find ways to get across the U.S. border. Now, most of them are from Honduras, so many are expected to apply for asylum supposedly to escape violence at home. Well, anticipating that, the Trump administration is sending additional ICE attorneys, Justice Department judges, and also prosecutors to make sure the caravan asylum cases will be, quote, \"adjudicated promptly.\" But we have also learned, this is curious, that American attorneys have traveled southward to meet with migrants to instruct them on their rights to apply for asylum here in the United States. We did some digging, and according to reports, two of these lawyers are Allegra Love of Santa Fe Dreamers Project, and Marie Vincent, who also works for a small 5O1C3 organization. Vincent has said that many of the migrants are strong candidates for asylum because they are fleeing political persecution or violent gangs were threats over their gender or sexual orientation. But for asylum eligibility, according to Section 1208 of the Title 8 Code of federal regulations, attorneys have to establish that their client has, quote, \"reasonable fear of persecution.\" And that is what Democrats and the media have been claiming, that these are political refugees escaping violence and yes, persecution."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, there are next move is to crash into our country. The problem for the attorneys helping the members of the caravan could be the U.S. law, the code Section 1324, excuse me of Title 8, which makes it an offense for any person who encourages or induces an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such coming to, enter your residence is or will be in violation of law. So, the question is when does advocacy for illegals and up crossing the line to committing a 1324 offense, interesting legal question. Well, because of the attorney-client privilege, this could be tough to determine. But if these attorneys are holding what is being described as these large group seminars and demonstrate intent to skirt the laws or to help the migrant skirt the laws, well, they could be in jeopardy at least technically. Here's the other problem for these lawyers. Most of the people in this caravan, as I said, are from Honduras. Well, a poll conducted by a Jesuit research group found a whopping 83 percent of Hondurans were considering migrating to the United States were motivated by purely economic reasons. In other words, they simply wanted to move to a wealthier country with better economic opportunities. Only 11 percent said they wanted to leave due to violence and insecurity. So, given that poll, immigration judges have to be really skeptical about these asylum claims. And if these claims, a lot of them are bogus, as I assume most of them are, what does that say about the attorneys themselves? Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, remember, he was called a fixer. Well, what would you call members of the American BAR who arguably connive with their clients to board or get around U.S. immigration law or at least gain it? How many of these migrants know exactly what to say to asylum judges? Well, it's a must like when you hear this, they are almost working off of the same script. How would they all know to say the same thing? Huh. Well, the president is doing the right thing. He is heading the caravan off of the past. This is what he tweeted yesterday. He said, \"I have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country.\" Another tweet wrote, \"Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the United States. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA agreement.\" Well, the plan is to detain any asylum-seekers until their hearings. The others will be prosecuted for illegal entry, and I say good. Catch and release does not work. The Trump administration said they were ending it. It must be ended now. There can be no more catch and promise you will show up for your asylum hearing because as we know, and we have discussed this many times at \"The Angle,\" the vast majority of those asylum-seekers never show up at their hearings. They disappear into society. Trump is right. Partnering with Mexico to stop the flood of immigrants to pouring through Mexicans southern border. Tying it to trade might be the only thing we can do. Might be -- if you can see building the wall is more necessary than ever, you must be blind. The president should also put Honduras on notice that this virtual invasion has to stop. It's not virtual. It's a real invasion. Even if that means things don't change, threatening to suspend foreign aid, which Honduras testily needs. It would also help if we got our own house in order and stopped the abusive asylum and the process of applying and facilitating it by American lawyers. More has to be done there. So-called asylum-seekers all get their day in court, but for the American citizen? Security and justice always seemed delayed. And that's \"The Angle..\" Joining us now for reaction here in studio is Andrew Arthur with the Center for Immigration Studies, and immigration attorney, Allen Orr. All right. Gentlemen, great to have you on. This is a big deal I think because we have now seen large groups of people, not just one group but several groups over the last four or five months begin to move north through Mexico all the way to the U.S. border. This latest group is due to arrive any day now. What is the immigration system in our country supposed to do when we have masses of humanity rushing the border and having their actions facilitated in part by U.S. lawyers? Allen, you are an immigration attorney. They are flying down there, at least the two we have been able to identify, and apparently, they are representing hundreds of people. How can you represent hundreds of clients? You don't know who they are. You don't know what their intentions are."

I really don't think it's that big of a problem because usc.gov also tells immigrants all the time exactly what the rights are to file the asylum claim. So, it's one of the things they are doing at the humanitarian issue, sort of a Good Samaritan type thing to go to these people who are in need from their home countries to sort of inform them of if they are coming to the United States, this is what you will need to do and what you will and encounter at the point of entry."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All right. Here's the reasons to seek asylum. You are a former immigration judge know this, persecution -- you have to have credible fear of persecution, due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Explain that because it looks like a lot of these Hondurans, especially are coming here because of economic concerns. They want a better life. A lot of people in Africa want to come here for a better life, but they can't come through Mexico. They have to go in a boat. It's an economic concern masquerading as an asylum claim, credible fear of persecution. Political or criminal or so forth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDREW ARTHUR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES",
      "utterance": "For these grounds for asylum are very easy, race, religion, nationality, political opinion. Membership in a particular social group is wide open, however, it could be anything. It could be based on gender identity. It can be based on, you know, I was harmed because of my familial relationship. For that reason, most of these people claiming they had been harmed by gangs. So, the judges, the asylum officers have to figure out where there is a claim based on membership of a particular social group, given the claim that they have. That's really where we get all these people."

We don't have the judges. We don't have the prosecutors. We don't have the system to do this. So, Allen, everyone wants to be a humanitarian. We give a lot of money to other countries. Millions of people around the world want to come here because they are being persecuted. I mean, a lot of people in the united states feel persecuted.

It's not just help. It's we have a right to be here. Mexico deserved some of the blame here. Because Mexico, instead of deporting them from Mexico or keeping them, they are giving them these temporary visas to travel from Southern Mexico up to the border.

I truly believe that if we were talking about Chick-Fil-A not Starbucks, the most dangerous place in America to be would be between Chuck Schumer and a camera. As long as we're talking about statistics here, you talk about the minority of bad cops.

Otherwise kids of all backgrounds are going to feel like \"I'm afraid.\" I don't even want to report a crime. I don't want to see a police officer. I don't want help from a police officer because they are not fair, or they are inherently biased. Getting back to the point of Candace for a moment. She goes to a college campus and she talks about thinking for yourself. Just because you grow up black doesn't mean you automatically register D for Democrat. That's her point. I've seen time and again that black conservatives or Latinos or even Asians, they are treated like they are second class citizens within their own communities. And they are looked at like what's wrong with you? You're an uncle Tom. You are this. You're an uncle Tomasina, I've heard. That also I think is toxic. Let people debate the issues. Let people have different points of view. Don't demonize them. They might disagree. Maybe they are wrong. Maybe they are right. Maybe sometimes I am wrong, you are right. That's fine.

The inspector general recently submitted a criminal referral against the fired FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe for lying to federal investigators. But buried in that report is McCabe's description of a crucial phone call in August of 2016. Now, that's when McCabe claimed that he pushed back hard against someone in Obama's DOJ who seemed to be pressuring the FBI to quash a probe into the Clinton Foundation. Let's discuss the stunning details of former FBI undercover agent James Reddick in Sacramento, California, who handled, I think you handled a corruption, you were head of the corruption task force in Sacramento, I believe, if I got that right. Let's talk about where we are here on this case. I had you on radio this morning and you were so great I had to invite you on T.V. Is this normal for an FBI principle associate deputy to call up the FBI and say kind of slow walk this or eh to this investigation of the Clinton Foundation if this is how it went down."

I conducted numerous investigations involving suspect, corrupt officials, many high-level officials, and I can tell you that conversation that Matthew Axelrod had with Deputy Director McCabe asking him to stand down, if you will, the agent's working the Clinton investigation was improper. I do not agree or support many things McCabe did, but his pushback there to Justice Department officials, telling them they were influencing or attempting to influence an investigation was improper I agree with. And unfortunately it was his disclosure of that conversation that of course has caused him problems, and now the I.G. has made a criminal referral to the Justice Department."

I worked 35 years and ran the corruption squad for a number of those years.

You don't want this Clinton Foundation -- I am just speculating. This thing smells, stinks to high heaven. Unless this is something that McCabe is also making up. He was lying about other things. Maybe he could have been lying about this, but it didn't seem so. James, thank you so much with your wealth of extremes, 35 years with the FBI. Meanwhile, we may finally, finally get some answers on whether political bias affected decisions in investigations at the FBI and the DOJ, including maybe even this. Congressman Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy announced they have made a deal. This is like the North Korean deal. And the Department of Justice will turn over documents their committees have requested finally. Let's get the details firsthand from the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte who joins us in the studio. Mr. Chairman, good to see. So this is a threat of subpoena. This is the result of a threat of subpoena and perhaps contempt of Congress. This is not -- REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R—V.A.: Absolutely. We saw the same effect with the Comey memos last week. Now the department is working with us and the FBI, by the way, too. Make some changes at the top and bring to bear the forces that be, and follow the truth wherever it leads. And I think it's going to lead to some interesting places."

Our understanding with the Justice Department includes looking at documents that their search terms yield documents, but we will also be able to say we want to use our search terms to find email communications and other communications and other documents related to that very matter because that goes right to the core of our investigation into how the FBI handled all the matters related to former secretary Clinton during 2016 and on into 2017."

The notion that the principle deputy would've made such a decision and issued a directive without the knowledge and consent of the deputy attorney general,\" which she was the time, \"is highly unlikely.\" He was counsel to the principle associate deputy during the Bush administration.

Maybe Melania will finally get some of those magazine covers that featured Michelle Obama so prominently and frequently, but I won't hold my breath. To discuss all of this, we are joined by FOX News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy along with the publisher of \"Catalina\" magazine Cathy Areu. Great to see both of you. Let's start with you, Rachel. Melania has had to endure Jimmy Kimmel mocking her accent. I know he apologized. That's fine. But she's not gotten the cover of \"Vogue\" five times in the first year like Michelle. I'm exaggerating but you know what I'm saying. And she has been scrutinized, the way she's holding her husband's hand or not. It's endless. And yet tonight we see a beautiful dinner that she did not hire or an event planner for. She did it all herself. All the designs, all of the selections, no Desiree Rogers there helping her, I guess."

And this is her showcasing what she brings to the office of first lady, or the position of first lady. I would say that while this has been an amazing event and it has been flawless, you're absolutely right about that, Laura, she's been doing this all along. I have been so impressed with not just her quiet dignity, as you brought up, but also just this diplomatic use of fashion. It's been brilliant when she went to Paris and to that restaurant at the Eiffel Tower. She was wearing red, white, and blue, a symbol of both flags. She wore that gorgeous black caftan with the gold white belt in Saudi Arabia. And of course who can forget the amazing Asian inspired gown that she wore in China with the pink fur sleeves. So she has been doing this all along. I have to say also, you are right. Jimmy Kimmel has been mean. So has the fashion industry, and bravo to Dolce Gabbana, Carolina Herrera, those who have celebrated fashion instead of boring us with another political statement as so many in the industry have done to take a stab at her."

CATHY AREU, PUBLISHER OF \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE: She is from the elite fashion industry. This is a former model. She's had many covers. We don't want to see her on another cover.

I presume she loves her husband, and yet all these women who claim to be pro-choice and women should do what they want, any kind of arrangement for their marriages are good for them. It's all about free choice. But when a conservative woman makes a choice, you trash her or you say we feel sorry for her.

And it gets worse. In Orange County, parents can't opt out for their kids as part of this class. Unbelievable. Joining me now for reaction is Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Victor, we have got this and another subject we have to hit fast. What about this? The guy from the general counsel, the Orange County Board of Education says parents who disagree with the instructional materials related to gender, identity, expression may not excuse their children from this instruction.

The legislature just passed a bill saying if you knowingly pass AIDS to a person who does not have it, it's no longer a felonious behavior.

There's politically correct and politically incorrect. If she said something about Obama or if she had said something about a racial or minority group, she would be fired probably. But more importantly, she told people to jam a hotline about suicide, and that seems to be that that was bordering on semi criminal activity. And then she has other tweets they didn't really get in the news that people in the university know about it where she almost advocates violence against white people and particular racial groups. So it's not just free-speech that was her personal choices but she says things that are bordering on advocating violence and trying to disrupt a public service.
