      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” For a few overheated hours on Saturday, a group of boys from a Catholic High School in Kentucky became the most hated figures in America. Television anchors denounced them as bigots. Journalists with Harvard degrees called them privileged. Republican commentators scolded them as bad Christians. Famous actors suggested they should be hunted down and punched in the face. Some on social media called for them to be killed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The boys stood accused of mocking an elderly Vietnam Veteran, an American Indian man, and doing it in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. Now, the story had no inherent news significance. It didn't mobilize troops or move markets or re-open the government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as a symbolic event, it's hard to remember a moment more galvanizing in Washington. As they read their Twitter feeds, the leaders of this country were in rare and solemn agreement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These teenage monsters, these remorseless thugs from our backward provinces are living examples of all that is rotten and immoral about America. That was the consensus on Saturday. Pretty much everybody agreed with it. And then, suddenly, the Covington Catholic story exploded, popped like an overfilled balloon animal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } New footage of the event emerged. And it turns out the boys never attacked anyone. In fact, they stood in place as others approached and harassed them. People did indeed scream racial epithets at the Lincoln Memorial over the weekend. But it wasn't Catholic kids from Kentucky. Watch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They'd probably be living under assumed names by now. Instead, the facts exonerated them and implicated their accusers. From brunch tables across Washington, reporters rushed to delete their outraged tweets. Some of them even apologized for passing rash judgment, and good for them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But amazingly, many others pretended that nothing had happened.

There is growing evidence tonight that Phillips concocted key elements of his story as well as parts of his own biography, and that he's done it before. The press isn't rushing to find out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kirsten Powers doesn't seem to care one way or the other, nor did she explain how precisely the boys disrespected Phillips. Identity politics doesn't concern itself with details like these.

Some groups are always right, no matter what the tape shows. Laura Wagner didn't even bother to look at the tape. Wagner is a Reporter at Deadspin that used to be a sports site before the Revolution began. In an article last night, Wagner described the boys' behavior at the Lincoln Memorial as \"A racially-charged frenzy of barely-contained violence\" that was committed by a \"Frothing mass of MAGA youth, frenzied and yelling and out of control.\" She went on like this paragraph after paragraph. And, of course, anyone who disagree with that assessment is a racist. Keep in mind as you read that that there was literally nothing in the record, the documentary record on tape or in the testimony of anyone to support any of Wagner's claims. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Every word is just made up out of nothing. Imagine if someone was writing things like that about your son. At Covington Catholic, classes were canceled today. Thanks to people like Laura Wagner, there were too many threats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here are two seniors from the school. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

That was the only true racism and bigotry that was evident on that day. Since that time, there's been an incredible amount of bigotry shown by the media.

So now, everybody's waiting for the U.S. Department of Justice to do their job, and hold Planned Parenthood accountable to the law, the same as any other organization, the same that we would expect for any other organization that's in violation of federal law, which is something that, again, a Federal Appeals Court has now looked at the evidence and said this is - this - this is probable cause that this is going on.",

      "sentences": "An update tonight on the dysfunction of our Federal Immigration System. According to a recent report by the Associated Press, in the past decade, the U.S. government has approved more than 5,000 requests to bring child brides into this country. Child brides! That is not a euphemism. That means girls younger than 18 and, in some cases, much, much younger, too young to sign contracts, too young to vote, too young to be forcibly married, transported to this country to marry men typically far older than they are. In one case, highlighted by the AP, the husband was 48 years old. The child he married was 14. Is this legal? Well for most Americans, it would not be legal. All but a few states have a minimum age for marriage. But those laws do not apply to immigrant spouses. For them, there is no minimum age. Naila Amin was forcibly engaged to her cousin at the age of eight. At 13, her family flew her to Pakistan to conduct the marriage ceremony, and then told her to petition the U.S. government to allow her adult husband/cousin to enter this country. That petition was granted. Let's be honest here. This is not a mere cultural difference. No 13-year old child can meaningfully consent to marry. In the United States, if an adult has sex with a middle schooler, we call it rape. But when government bureaucrats grant immigration petitions, they don't consider that. They consider only whether the marriage would be legal in the person's home country. Pakistan has a very different definition of marriage and of rape than the West does. Many Americans may not even understand how different. By sanctioning Amin's forced marriage at the age of 13, America became an accomplice to sexual slavery. In order to escape bondage, Amin ran away from home and spent the rest of her childhood in group homes and in foster care. American officials apparently don't care about her or any of these girls. We know that because this sort of thing happens all the time. There are at least a 150 cases of American officials helping a minor child unite with a spouse 40 years or older. This is an attack on American values by American bureaucrats. There's a reason why almost everybody was disgusted by the allegations that Roy Moore may have romantically pursued young girls. It's creepy, and it's wrong. And, by the way, Americans have always felt that way because this has always been a civilized country. Records from 17th Century New England show the colonists felt that way too. Even then, they were not marrying children. Americans view child marriage as backward and predatory because it is. Yet, at the same time, our immigration officials are doing what they can to normalize it and bring it here. Will Congress do anything about this? They easily could. Democrats say they're the party of women and of women's rights. Why not prove that? Why not introduce legislation in the House tomorrow? Just write a bill that bans the importation of children as spouses. Republicans would support that. The President would sign it. It would be a rare bipartisan achievement, something that benefits America, and also sends a clear message about what sort of society we are and plan to remain. But, of course, Congress won't do that, just like they won't take MS-13 seriously or stop giving citizenship to the anchor babies of Chinese tourists. There is no American value that is so precious that our leaders won't throw it away for the sake of more immigration. Well lawmakers in California haven't gotten around to fixing the State's infrastructure, its housing crisis, its homelessness, its vanishing middle- class. But they are at the forefront of another fight, re-writing grammar. Last week, the Chair of the State Senate Judiciary Committee announced that only gender-neutral pronouns would be permitted on her, or rather, their committee.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” For a few overheated hours on Saturday, a group of boys from a Catholic High School in Kentucky became the most hated figures in America. Television anchors denounced them as bigots. Journalists with Harvard degrees called them privileged. Republican commentators scolded them as bad Christians. Famous actors suggested they should be hunted down and punched in the face. Some on social media called for them to be killed. The boys stood accused of mocking an elderly Vietnam Veteran, an American Indian man, and doing it in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. Now, the story had no inherent news significance. It didn't mobilize troops or move markets or re-open the government. But as a symbolic event, it's hard to remember a moment more galvanizing in Washington. As they read their Twitter feeds, the leaders of this country were in rare and solemn agreement. These teenage monsters, these remorseless thugs from our backward provinces are living examples of all that is rotten and immoral about America. That was the consensus on Saturday. Pretty much everybody agreed with it. And then, suddenly, the Covington Catholic story exploded, popped like an overfilled balloon animal. New footage of the event emerged. And it turns out the boys never attacked anyone. In fact, they stood in place as others approached and harassed them. People did indeed scream racial epithets at the Lincoln Memorial over the weekend. But it wasn't Catholic kids from Kentucky. Watch."

      "utterance": "Now, whatever it is you just saw in that tape, it does not confirm what they were telling you on Saturday on Twitter, just the opposite. The official story was a lie. And who knows what would have happened to the boys from Covington Catholic if the tape you just saw had never been posted to the internet? They'd probably be living under assumed names by now. Instead, the facts exonerated them and implicated their accusers. From brunch tables across Washington, reporters rushed to delete their outraged tweets. Some of them even apologized for passing rash judgment, and good for them. But amazingly, many others pretended that nothing had happened. They didn't acknowledge the new tape. They kept up their original attacks. Being woke means never having to say you're sorry. CNN Political Analyst, Kirsten Powers now says the boys are guilty of \"Disrespecting an indigenous elder.\" That elder would be Nathan Phillips, the man with the now-famous drum. There is growing evidence tonight that Phillips concocted key elements of his story as well as parts of his own biography, and that he's done it before. The press isn't rushing to find out. Kirsten Powers doesn't seem to care one way or the other, nor did she explain how precisely the boys disrespected Phillips. Identity politics doesn't concern itself with details like these. It's not about individuals or what actually happened to specific people on a given day. Identity politics is a set of moral judgments about groups. Some groups are always right, no matter what the tape shows. Laura Wagner didn't even bother to look at the tape. Wagner is a Reporter at Deadspin that used to be a sports site before the Revolution began. In an article last night, Wagner described the boys' behavior at the Lincoln Memorial as \"A racially-charged frenzy of barely-contained violence\" that was committed by a \"Frothing mass of MAGA youth, frenzied and yelling and out of control.\" She went on like this paragraph after paragraph. And, of course, anyone who disagree with that assessment is a racist. Keep in mind as you read that that there was literally nothing in the record, the documentary record on tape or in the testimony of anyone to support any of Wagner's claims. Every word is just made up out of nothing. Imagine if someone was writing things like that about your son. At Covington Catholic, classes were canceled today. Thanks to people like Laura Wagner, there were too many threats. Here are two seniors from the school."

Less than that actually, they're from a hostile country, a place we must subdue for our own safety. That's the attitude, and it may account for the Left's embrace of violent rhetoric in the age of Trump. Back more than a year ago, when CNN anchors publicly defended Antifa, it seemed at the time like they might have misspoken, may be they didn't know what Antifa was. Now, it's clear they knew exactly what Antifa was. Our ruling class has told us that they're fine with punching Nazis. Now they've declared they're OK with punching children. How long before they're OK with punching you? Jim Wilson was a chaperone for the Covington Boys in D.C., and he joins us tonight. Mr. Wilson, thank you for coming on.

But there had been so much effort to get my response that today I did put out a - a series of three tweets back to back to back, giving my thoughts. And my assessment is this. The level of bigotry that was evident throughout this came from one side entirely, and - and it was twofold. It came in the moments prior to the little snippet that sent people into a tizzy, when there was true racial bigotry shown by people that were with the fellow drumming when they told people to go back to Europe that this was theirs country. And also, preceding even that as people were yelling, some incredibly vile and racist things, at these teenage students, none of that was covered. That was the only true racism and bigotry that was evident on that day. Since that time, there's been an incredible amount of bigotry shown by the media. The people who took this and ran with this, who did not verify anything, the people who made assumptions about these kids because of their color, because of their gender, because of their faith, because of where they lived, because of the hat that they were wearing, people didn't bother to do the basic checking of facts that anybody who's worth their salt in the media should have and would have done, because this fit the narrative and the stereotype and the bigotry that they wanted so desperately to be able to run with. And I find it offensive that people have insulted these students as they did. Could they have themselves in every instance perhaps behaved more gentlemanly? Probably so. But as somebody who has a 20-year old and six teenagers to boot, I can tell you teenagers sometimes act silly and goofy and irresponsible. But these children acted far more responsible during the course of that 20-minute interaction or so than any of the adults that were involved."

So, as you've just heard your previous guest talk about, not only is Planned Parenthood raking in more taxpayer money than ever before in their latest annual report, bringing in more money from private donations than ever before, and also doing more abortions and making more money off of their abortion program than ever before. And as the videos that I did with The Center for Medical Progress show and the Federal Appeals Court from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has now determined definitively, that the undercover videos show that Planned Parenthood resorts to criminal abortion methods to harvest more marketable body parts from their abortions. And this is something that's horrifying to normal everyday Americans. It's something that treats their patients as if they're just harvesting pods or a cash crop for Planned Parenthood. And it's something that's against federal law. And that Planned Parenthood is still under active federal investigation by the DOJ on account of, so there's no reason that this is--"

So far, at the very least, there were two very good Congressional investigations done, multiple criminal referrals that went to state and local and federal law enforcement. So far, at least in Southern California, the District Attorney in Southern California did bring an initial case against two of Planned Parenthood's business partners in Southern California that was the - the first successful prosecution of a note (ph) of their baby parts trafficking network, it resulted in a $7.8 million settlement, shutting the companies down, and they admitted guilt for selling body parts for profit that they harvested at the local Planned Parenthood. So now, everybody's waiting for the U.S. Department of Justice to do their job, and hold Planned Parenthood accountable to the law, the same as any other organization, the same that we would expect for any other organization that's in violation of federal law, which is something that, again, a Federal Appeals Court has now looked at the evidence and said this is - this - this is probable cause that this is going on."

      "utterance": "An update tonight on the dysfunction of our Federal Immigration System. According to a recent report by the Associated Press, in the past decade, the U.S. government has approved more than 5,000 requests to bring child brides into this country. Child brides! That is not a euphemism. That means girls younger than 18 and, in some cases, much, much younger, too young to sign contracts, too young to vote, too young to be forcibly married, transported to this country to marry men typically far older than they are. In one case, highlighted by the AP, the husband was 48 years old. The child he married was 14. Is this legal? Well for most Americans, it would not be legal. All but a few states have a minimum age for marriage. But those laws do not apply to immigrant spouses. For them, there is no minimum age. Naila Amin was forcibly engaged to her cousin at the age of eight. At 13, her family flew her to Pakistan to conduct the marriage ceremony, and then told her to petition the U.S. government to allow her adult husband/cousin to enter this country. That petition was granted. Let's be honest here. This is not a mere cultural difference. No 13-year old child can meaningfully consent to marry. In the United States, if an adult has sex with a middle schooler, we call it rape. But when government bureaucrats grant immigration petitions, they don't consider that. They consider only whether the marriage would be legal in the person's home country. Pakistan has a very different definition of marriage and of rape than the West does. Many Americans may not even understand how different. By sanctioning Amin's forced marriage at the age of 13, America became an accomplice to sexual slavery. In order to escape bondage, Amin ran away from home and spent the rest of her childhood in group homes and in foster care. American officials apparently don't care about her or any of these girls. We know that because this sort of thing happens all the time. There are at least a 150 cases of American officials helping a minor child unite with a spouse 40 years or older. This is an attack on American values by American bureaucrats. There's a reason why almost everybody was disgusted by the allegations that Roy Moore may have romantically pursued young girls. It's creepy, and it's wrong. And, by the way, Americans have always felt that way because this has always been a civilized country. Records from 17th Century New England show the colonists felt that way too. Even then, they were not marrying children. Americans view child marriage as backward and predatory because it is. Yet, at the same time, our immigration officials are doing what they can to normalize it and bring it here. Will Congress do anything about this? They easily could. Democrats say they're the party of women and of women's rights. Why not prove that? Why not introduce legislation in the House tomorrow? Just write a bill that bans the importation of children as spouses. Republicans would support that. The President would sign it. It would be a rare bipartisan achievement, something that benefits America, and also sends a clear message about what sort of society we are and plan to remain. But, of course, Congress won't do that, just like they won't take MS-13 seriously or stop giving citizenship to the anchor babies of Chinese tourists. There is no American value that is so precious that our leaders won't throw it away for the sake of more immigration. Well lawmakers in California haven't gotten around to fixing the State's infrastructure, its housing crisis, its homelessness, its vanishing middle- class. But they are at the forefront of another fight, re-writing grammar. Last week, the Chair of the State Senate Judiciary Committee announced that only gender-neutral pronouns would be permitted on her, or rather, their committee."

This would include the invisibility cloak, warp drives and anti-gravity. The DIA spent $22 million from 2007 and 2005. The program apparently was initiated by then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Nick Pope is one of the world's experts in this. He once investigated UFOs for the British government.
