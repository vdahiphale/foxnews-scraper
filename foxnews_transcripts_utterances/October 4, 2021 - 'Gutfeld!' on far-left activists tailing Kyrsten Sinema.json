The Washington Post joined in, saying that reporters will now be expected to write pregnant individuals because not all pregnant people are women. The complete phrase pregnant women and other pregnant individuals. Meaning, I suppose, men. But once again, a reminder to all you narrow-minded types, yes, men can get pregnant. I refer to the men who have ovaries and wombs and can fertilize an egg and bring a baby to term. Oh, wait. Men don't have that stuff. And good luck trying. You put a Mercedes engine in a Toyota, it's still a Toyota. But mentioned the science, you risk marginalizing someone. Who would that be? Good question. I hate to tell you, but who is getting marginalized here is women. Men now appear on playboy. It's happened before, but this is different. Yes, check this out, a half-naked dude on the cover.

Right before he announced he was seeking your votes, a wannabe politician removes his posts, and he's taking a beating over his pathological tweeting. I speak of unstable gas bag Matthew Dowd, and I'm being - I'm being gentle. Because we wait to hear about this guy. Who he recently announced his candidacy for Texas lieutenant governor. Fox News reported that before announcing, he deleted about 175,000 tweets. That's a lot of tweets. That's a tweet for every shot Kat did this weekend. Now, he's just got under 6,000 tweets left. That's a tweet for every shot Kat did this morning. But I got to wonder if that sheer quantity of tweets makes him insane regardless of the actual content. Me, Tyrus, and Kat have about 85,000 tweets combined. And this guy has more than double that all by himself. He's crazy. There's something wrong with him. But when asked about it by CNN's favorite cicada eating anchor -- or cicada, never remember, he called it a conspiracy.",

The Washington Post joined in, saying that reporters will now be expected to write pregnant individuals because not all pregnant people are women. The complete phrase pregnant women and other pregnant individuals. Meaning, I suppose, men. But once again, a reminder to all you narrow-minded types, yes, men can get pregnant. I refer to the men who have ovaries and wombs and can fertilize an egg and bring a baby to term. Oh, wait. Men don't have that stuff. And good luck trying. You put a Mercedes engine in a Toyota, it's still a Toyota. But mentioned the science, you risk marginalizing someone. Who would that be? Good question.

It was between that and a story about Biden putting his shoes in the microwave by accident. Or was it by accident? We don't know. That just all of these things have one thing in common, vapid stupidity. The activists who chase people in the bathrooms are stupid and vapid. The people who demand you say pregnant individuals are stupid and vapid. And anyone who took over Playboy magazine, stupid, stupid, stupid, and vapid. They decided to live in a nonsense world and drag the rest of us into it. All this stupidity makes me missed Nashville, for it has a dome of impenetrable common sense that protects it from such idiocy.

Luckily, that magazine can't be canceled because it's too hard to spell for college kids. French President, they have one there, Emmanuel Macron, and Elizabeth Marino, the French Delegate Minister for Gender Equality and Diversity have expressed similar sentiments in recent months. So, we're too woke for a French gender equality and diversity minister. that's saying something, something. On top of that, unlike us the French are still not afraid of bread.

But you know, in this case, I kind of want to propose a trade. I mean, I'm -- there are people in their government who I'd much rather have here.

So, I know there's a lot of paperwork when it comes to that stuff. Good thing we have the best and brightest in our administration to get on that. So, we're probably going to get some, some you know, some negative feedback from France.

That's how weak the woke has gotten to where France is like this is our chance to get out of the basement guys. It's the woke; we're not going to be picked on anymore.
