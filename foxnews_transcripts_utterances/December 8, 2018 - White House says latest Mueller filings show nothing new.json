Fox News channel, chief national correspondent Ed Henry is here to break it all down. Let's begin with Cohen. I was looking over the filing, it looks like most of it is about cheating the IRS for millions and millions of dollars and the payment to the mistresses was very, very small and people argue that that could be personal expenses since it came out of Donald Trump's personal bank account."

I am just going to go through some of the highlights, the first blush that we have seen here. He was asked a question here about whether or not it was proper for Jeff Sessions to recuse himself. And he indicated that he thought that this was an obvious case for recusal. Trey Gowdy also asked Director Comey here who at the FBI has the authority to launch an investigation into a major political campaign. Would it require approval by you? And Comey said, \"I don't know that I ever encountered in circumstance where an investigation was launched into a major political campaign.\" He talked about 100 million to one. He said, who won those campaigns when their odds were 100 million to one and he said, \"Well, I don't know.\" Would it be Mao Zedong, would it be Joseph Stalin? Those were actual quotes from the transcript here. At different points, Jesse in the interview here, he applauded the Mueller probe. He said that this was an all-star team - that's the quote - of prosecutor and attorneys who were put together in this and he said quote, \"I would bet my life that Bob Mueller would do things the right way.\" Now, this was only the first round of this. He was up there for about six and a half hours. He is going to coming back on the 17th.

All of this is a way to quote, \"Spark a conversation\" about the current illegal immigration situation at the border. Here with their thoughts, Diamond and Silk. So, I guess they are trying to make a point about Donald Trump separated families. He put kids in cages.  I mean, what are you guys supposed to say about that? Obama put baby Jesus in a cage first?"

They should be focused on all of the hate that's going on from the Democratic Party and Democrats that hate this sitting President. That's what they should be focused on instead of putting baby Jesus in a cage. Because Donald Trump didn't do that. That was done under the Obama administration.

If you're a woman who voted for Donald Trump, it turns out you're too stupid to make your own decisions. That's according to Barbra Streisand who told the \"Daily Mail\" quote, \"I love my country and it's painful to see democracy being assaulted, institutions being assaulted and women being assaulted. A lot of women vote the way their husbands vote. They don't believe enough in their own thoughts. Maybe that woman who's so articulate, so experienced and so fit for the presidency, Hillary, was too intimidating.\" Wow.

      "speaker": "H. TURNER",
      "utterance": "Look, I'm about facts and I think Barbra's the one who's focusing on her feelings, so the facts are that women make 90% or 90% of women make the financial decisions for their households, that's why they voted for Donald Trump, 40% of women are the primary income earners for their families, that's why they voted for Donald Trump and it's estimated that they're going to be the majority of income earners, primary income earners for their families in the future. Look, when was the last time Barbra Streisand went to the store and saw what a gallon of milk cost? She has no idea. The women - women know what they need for their families and they knew that President Trump was going to deliver for them and that's why they voted the way they did and they're going vote that way again in 2020. It's not about emotions for us, it's about taking care of our families and doing what's right for our kids and for the future of our country."
