New York Governor Andrew Cuomo showing little remorse, taking zero responsibility and saying who cares? The governor answering questions for the first time after his incompetence, got called out by his state's own Democratic A.G. The A.G. releasing a damning report, showing that New York underreported nursing home deaths by as much is up to 50 percent. This is a massive failure that caused 12,000 people their lives. So, Cuomo is obviously sorry about it, right? Not a chance.",

So, look, he made a mistake, he was trying to keep the capacity in the hospitals by telling people to go back to nursing homes.

I don't know why Cuomo again would have thanked President Trump if he was really the one who was the problem here. And I want to look forward. I mean, you've had -- you have a number of criminal charges that have been brought in places like Massachusetts against nursing home leaders for a situation that occurred with coronavirus. You have a grand jury investigating nursing homes in New Jersey. And today, you have people like Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik from New York saying there need to be subpoenas of Andrew Cuomo, all of his staff members, lobbyists, who they were talking to because we need to get to the bottom of this and find out if there is any kind of criminal liability for this. And Andrew Cuomo, given the series of facts here and his statements and his flippant attitude about people dying and who cares where they died, you know, I think people are going to want some answers. And when you have your own attorney general who is also a Democrat, not a Republican, nailing you for cooking up the numbers or ignoring the numbers or reclassifying them, you know, Elise Stefanik says this is not just about a nursing home scandal anymore, this is about corruption. And so, and then one more thing. The White House will not comment on this. You know, they were asked about this today by Kristin Fisher. And Andrew Cuomo was almost Joe Biden's attorney general. So, this idea that they are now not commenting on this massive scandal and the media covering it up when COVID has been like the biggest story for them for the last year, really there are a lot of questions moving forward, but the criminal liability part I think is something to watch.",

He said the reason people in nursing homes are dying at faster rates than the rest of Americans is because they are older, and they have comorbidities. And then he went on to say this is really all just a big tragedy. That's a way of throwing up your hands and saying look, it was an act of God. What could we have done? We did the best we could. And to answer Greg's question really quickly though, about why the media fell so hard for the governor. I think the answer is that, they started covering his press conferences back during the height of the pandemic, and completely stopped covering his actual policies that he was implementing at the time. It's a real blind spot with the media and politicians right now in this country. They start watching their mouths, what they are saying, and they stop watching what they are doing. It's something that we saw with President Trump. If somebody says things that are outlandish, no one cares about your policies. They want to talk about your tweets and what you said at the press conference. It's the same thing sort of, in reverse with Cuomo.",

And it's actually safer than not having them at school when they're going off and doing whatever they want, hanging out with each other whatever, and not social distancing. I remember when I was a teen. We didn't social distance at all. But let's not forget the COVID package was deliberately delayed so Trump would lose. And people died because of that. People suffered. People died. So, they got blood on their hands. So, they can't come here -- Jen -- you know, Jen, I have to say Jen Psaki sounded a lot like Donald Trump who was the first and loudest proponent for schools reopening, which was based on data. But when he doubled down on that, he was accused of putting teachers and children at risk. And the media consistently would do that with any kind of act meant to help the economy or help people get back to work or help people from going crazy or overdosing in their isolation. Anytime you even brought that up, you would be portrayed as somebody who would let people die, that you didn't believe in safety first. So, this is now the -- now, they've inherited the problem.

The governor answering questions for the first time after his incompetence, got called out by his state's own Democratic A.G. The A.G. releasing a damning report, showing that New York underreported nursing home deaths by as much is up to 50 percent. This is a massive failure that caused 12,000 people their lives.

We hate you, Donald Trump, but we love him.

They said that his role in the pandemic was less than stellar, which is like saying the Hindenburg's final flight was less than stellar. It's also really, really, really hard to listen to Cuomo because of the way he talks. Just now it's as though you are stupid, and you've got to talk really slow like you're some dumb weather lady that seems to be his default position about everybody. And I love how he says look to the federal government, but I don't want to point any fingers. who signed the order, Cuomo? I think it's you.

This was all about whether someone got sick in a nursing home, died in the nursing home, or died in the hospital. So, look, he made a mistake, he was trying to keep the capacity in the hospitals by telling people to go back to nursing homes. I think it was an error, and it's very clear, and he is being scolded by it for it on the front page of American newspapers as I read them this morning.

      "utterance": "I think if Andrew Cuomo is going to blame anybody, maybe he can like give China a little bit of the blame here, the Chinese Communist Party, but you know, he's like blaming President Trump. I don't know why Cuomo again would have thanked President Trump if he was really the one who was the problem here. And I want to look forward. I mean, you've had -- you have a number of criminal charges that have been brought in places like Massachusetts against nursing home leaders for a situation that occurred with coronavirus. You have a grand jury investigating nursing homes in New Jersey. And today, you have people like Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik from New York saying there need to be subpoenas of Andrew Cuomo, all of his staff members, lobbyists, who they were talking to because we need to get to the bottom of this and find out if there is any kind of criminal liability for this. And Andrew Cuomo, given the series of facts here and his statements and his flippant attitude about people dying and who cares where they died, you know, I think people are going to want some answers. And when you have your own attorney general who is also a Democrat, not a Republican, nailing you for cooking up the numbers or ignoring the numbers or reclassifying them, you know, Elise Stefanik says this is not just about a nursing home scandal anymore, this is about corruption. And so, and then one more thing. The White House will not comment on this. You know, they were asked about this today by Kristin Fisher. And Andrew Cuomo was almost Joe Biden's attorney general. So, this idea that they are now not commenting on this massive scandal and the media covering it up when COVID has been like the biggest story for them for the last year, really there are a lot of questions moving forward, but the criminal liability part I think is something to watch."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Gillian, we are trying to be fair to Cuomo. He did get dealt a tough hand, as Juan said. I guess he did the best he could. Juan said it was a mistake and that was the right thing to say. But, Cuomo, if you listen to him, he didn't even admit it was a mistake. He said well, if you think it was a mistake, you know, talk to the Trump administration. He won't even admit that he made a mistake, and that's why people are hammering him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "I watch the whole press conference today. My takeaway was that he went on defense, which as you say, Jesse, is really the only thing he could do. But what I took from it was that today Cuomo was trying to make the case that everything that has happened in New York is essentially like an act of God. He said the reason people in nursing homes are dying at faster rates than the rest of Americans is because they are older, and they have comorbidities. And then he went on to say this is really all just a big tragedy. That's a way of throwing up your hands and saying look, it was an act of God. What could we have done? We did the best we could. And to answer Greg's question really quickly though, about why the media fell so hard for the governor. I think the answer is that, they started covering his press conferences back during the height of the pandemic, and completely stopped covering his actual policies that he was implementing at the time. It's a real blind spot with the media and politicians right now in this country. They start watching their mouths, what they are saying, and they stop watching what they are doing. It's something that we saw with President Trump. If somebody says things that are outlandish, no one cares about your policies. They want to talk about your tweets and what you said at the press conference. It's the same thing sort of, in reverse with Cuomo."

It's really about Wall Street and big tech against main street, against the little guy. What happened yesterday was incredible. Big tech inserted themselves into this situation and essentially sided with the hedge funders.

You know, it's interesting that Joe Biden ran as a moderate, and now all of a sudden, AOC is praising this Green New Deal plan as something that Biden supports when Joe Biden continuously said on the campaign trail that he doesn't support the Green New Deal, although he does support some kind of climate change legislation or executive orders. Well, now we know that his vice president, Kamala Harris, who co-sponsored the Green New Deal with AOC, is getting exactly what they want when it comes to this overwhelming takeover of the federal government in terms of climate change and going after every aspect of Americans lies because you can justify it by saying it's environmentally friendly."

But keep in mind that Joe Biden was completely written off by progressives during the primaries. They said he's too old, he's too white. He's too embedded in the establishment to make the kind of progressive change that we want to see in this country. But right now, where we are two weeks in, if you look at the 40 executive actions he's taken, progressives are very, very happy with it. That's what Greg was talking about when you see Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren and now AOC lining up behind these policy proposals.

I think parents want schools open, but they also want their kids safe. There's nothing more valuable in our lives than our children, our grandchildren. And people want to know that those kids are going to be safe. So, right now, I think you're seeing lots of school districts open, you know, the lower schools open.

And it's actually safer than not having them at school when they're going off and doing whatever they want, hanging out with each other whatever, and not social distancing. I remember when I was a teen. We didn't social distance at all. But let's not forget the COVID package was deliberately delayed so Trump would lose. And people died because of that. People suffered. People died. So, they got blood on their hands. So, they can't come here -- Jen -- you know, Jen, I have to say Jen Psaki sounded a lot like Donald Trump who was the first and loudest proponent for schools reopening, which was based on data. But when he doubled down on that, he was accused of putting teachers and children at risk. And the media consistently would do that with any kind of act meant to help the economy or help people get back to work or help people from going crazy or overdosing in their isolation. Anytime you even brought that up, you would be portrayed as somebody who would let people die, that you didn't believe in safety first. So, this is now the -- now, they've inherited the problem. They're no longer on the Dems in the left or no longer on the outside who can gawk and make fun of people. Now, they've got the responsibility, and suddenly they're discovering nuance. They're saying, oh, this is very hard. This is very difficult. Well, it was too hard and difficult under Trump and you didn't seem to mind calling him a mass murderer."

Take a look at her in the 1974 film The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. Tyson won two Emmys for that show portraying 110-year-old former slave telling her life story. She also won an Oscar nomination for her role in the movie Sounder. Obviously, no one gets an award for not taking a role, but Tyson earned a lot of respect for refusing to act and Blaxploitation movies which played to negative stereotypes. She also was all over the celebrity press as the wife of the famous trumpeter Miles Davis. Rest in peace, Cicely Tyson. You will be remembered."

Three -- I'm going to have three videos and you get to vote which one is best. Check out this cat climbing up the wall. That's pretty impressive. There he is wagging his tail. He knows what time it is. All right. Let's go to the second video. Here we go. This is interesting. You have to wait for it. Oh, there you go, a little bit of it. A lot of cats involved in that one. A lot of -- what are -- the birds are on TV. All right, and let's go to the third one. This is just a cat beating on a banana. He thinks the banana is something else.
