I mean, it really created a generation of Goldwater supporters who saw really him to sort of personify a new way of thinking about things. He was very important because he broke the establishment's grip on the Republican Party. He lost badly in the general election to Johnson, who probably was going to win anyway because John F. Kennedy had been assassinated and weren't going to change presidents twice that quickly, but Goldwater sort of planted the flag, and ironically in defeat, he asked Ronald Reagan to make a nationwide speech in October of '64. And so, in a way the conservative flag was passed from Barry to Ronnie at that moment. Reagan's speech was electrifying and he went onto become governor of California, and I would argue that there's a continuum that starts with Goldwater, goes to Reagan that in many ways Nixon and all the traditional Republicans are place holders. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just as later on the Bushes would be place holders, because they don't actually understand the long-term trajectory of conservatism. Reagan comes along, oddly becomes a very consequential president in three ways, defeating the Soviet empire, which is an enormous achievement. One of the greatest strategic victories of all time because he did it without a war. Relaunching the American economy, getting people to feel good about being entrepreneurs and really focus on American civic culture. In fact, in his farewell address, he says one of his great sadness was that they had not driven home American history enough. But he was trying to rebuild the sense of being American. You then have a period that were the doldrums and we come along with a contract with America and for the first time in 40 years, the Republicans win the House. We impose a balanced budget for four straight years, we imposed welfare reform. We have a number of other reforms. Bill Clinton actually comes to the Congress and with a straight face says the era of big government is over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was really a pretty remarkable moment, and left scars on the left which Hillary never overcame. I mean, there are a lot of liberals hated what the Clintons did, and then we, again sort of had a period of being in the doldrums and following some policies that frankly didn't work. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I mean, look, I was for the war in Iraq. I certainly for the war in Afghanistan, but you have to look 17 years later and say we haven't figured out how to win these things and along comes Trump, and I agree with you about describing Trump, and as you and I talked about earlier off camera, you have the tea party movement beginning to explode around 2010 because they couldn't grow up against a Republican president but they could rapidly mobilize against the Democratic president. And so you have a whole new wave of energy, and John Boehner and the House Republicans actually won ten more seats in 2010 than I won in 1994. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He was a very young guy at that point. That Donald Trump, I think, was stunningly shallow, and sort of for whatever reform because that's what we're doing, and gradually began to change, and I think that it is watching Obama that drove him to the right, because there is just clearly - in a sense, Bush and the failure to win in Iran and Afghanistan drove him into a harsh critique of American foreign policy. And Obama's entire approach to policy drove Trump to just say \"This is crazy.\" Remember, years ago, I had the opportunity to spend time with the founder of Singapore who had been the great leader who created a remarkably successful country, and I asked him what was the basis of what he did? He said, \"You know, I was a graduate student in Britain during the labor government right after World War II, and every time I would encounter a problem, I'd ask myself, what would Clement Attlee and the socialists do?

He began to acquire allies like Dave Bossie and others who were naturally in the conservative movement. Sean Hannity, it's probably in some ways ironically his closest adviser in that period, and you can't do the \"Hannity\" show once or twice a week and not gradually become a conservative because it just doesn't work. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then I remember, Callista and I were in the meeting here in Washington and his first visit to Washington as a candidate, where we're sitting around and people, to your point, people were kind of going, \"This guy a total opportunist, why would I believe him?\" And somebody in the group came up and said, \"Why don't we put together a list of ten solid conservatives that you would name to the Supreme Court, so that people can realize here's stability, here's a clear commitment. It's a yes or no.\" And Leonard Leo and Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation agreed to take the lead, and Leonard Leo who is the head of the Federalist Society. That's one of the big changes I think because we now have relationships that we didn't have 30 years ago.

He wrote it back in 2006-2007 and it really, in retrospect, I read it at time and it sort of indicated Hillary was going to have a hard time, and Obama has a small role in the book. You don't see Obama necessarily emerging, but you clearly see that at least half the party opposed Hillary because they thought her husband had sold out. And Clinton had interestingly exactly the same experience as his counterpart in Great Britain, in that they - they both tried to bring their party to the middle. They were both in the end repudiated by their party because the left-wing of their party was the dominant wing and the wing that has all the energy. And so what's happened is - and then Obama comes along and Obama is a radical. I mean, the one person I know personally who really got this fairly early was Sean. Hannity very early said, \"Look, this guy is exactly out of rules for radicals and exactly represents that kind of radicalism.\" So he kept the left relatively happy because under the happy face, they knew he was really them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I would say 60% of the Democratic Party today is a radical party.

He is a Harvard graduate, he served a brief time in Congress, but he's shown himself to be a leader. A solid conservative, a Trump supporter. You have Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, it's a corrupt city. The murder rate is through the roof. He pushes taxes through the roof. He was Bernie Sanders' candidate. He has worked for People for the American Way. Norman Leary, he's backed by George Soros and I watched this debate last night, he keeps bringing up race.

So by the early 1960s, you had a reaction building in the country. It said, the government is too big, our policy against the Soviet Union is too weak, our taxes are too high and frankly, we don't want Washington running our lives. The guy who personified that was Barry Goldwater and he wrote a little book called \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" which came out in paperback, and I was a college student at the time, and it just swept the country. I mean, it really created a generation of Goldwater supporters who saw really him to sort of personify a new way of thinking about things. He was very important because he broke the establishment's grip on the Republican Party. He lost badly in the general election to Johnson, who probably was going to win anyway because John F. Kennedy had been assassinated and weren't going to change presidents twice that quickly, but Goldwater sort of planted the flag, and ironically in defeat, he asked Ronald Reagan to make a nationwide speech in October of '64. And so, in a way the conservative flag was passed from Barry to Ronnie at that moment. Reagan's speech was electrifying and he went onto become governor of California, and I would argue that there's a continuum that starts with Goldwater, goes to Reagan that in many ways Nixon and all the traditional Republicans are place holders. Just as later on the Bushes would be place holders, because they don't actually understand the long-term trajectory of conservatism. Reagan comes along, oddly becomes a very consequential president in three ways, defeating the Soviet empire, which is an enormous achievement. One of the greatest strategic victories of all time because he did it without a war. Relaunching the American economy, getting people to feel good about being entrepreneurs and really focus on American civic culture. In fact, in his farewell address, he says one of his great sadness was that they had not driven home American history enough. But he was trying to rebuild the sense of being American. You then have a period that were the doldrums and we come along with a contract with America and for the first time in 40 years, the Republicans win the House. We impose a balanced budget for four straight years, we imposed welfare reform. We have a number of other reforms. Bill Clinton actually comes to the Congress and with a straight face says the era of big government is over. It was really a pretty remarkable moment, and left scars on the left which Hillary never overcame. I mean, there are a lot of liberals hated what the Clintons did, and then we, again sort of had a period of being in the doldrums and following some policies that frankly didn't work. I mean, look, I was for the war in Iraq. I certainly for the war in Afghanistan, but you have to look 17 years later and say we haven't figured out how to win these things and along comes Trump, and I agree with you about describing Trump, and as you and I talked about earlier off camera, you have the tea party movement beginning to explode around 2010 because they couldn't grow up against a Republican president but they could rapidly mobilize against the Democratic president. And so you have a whole new wave of energy, and John Boehner and the House Republicans actually won ten more seats in 2010 than I won in 1994.",

We held the House for two two-year terms between 1930 and 1994, so out of 64 years, we held the House four years. We've now had the House a vast majority of the time since 1994. And along comes Trump, and I agree with you, I tell people I'm not sure he's a conservative but he's the most effective anti- liberal in my lifetime. And whether it's deregulation or conservative judges or cutting taxes or standing up for an American foreign policy based on American values, every time you turn around, he is instinctively saying things which drive the left crazy, and he's doing it, I think, because of this notion of common sense, and the things he learned a long time ago. Again, he's old enough, he remembers the values of the post World War II, highly patriotic America, where people love the flag and they love the idea that we were the greatest nation on earth and they love the values of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

He was a very young guy at that point. That Donald Trump, I think, was stunningly shallow, and sort of for whatever reform because that's what we're doing, and gradually began to change, and I think that it is watching Obama that drove him to the right, because there is just clearly - in a sense, Bush and the failure to win in Iran and Afghanistan drove him into a harsh critique of American foreign policy. And Obama's entire approach to policy drove Trump to just say \"This is crazy.\" Remember, years ago, I had the opportunity to spend time with the founder of Singapore who had been the great leader who created a remarkably successful country, and I asked him what was the basis of what he did? He said, \"You know, I was a graduate student in Britain during the labor government right after World War II, and every time I would encounter a problem, I'd ask myself, what would Clement Attlee and the socialists do? And I would do the exact opposite. And it worked every time.\" And I think, in a sense, Trump came out of Obama years having been driven to a much more practical businessman, commonsense approach and because he wanted to run as a Republican. He began to acquire allies like Dave Bossie and others who were naturally in the conservative movement. Sean Hannity, it's probably in some ways ironically his closest adviser in that period, and you can't do the \"Hannity\" show once or twice a week and not gradually become a conservative because it just doesn't work. And then I remember, Callista and I were in the meeting here in Washington and his first visit to Washington as a candidate, where we're sitting around and people, to your point, people were kind of going, \"This guy a total opportunist, why would I believe him?\" And somebody in the group came up and said, \"Why don't we put together a list of ten solid conservatives that you would name to the Supreme Court, so that people can realize here's stability, here's a clear commitment. It's a yes or no.\" And Leonard Leo and Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation agreed to take the lead, and Leonard Leo who is the head of the Federalist Society. That's one of the big changes I think because we now have relationships that we didn't have 30 years ago.

Two hours later, it's clear that Hillary is going to lose, and if Hillary is going to lose, that means, \"Oh, my God, Donald J. Trump is going to be president.\" So this two hours is the equivalent of psychologically of an IED going off. And they get basically the equivalent of PTSD. I mean, these people are all in a state of shock. They try to recover and this part of Trump's genius. Every morning they wake up and they think this could this be a better day, and then he's already tweeted six times before they get awake, and go, \"Oh, my God, he's still president,\" and go right back into the PTSD. And so what you've had is a collective psychotics experience by the entire left, who would then get together in sort of therapy support groups called fundraisers and cocktail parties and what have you, and they all talk to each other and they get hysterical. And so Max Boot, a good historian wrote at one point he'd rather vote for Joseph Stalin than for Donald Trump. Now, that is an insane comment.

You don't see Obama necessarily emerging, but you clearly see that at least half the party opposed Hillary because they thought her husband had sold out. And Clinton had interestingly exactly the same experience as his counterpart in Great Britain, in that they - they both tried to bring their party to the middle. They were both in the end repudiated by their party because the left-wing of their party was the dominant wing and the wing that has all the energy. And so what's happened is - and then Obama comes along and Obama is a radical. I mean, the one person I know personally who really got this fairly early was Sean. Hannity very early said, \"Look, this guy is exactly out of rules for radicals and exactly represents that kind of radicalism.\" So he kept the left relatively happy because under the happy face, they knew he was really them. Now, I would say 60% of the Democratic Party today is a radical party. Kevin McCarthy had it exactly right when he said, \"This is a now campaign between America and socialism. It's not between Democrats and Republicans.\" And I think this is now the socialist party of the United States, and you look at places like Venezuela which is disintegrating, and you have to ask yourself how can any rational person favor the kind of socialism that every time it's tried is a disaster.",

And people have said he left as a British subject, he came back as an American, and in a way, this thing about being an American starts there. And I think it's important to recognize it, but what Trump is saying, when he uses the word nationalism isn't at a level of a Federalist anti- Federalist arguments, but it's saying look, these guys on the left want to basically sell our country out for some kind of global cause whether it's the Paris Accords or the International Criminal Court or the United Nations. You know, I tell people the reason that John Kerry runs all over the world the way he does and the reason he still sees the Iranians is in Kerry's mind, he was never really the American Secretary of State, he was a world Secretary of State, doing good things on behalf of the world, which is why I don't think you could charge him with the Logan Act because you'd have to be an American in order to be charged him with the Logan Act and Kerry is not psychologically an American, he's psychologically a person of the globe and would regard people who care about America as sort of pygmies, obsolete.",

You have got a governorship race there, Ron deSantis and Andrew Gillum. Ron deSantis, is a war veteran. He is a Harvard graduate, he served a brief time in Congress, but he's shown himself to be a leader. A solid conservative, a Trump supporter. You have Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, it's a corrupt city. The murder rate is through the roof. He pushes taxes through the roof. He was Bernie Sanders' candidate. He has worked for People for the American Way. Norman Leary, he's backed by George Soros and I watched this debate last night, he keeps bringing up race.

Then it turns out, he also took a trip to Central America - what are they saying about the FBI guy? And you have to say to yourself so you shouldn't be held accountable for anything you do because you're black? And I think it actually is a disservice to every African-American in the country to have a politician at that level who faced with their own personal corruption hides behind the issue of race because then - on the one level, he's sort of smearing every single person who's African-American, and that's just wrong.

It has nothing to do with race and I agree. To bring that up is really a disservice to African-Americans but it's a disservice to the people of Florida, too to play that kind of game and the media has largely - the national media, not the local media has let him off the hook. Let's take a look at another race. We have Texas, Ted Cruz seems to be doing much better against Robert Francis O'Rourke. I won't call him Beto. That's his deal. He can call himself Beto all he wants. But O'Rourke, he is another guy who is a hardcore leftist. He was a leftist for a few years representing El Paso in the House of Representatives.

I mean, it really created a generation of Goldwater supporters who saw really him to sort of personify a new way of thinking about things. He was very important because he broke the establishment's grip on the Republican Party. He lost badly in the general election to Johnson, who probably was going to win anyway because John F. Kennedy had been assassinated and weren't going to change presidents twice that quickly, but Goldwater sort of planted the flag, and ironically in defeat, he asked Ronald Reagan to make a nationwide speech in October of '64. And so, in a way the conservative flag was passed from Barry to Ronnie at that moment. Reagan's speech was electrifying and he went onto become governor of California, and I would argue that there's a continuum that starts with Goldwater, goes to Reagan that in many ways Nixon and all the traditional Republicans are place holders. Just as later on the Bushes would be place holders, because they don't actually understand the long-term trajectory of conservatism. Reagan comes along, oddly becomes a very consequential president in three ways, defeating the Soviet empire, which is an enormous achievement. One of the greatest strategic victories of all time because he did it without a war. Relaunching the American economy, getting people to feel good about being entrepreneurs and really focus on American civic culture. In fact, in his farewell address, he says one of his great sadness was that they had not driven home American history enough. But he was trying to rebuild the sense of being American. You then have a period that were the doldrums and we come along with a contract with America and for the first time in 40 years, the Republicans win the House. We impose a balanced budget for four straight years, we imposed welfare reform. We have a number of other reforms. Bill Clinton actually comes to the Congress and with a straight face says the era of big government is over. It was really a pretty remarkable moment, and left scars on the left which Hillary never overcame. I mean, there are a lot of liberals hated what the Clintons did, and then we, again sort of had a period of being in the doldrums and following some policies that frankly didn't work. I mean, look, I was for the war in Iraq. I certainly for the war in Afghanistan, but you have to look 17 years later and say we haven't figured out how to win these things and along comes Trump, and I agree with you about describing Trump, and as you and I talked about earlier off camera, you have the tea party movement beginning to explode around 2010 because they couldn't grow up against a Republican president but they could rapidly mobilize against the Democratic president. And so you have a whole new wave of energy, and John Boehner and the House Republicans actually won ten more seats in 2010 than I won in 1994."

When they came together, the people looked up and said, that's the right question. So we were back in charge of the House again. And I think people today have no idea how unusual this is. We held the House for two two-year terms between 1930 and 1994, so out of 64 years, we held the House four years. We've now had the House a vast majority of the time since 1994. And along comes Trump, and I agree with you, I tell people I'm not sure he's a conservative but he's the most effective anti- liberal in my lifetime. And whether it's deregulation or conservative judges or cutting taxes or standing up for an American foreign policy based on American values, every time you turn around, he is instinctively saying things which drive the left crazy, and he's doing it, I think, because of this notion of common sense, and the things he learned a long time ago. Again, he's old enough, he remembers the values of the post World War II, highly patriotic America, where people love the flag and they love the idea that we were the greatest nation on earth and they love the values of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. So in a lot of ways, he's carrying forward almost as a grandfather, the values of two generations ago and taking head on the left-wing radical values which the academic world, the news media is and Hollywood have tried to impose on the country."

That sitting there where the buck stops there, seeing these policies, seeing the impact of the policies or potential impact of the left's policies, using his common sense and using his business background and so forth and he's an incredibly intelligent man and he is sitting there and saying no, that's not right.

      "utterance": "I think that's partly true. I think the Donald Trump between 1983 or '84 and as early as the 80s, Oprah Winfrey is asking if he's going to run for president. He was a very young guy at that point. That Donald Trump, I think, was stunningly shallow, and sort of for whatever reform because that's what we're doing, and gradually began to change, and I think that it is watching Obama that drove him to the right, because there is just clearly - in a sense, Bush and the failure to win in Iran and Afghanistan drove him into a harsh critique of American foreign policy. And Obama's entire approach to policy drove Trump to just say \"This is crazy.\" Remember, years ago, I had the opportunity to spend time with the founder of Singapore who had been the great leader who created a remarkably successful country, and I asked him what was the basis of what he did? He said, \"You know, I was a graduate student in Britain during the labor government right after World War II, and every time I would encounter a problem, I'd ask myself, what would Clement Attlee and the socialists do? And I would do the exact opposite. And it worked every time.\" And I think, in a sense, Trump came out of Obama years having been driven to a much more practical businessman, commonsense approach and because he wanted to run as a Republican. He began to acquire allies like Dave Bossie and others who were naturally in the conservative movement. Sean Hannity, it's probably in some ways ironically his closest adviser in that period, and you can't do the \"Hannity\" show once or twice a week and not gradually become a conservative because it just doesn't work. And then I remember, Callista and I were in the meeting here in Washington and his first visit to Washington as a candidate, where we're sitting around and people, to your point, people were kind of going, \"This guy a total opportunist, why would I believe him?\" And somebody in the group came up and said, \"Why don't we put together a list of ten solid conservatives that you would name to the Supreme Court, so that people can realize here's stability, here's a clear commitment. It's a yes or no.\" And Leonard Leo and Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation agreed to take the lead, and Leonard Leo who is the head of the Federalist Society. That's one of the big changes I think because we now have relationships that we didn't have 30 years ago. You couldn't have produced the number of judges for Reagan that they're now producing for Trump."

They were all going to celebrate breaking the glass ceiling with Hillary. They were going to get radicals appointed to the Supreme Court and life was good. Two hours later, it's clear that Hillary is going to lose, and if Hillary is going to lose, that means, \"Oh, my God, Donald J. Trump is going to be president.\" So this two hours is the equivalent of psychologically of an IED going off. And they get basically the equivalent of PTSD. I mean, these people are all in a state of shock. They try to recover and this part of Trump's genius. Every morning they wake up and they think this could this be a better day, and then he's already tweeted six times before they get awake, and go, \"Oh, my God, he's still president,\" and go right back into the PTSD. And so what you've had is a collective psychotics experience by the entire left, who would then get together in sort of therapy support groups called fundraisers and cocktail parties and what have you, and they all talk to each other and they get hysterical. And so Max Boot, a good historian wrote at one point he'd rather vote for Joseph Stalin than for Donald Trump. Now, that is an insane comment. I mean, Stalin killed well over 30 million people, but it was just that sense of the mood, and trying to express how deeply he felt."

I think first of all, a lot of the current hard left was outlined in a terrific small book called by Matt Bai called \"The Argument.\" Bai is a \"New York Times\" reporter. He wrote it back in 2006-2007 and it really, in retrospect, I read it at time and it sort of indicated Hillary was going to have a hard time, and Obama has a small role in the book. You don't see Obama necessarily emerging, but you clearly see that at least half the party opposed Hillary because they thought her husband had sold out. And Clinton had interestingly exactly the same experience as his counterpart in Great Britain, in that they - they both tried to bring their party to the middle. They were both in the end repudiated by their party because the left-wing of their party was the dominant wing and the wing that has all the energy. And so what's happened is - and then Obama comes along and Obama is a radical. I mean, the one person I know personally who really got this fairly early was Sean. Hannity very early said, \"Look, this guy is exactly out of rules for radicals and exactly represents that kind of radicalism.\" So he kept the left relatively happy because under the happy face, they knew he was really them. Now, I would say 60% of the Democratic Party today is a radical party. Kevin McCarthy had it exactly right when he said, \"This is a now campaign between America and socialism. It's not between Democrats and Republicans.\" And I think this is now the socialist party of the United States, and you look at places like Venezuela which is disintegrating, and you have to ask yourself how can any rational person favor the kind of socialism that every time it's tried is a disaster."

I mean, they say, clearly you understand, you shouldn't be here. I mean, take the example of what Trump was saying about nationalism. Really one of the great magic moments of American history is Benjamin Franklin who goes to England to represent the colony of Pennsylvania, and after seven years realizes that he will never be accepted as an Englishman. That the aristocracy simply will not accept him even though he was a world-famous scientist and a very wealthy man. And people have said he left as a British subject, he came back as an American, and in a way, this thing about being an American starts there. And I think it's important to recognize it, but what Trump is saying, when he uses the word nationalism isn't at a level of a Federalist anti- Federalist arguments, but it's saying look, these guys on the left want to basically sell our country out for some kind of global cause whether it's the Paris Accords or the International Criminal Court or the United Nations. You know, I tell people the reason that John Kerry runs all over the world the way he does and the reason he still sees the Iranians is in Kerry's mind, he was never really the American Secretary of State, he was a world Secretary of State, doing good things on behalf of the world, which is why I don't think you could charge him with the Logan Act because you'd have to be an American in order to be charged him with the Logan Act and Kerry is not psychologically an American, he's psychologically a person of the globe and would regard people who care about America as sort of pygmies, obsolete."

So the reminder of the Kavanaugh fight that this is a team sport was particularly badly timed for all the Democrats running in states that Trump carried."

That looks like an invasion. It doesn't look like a family reunion.

You start losing states like Florida, you can't win. If you lose Texas and Florida, there's no way you can win a presidential election. But these are very, very important states. You have got a governorship race there, Ron deSantis and Andrew Gillum. Ron deSantis, is a war veteran. He is a Harvard graduate, he served a brief time in Congress, but he's shown himself to be a leader. A solid conservative, a Trump supporter. You have Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, it's a corrupt city. The murder rate is through the roof. He pushes taxes through the roof. He was Bernie Sanders' candidate. He has worked for People for the American Way. Norman Leary, he's backed by George Soros and I watched this debate last night, he keeps bringing up race. He's under investigation among others by the FBI and he says it's because of race. What is your comment on that?"

What is he saying to us? That it was okay to be corrupt if you're black? Or that it's not corrupt by definition if you're black because it's never corrupt? Then it turns out, he also took a trip to Central America - what are they saying about the FBI guy? And you have to say to yourself so you shouldn't be held accountable for anything you do because you're black? And I think it actually is a disservice to every African-American in the country to have a politician at that level who faced with their own personal corruption hides behind the issue of race because then - on the one level, he's sort of smearing every single person who's African-American, and that's just wrong. This is about him personally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "I agree with that. I mean, it had nothing to do with race. He's an undercover FBI agent, they're investigating a corrupt city and investigating they are investigating the mayor as part of it, and the fact is, he took the tickets to \"Hamilton,\" which he didn't pay for, the taxpayer paid for it, and the fact is he took the hotel room, the fact is he went to Costa Rica. It has nothing to do with race and I agree. To bring that up is really a disservice to African-Americans but it's a disservice to the people of Florida, too to play that kind of game and the media has largely - the national media, not the local media has let him off the hook. Let's take a look at another race. We have Texas, Ted Cruz seems to be doing much better against Robert Francis O'Rourke. I won't call him Beto. That's his deal. He can call himself Beto all he wants. But O'Rourke, he is another guy who is a hardcore leftist. He was a leftist for a few years representing El Paso in the House of Representatives. He's backed by Hollywood, he's backed by Manhattan, he's backed by the usual leftists, some billionaires and so forth. What do you make of that race?"

She crashed and burned. It's going to be doubly interesting in O'Rourke's case, because he has raised so much money, I think he's raised $68 million. If he loses with $68 million, at some point there's going to be kind of buyer's remorse."

If we lose both of them, then it could be a really long night. I think they're really central as a weather vane of what's going to happen.

You've got Rohrabacher, Hunter, a few of the other seats, you've got Chairman who has retired. I think, tell me if you agree, I think the media will do in this country is the report in such a way quote, unquote \"as to try and get the Democrats out, try and get the Democrat base out,\" because they know if it's close they need those six or seven California seats to put the Democrats over the top.

But I want to talk first before we get into the election because I think it's a crucial election, there are certain issues I want to talk about. Certain candidates I want to talk about. The media and so forth, but before we do, I think a little background is useful. You're a historian and Donald Trump, I would argue is one of the most conservative Presidents we've had in modern history. Now he may not be a conservative, you know, based on philosophy, but I think he's a conservative as a result of common sense, and his background as a developer and so forth. But also it's part of a trajectory. Explain this trajectory over the last several decades of conservatism and conservative victories."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Well, what had happened was that the Roosevelt-era Democrats created the modern system, the bureaucracy, centralized power, a whole set of values compounded by Eisenhower making a huge mistake in appointing Earl Warren and leading to a much more radical court that anybody can imagine. So by the early 1960s, you had a reaction building in the country. It said, the government is too big, our policy against the Soviet Union is too weak, our taxes are too high and frankly, we don't want Washington running our lives. The guy who personified that was Barry Goldwater and he wrote a little book called \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" which came out in paperback, and I was a college student at the time, and it just swept the country. I mean, it really created a generation of Goldwater supporters who saw really him to sort of personify a new way of thinking about things. He was very important because he broke the establishment's grip on the Republican Party. He lost badly in the general election to Johnson, who probably was going to win anyway because John F. Kennedy had been assassinated and weren't going to change presidents twice that quickly, but Goldwater sort of planted the flag, and ironically in defeat, he asked Ronald Reagan to make a nationwide speech in October of '64. And so, in a way the conservative flag was passed from Barry to Ronnie at that moment. Reagan's speech was electrifying and he went onto become governor of California, and I would argue that there's a continuum that starts with Goldwater, goes to Reagan that in many ways Nixon and all the traditional Republicans are place holders. Just as later on the Bushes would be place holders, because they don't actually understand the long-term trajectory of conservatism. Reagan comes along, oddly becomes a very consequential president in three ways, defeating the Soviet empire, which is an enormous achievement. One of the greatest strategic victories of all time because he did it without a war. Relaunching the American economy, getting people to feel good about being entrepreneurs and really focus on American civic culture. In fact, in his farewell address, he says one of his great sadness was that they had not driven home American history enough. But he was trying to rebuild the sense of being American. You then have a period that were the doldrums and we come along with a contract with America and for the first time in 40 years, the Republicans win the House. We impose a balanced budget for four straight years, we imposed welfare reform. We have a number of other reforms. Bill Clinton actually comes to the Congress and with a straight face says the era of big government is over. It was really a pretty remarkable moment, and left scars on the left which Hillary never overcame. I mean, there are a lot of liberals hated what the Clintons did, and then we, again sort of had a period of being in the doldrums and following some policies that frankly didn't work. I mean, look, I was for the war in Iraq. I certainly for the war in Afghanistan, but you have to look 17 years later and say we haven't figured out how to win these things and along comes Trump, and I agree with you about describing Trump, and as you and I talked about earlier off camera, you have the tea party movement beginning to explode around 2010 because they couldn't grow up against a Republican president but they could rapidly mobilize against the Democratic president. And so you have a whole new wave of energy, and John Boehner and the House Republicans actually won ten more seats in 2010 than I won in 1994."

      "utterance": "Yes, and Boehner did it with a very straightforward simple campaign, where are the jobs? And it just worked. When they came together, the people looked up and said, that's the right question. So we were back in charge of the House again. And I think people today have no idea how unusual this is. We held the House for two two-year terms between 1930 and 1994, so out of 64 years, we held the House four years. We've now had the House a vast majority of the time since 1994. And along comes Trump, and I agree with you, I tell people I'm not sure he's a conservative but he's the most effective anti- liberal in my lifetime. And whether it's deregulation or conservative judges or cutting taxes or standing up for an American foreign policy based on American values, every time you turn around, he is instinctively saying things which drive the left crazy, and he's doing it, I think, because of this notion of common sense, and the things he learned a long time ago. Again, he's old enough, he remembers the values of the post World War II, highly patriotic America, where people love the flag and they love the idea that we were the greatest nation on earth and they love the values of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. So in a lot of ways, he's carrying forward almost as a grandfather, the values of two generations ago and taking head on the left-wing radical values which the academic world, the news media is and Hollywood have tried to impose on the country."

That sitting there where the buck stops there, seeing these policies, seeing the impact of the policies or potential impact of the left's policies, using his common sense and using his business background and so forth and he's an incredibly intelligent man and he is sitting there and saying no, that's not right.

      "utterance": "I think that's partly true. I think the Donald Trump between 1983 or '84 and as early as the 80s, Oprah Winfrey is asking if he's going to run for president. He was a very young guy at that point. That Donald Trump, I think, was stunningly shallow, and sort of for whatever reform because that's what we're doing, and gradually began to change, and I think that it is watching Obama that drove him to the right, because there is just clearly - in a sense, Bush and the failure to win in Iran and Afghanistan drove him into a harsh critique of American foreign policy. And Obama's entire approach to policy drove Trump to just say \"This is crazy.\" Remember, years ago, I had the opportunity to spend time with the founder of Singapore who had been the great leader who created a remarkably successful country, and I asked him what was the basis of what he did? He said, \"You know, I was a graduate student in Britain during the labor government right after World War II, and every time I would encounter a problem, I'd ask myself, what would Clement Attlee and the socialists do? And I would do the exact opposite. And it worked every time.\" And I think, in a sense, Trump came out of Obama years having been driven to a much more practical businessman, commonsense approach and because he wanted to run as a Republican. He began to acquire allies like Dave Bossie and others who were naturally in the conservative movement. Sean Hannity, it's probably in some ways ironically his closest adviser in that period, and you can't do the \"Hannity\" show once or twice a week and not gradually become a conservative because it just doesn't work. And then I remember, Callista and I were in the meeting here in Washington and his first visit to Washington as a candidate, where we're sitting around and people, to your point, people were kind of going, \"This guy a total opportunist, why would I believe him?\" And somebody in the group came up and said, \"Why don't we put together a list of ten solid conservatives that you would name to the Supreme Court, so that people can realize here's stability, here's a clear commitment. It's a yes or no.\" And Leonard Leo and Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation agreed to take the lead, and Leonard Leo who is the head of the Federalist Society. That's one of the big changes I think because we now have relationships that we didn't have 30 years ago. You couldn't have produced the number of judges for Reagan that they're now producing for Trump."

Two hours later, it's clear that Hillary is going to lose, and if Hillary is going to lose, that means, \"Oh, my God, Donald J. Trump is going to be president.\" So this two hours is the equivalent of psychologically of an IED going off. And they get basically the equivalent of PTSD. I mean, these people are all in a state of shock. They try to recover and this part of Trump's genius. Every morning they wake up and they think this could this be a better day, and then he's already tweeted six times before they get awake, and go, \"Oh, my God, he's still president,\" and go right back into the PTSD. And so what you've had is a collective psychotics experience by the entire left, who would then get together in sort of therapy support groups called fundraisers and cocktail parties and what have you, and they all talk to each other and they get hysterical. And so Max Boot, a good historian wrote at one point he'd rather vote for Joseph Stalin than for Donald Trump. Now, that is an insane comment.

This is a good example what's happening with the Democrats. They nominated a Congresswoman named Sinema who turned out to be a real radical and led anti-war demonstrations in a pink tutu, went on a radio show and said that she thought it was okay for Americans to join the Taliban, and while you can say, well, that was years ago when she was young.

I think first of all, a lot of the current hard left was outlined in a terrific small book called by Matt Bai called \"The Argument.\" Bai is a \"New York Times\" reporter. He wrote it back in 2006-2007 and it really, in retrospect, I read it at time and it sort of indicated Hillary was going to have a hard time, and Obama has a small role in the book. You don't see Obama necessarily emerging, but you clearly see that at least half the party opposed Hillary because they thought her husband had sold out. And Clinton had interestingly exactly the same experience as his counterpart in Great Britain, in that they - they both tried to bring their party to the middle. They were both in the end repudiated by their party because the left-wing of their party was the dominant wing and the wing that has all the energy. And so what's happened is - and then Obama comes along and Obama is a radical. I mean, the one person I know personally who really got this fairly early was Sean. Hannity very early said, \"Look, this guy is exactly out of rules for radicals and exactly represents that kind of radicalism.\" So he kept the left relatively happy because under the happy face, they knew he was really them. Now, I would say 60% of the Democratic Party today is a radical party. Kevin McCarthy had it exactly right when he said, \"This is a now campaign between America and socialism. It's not between Democrats and Republicans.\" And I think this is now the socialist party of the United States, and you look at places like Venezuela which is disintegrating, and you have to ask yourself how can any rational person favor the kind of socialism that every time it's tried is a disaster."

There's a long list of the harassment, of Trump officials and Republican officials in restaurants and so forth, and then last week, the President calls himself a nationalist. I'm not a nationalist, I'm a constitutional conservative, but I know what he meant by that, he meant Americanism. American first. And they insinuate or flat-out say he's Hitler. He is comparing himself to Hitler, and that Trump is too foolish, he doesn't know he's comparing himself to Hitler. Well, actually the new nationalism speech was given by Theodore Roosevelt, a progressive. Part of their ideology or at least it was. And I think, how in the world do you compare this president to Hitler and Stalin and then take from that that he is a racist. He hasn't done anything that suggests that. And so, this is a mantra that they keep pushing, a propaganda that they keep pushing and then I ask myself are they trying to influence the election? Are they just trying to destroy the man?

I think the last study said 92% of the news media was hostile to Trump, of the actual coverage, story by story by story by story. I think if you are openly pro-Trump, in the \"New York Times\" newsroom, they'd fire you or \"The Washington Post.\" They would just fire you. I mean, they say, clearly you understand, you shouldn't be here. I mean, take the example of what Trump was saying about nationalism. Really one of the great magic moments of American history is Benjamin Franklin who goes to England to represent the colony of Pennsylvania, and after seven years realizes that he will never be accepted as an Englishman. That the aristocracy simply will not accept him even though he was a world-famous scientist and a very wealthy man. And people have said he left as a British subject, he came back as an American, and in a way, this thing about being an American starts there. And I think it's important to recognize it, but what Trump is saying, when he uses the word nationalism isn't at a level of a Federalist anti- Federalist arguments, but it's saying look, these guys on the left want to basically sell our country out for some kind of global cause whether it's the Paris Accords or the International Criminal Court or the United Nations. You know, I tell people the reason that John Kerry runs all over the world the way he does and the reason he still sees the Iranians is in Kerry's mind, he was never really the American Secretary of State, he was a world Secretary of State, doing good things on behalf of the world, which is why I don't think you could charge him with the Logan Act because you'd have to be an American in order to be charged him with the Logan Act and Kerry is not psychologically an American, he's psychologically a person of the globe and would regard people who care about America as sort of pygmies, obsolete."

I think the other two are Kavanaugh because I think what happened with Judge Kavanaugh galvanized the right, reminded people how radical the Democrats are, and for the Senate races, it was devastating because it reminded people that this is a team sport. So if you watch Manchin who is a person who is pretty popular in West Virginia, is now behind, and the reason he's behind is people figured out he's going to go back and root for Schumer. Don't tell me you're a conservative if you are going to go back and work for Schumer.

You start losing states like Florida, you can't win. If you lose Texas and Florida, there's no way you can win a presidential election. But these are very, very important states. You have got a governorship race there, Ron deSantis and Andrew Gillum. Ron deSantis, is a war veteran. He is a Harvard graduate, he served a brief time in Congress, but he's shown himself to be a leader. A solid conservative, a Trump supporter. You have Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, it's a corrupt city. The murder rate is through the roof. He pushes taxes through the roof. He was Bernie Sanders' candidate. He has worked for People for the American Way. Norman Leary, he's backed by George Soros and I watched this debate last night, he keeps bringing up race.

What is he saying to us? That it was okay to be corrupt if you're black? Or that it's not corrupt by definition if you're black because it's never corrupt? Then it turns out, he also took a trip to Central America - what are they saying about the FBI guy? And you have to say to yourself so you shouldn't be held accountable for anything you do because you're black? And I think it actually is a disservice to every African-American in the country to have a politician at that level who faced with their own personal corruption hides behind the issue of race because then - on the one level, he's sort of smearing every single person who's African-American, and that's just wrong. This is about him personally."

It has nothing to do with race and I agree. To bring that up is really a disservice to African-Americans but it's a disservice to the people of Florida, too to play that kind of game and the media has largely - the national media, not the local media has let him off the hook. Let's take a look at another race. We have Texas, Ted Cruz seems to be doing much better against Robert Francis O'Rourke. I won't call him Beto. That's his deal. He can call himself Beto all he wants. But O'Rourke, he is another guy who is a hardcore leftist. He was a leftist for a few years representing El Paso in the House of Representatives. He's backed by Hollywood, he's backed by Manhattan, he's backed by the usual leftists, some billionaires and so forth. What do you make of that race?"

You've got Rohrabacher, Hunter, a few of the other seats, you've got Chairman who has retired. I think, tell me if you agree, I think the media will do in this country is the report in such a way quote, unquote \"as to try and get the Democrats out, try and get the Democrat base out,\" because they know if it's close they need those six or seven California seats to put the Democrats over the top.
