Mara, the president met with his cabinet today and was hitting on what he said was the successful sanctions and adding sanctions on Russian oligarchs. Yet there is a real debate about whether Russian oil should be stopped, that U.S. should not be buying Russian oil at all. Where do you think that's going?",

And there is a bipartisan consensus forming in Congress that it should be banned. In other words, the United States shouldn't buy Russian oil. That's actually an easier move for us to make. If we want to put sanctions on Russian oil, that means we have to get all of the allies to go in tandem, just like President Biden has worked with the allies to go in tandem in all of the other restrictions that he has put on Russian finance, central bank, oligarchs, et cetera. So that's harder. And also, there are domestic repercussions to sanctioning Russian oil, maybe even to banning it, although we buy extremely little bits of it.",

The war on fossil fuels has driven gasoline up by a $1.15 from when Donald Trump left office to today per gallon. So he doesn't have any room for Americans to accept more pain on behalf of the Ukrainian people. If gas was at 2.35 a gallon like it was on Trump's last day in office, and it went up to $3.50, then Americans would say, OK, I can live with that for a little while because I see what's happening in Ukraine , and I see the heroism of these people and I want to stand with them in solidarity.

It's going to be sending Russian soldiers back in body bags. It's going to make the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan look mild by comparison. So Xi Jinping has to be looking at this and calling in his generals and saying, why are the Russians doing so badly? What are they doing wrong? Are you prepared for an invasion of Taiwan so we don't repeat these mistakes? How are you going to fix these problems? They are going to go to school on the Russian mistakes.

But I think what's interesting is China is an economic superpower. Russia might soon be an economic basket case. And China is going to have to prop up Russia.

      "utterance": "Yes, look, we are in a multipolar world, and the two totalitarian polls have now joined an alliance against the west and the democratic poll. So there is no doubt that China is looking to see how the west reacts to this, not just how Ukrainian resistance works. And don't forget, occupying a country of 44 million people, each and every one of them hate you with a passion, is pretty hard to do. And that would be the same thing in Taiwan. But I think what's interesting is China is an economic superpower. Russia might soon be an economic basket case. And China is going to have to prop up Russia. It's going to have to buy everything Russia makes, and who knows what else it's going to have to do. But we don't know the full impact of the sanctions yet on Russia."

      "utterance": "I agree. And they are going to be devastating if they continue. After Putin meets with Xi at the Olympics, they released this 5,000-word statement. Among that, in that, \"The new interstate relations between Russia and China are superior to political and military alliances in the Cold War era. Friendship between the two states has no limits. There are no forbidden areas of cooperation, strengthening of bilateral strategic cooperation neither aimed against third countries nor affected by the changing international environment and circumstantial changes in third countries.\" The rest of it is word salad there for people listening in, but there are no limits to the engagement and friendship. Marc, quickly."

      "utterance": "Yes. If they want to create their own little totalitarian trading block they can. American businesses should look at what is happening with Russia and all the sanctions that are being put on, all the businesses who have pulled out, and think we better get out of China fast and decouple from that economy, because we are going to be in big trouble if they invade Taiwan."
