      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon announced he was resigning the presidency. That was almost 45 years ago. The Nixon administration ended that day. And so did the relevance of anything John Dean has to say. Dean, you'll remember, if you are old, was Nixon's White House counsel during Watergate. He helped orchestrate the payoffs and the cover up that brought down his boss. Dean was incarcerated for that, he was convicted and then incarcerated. And that's pretty much all you need to know about John Dean. He is the living answer to a trivia question. That is until this week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yesterday, House Democrats brought Dean to Congress to testify up on Capitol Hill, not about Richard Nixon, but about the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation? Baffling. John Dean is 80 years old. He has nothing to do with Robert Mueller or his investigation. Dean hasn't worked in any of the last eight presidential administrations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When John Dean last held a politically relevant job, Francisco Franco ran Spain. It was a long time ago. So why was dean on Capitol Hill? Well, simple. He works for Jeff Zucker now as a CNN contributor, and Democrats wanted to hear him talk like this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon announced he was resigning the presidency. That was almost 45 years ago. The Nixon administration ended that day. And so did the relevance of anything John Dean has to say. Dean, you'll remember, if you are old, was Nixon's White House counsel during Watergate. He helped orchestrate the payoffs and the cover up that brought down his boss. Dean was incarcerated for that, he was convicted and then incarcerated. And that's pretty much all you need to know about John Dean. He is the living answer to a trivia question. That is until this week. Yesterday, House Democrats brought Dean to Congress to testify up on Capitol Hill, not about Richard Nixon, but about the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation? Baffling. John Dean is 80 years old. He has nothing to do with Robert Mueller or his investigation. Dean hasn't worked in any of the last eight presidential administrations. When John Dean last held a politically relevant job, Francisco Franco ran Spain. It was a long time ago. So why was dean on Capitol Hill? Well, simple. He works for Jeff Zucker now as a CNN contributor, and Democrats wanted to hear him talk like this."

People who have no idea what they're talking about, but feel very strongly about it? The entire hearing went like this. And Dean wasn't even the only cable news analyst there. Democrats invited a lot of them. They tried out a fake expert, for example, called Barbara McQuade. McQuade is an MSNBC legal analyst who was once a U.S. Attorney before Donald Trump fired her. Since then, she has been on call to reassure jittery MSNBC viewers that the 2016 election wasn't actually real. And in any case, big orange will be gone very soon."

      "utterance": "It went on like this all day long, in case you missed it, there was no real discussion of Robert Mueller's findings; instead, for a few hours C-SPAN looked like a CNN panel as people in makeup thundered for impeachment. But in fact, the whole show was an indication of how weak pro-impeachment forces really are. Despite all the investigations and all the ranting you see on cable news, House Democrats still don't have the votes to impeach Donald Trump. The talking heads showed up yesterday to rally the base and to prod numbers of Democrats toward an impeachment trial. Did it work? Not clear? Probably not. But there was another reason for the hearing, too, and we shouldn't overlook it. While Democrats continue to burrow through the Mueller report trying to twist its ho-hum findings into high crimes and misdemeanors, the Attorney General, William Barr is digging deeper into the spying, the DOJ spying before and after the 2016 election, where you know, the FBI surveilled Donald Trump's campaign. Now we're finding out how extensive that spying was and how flimsy the justification for it. Democrats know that Barr's findings could be horrifying, embarrassing, maybe even devastating. They could help President Trump get reelected. So if you're on the left right now, it's a good idea to muddy the waters. If it takes calling John Dean out of retirement, well worth it. Fox senior political analyst, Brit Hume covered John Dean the first time around, and he joins us tonight to assess Dean this time. Brit, great to see you."

    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Otherwise, not that big a story but big enough to knock Dean off the air, which gives you an idea of the news value of it. John Dean is, as you pointed out, a convicted felon who did time for obstruction of justice. He was -- you know, he was he wasn't really a Watergate coconspirator, he was a mastermind. And before he was a Watergate cover-up mastermind, he was also the mastermind of a coverup of the ITT Dita Beard scandal which preceded Watergate, a story, which I did a lot of work on. And in the course of doing that, the FBI found that this particular memo that set off the whole scandal was authentic, they had to get to the FBI to change the letter asserting its authenticity. That is the sort of chap John Dean was and best we can tell, that's the sort of chap he is, that would be the star witness in a House hearing about Donald Trump is quite remarkable. Remember, we earlier had a House hearing in which Michael Cohen was the star witness. So I suppose we shouldn't be terribly surprised."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, of course it is. And, you know, it is a little surprising to me that our colleagues over at CNN had made him a contributor and having him on the air all the time. I mean, I suspect that you know, I'm old enough to have been around during John Dean's heyday as President Nixon's White House counsel and cover-up planner. But it seems to me that a lot of people over at CNN perhaps weren't. But this is not a guy even though you know, he was able to reduce his sentence, I suppose by testifying against his boss, who anybody at the time really would have considered a good guy and least of all, an expert on ethics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, saying things that are worse than Watergate is something that John Dean has been doing for some time. He said that about George W. Bush. He did. It's what he does. And you know, he's -- I guess, he has gotten himself on television doing that. But it doesn't really add up to much of a reason to take him very seriously. And then, thanks to the helicopter crash, Americans were spared the experience."

      "utterance": "It's interesting. The impeachment conversation, clearly yesterday's -- the theatrics were designed in order to spur Democrats towards supporting impeachment, I don't know if it was effective in doing that or not. But we've been, for two months, since the release of the Mueller report have been talking about whether or not there is going to be a move toward impeachment, and it's not clear that Democrats have the votes even now, why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they don't have the votes because the crime that everybody suspected that Donald Trump might be guilty of, the Mueller report pretty authoritatively knocked down, that is to say that he was, you know, complicit with the Russians in trying to throw the election in his own favor. The Mueller report simply did not find that. And that, of course raises questions about what would have been the motivation for him to obstruct the investigation, since it was an investigation into something that he evidently did not do. I think the reason to bring John Dean up there, was perhaps an effort to try to recapture the drama of his Watergate testimony and make no mistake about it, Tucker, it was quite dramatic, and he was a quite effective witness."

He was a meticulous witness. He was a prepared witness. And, he was effective against Nixon. So I suspect that they were seeking to recreate some of those atmospherics, but, you know, given his record and given all that's gone before, it clearly was not going to happen and it didn't."

And John Dean has made a career of comparing everybody to Richard Nixon, and everybody is worse than Richard Nixon, according to him. And yes, here, they come back with a CNN paid contributor, trying to lay out an argument that actually fell flat. I think the biggest thing, Tucker is this, you know, there was that movie \"Groundhog Day,\" where Bill Murray, this is a \"Groundhog Day\" kind of hearing. They can't get it right. So they keep coming back over and over and over again, trying to convince the American people that the President is guilty when indeed the evidence suggests otherwise."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, it's very odd and interestingly, one of those witnesses yesterday, tweeted out in 2017, that the Steele dossier was a credible document that FISA Court obviously thought it was credible. Now you and I both know that not only do we know that it's not credible, and not only do the American people know that the dossier and Christopher Steele was not credible, but the FBI knew that before the very first FISA warrant, and so yet, they're going to try to convince the American people with theatrics instead of the facts. And the fact that he said he was not a fact witness, there is not a truer statement that's been uttered on Capitol Hill than that statement by John Dean yesterday."

    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "You know, obviously I don't think they impeach mainly because if they've looked at the same polls that we've looked at, the vast majority of Americans believe that everybody was waiting for the Mueller report to say was there collusion? When there was none, unaffiliated voters, Republican voters all believed that impeachment would be divisive. And certainly, you can even make the case that if they impeach that it actually helps the President of the United States. Now, I think it's sort of divisive, that we shouldn't do it. But in the end, I think that they're going to try to do death by a thousand cuts, and have hearing after hearing after hearing and try to inflict as much partisan damage as they possibly can."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",

You've been talking about it night in and night out here at the eight o'clock hour. You've been talking about the fact that there's other information that's coming and I'm telling you, Attorney General Bill Barr, John Durham, they're there on this case, and what we will find is this whole conspiracy case, and actually the whole case against the President and obstruction will start to fall apart as we look at transparency and make sure that the American people can judge for themselves, and that's what they're afraid of. So they are going to try to inflict as much damage as they can right now because there are better days ahead for the President of the United States as it relates to this particular investigation."

Because when you get everything free, then you make a party of out of it. So sometimes some people may not be capable of drinking and eating as much and that's why you have incidents with heart attacks and things like that. But it's not a problem of the minibar. President Medina is a very responsible man, and I'm sure he is involved personally supervising and making sure that all this comes to an end and he gets a clear picture of why that happened."

We currently implement beverage protocols, including purchasing sealed and unopened products from licensed and reputable vendors, as well as daily inspections of all products served throughout the hotel bars and in-room liquor dispensers.\" So at least the Hard Rock, they're responding to our investigation. But you know, it is going to be the final toxicology pathology reports of the last four individuals that have died here -- the Americans that have died here. I can also add to this, the hotel resort behind me, Tucker here, the Bahia Principe, this is where that Maryland couple Edward Holmes and Cynthia Day were unresponsive, didn't check out on time. They were found dead in their room on May 30th. Their attorney telling me about 30 minutes ago, they just got the bodies back today to Maryland.

That the democracy is under threat? I understand that he thinks Donald Trump is a bad President, and he can campaign on that. But actually, if we're worried about norms and the Constitution and the institutions, actually go issue by issue, and they have held up pretty well. I would say this though, Joe Biden isn't the only one acting like this is a general election contest between Biden and Trump. President Trump is actually doing the same, elevating Joe Biden. And this is coming at a time just when other contenders on the left are starting to take little bites at Joe Biden. And if I were President Trump, I would be so in that chaos, and let them feel comfortable going after Biden. There's plenty to try. Right? There's the Hyde Amendment, the flip-flop on abortion. There's China that happened today. There's the Iraq War, the crime bill, like, it's kind of a never ending thing. I do wonder about going after Biden so aggressively, and then getting liberals to start to coalesce behind Biden, because he has been attacked by President Trump this early."

You don't say, you don't have them and like call out the President and say, make sure to watch Tucker because he is going to eviscerate someone tonight. What happens is you do your monologue, and if people think that was an evisceration, then that's the kind of buzz that it gets. But you don't like pregame an evisceration. Don't ever do that. A little tip from the Press Secretary."

So if Bill de Blasio is actually more disliked than Donald Trump that is really saying something because people can see it with their own eyes. They see what's happening to the city, they get it.

For example, all of them hate borders, at least America's borders and want them to go away. But what do Democrats actually agree on? What do they like most? And the answer it turns out is abortion. Democrats previously said they wanted abortion to be safe, legal and rare. You remember that? They don't say that anymore. Modern Democrats want abortion to be late, common and subsidized by taxpayers. It's not even that the left denies that abortion is killing. Honest liberals admit it is in fact killing.

Well, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has very strong feelings about that. She has an answer. If you disagree that abortion should be legal up until the moment of birth, not restricted in any way and paid for by tax dollars, you're not simply wrong, you're evil, you're on par with racist maybe even the Nazis.

Killing them is fine. Lila Rose is the founder of the pro-life group Live Action, and she joins us tonight. Lila, thanks very much for coming. Before I asked you about Senator Gillibrand, there was a report tonight that your organization was in effect censored by Pinterest, the tech company and put in the same category as porn.

There's been an insider from the popular website Pinterest, which a lot of women love to use, you pin pictures of babies, wedding decor, and pro-life pins, Bible verses, whatever you want. Live Action has been totally banned. And it's because they say we were originally a porn website, which we're not obviously, we're a pro-life organization. And now it's -- now they're saying it's because we dwell in conspiracy theories, and we're harmful to public health. At the same time, abortion clinics are on Pinterest, the same website, and they're running ads to promote selling abortions online. So it's absolutely insanity coming from this big company in San Francisco that's censoring the pro-life message."

And yet, this insider has now been fired after he broke the news this morning. And Live Action has been now totally banned from the website.

But her comments, unfortunately, are held -- this idea that it's not even justified to have the pro-life position, you're a racist. I mean, that term is just thrown around today. But saying that you're even a racist to be pro-life. Half of America is pro-life. And why are we pro-life? Because we believe in human rights. I mean, she invoked human rights. Well, we believe in the right to life for every human being in the womb and outside of the womb. It's our first human right. It's in the Declaration of Independence, and her position of abortion through all nine months for any reason, it's held by all the Democratic candidates for President, every single one of them, Tucker, want abortion through all nine months. That's their position. It is out of touch with the vast majority of Americans, including most Democrats, they don't want abortion on demand for any reason.

No other country on Earth has 12 million illegal immigrants and gives birthright citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. So if you look at Canada, you look at Australia, they have a merit-based immigration system that gives priority to those with college degrees, English speaking skills and job skills that can contribute to their economy.

So for ordinary people life will get a little worse and a little less convenient, and make no mistake, when activists are done harassing the people of Canada, they'll try to import the same laws here. Tammy Bruce is a radio host and President of Independent Women's Voice. She joins us tonight. Tammy, thanks for coming on. I since it theme here. Politicians on the left, they announced some new initiative. I can't remember the last time one of their ideas make life better for voters."

      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Not even neutral. Right? They make things worse, you'd hope for some ambivalence, right? But yes, the theme is that we live in dumb times, because the liberals control so much. But Justin Trudeau -- it's interesting. He must know, he seems to be a man of the world that 90 percent of the plastic in the world's oceans come from 10 rivers. This is according to the World Economic Forum, eight of which are in Asia, two of those rivers are in Africa. It's from no rivers in Canada is this issue. So this is the problem with like a national narcissism, this belief that we're responsible for everything that's happening. The fact of the matter is, Canada isn't and neither are we. And yet it placates people when you're telling them, if you don't get your plastic fork, you're saving the whales. He opened his speech, Tucker, by saying, \"What do I tell my children?\" And it's a horrible thing. We all love to see animals. When a whale is found dead and there's plastic and its stomach, if they want if the Canadians which, you know, that's not -- this is China, what you would do is go talk to China about these issues, and tell China to stop using plastic bags and straws, but they're not. But the Canadians could actually stop killing hundreds of thousands of baby seals every year, but they don't want to do that. And yet, that could be a serious conversation that the Canadians could make a difference on. So this is classic. And it's national narcissism. We all want to solve the problem. And I'm against this because it gives the false impression that we're doing something about the issue when the issue is China primarily."

If you really care about the environment, maybe it would rein in the nickel mines or whatever, but they're not. It does seem like this is a very specific audience he is aiming at, the kind of affluent, well-educated group who thinks everything is about them and want policies to make them feel virtuous."

      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Right, exactly. That's something you can do in your in your day to day life without being too bothered, necessarily, but you're sacrificing that the struggle is real Tucker, and they're sacrificing because what are you going to do about that straw that you can't quite wash in the sink -- you're sacrificing in that regard. This is the absurdity of what we think it is we're doing. There are real things we can do. And even like there's a store that was trying to get people to not want plastic bags in Canada, so it was putting really ridiculous logos on them like the Colonoscopy Coop. And you'd have to carry that around your town. And he thought people wouldn't like that. The Canadians loved it, because it was like so unique and like limited editions. And they wanted to collect all of the stupid plastic bags. So look, this is -- you know, Canadians, Americans, the Western world, you know, we're entrepreneurs, we have enough information to know how to make a difference. This is a distraction. And it's shameful, and it's what the left does, and it's why things get worse with all of their policies, because they never make a real difference in addressing a real issue."
