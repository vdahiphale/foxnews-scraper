Coming up tonight, we're going to show you how two individuals are literally standing up to Mueller's coercion and what we call test the lie tactics. And we'll expose a fake story accusing Paul Manafort of having secret meetings with Julian Assange. Nothing more than a conspiracy theory and literally peak Russia collusion hysteria at its worse.

And we're going to bring you the very latest from the crisis at our southern border. Tonight, we will expose some of the almost unbelievable hypocrisy from America's left and your mainstream media. Senator Lindsey Graham is here to weigh in on that.

      "sentences": "All right. Tonight, it appears another so-called Russian bombshell has fallen completely flat. The Guardian today reported without any evidence, vague sourcing, that former Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange met multiple between 2013 and 2016 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, tonight, Paul Manafort is strongly denying all of that, firing back in a powerful statement that reads, quote: This story is totally false, deliberately libelous. I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him. I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter. Now, Manafort is also vowing to pursue all legal options against that paper. And WikiLeaks, by the way, they are even going further tonight.  They tweeted, quote, willing to bet The Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange. Assange, too, rightly so, moving ahead on possible legal action, in addition to being absolutely rebuffed by both parties involved. What's fascinating is The Guardian's story filled with serious flaws.  And, by the way, no evidence of any meetings, vaguely described sources, and none on the record. Remember, the Ecuadorian embassy in London is one of the most surveilled and secured buildings in the world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I know. I went there. I interviewed Julian Assange in January of 2017.  Visitors are monitored. They are photographed, videotaped by multiple governments. And now, The Guardian is being accused of quietly stealth editing the story. The paper actually altered their own headlines, adding words, sources say. They didn't have that in beginning and they softened key elements of the language just hours after receiving all the backlash. And while the fake news media jumps on anything, everything Russia, except Hillary's phony dossier, regardless of any actual evidence, President Trump is not backing down. And today, he had sharp words for Robert Mueller. He tweeted, quote: The phony witch hunt continues but Mueller and his gang of angry Democrats are only looking at one side, not the other. Wait until it comes out how horribly and viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie. Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue. And then Trump continued, quote: And the fake news media builds Bob Mueller up as a saint when in actuality, he is the exact opposite. He is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system where he is only looking at one side, not the other. Heroes will come of this, and it won't be Mueller and his terrible gang of angry Democrats. Look at their past, look where they come from. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And look at this, $30 million, the witch hunt continues. They've got nothing but ruined lives. Where is the server? Meaning Hillary's server.  Let these terrible people go back to the Clinton Foundation and the Justice Department. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Still, President Trump is letting the process play out. He told The Washington Post tonight he has no intention of stopping the investigation. But the president's concerns are being echoed by legal scholars like Alan Dershowitz, who warned today about what Mueller's true motives really are.  Let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Our own Gregg Jarrett has explained what we're witnessing now is the classic Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, pit bull tactics, using threats, coercion, to get people to what we call test the lie. In other words, tell us what we want to hear. And guess what? We're going to go easy on you. And, by the way, if you don't tell us what we want to hear, well, you might spend the rest of your life in jail. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But look what's happening. This is fascinating. Paul Manafort and Jerome Corsi, they are now taking a stand. They're refusing to cooperate and go along with the test the lie scheme. They're not willing to tell a story that they want told. Even both of them, elderly men, risking life in prison. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they could say exactly what these rogue prosecutors want to save themselves. But, clearly, their conscious refuses to allow them to lie.  CNN reporting that Robert Mueller has his hands on 2016 e-mail communications between Corsi and Roger Stone, supposedly showing some attempt from Stone to seek information from WikiLeaks. We'll see how this plays out as Mueller continues to turn the screws on both Corsi and Stone. One thing as I have read it, it doesn't show that they knew anything was stolen in any way by anybody. Anyone ever hear of the Pentagon papers?  Just a thought. Remember, it is now day 559 of Mueller's \"destroy Trump\" witch hunt. Zero evidence, zero, of Trump/Russia collusion. We got, oh, lying to the FBI, lying to prosecutors, lying on loan applications, didn't pay your taxes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Where is the collusion? Why not go after Hillary? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What we are seeing is a two-tiered justice system? Hillary Clinton paid for phony Russian lies that were fed to you, the American people, to influence the 2016 election and no legal consequences? President Trump, everyone associated with him, they turn the screws ever so tight, Mueller and his merry band of partisan investigators with a horrific track record. It's a travesty of justice. It is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal we've had. Never mind Hillary Clinton from the get-go got exonerated, no real investigation. They were writing her exoneration in May and they didn't interview her and 17 other people until July. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She committed obvious and clear felonies including obstruction when she deleted, and she acid washed and then busted up devices. But America's left and their friends in the mainstream media, they can't get enough. But they never talk about the dual justice system, the Hillary system and then the system for the rest of us, completely obsessed with a phony Trump- Russia collusion theory. And meanwhile, the destroy Trump press is all but ignoring the major scandal surrounding what might be the world's sketchiest, so-called charity. The Clinton Foundation back in the news. Federal investigation is now currently under way into Bill and Hillary's prized so-called nonprofit organization. FBI agents who are seeking to determine whether or not the Clintons employed an elicit play-to-pay scheme for years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, during Hillary's tenure as then-senator and then-secretary of state and during her two runs for the presidency, that foundation raked in tens and tens of millions of dollars. Many of the largest donations coming from foreign governments. We're talking about millions of dollars from Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, Ireland. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And remember, Hillary Clinton's, you know, claim to be the champion of women during the 2017 campaign, her foundation took in tens and tens of millions of dollars from countries with the most despicable, disgusting, horrific human rights records, Middle Eastern countries practicing Sharia, treating women like second and third-class citizens and worse. And the Clinton Foundation taking between $10 million and $25 million from Saudi Arabia -- forbids women from traveling without a male guardian's permission, persecutes Christians and Jews and literally gives the death penalty to gays and lesbians. What did they do? They took millions from these countries and they bought the Clinton silence and they took more from Kuwait and Qatar, Brunei and Oman and UAE, Algeria. They bought her silence. She never criticized those atrocious human rights records like we have regularly on this show. And in 2016, alone, the foundation took in a whopping -- get this -- the year she is running, $62 million. In 2017, after Clinton's devastating loss to Donald Trump, her foundation only received $26 million in donations. Oh, that's a huge, massive drop, and that's because after it became clear that Hillary Clinton would never be president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So what were all those big donors hoping to gain from their enormous deposits into the Clinton Foundation? Looks to me like that's called access, pay to play, paid access at the highest levels of our federal government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Imagine for a second Donald Trump ever did this. You are buying access that no other law-abide be citizen would ever dream of. Do you think they get invitations to the White House? Do you think they get access to the president if she had won? Access to the Senate seat when she had that, the State Department when she was secretary of state? If everything went according to plan, access to the Oval Office? Of course, everything didn't go according to plan and Hillary Clinton lost because you, we, the people -- well, Donald Trump became president in spite of all the deep state's effort to prevent that from happening. Now, they are delegitimizing and, frankly, we will see in the next two years nothing but an all-out effort and assault to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump. And now, we have the opportunity to uncover what looks like a completely corrupt pay to play scheme that should have no place in this constitutional republic of ours. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the mainstream media, they choose to ignore this developing scandal.  Of course, they are all things Democratic. They are an extension of the Democratic Party. They are too busy covering Stormy, Stormy, and shh-hole, shh-hole, et cetera. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They don't want to cover the crisis at the southern border, at least not in a fair and honest way. Now, thousands of migrants have arrived south of San Diego. The biased press can no longer ignore the serious situation or pretend it is some grand conspiracy theory cooked up by the GOP to get votes in the midterms. Instead, the media's echo chamber is spinning out of control over the use of non-lethal tear gas. Why? To disperse a massive group of migrants that attempted to break all of our laws, rush the border and many assaulting our own border patrol with rocks and bottles and other projectiles. And we have it on tape. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This has been two years and ongoing, many on the left try to paint the Trump administration as monsters. The statistics, the truth, history tells a much different story. In fact, 100,000 asylum claims were processed last year under the Trump administration. By the way, that happens to be a record-setting amount.  That's up 6,000 from Obama's final year in office. Under the Trump immigration application, into the United States they have surged, probably because of the better economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Unfortunately, this causes serious back logs and we now are currently at 786,000 pending immigration cases. Now, keep in mind, the U.S. has received 160,000 asylum cases this year, compared to just 42,000 in 2008.  A good economy, again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As of September, there were 42,000 likely illegal immigrants held in ICE detention facilities despite only enough funding and capacity for 40,000 people. Now, the president has requested more funding for ICE. But as we know and as we can see, America's immigration resources are stretched extremely thin. They are operating at maximum capacity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This makes the situation at our southern border even more serious and more dangerous for those people that put their lives on the line to protect our country, or sovereignty, our borders, our rule of law. None of this seems to matter to the left. The president is working hard to improve the lives of our American people, and our immigration system, strengthen our borders, ask people to respect our laws. And the left is working overtime to destroy the reputation of the Trump administration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No conspiracy is too absurd for them, no lie too egregious, no rhetoric too disgusting.

Two years, never-ending nonstop attacks, nonstop investigation. What are they going to do for you, we, the people, to improve the economy and our security, to bring us to energy independence?

I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter. Now, Manafort is also vowing to pursue all legal options against that paper. And WikiLeaks, by the way, they are even going further tonight.  They tweeted, quote, willing to bet The Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange. Assange, too, rightly so, moving ahead on possible legal action, in addition to being absolutely rebuffed by both parties involved. What's fascinating is The Guardian's story filled with serious flaws.  And, by the way, no evidence of any meetings, vaguely described sources, and none on the record. Remember, the Ecuadorian embassy in London is one of the most surveilled and secured buildings in the world. I know. I went there. I interviewed Julian Assange in January of 2017.  Visitors are monitored. They are photographed, videotaped by multiple governments. And now, The Guardian is being accused of quietly stealth editing the story. The paper actually altered their own headlines, adding words, sources say. They didn't have that in beginning and they softened key elements of the language just hours after receiving all the backlash."

Still, President Trump is letting the process play out. He told The Washington Post tonight he has no intention of stopping the investigation.

Our own Gregg Jarrett has explained what we're witnessing now is the classic Mueller, Andrew Weissmann, pit bull tactics, using threats, coercion, to get people to what we call test the lie. In other words, tell us what we want to hear. And guess what? We're going to go easy on you. And, by the way, if you don't tell us what we want to hear, well, you might spend the rest of your life in jail. But look what's happening. This is fascinating. Paul Manafort and Jerome Corsi, they are now taking a stand. They're refusing to cooperate and go along with the test the lie scheme. They're not willing to tell a story that they want told. Even both of them, elderly men, risking life in prison. And they could say exactly what these rogue prosecutors want to save themselves. But, clearly, their conscious refuses to allow them to lie.  CNN reporting that Robert Mueller has his hands on 2016 e-mail communications between Corsi and Roger Stone, supposedly showing some attempt from Stone to seek information from WikiLeaks. We'll see how this plays out as Mueller continues to turn the screws on both Corsi and Stone. One thing as I have read it, it doesn't show that they knew anything was stolen in any way by anybody. Anyone ever hear of the Pentagon papers?  Just a thought. Remember, it is now day 559 of Mueller's \"destroy Trump\" witch hunt. Zero evidence, zero, of Trump/Russia collusion. We got, oh, lying to the FBI, lying to prosecutors, lying on loan applications, didn't pay your taxes. Where is the collusion? Why not go after Hillary? What we are seeing is a two-tiered justice system? Hillary Clinton paid for phony Russian lies that were fed to you, the American people, to influence the 2016 election and no legal consequences? President Trump, everyone associated with him, they turn the screws ever so tight, Mueller and his merry band of partisan investigators with a horrific track record. It's a travesty of justice. It is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal we've had. Never mind Hillary Clinton from the get-go got exonerated, no real investigation. They were writing her exoneration in May and they didn't interview her and 17 other people until July. She committed obvious and clear felonies including obstruction when she deleted, and she acid washed and then busted up devices. But America's left and their friends in the mainstream media, they can't get enough. But they never talk about the dual justice system, the Hillary system and then the system for the rest of us, completely obsessed with a phony Trump- Russia collusion theory. And meanwhile, the destroy Trump press is all but ignoring the major scandal surrounding what might be the world's sketchiest, so-called charity. The Clinton Foundation back in the news. Federal investigation is now currently under way into Bill and Hillary's prized so-called nonprofit organization. FBI agents who are seeking to determine whether or not the Clintons employed an elicit play-to-pay scheme for years. Remember, during Hillary's tenure as then-senator and then-secretary of state and during her two runs for the presidency, that foundation raked in tens and tens of millions of dollars. Many of the largest donations coming from foreign governments. We're talking about millions of dollars from Australia, Norway, the Netherlands, Ireland. And remember, Hillary Clinton's, you know, claim to be the champion of women during the 2017 campaign, her foundation took in tens and tens of millions of dollars from countries with the most despicable, disgusting, horrific human rights records, Middle Eastern countries practicing Sharia, treating women like second and third-class citizens and worse. And the Clinton Foundation taking between $10 million and $25 million from Saudi Arabia -- forbids women from traveling without a male guardian's permission, persecutes Christians and Jews and literally gives the death penalty to gays and lesbians. What did they do? They took millions from these countries and they bought the Clinton silence and they took more from Kuwait and Qatar, Brunei and Oman and UAE, Algeria. They bought her silence. She never criticized those atrocious human rights records like we have regularly on this show. And in 2016, alone, the foundation took in a whopping -- get this -- the year she is running, $62 million. In 2017, after Clinton's devastating loss to Donald Trump, her foundation only received $26 million in donations. Oh, that's a huge, massive drop, and that's because after it became clear that Hillary Clinton would never be president. So what were all those big donors hoping to gain from their enormous deposits into the Clinton Foundation? Looks to me like that's called access, pay to play, paid access at the highest levels of our federal government. Imagine for a second Donald Trump ever did this. You are buying access that no other law-abide be citizen would ever dream of. Do you think they get invitations to the White House? Do you think they get access to the president if she had won? Access to the Senate seat when she had that, the State Department when she was secretary of state? If everything went according to plan, access to the Oval Office? Of course, everything didn't go according to plan and Hillary Clinton lost because you, we, the people -- well, Donald Trump became president in spite of all the deep state's effort to prevent that from happening. Now, they are delegitimizing and, frankly, we will see in the next two years nothing but an all-out effort and assault to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump. And now, we have the opportunity to uncover what looks like a completely corrupt pay to play scheme that should have no place in this constitutional republic of ours. And the mainstream media, they choose to ignore this developing scandal.  Of course, they are all things Democratic. They are an extension of the Democratic Party. They are too busy covering Stormy, Stormy, and shh-hole, shh-hole, et cetera. They don't want to cover the crisis at the southern border, at least not in a fair and honest way. Now, thousands of migrants have arrived south of San Diego. The biased press can no longer ignore the serious situation or pretend it is some grand conspiracy theory cooked up by the GOP to get votes in the midterms. Instead, the media's echo chamber is spinning out of control over the use of non-lethal tear gas. Why? To disperse a massive group of migrants that attempted to break all of our laws, rush the border and many assaulting our own border patrol with rocks and bottles and other projectiles. And we have it on tape. Take a look."

      "utterance": "And as you can see, your mainstream media doing anything, everything to vilify President Trump and his administration over the crisis at our southern border. However, as per usual, they have completely failed to tell the whole truth.  Look at the study tonight from NewsBusters. Last night, networks totally ignored the use of tear gas during the Obama administration. Do you remember this kind of hysteria? A report from \"The Washington Times\" shows that, oh, tear gas was used about once a month during Barack Obama's time in offense in order to repel migrants at the border. Once a month. Think about that. Isn't that all you need to really know about the bias of the media in this country? There was no monthly outrage over the actions of the Obama administration, no grandstanding, no dramatic pleas for civility, no talk about women and children. This shows without any shadow of a doubt, the destroy Trump press, and that's who they are, are willing to do and say anything and everything to damage the administration. This has been two years and ongoing, many on the left try to paint the Trump administration as monsters. The statistics, the truth, history tells a much different story. In fact, 100,000 asylum claims were processed last year under the Trump administration. By the way, that happens to be a record-setting amount.  That's up 6,000 from Obama's final year in office. Under the Trump immigration application, into the United States they have surged, probably because of the better economy. Unfortunately, this causes serious back logs and we now are currently at 786,000 pending immigration cases. Now, keep in mind, the U.S. has received 160,000 asylum cases this year, compared to just 42,000 in 2008.  A good economy, again. As of September, there were 42,000 likely illegal immigrants held in ICE detention facilities despite only enough funding and capacity for 40,000 people. Now, the president has requested more funding for ICE. But as we know and as we can see, America's immigration resources are stretched extremely thin. They are operating at maximum capacity. This makes the situation at our southern border even more serious and more dangerous for those people that put their lives on the line to protect our country, or sovereignty, our borders, our rule of law. None of this seems to matter to the left. The president is working hard to improve the lives of our American people, and our immigration system, strengthen our borders, ask people to respect our laws. And the left is working overtime to destroy the reputation of the Trump administration. No conspiracy is too absurd for them, no lie too egregious, no rhetoric too disgusting. And when Democrats take control of the House, in a few short weeks, I digress here a second, when they do, oh, we have great things planned. It's only going to get worse, mark my words. Two years, never-ending nonstop attacks, nonstop investigation. What are they going to do for you, we, the people, to improve the economy and our security, to bring us to energy independence?

The question for the country is, what do you say to the people who shot the canisters? I stand behind the men and women on the border standing between us and people that want to cross illegally. When you are slamming the tear gas, you are slamming the people we put on the border to protect us.  That's what disgusts me the most."

The bottom line is Donald Trump was right to call the caravan out weeks ago. He is right to make sure it never crosses the border. People throughout the world are watching the president. If he blinks here, his credibility on securing the border is dead. He is not going to blink. To my Democratic friends, how go you expect the public to work with us to fix a broken immigration system if you support one wave after another? A lot is at stake here.

We now have literally and we'll talk to Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of homeland security, we have identified -- Mexico, too, has identified at least 500, maybe 600 criminals coming across that border that have integrated themselves into the migrant population. And that means -- when I sat through a briefing with Rick Perry in Texas when he was governor, a security briefing that Obama should have been at, when I sat through it, they had a seven-year period of time, 642,000 crimes committed against Texans. Some minor, many serious, including murder. I have interviewed angel moms and dads more than I ever wanted to in my whole life, lost their lives to illegal immigrants that were -- that we even had in our justice system and never deported.

Democrats should give him the money he needs to secure the border. If they deny him the funding to secure our border, President Trump is going to push back and fight back. This is a day of reckoning for the American people. What message do you want to send to the rest of the world about our border? If you want to be open borders, this is your chance.

And just about everywhere we went on the side of the road, there were these big flashing billboards that said vote again. And now we do know generally how many people got a message to go and cast a ballot for the second time in three weeks. It was 30 percent to 40 percent of registered voters in Mississippi according to state officials who are saying it started out slow and steady but it really picked up towards the end of the day. Right now, the Democrat, not far from here, the Democrat Mike Espy, is having his election night event at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. We understand he is on site watching returns that could make him the first African-American senator elected in Mississippi since Reconstruction. Cindy Hyde-Smith meanwhile trying to make history of herself as the first- ever woman elected to the Senate from Mississippi. And she is waiting to see if voters who said they were offended by a joke that she made about a public hanging voted in larger number than people who took it as a joke.  Her supporters did something at the last minute, too. They tried to shine a light on a Clinton era indictment against Mike Espy and last night some of the people introducing the president and Cindy Hyde- Smith came to the stage to say he had to leave, Espy had to leave as Clinton's agriculture secretary because, they said, he was too corrupt for the Clintons.

I hope that the next attorney general, the permanent attorney general, who I hope the president will nominate soon, will take control of this. And one of the first things he should do, the new attorney general, after sworn in, is have a meeting with Mr. Mueller, find out what's going on, where he is going and when he is going to end. That is a duty that the next attorney general has, because this investigation by Mueller is unconstitutional, it is founded on no crime, it is created by Rod Rosenstein because he is a gutless, duplicitous failure of a deputy attorney general.

So, 90 percent of those making asylum claims are not making the claim that can be honored under the statutory framework within the United States, it's not a valid reason for asylum.
