Clapping because it triggers anxiety and discourages people from attending events, and it will be replaced with a silent version of jazz hands which is said to encourage an environment of respect. Meanwhile, totally different story, a Massachusetts professor said that the label \"veteran\" should be expanded to include peace activists. I say the label \"professor\" should be expanded to include messy droolers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The one thing these things have in common besides lunacy is that they've both broken out of the asylum gates of a local university. The seed pods from the garden of stupid are now blooming in the real world. Why is that? Because no one wants to say: Man, that's really dumb. We're all bullied to silence now by the tyranny of grievance. Nobody wants to share the risk in calling out absurdity because that makes you a big meanie. Example: You're on a subway and a maniac gets on board, he's a babbling idiot, so everyone, what do they do? They look down at their phones. Why? Because no one wants to assume a piece of the risk, so they hide from the maniac. Then you realized the maniac is Bill de Blasio. Again, he's screaming inanities. Your head aches, he won't shut up. So now the joke's on you: You should have complained the moment de Blasio got on. You should have said shut up and get out of here, you're too loud and stupid for mass transit. Ideological excess spread when everyone looks the other way, whether it's on campus, in Congress, in media. But maybe for once, it's time, let's share the risk. It might be the only defense we have left. So, Jesse, they also said that clapping makes people with autism nervous, and I think that was a strategy to use a real issue to camouflage a silly idea because if clapping makes autistic or any anxious people nervous, it would be harmful to keep them from becoming accustomed to it. Like, what if they want to go to a soccer game, or what if they want to go to a rock concert. They can't because they wouldn't be used to clapping. This is absurd.",

So Megs Yunn, a 33-year-old mom of four, came up with this idea. She calls it Beverly's Birthdays. And since 2012 she's put on parties for more than 30,000 children in Pittsburgh, allowing them to feel like they matter for a few hours and forget the stress of living in poverty. By the way, an estimated 2.5 million homeless kids live in the United States, and for them, Yunn's idea just terrific. It's the gift that keeps on giving, because it's a great example for us all.",

All right, Greg, this -- I guess this is a sworn statement by the ex- boyfriend of Ford, and it's riddled with bombshells here. Never brought up anything about Kavanaugh, never his name, never brought up about being sexually abused. He witnessed her prepping this friend of hers, Monica, for a polygraph exam. She flew on planes all the time. Not afraid of small spaces. And when he caught her cheating, she ended up keeping his credit card and then spending lavishly on it, then lied about it afterwards.

That -- the media is saying that Trumps comments about Ford were a mockery or an attack are the same media who thought Matt Damon's ridicule of Kavanaugh was sparkling and brilliant and daring. And yet, they find that Trump said something yesterday and he called it mockery or an attack when all he did was point out a discrepancy. What Trump did, if that was an attack to you, then you really do live in a bubble because if you go home, or you go to a bar, or you talk to somebody at the gym, what Trump said is exactly the opinions of everybody at home going, some of her stuff has holes in it, that stuff about having one drink but not -- knowing she only had one drink but not remembering everything else. The common sense of his -- what would you call, the rally Trump. The common sense of the rally Trump reflects most of America and he's revealing the contrast of the public and private expression about this case, that so many people publicly will say she's credible and compelling, but then they go home and they go, dude, she's not making sense on a lot of it.

Like your mom said, for me to set the tone. So the president has a tone that does sound like he's going after you. That's like for me, like you know I hate the nicknames. I get it that they worked and that they're very effective. I do, though, wonder about the strategy later on because Flake, Murkowski, Collins, they're sincerely polite, like they would never say this kind of thing. And so now, they're already under a ton of pressure. They're waiting for this FBI reports. The president needs their vote. And I just think, like from a strategy standpoint, do you get the country with you and lose those three votes and then end up winning in 2020 because people are so mad?

He's saying that this is not a criminal trial. This is about Kavanaugh's credibility, his character, judicial temperament of a man who would sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come.

Look, here's the bottom line, the man was accused of being a sexual predator, of being a gang rapist, and, you know, causing women to get drunk, and he's not supposed to lose his cool for even a little bit. The truth is he's been on the circuit court for 12 years. He's got the temperament. And I don't know how many people out there been in courtrooms, but I've spent 30 years in them. Judges flip out all the time, and that is not what I consider flipping out, what Kavanaugh did. But I think the saddest part of all this is that they're standing up and saying it doesn't matter what the truth is. There's enough smell here. Let's get rid of him. But what is this smell? The only smell I get here is about someone who doesn't know the fundamentals about an issue that she kept quiet about. It's about a guy who was accused by three women, and how this guy found three women who would wait 35 years to admit that they were sexually assaulted by him blows my mind. He must be a genius because all of these women now have suffered from repressed memory. And in the end, they're now coming out to attack him. It's all politics, period. End of the story."

There's nothing. There's absolutely nothing. So with that, what you have is people raising questions. Anybody can raise questions, Juan. You can raise questions about everything. But you know what? When you raise questions, you have to find answers. How do you find answers? You get the facts. Senate investigators are looking for the facts. Unfortunately, for Democrats, they don't have any facts. There are no facts on their side right now. And if you look at the context of -- let's just say, the rolling stone rape hoax, how in the context of that can any Democrat say I have absolutely no doubt about what happened with judge Kavanaugh. These things happen all the time. There has to be some doubt there. Look at the Russian collusion situation. What happens if Mueller comes back and says we didn't find any evidence of collusion. What are the Democrats going to do then, Juan? They've convinced themselves for a year and a half there's collusion. And then when there's a fact-finding mission and they have no evidence, what will the Democrats going to do then?

Meanwhile, totally different story, a Massachusetts professor said that the label \"veteran\" should be expanded to include peace activists. I say the label \"professor\" should be expanded to include messy droolers. The one thing these things have in common besides lunacy is that they've both broken out of the asylum gates of a local university. The seed pods from the garden of stupid are now blooming in the real world. Why is that? Because no one wants to say: Man, that's really dumb.

Ideological excess spread when everyone looks the other way, whether it's on campus, in Congress, in media. But maybe for once, it's time, let's share the risk. It might be the only defense we have left. So, Jesse, they also said that clapping makes people with autism nervous, and I think that was a strategy to use a real issue to camouflage a silly idea because if clapping makes autistic or any anxious people nervous, it would be harmful to keep them from becoming accustomed to it.

Because what it comes off as, it comes off as the cool kids exacting peer pressure on everybody else. They're at their cafeteria table saying if you don't agree with me, you're not cool.

This is Lena Dunham. These people are really despised by half of the country. And then the independents, they're not really going to move the needle. This is not like the Million Man March. This is not like the Women's March. This isn't like the Tea Party. These are highly-trained Democratic activists that are taking off work, if they have a job, and they're going to harass public officials. And the only reason we're paying more attention to them is because they're nastier now. The other day someone went into an office of a congressman and assaulted them. And that's barely been reported.

And since 2012 she's put on parties for more than 30,000 children in Pittsburgh, allowing them to feel like they matter for a few hours and forget the stress of living in poverty. By the way, an estimated 2.5 million homeless kids live in the United States, and for them, Yunn's idea just terrific. It's the gift that keeps on giving, because it's a great example for us all."

So the crushing blow, as you can see, sends him to the ground. Then he was unconscious for a few minutes. Now, police say he tried it three times, and all three attempts were obviously unsuccessful, prompting the guy, after he passed out, to get up and leave. So my question is, you know, did they arrest him? Did they indict him? Has he been convicted?"
