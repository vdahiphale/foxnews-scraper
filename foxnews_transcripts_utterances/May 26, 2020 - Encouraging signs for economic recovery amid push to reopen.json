It is good news that the virus is not nearly as deadly as we thought it was when we first saw this, or that hospitals are not overrun like that we thought they were. But I was interested in an article that was in \"Politico\" today about how Democrats say that their nightmare scenario is that the economy might get back up and running before the November election. And I do think there is a political concern here that people don't want to reopen in part because they are worried that a strong economy is one of Donald Trump's best arguments for his reelection and that they don't -- and they think that hurting the economy might help Democratic prospects.

AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": So the economy has been the centerpiece question from the very beginning, long before this pandemic. The question was, why is an economy that's doing so well not benefiting the president politically? We saw at one point he had approval ratings on the economy close to 60 percent. And yet when you looked at it the overall approval ratings, they were still mired in the 40s, and matched up against Joe Biden he was still losing. So the challenge for the president has long been that the economy in and of itself isn't really the issue in this election. A lot of what this election is going to hinge on, that we are in the middle of a crisis, so let's just put into perspective. We may be in another health crisis by the time October or November comes around, we may not be. We will certainly be in an economic crisis regardless. Even if the economy does come back pretty well, there are going to be a lot of people still hurting economically. But the real question in my mind has long been, how are voters squaring their perception of the president and how he serves as president, the behavior, the way he conducts himself, versus what he's doing on the economy per se? It is true, most residents who are running in a bad economy tend not to get reelected. But this is not a typical type of recession, and this president has not seen, unlike other presidents, a big bump when things are good.",

GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__TOWNHALL.COM&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=MxlMONYL8G8bt_qfz87PeV0Fb8wpGWWihdy-mVdZFtM&s=7-6QwMZFPizAmCrdAYUyfEAqVjA3KavrWQB9Gq7m2mM&e= : And I feel like if the Democrats are put in the position where they appear to be rooting against the recovery or a strong recovery for political reasons, that's not going to play well, because Americans, regardless of political stripe after what we have been through will be very eager for things to return to somewhat normal, for the economy to begin to thrive, again, regardless of where they come down in the political spectrum because it's been such a painful experience for so many hurricanes. Look, I think that a lot of this comes down to the question, to Amy's point, will President Trump have a narrative that is sellable heading into November? And I don't think we are really going to know that until September or October. It's going to depend on the facts and the realities on the ground for actual voters, slogans. They can talk about pivoting to greatness or the great American comeback. If those don't feel real, if they sound like empty words to people, then the president can say them until he's blue in the face, it's not going to matter. But if it lines up with the reality that people are living every day, and they're like, OK, maybe we have gotten through the public health crisis. Maybe it wasn't handled perfectly but we are recovering now, and perhaps we are starting to recover also on the economic front and I am starting to feel that, then those slogans, those catchphrases would resonate.

I do think it's important that the media be much better about accurately describing who is really at risk from this.

According to CNN, the Washington Post, and others experts, say mail-in ballots are very rarely linked to voter fraud. In the last hour in the Rose Garden, the president again went off on the idea of mail-in ballots, saying that spied to do absentee balloting. But if you did it across every state to every voter, it could result in fraud. But five states currently, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington State, and Utah, all have all mail-in ballots, and there doesn't appear to be any particular problem with that.

It protected the rule of law and resulted in your exoneration. Your personal feelings don't dictate who Alabama picks as their senator.

But his relationship with MSNBC's morning host turned bitter in 2016 and is increasingly toxic. The president has been tweeting about his unfounded conspiracy theory involving the 2001 death of Lori Klausutis, a 28-year-old aide in Scarborough's Florida office. A medical examiner ruled an undiagnosed heart problem caused her to block out, fall, and hit her head. No foul play was suspected. Responding to harsh attacks on \"Morning Joe,\" Trump tweeted \"When will they open a cold case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida? Did he get away with murder? Some people think so.\" Also, \"And guys like Low Ratings Psycho Joe Scarborough are allowed to walk the streets? Open Cold Case!\" That prompted Brzezinski to urge Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to ban the president."

Let's bring on our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Guy Benson, political editor at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Townhall.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=MxlMONYL8G8bt_qfz87PeV0Fb8wpGWWihdy-mVdZFtM&s=259EbkX1NdPeag_27xxBn-O2Dc_gavKuDeSmkWjW5dE&e= , host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio. Mollie, your sense about where we are. Obviously there's the chance that things could slide, but there is some growing optimism it appears, starting this week. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's absolutely true that this virus will be with us for some time, but it's also true that we know a lot now that we didn't know a few months ago when we embarked on a mass shutdown. It is good news that the virus is not nearly as deadly as we thought it was when we first saw this, or that hospitals are not overrun like that we thought they were. But I was interested in an article that was in \"Politico\" today about how Democrats say that their nightmare scenario is that the economy might get back up and running before the November election. And I do think there is a political concern here that people don't want to reopen in part because they are worried that a strong economy is one of Donald Trump's best arguments for his reelection and that they don't -- and they think that hurting the economy might help Democratic prospects. And so it's important people care about public health and not keep the economy locked down for political reasons."

Let's reverse the Trump tax cut. Nobody making under $400,000 should have their taxes raised, period. Bingo. Let's get people back to work. The idea of putting people back to work is going to occur when we begin to really invest in America, when we invest significantly in infrastructure. When we invest significantly in all the research and development that has to be done to compete with not just China but around the world."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "That ad there obviously playing on the president playing golf as the numbers hit 100,000. Thoughts? AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": So the economy has been the centerpiece question from the very beginning, long before this pandemic. The question was, why is an economy that's doing so well not benefiting the president politically? We saw at one point he had approval ratings on the economy close to 60 percent. And yet when you looked at it the overall approval ratings, they were still mired in the 40s, and matched up against Joe Biden he was still losing. So the challenge for the president has long been that the economy in and of itself isn't really the issue in this election. A lot of what this election is going to hinge on, that we are in the middle of a crisis, so let's just put into perspective. We may be in another health crisis by the time October or November comes around, we may not be. We will certainly be in an economic crisis regardless. Even if the economy does come back pretty well, there are going to be a lot of people still hurting economically. But the real question in my mind has long been, how are voters squaring their perception of the president and how he serves as president, the behavior, the way he conducts himself, versus what he's doing on the economy per se? It is true, most residents who are running in a bad economy tend not to get reelected. But this is not a typical type of recession, and this president has not seen, unlike other presidents, a big bump when things are good."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right. But why, then, Guy, are Democrats, including the former vice president, openly worrying about the V-shaped recovery that may come as the bounce back here in the third quarter? \"Politico\" had a big piece today. Joe Biden was asked about that in a CNN interview in which he said yes, these people coming back to work and the economy churning is going to look a lot steeper in the recovery right around the election."

Look, I think that a lot of this comes down to the question, to Amy's point, will President Trump have a narrative that is sellable heading into November? And I don't think we are really going to know that until September or October. It's going to depend on the facts and the realities on the ground for actual voters, slogans. They can talk about pivoting to greatness or the great American comeback. If those don't feel real, if they sound like empty words to people, then the president can say them until he's blue in the face, it's not going to matter. But if it lines up with the reality that people are living every day, and they're like, OK, maybe we have gotten through the public health crisis. Maybe it wasn't handled perfectly but we are recovering now, and perhaps we are starting to recover also on the economic front and I am starting to feel that, then those slogans, those catchphrases would resonate. And I'm not sure what the response of that will be from Democrats without sounding like they are trying to talk down a comeback from a very dark place, which, as I said, is not a great look."

Even the site of the Republican National Convention, the president threatening that Charlotte, if North Carolina, the governor can't give them an answer, maybe he will move it, and Georgia is already pitching, saying bring it to Georgia."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Right. You are definitely seeing a partisan divide in how governors are handling like this, even if it's not a perfect partisan divide. And you're also seeing that reflected in polls about what individuals themselves want in terms of reopening the economy or keeping it shut down. There are so many questions going into the summer about sporting events, conventions, and whatnot. But we are in a much better place now than we were a few months ago. I do think it's important that the media be much better about accurately describing who is really at risk from this. They seem to overhype the general risk of what's happening to the population while under-hyping something day-in and day-out, which is that nursing homes have absolutely been ravaged by the coronavirus. Half of all deaths are in nursing homes, maybe even more. That's not just in the United States but worldwide. And so the more that we do general things that don't matter, like shutting down the outdoor spaces but not taking care of nursing homes, is not good for us."
