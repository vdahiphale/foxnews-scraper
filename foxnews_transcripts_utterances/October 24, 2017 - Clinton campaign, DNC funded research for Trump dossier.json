Christopher Steele found out that the Kremlin was investigating Donald Trump, supposedly. We don't know about what to believe about the salacious allegations were, but Hillary Clinton, the Democrats were happy to take that information. This is the Kremlin investigating, or getting dirt, on an American political candidate.

Jim Comey takes that dossier to President Obama in January and says, look, we have this. They wanted to keep this thing going. Until it was shut down they were going to keep paying Christopher Steele to dig up more information on Donald Trump. So any collusion that we're talking about, I think Hillary Clinton, the Democrats with the Steele sleazy guy and Russia together, all of this.
