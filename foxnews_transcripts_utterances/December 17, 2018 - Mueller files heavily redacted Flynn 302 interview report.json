Democratic leaders have already said that they'd be open to such a proposal, but the $1.6 billion is far left to less than the $5 billion the president is looking for.

Time for us to save billions dollars of year and half at the same time far greater safety and control. To get the president's wall, sources tell our own John Roberts the White House may seek a legal opinion to see if it can use money from the Department of Defense's budget to start building portions of the wall.  Again, though, we are told that is one of many proposals being discussed and worked out what it is another indication that if the president wants a deal this week to avoid a shutdown, it is likely going to be for far less than $5 billion that he wants. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If a shutdown does drag on into the New Year, several senior Republicans also today pointed out the negotiations will likely only get tougher once Democrats take control of the House -- Judge.",

If Democrats wanted to have a liberal Medicare for all a.k.a. socialized medicine system, they could have done it, however it would be at the state level. Meanwhile the red states would have free market solutions and thriving health care. It was a fair minded plan but Democrats are not interested in solutions or affordable health care, that's why we have Obamacare where the average premium has doubled, the only one who has taken an interest in solving the health care problem is President Trump who put in place short term health care plans, market based solutions that have actually made this the only year we have not seen premiums rise since Obamacare was put in place.

The bomb maker had been detained but under strict rules of engagement, the army was forced to release him. Instead of letting him go, Major Golsteyn tracked him down and killed him, fearing the bomb maker would later target Afghans who were helping U.S. troops. After Golsteyn's admission, the military launched an investigation but closed it without filing charges. Then he said this in 2016 on Special Report, watch.",

We're going to break this down, this development, coming up. But first, disgraced former FBI Director James Comey was back on Capitol Hill today, taking questions from lawmakers behind closed doors. While we don't know exactly what went on inside the hearing, we do know that Comey was pretty rattled during a subsequent press conference where he chastised President Trump, Republican lawmakers, and even Fox News.

There's an assertion in there that Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, settles (ph) payments that were needed at the end of the campaign. We have had to reporters through every hotel in Prague, all over the place, just to try to figure t out if he was ever there and came away empty.

You've got this Washington Post reporter, who is -- you know, we all know The Washington Post is certainly a liberal newspaper, and the reporter is saying there is nothing that they are talking about with respect to Michael Cohen and Prague, and we didn't get into it come up with the whole is that Michael Cohen went to Prague so that he could pay these Kremlin-related people for information to get into information on the tweets -- or what is it, the DNC information.

They cannot find any substantial facts to substantiate what was presented to the FISA courts. It's not the reporters from The Washington Post, we've had Bob Woodward writing books, we've had other reporters doing deep investigative work into this and nobody can substantiated it. Set aside the reporters for a moment, Judge, what about what this reporter admitted? That the FBI and CIA, two of the top intelligence and law enforcement agencies, cannot substantiate what's in the dossier. And still, people are operating under the assumption, including the special counsel, that there is something there to be investigated."

Take the number two at the FBI, former number two, Andy McCabe's word for it, who actually said they would not have had a case without the dossier. Think about where we are. They spied on the Trump team based on a hoax document that the number two at the FBI himself said they wouldn't have had a case without. How does that not bother everyone listening right now? Beyond me."

One is being recommended for criminal prosecution by the DOJ, and that's being McCabe."

He is so good at accusing President Trump and Republicans of exactly what he himself and his cohorts are guilty of -- lawbreaking, lying, corruption, being uninterested in the truth. He is deflecting from his own behavior and activities by accusing the president and his associates of doing the same thing. James Comey is the personification of the deep state. Totally ruthless, unaccountable, surrounded by acolytes and flunkies and has assumed throughout this entire amount of time to be untouchable, except they never accepted President Trump to win. And now, they are being ambushed by history, and that is why you are seeing them double down on the aggression and accusing the president and his team of what they themselves are guilty of."

Sadly, he is taking the rest of the FBI with him and that is a shame. There are a lot of good folks working over there. I talked to a lot of them who are embarrassed by Jim Comey, too. But here -- Judge, to answer your question, no, I don't think Comey is going to get away with it. And here's the reason why. Let's not forget, there is a very specific, verified procedure called the Woods Procedure to verify information before it goes before the FISA courts. We know that dossier was not verified. Jim Comey, at some point, had to have signed off on that verification procedure for a document we now know was a hoax. There is a paper trail, Judge."

I don't hear anyone saying they need to be held in contempt for bringing this before me. I don't even know who it was. We know that contrary is took the plea on Flynn, which I'm going to get to with Gregg Jarrett and Sara Carter in a minute. But he was taken off the case, and, you know, there is all these dirty dealing going on and nobody is looking at it, and this guy is pontificating, Comey, that is the president who is wrong."

All right, guys, I am excited to be doing this. Here we have god just released the new 302 -- we didn't even know if there was a 302, because on Wednesday when Judge Sullivan ordered it be turned in on Friday, we didn't get it on Friday but we get it today. It's heavily redacted. And the 302, for the viewers, just so you know, it's basically an interview of an individual that has turned into a report, a 302. It is supposed to be done contemporaneously with the report. Now, what we have here is we now have a version of the January 24th interview of Michael Flynn signed February, one version in May, and then we've got one version in August. Gregg, which one do you believe?"

And it clearly states that these FBI agents who interviewed Michael Flynn determined that he was telling the truth and he wasn't flying. But you know, these prosecutors, Mueller's prosecutors, tried to follow a fast one on this federal judge, Emmet Sullivan, he was having none of it. Last Friday, they were supposed to hand over these documents. They hid -- deliberately hid -- the 302 from the judge. He noticed it and he issued a minute order today, saying, turn over that document. So, that's a red flag for the judge, puts them on alert, during tomorrow's jury hearing, he may say why did you hide that document from me?"

You know, when Mueller withholds a 302, which is the essence of the statement that Flynn made, which is the basis of his lying, as the feds see it, but if they see it to be honest, they said he really wasn't lying. So what we have here is the judge, who, tomorrow, has a decision to make. He can vacate the plea or he can allow the second to go through, which the prosecution is recommending no time."

I also want to say, Judge Jeanine, that they didn't turn in the raw notes. That is, the raw notes from the FBI agent, Joe Pietka, who is the other agent who interviewed Flynn. And that's extremely important, because a lot of times when I was talking to Sidney Powell (ph) about this, a lot of times, the raw materials, those raw notes, are drastically different from the 302s. So, the judge is going to want to compare the raw notes of the FBI agents with these 302s. And remember, 302s should be done within five days. Why were these 302s -- well, the three of them -- why were they don't consecutively, and so far apart?"

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And, I'll give you an example of how it supposed to be done.  Hillary Clinton was interviewed on July 2nd of 2016. Her 302 was done that day. Now, we have three 302s that they try h to hide from the judge that they redacted heavily and we don't know which one is the accurate one and there is something that stinks in River City (ph)."

It happened in the Ted Stevens case, this judge was presiding. So, you know, look -- these are prosecutors who don't care about justice and the truth. Mueller's team only cares about getting Trump and winning their cases. But this judge cares about justice and he may turn to the prosecutors tomorrow and say, wait a minute, look at this 302, why did you charge a guy with lying --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "When you don't think he was lying? Not only that, the judge has the authority to vacate the plea, the authority to dismiss in the interest of justice, but what is interesting, Flynn did not make any of these motions. The judge will have to do it sua sponte, on his own. Will he?"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "I want to see these documents. And the judge may actually turn to Michael Flynn and said, what happened here? If you didn't lie, and the only two witnesses said you didn't like, were you coerced and forced? Did Mueller and his team threaten your son? Did he cause you to essentially go bankrupt and broke? Is that why you pled?"

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But in addition to that, in addition to that, what he can say is, he can say, you know, you intentionally dissuaded him from bringing an attorney. And although this is not a custodial interrogation, which would require Miranda rights, there is a nuance here, and the nuance is, we may say you don't need a lawyer, and when they try to talk you out of it, Sara, aren't they in as bad a place as if they didn't Mirandize at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely they are. And if you look at 302 itself, the lie is at the top of this 302, because they said -- they notified him of the nature of this interview, and that is inaccurate. They never notified him of the nature of the interview because they asked him not to bring an attorney, and they were looking at him for possible criminal purposes, they were trying, in a sense, to a entrap him because they already knew what the conversation was that he had with Ambassador Kislyak and they were going to him. So, I think the judge is going to be looking at all this. And remember one thing, Judge Jeanine, that there is another FBI agent here. Everybody has talked about Peter Strzok, every has seen what Michael Flynn has had to say but nobody has spoken to the other FBI agent."

They are delaying -- you know, I must say that, Sara, when you talk about the beginning of the 302, it says come after being advised of the eight of the identities of the interviewing agents and the nature of the interview, Flynn provided the following information. So you are saying, they said to him, we are looking at you to interrogate you regarding your statement and you are saying that didn't happen. You have information that that was not a fact.

What would happen is I'd have to notify the DOJ, this is just a conversation. There was no way at that point in time, according to the sources I have spoken with, that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn thought that he was being interrogated. In fact, throughout half of that interview, he thought they were just having a normal conversation."

Then he pushed him not to have -- oh, you don't need to have a lawyer, we don't need to involve the lawyers in is and they conspired.  Comey, McCabe, and Strzok, and Pietka, apparently, conspired not to tell Flynn they had the transcript of his very legal conversation with the Russian ambassador."

      "utterance": "Well, Judge, tonight, the White House is suggesting it may be able to strike a deal with Democrats to keep the government open. A number of plans are being discussed and at this point, there is still no specific proposal, but as these negotiations continue, it's starting to look like the White House may be softening its hard line on $5 billion for the border ball. A source with knowledge of the negotiations tells Fox News that one proposal is for a continuing resolution, which would keep the government funded until next year and provides $1.6 billion work border security and about 65 miles of fencing through the Rio Grande section of the southern border. Democratic leaders have already said that they'd be open to such a proposal, but the $1.6 billion is far left to less than the $5 billion the president is looking for. Earlier today, he stressed the need for a physical wall, tweeting that anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can good border security without a wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions dollars of year and half at the same time far greater safety and control. To get the president's wall, sources tell our own John Roberts the White House may seek a legal opinion to see if it can use money from the Department of Defense's budget to start building portions of the wall.  Again, though, we are told that is one of many proposals being discussed and worked out what it is another indication that if the president wants a deal this week to avoid a shutdown, it is likely going to be for far less than $5 billion that he wants. If a shutdown does drag on into the New Year, several senior Republicans also today pointed out the negotiations will likely only get tougher once Democrats take control of the House -- Judge."

You know, the president has made it clear that he has no problem taking responsibility for a partial shutdown, so that he can get the border wall that he has promised. Now, it seems, just as we heard from Garrett Tenney and everything has been happening, that he probably won't get more than the $1.6 billion.

This is the swamp way. And I got to tell you, my readers who followed my immigration reporting over the last 25 years of it are completely sick of it. They do hope that President Trump is true to who is worried because if they don't feel to the wall, you will fall, and that goes for people on both sides of the aisle.  $1.6 billion?

I mean, we saw - we heard last week from the department of Homeland Security, how they stopped a 3700 known or suspected terrorists at the border in 2017. They stop 17,000 criminals at the border. They stopped over a 1000 gang members so we can pay the price now or we can pay the price down the line in this. Now here is the good news, let's say they don't get something done. If the new deal that the President has been able to put together with Mexico doesn't have the economic activity that we think it will, that projections suggest it will, then there'll be new revenue coming in that will give the President actually a stronger hand to say, look, we now have the money coming in that now we should be funding border security. The last point I want to make is how far Nancy Pelosi has come that during Barack Obama's administration she wanted to pass bills and then find out what was in them and now all of a sudden she has to know everything in any Bill before it passes."

I mean, we have these migrant invasions and we've talked about this judge, that are coordinated globally. This is sabotage of our sovereignty by I think, menaces inside and outside of our country and if this doesn't constitute a Presidential prerogative for using our defense budget on the border, I don't know what does. And let's talk about more Democrat hypocrisy because every Senate Democrat in 2013 voted for $46 billion of border security including reinforced steel barriers and Senate Democrats at the time in 2006 including Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, who now claims that we don't need physical barriers in order to ensure border security, all voted for the Secure Fence Act which included 30 feet steel bollard fences and walls. The idea that we don't need physical barriers at a time when countries around the world can't erect them fast enough, it's laughable and they need to be called out."

The folks that were challenging this is when you take that Tax Bill that the President passed with Congress in 2017, that Tax Bill set the individual mandate to zero.

If Democrats wanted to have a liberal Medicare for all a.k.a. socialized medicine system, they could have done it, however it would be at the state level. Meanwhile the red states would have free market solutions and thriving health care. It was a fair minded plan but Democrats are not interested in solutions or affordable health care, that's why we have Obamacare where the average premium has doubled, the only one who has taken an interest in solving the health care problem is President Trump who put in place short term health care plans, market based solutions that have actually made this the only year we have not seen premiums rise since Obamacare was put in place.

My answer was it depends on the day and our goal is to hopefully have them be a friend more days than they're a foe but it's not going to be because we're being soft on them, it's going to be because they want the relationship back and they are starting to act better now."

Major Mathew Golsteyn was once awarded the silver star for valor for his actions in Afghanistan and was under consideration for the Distinguished Service Cross. Then in 2014 when Golsteyn was interviewing with the CIA and taking a polygraph, he acknowledged killing an alleged Taliban bomb maker who was suspected of killing two marines. The bomb maker had been detained but under strict rules of engagement, the army was forced to release him. Instead of letting him go, Major Golsteyn tracked him down and killed him, fearing the bomb maker would later target Afghans who were helping U.S. troops. After Golsteyn's admission, the military launched an investigation but closed it without filing charges. Then he said this in 2016 on Special Report, watch."
