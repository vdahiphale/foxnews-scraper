And we don't want this from any administration, but when John Brennan comes out and talks about an Obama abuse of power, you have to say what about the power that you had as the director of the CIA? What about when you are working with the FBI and the DNI and order to set this political cheese laden perjury traps for Michael Flynn who actually wasn't charge with perjury.

Because, Dana, as we've been listening to the president and talking about this Obamagate thing on the show, I mean, it goes into the dirty dossier that they used to buy a warrant and then fabricate the evidence to the judge. It goes to the criminal leak of Mike Flynn. It goes the insertion of spies into a campaign. I mean, it goes to the setup of Mike Flynn. The illegal prosecution. All of these things come together and when he says Obamagate, you can't just dismiss it as a conspiracy theory."

Then the attorney general that is put in a position of like, OK, well, I have to deliver on this some way. Now he has figured out a way to go to Jensen, who was the U.S. attorney in Missouri. His credibility is not at all in question. Not at all. And so, he is the one who makes the recommendation along with career prosecutors that tell Barr what they think base on their investigation, then Barr takes the action that he does and I feel like that's been very methodical. One thing at that I think is pretty outrageous is that Emmet Sullivan, the judge, wants to have additional people outside of the case come in and decide whether Michael Flynn should be actually charged with perjury. That doesn't make any sense. You don't charge perjury to somebody through an extrajudicial process. You do it through the prosecutors. The prosecutors in this case have said they want to drop it. So that will probably happen sometime next week. And Joe Biden is not able to answer some of these questions but he's not completely out there. He was very specific. He said I had no knowledge of a criminal investigation. He didn't talk about any knowledge --"

It reminds me when I was a kid watching big time wrestling in San Mateo, California, and all the wrestlers would beat up on Pat Patterson and then at the end he would come back and he would flip the script and beat everybody. That's what's happening here with the Russian story, the Russian narrative, the script has been flipped and now it's the media on their heels. Look, what drives me nuts, it's weird to see so many people in the press depressed. They are depressed that a war hero wasn't imprisoned. I would think that they should be relieved that such a patriotic American hero was found innocent and now can live his life. But they're really, really pissed off that, you know, he somehow triumphed against this kind of set up. I will go back to my original suggestion from two weeks ago, the best thing Trump can do is appoint Flynn to be head of the FBI. He has earned it and maybe that will clean house. And can you imagine what it does to the media? It will be worse for them than the pandemic."

Politico criticizing media coverage of how red state governors like Florida's Ron DeSantis handled the lockdown. While New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is now facing more scrutiny for his handling of the pandemic after previously receiving high marks. Dana, as we go into this reopening phase, I have a feeling like we are just in a grand experiment. Lives are on the line. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I think we're doing -- I think it's more than just an experiment. Though of course you could look at, as Greg has mentioned, 50 different experiments. And that's kind of a useful way to look at it. But I do feel like aside from the extremes like in Los Angeles, cutting off water to businesses, that's extreme. And maybe revelers in Wisconsin, that can be an extreme. But the extremes are hijacking the debate. What you actually see is that governors are using data to inform their decision such as Governor DeSantis and Governor Kemp. And they have, one, they would be responsible for the consequences of their decisions, but they've based it on data. People have been fairly responsible, and they are seeing their numbers continue to come down and they are recognizing that they're going to have to help their businesses have to figure out a way to reopen safely and responsibly. The other thing is the government cannot be your parent. The government can't do everything for you. We are responsible citizens. We are responsible adults. We are blessed to live in a free country, and the government has to trust us that we will make a decision for ourselves. There might be extremes. But that is absolutely not the vast majority of what's happening. And I would also say, you know, say a prayer for some of these local officials that have to make some really tough decisions. Talk to the mayor of Point Pleasant Beach today, Paul Kanitra, he was on the daily briefing talking about how they are going to reopen beaches. You know, it's not going to be easy to tell people if they're in a line, that they're going to have to wear a mask while they're at the beach. They're going to have to have patrols, et cetera. They are trying to do it with care. And we should understand and give them some room to try to do what they need to do so that we can all reopen and get this country moving again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, Greg, coming to this idea, you know, Dana is talking about beaches. The weather is getting better. There's going to be more people outside, and I think people if they are outside and keeping a social distance, I think there is a better shot at avoiding trouble than when we are indoors kind of huddled with the virus around. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I've always felt that way and I've said it many times. Because the first, I think the first suggestion about this virus was that it was spread via indoors. It's an indoor sickness. So, I think it's a -- I think it's a really, a really smart idea to get people outside as the weather gets warmer. As for people who continue to accuse others of murder when they want to go outside and feed their families, flip the script. When they accuse you of wanting death, say to them, well, you want more spousal abuse. Because domestic violence has been surging as these restrictions linger, right? So, if they say you want people to die, well, you want spouses to get beaten up. Obviously, that's absurd. But it's analogous. And that's what the media right now is doing to people who just want to get back to work. So, you've got to flip it on them. Piece of advice from Greg."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "All right. Kennedy -- we appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Kennedy, I'm wondering what is practical? What can we really do until the summer camps and the schools get reopened? I know you have kids, so I just wanted to hear your thoughts on how extensive can any reopening be if the kids are -- the kids have nowhere to go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "No, it's true, there's so much pressure on parents right now not only are we in charge of schooling and education and curriculum and being taskmasters and making sure that everything is turned in on time and everyone is attending their zoom meetings. You also have to keep your kids physically active and that's a very big challenge. But one nice thing about it is it is bringing people together and sort of reinvent buying what physical fitness means and getting outside and walking together properly socially distanced, I think that's a great thing and it also, it leaves it up to families, what are we comfortable doing? And to Dana's point, yes, it's a laboratory of democracy and that every state is going to open differently, just like every person is going to come back from an injury differently but also every business and every parent has to think for themselves what is the best way to keep my family safe while still functioning. And to Greg's point, it is a false dichotomy. It's not open up the states and people die or stay at home and the economy craters long-term. There has to be something in the middle and we have to be trusted as individuals to thread that needle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I think that's a good point. So, Jesse, let's come to the media angle on this story. You saw that Politico critical of the American media for having previously been so critical of Florida's Ron DeSantis, the governor, when he was leaving the beaches open and the like. And the reality is now we don't see any large-scale outbreaks in Florida. On the other hand, very high praise for lots of Republican governors. I am thinking of DeWine of Ohio, Hogan in Maryland, Baker in Massachusetts. So, is it fair to say the media has been unfair to Republican governors?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, like, what does DeSantis need to do? Put some infected people in nursing homes to get a puff piece written about them? I mean, Cuomo is god and this guy botched it, and people are dead in nursing homes and it's getting worse. They did this all over the northeast. Like, Pennsylvania did the same thing. And now there's a huge scandal because the Pennsylvania health director withdrew her own mother from a nursing home while she forced other sick people to go into the nursing homes. And now thousands of people have been killed. And if the media had reported these things early on, every other governor in the country could've looked at that and said you know what, maybe we shouldn't be doing that. But they cover it up and they focus on red states like Georgia, Florida."

And I don't think he has answered this very well. Also, as far as Joe Biden campaigning from his basement, what he's trying to do right now is use the pandemic to get out of the debates.

Which is why he's hidden in the basement light granny in \"Evil Dead 2.\" Not because he was the granny or the mother. I'll get back to that. It is ironic that what's threatening the American public is offering immunity to Joe, the pandemic. But lucky for Joe living in a pandemic.

Remember what he used to like and his speeches? He'd be like, you know, check me out. If you don't like it, vote for the other guy. Like there's no confidence that Biden possesses. And that's because he knows deep down, he's not qualified to be the president. He's never been a leader. He doesn't have command of the subject matter. And he's just not articulate enough to be the leader of the free world. You know, we've had such beautifully articulate presidents for the -- in my entire lifetime that you know, they mesmerize you. They bring you in, they razzle-dazzle you, and you can't stop listening to them talk. With Biden, you just can't wait till it's over.

And I think that -- I think that he has been very strong on that point. He's denied it over and over. And the reporting that's come out since you know, Vox. I saw it today, a piece. It was done by PBS. They interviewed dozens of people. Nobody's backing up this -- the claim, the allegation yet. So we'll see where it goes, but not yet.

I seriously think I would have kicked him in the you know what. It's disgusting. And you know where you can get a lot of attention? You can get attention by doing really great things. If you look at any media, we're all looking to cover stories that fit into the -- like the America together program that we have at Fox News. Like, all of that is a great way to get attention.

A lot of guys have these dopey little ones like they look like they're in the hospital.

There's new research that says it can reduce the transmission of the disease by 80 percent. We were lied to about the masks early on, because they didn't have enough masks. I just want to address this survey. It's an online survey. It's the opposite of science. This is clickbait to get on T.V. And the easiest way to get on T.V. is to do a story on gender differences. But the key is, it has to be critical of men. You cannot do a gender different story that is critical of women. It will never get on. You know that. Everybody knows that."
