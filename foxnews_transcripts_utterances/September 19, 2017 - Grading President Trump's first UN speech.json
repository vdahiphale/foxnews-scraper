We remember just a few years ago, Bret, when President Obama addressed the Trayvon Martin case at the United Nations obliquely, said we've had our own issues in the United States with racial issues. And I remember Dick Cheney at the time said going to the United Nations and even implicitly acknowledging or discussing America's problems is just not what we expect from a president. And that's not what you heard from Donald Trump. He said we have been a force for good in the world. We will continue to be a force for good in the world. But my responsibility and duty is to the people of America. And at the same time, he hit the Soviet Union, as Tom said, and Cuba and the death struggle over communism and what it's done to people.

      "utterance": "I have to tell you I was on air this morning on radio. And I was taking the pulse of the listeners as we were going to it live. And person after person after person called in and said this is what we've been waiting to hear from a president at the United Nations. Bold, strong, unabashedly pro-American. We remember just a few years ago, Bret, when President Obama addressed the Trayvon Martin case at the United Nations obliquely, said we've had our own issues in the United States with racial issues. And I remember Dick Cheney at the time said going to the United Nations and even implicitly acknowledging or discussing America's problems is just not what we expect from a president. And that's not what you heard from Donald Trump. He said we have been a force for good in the world. We will continue to be a force for good in the world. But my responsibility and duty is to the people of America. And at the same time, he hit the Soviet Union, as Tom said, and Cuba and the death struggle over communism and what it's done to people. So I think Mara is right, there was a little bit for everybody in this speech. I think it could have been his best speech of the presidency thus far."

      "utterance": "And Tom, I've talked about this earlier in the show, or I should say shows. It's all kind of going together here 5:00 to 7:00. But the speech, the joint address, Saudi Arabia, Warsaw, the outline of Afghan policy, in there you see, and today an outline of a Trump doctrine."

    {
      "speaker": "ROGAN",
      "utterance": "You do. And I think that doctrine comes down to a pretty hardheaded realism. But it has a realism in the sense of articulating what kind of government -- identifying the flaws of government, for example Iran and Venezuela, but standing up and articulating specific challenges in terms of American interests, in terms of why you have to address particular issues. I do think on the Iran issue, unless President Macron is willing to play good cop-bad cop role with the president, it's going to be tough to do that in a way that keeps the Europeans happy. But perhaps President Trump doesn't care about that. So we shall see. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
