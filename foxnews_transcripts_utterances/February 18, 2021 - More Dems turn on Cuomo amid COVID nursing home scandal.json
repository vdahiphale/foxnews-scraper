This is \"The Five.\" The fallout from the nursing home scandal getting very serious for New York governor, Andrew Cuomo.

But Cuomo is not stopping there, no. He's called at least three other state Democrat lawmakers, threaten to destroy their careers for trying to strip them of emergency powers.

So they had no issues with bro covering bro when it was an adorable media darling shtick, right, when they played Abbott and Costello, or when they had a block where they talked about whether the governor was single and ready to mingle. It turns out he was ready to mingle. He mingled COVID patients with a rest home tenants and killed them! if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, let's face it. They should have done this sooner. And that's the big question. Imagine this -- if CNN had made that call sooner and banned the bro's, right? And Jake Tapper was doing the interviews and not Andrew Cuomo, there would be no Q-tip, there'd be no dating tips. Perhaps the governor would've acted faster under pressure from Tapper to reverse the policies and perhaps save some lives. So, we have to ask, how culpable is CNN in all of this? Perhaps the major cable carriers who bring CNN into your homes should reflect on whether that's a safe decision to make. I mean, I would definitely want to revisit that. And in lieu of the bro scandal, I suggest that Chris Cuomo could cover another scandal that's out there and brewing. You know, \"The New York Post\" was reporting court papers that show CNN paid $35,000 to a BLM anti-Trump writer who egged on the siege at the capital. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, they actually put a guy who encouraged the siege on TV and let him shape the narrative that he helped make and they paid him. And they didn't question his involvement until others called him and didn't question. That seems to me a pretty, pretty, pretty big story. Maybe now that Chris Cuomo has some free time and he doesn't have to follow his brother around, he could cover that story. Wouldn't that be great? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But it's an interesting concept in this -- in the fact that it reminds me of the exact ideology behind the hard left over the summer when they were talking about the riots and the looting and the arson. There were a lot of blue checkers on Twitter saying that looting and destruction is a form of protest when all other protests go unheeded.

If you don't pay me or you don't obey me, you will be hurt. And I heard that all summer saying like, hey, this is -- you know, this is -- you know, looting is just part of the deal, right?

      "utterance": "Hello everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, and Katie Pavlich. It's 5:00 in New York City. This is \"The Five.\" The fallout from the nursing home scandal getting very serious for New York governor, Andrew Cuomo. The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn now reportedly investigating him and senior members of his coronavirus task force. It's over claims they covered up COVID deaths at nursing home facilities. Cuomo insists he's done nothing wrong. But he is now facing growing bipartisan backlash. One state Democrat, Assemblyman Ron Kim, says the governor bullied him and threatened to \"destroy him.\" Take a look."

      "speaker": "RON KIM, NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLYMAN",
      "utterance": "When you get closer to the truth behind the growing nursing home scandal in New York, Governor Cuomo tries to implicate you in the cover-up or threatens your livelihood if you don't lie for him. And that's what happened to me in the last one week. For 10 minutes, he berated me, he yelled at me, he told me that, you know, my career would be over. He's been biting his tongue for months against me. And I had tonight, not tomorrow, tonight to issue a new statement, essentially asking me to lie."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Jesse, yesterday we were talking about, you know, exactly what is the crime that he did. I don't think there's any question he made grievous mistakes, but is it the case that somebody might just say \"boy, those Democrats in New York -- de Blasio, now Kim -- are feuding with a powerful governor who may be seeking a fourth term?\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "There is a feud, but Cuomo started it. Let's paint the picture, Juan. This guy Ron Kim, Democrat, his uncle died in a nursing home that Governor Cuomo infected. He's giving his children a bath in his apartment in Queens the other day. He's got sleeves rolled up, he's on his knees. He has the Johnson & Johnson no tears baby shampoo, here he gets a phone call. It's the governor screaming so loudly that his wife can hear, and now she's in tears because the governor's demanding he lie, threatens to destroy his career. He says, \"you're going to feel my wrath and don't cross me.\" And what else is the governor going to do? He's already killed the guy's uncle. His wife is in tears. But Cuomo is not stopping there, no. He's called at least three other state Democrat lawmakers, threaten to destroy their careers for trying to strip them of emergency powers. At least Donald Trump, when he called you out, did it on twitter in public and he owned it. Governor Cuomo does it in the dark and secret and then he tries to deny it. This is all about Mario Cuomo, his father and his legacy. He was elected three terms as governor in New York, and his son, he wants a fourth term, but he can see that fourth term fading because you now have federal investigations, public humiliation, bipartisan outrage. So, he's acting like a caricature of a Tammany Hall gangster politician, but he's coming off more like a bully that got punched in the face and now his nose is bleeding and he's wounded and whining about it and maybe doesn't look so invincible."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I'm going to ask Greg about that later, but Dana, let me ask you about the scandal reaching Washington because now there's a letter from nine Republican senators asking the Senate Judiciary Committee to have Merrick Garland, who is the nominee for attorney general, commit -- commit that he will investigate Andrew Cuomo. I'm wondering if that's a little bit of overreach by the Republicans. I mean, shouldn't an investigation be done privately and without political pressure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "I think it's pretty easy for Merrick Garland to answer that question, which is looks like the DOJ and the U.S. attorneys' offices is already investigating. And if I were Merrick Garland, I would say I see no reason to stop that and move on and get confirmed. That's what I think will happen. I don't think that Andrew Cuomo ever thought in his life he would be grateful to Senator Ted Cruz until today because obviously (inaudible) for political news, Ted Cruz is getting a little bit of attention today for something else we'll talk about in a little bit. Look, when you're taking incoming fire from your own side to this great extent, there's no place to hide. There is no safe port in the storm. So, I think that there's only one way to let some air out of this political balloon. He either has to say something like, let me fess up, here's what happened. Or more likely, even if the Democrats are going after him because they are looking for him to topple so that they can move up. I mean, the guys have been governor for three terms. He wants a fourth. I think that's not going to happen. And if the governor wants to sort of alleviate the situation, he might come out soon and say he's not running again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's an interesting thought. But Katie, to that point, this week we have a new poll from Sienna, a New York State pollster. And what they find is that even after the scandal broke, Cuomo's approval rating among New Yorkers is basically unchanged. And here is something I found really interesting. It said 39 percent, not a very high number, approve of how he made the data public, but 60 percent, Katie, approve of his handling of the pandemic. What do you make of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, we've been talking about the Andrew Cuomo nursing home scandal for nearly a year now, but not everybody has. And so I think that we're just at the beginning of the real seriousness of the consequences for what -- of what he's looking at. I mean, we haven't seen subpoenas yet from the Senate in Washington, D.C. or from the local legislature, but we do have an FBI investigation. And I think it's going to be really interesting to watch his staff and how they react when they have to lawyer up, and they can no longer call people and scream at them on the phone because they are under perjury rules and have a potential of going to prison themselves if they lie under oath to investigators. So, while I think this is just the beginning, I think the more people learn about it, I think his approval rating will go down. Now, also, you have to remember that before Andrew Cuomo was saying this is just Republicans attacking me because I'm running for governor again, well, there's a lot of Democrats who had people who were killed in nursing homes as a result of government decisions. And so now everybody is asking questions and it's not really a political issue anymore. It's a matter of accountability and finding out what happened after Andrew Cuomo Refused to release the data to both Republicans and Democrats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, Greg, Jesse was talking about the situation over at CNN. Chris Cuomo, the governor's brother, now told to stay away from the story. I think we both agree there is an element of entertainment in cable news coverage and the sibling rivalry and the giant Q-tip, oh, it was funny. But I was wondering, just as a matter of seriousness, now there is real news and a real scandal. Isn't it appropriate to say that a brother can't cover a brother?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, that's -- I think -- as Jesse said, how convenient. So they had no issues with bro covering bro when it was an adorable media darling shtick, right, when they played Abbott and Costello, or when they had a block where they talked about whether the governor was single and ready to mingle. It turns out he was ready to mingle. He mingled COVID patients with a rest home tenants and killed them! So, let's face it. They should have done this sooner. And that's the big question. Imagine this -- if CNN had made that call sooner and banned the bro's, right? And Jake Tapper was doing the interviews and not Andrew Cuomo, there would be no Q-tip, there'd be no dating tips. Perhaps the governor would've acted faster under pressure from Tapper to reverse the policies and perhaps save some lives. So, we have to ask, how culpable is CNN in all of this? Perhaps the major cable carriers who bring CNN into your homes should reflect on whether that's a safe decision to make. I mean, I would definitely want to revisit that. And in lieu of the bro scandal, I suggest that Chris Cuomo could cover another scandal that's out there and brewing. You know, \"The New York Post\" was reporting court papers that show CNN paid $35,000 to a BLM anti-Trump writer who egged on the siege at the capital. So, they actually put a guy who encouraged the siege on TV and let him shape the narrative that he helped make and they paid him. And they didn't question his involvement until others called him and didn't question. That seems to me a pretty, pretty, pretty big story. Maybe now that Chris Cuomo has some free time and he doesn't have to follow his brother around, he could cover that story. Wouldn't that be great?"

So like, you're in Cancun -- you're in Cancun, but that's where the orphanage is. So I've often walked by Jesse's pod -- he doesn't have an office. He has a pod -- and I'll see him and he looks for orphanages and charities on islands. It's disgusting."

Dana, you brought this up earlier about this kind of wiped the Cuomo news off, but I mean, they must -- I mean, this is kind of day one stuff if you're a politician.

They will pour money in (inaudible) then he will fall short again. The energy issues though, look, there's a lot of culpability that can go around and it's not just all one issue. One of the big things is failure to plan and failure to invest and to weatherize. And it's not fun to do the maintenance around you house when you'd rather, you know, add a deck or buy a new furniture, but the maintenance is what is critical to keep the roof over your head. And I think Texas is paying a big price for this. It's very unfortunate. You know, I have friends -- many friends, of course, in Texas. Many of them have resources and means, but they are suffering too. So imagine what people that don't have means are going through. And I -- we already know that more than 30 people have died. I think the suffering is way up there. We haven't heard the end of this. And also, I could just ask everyone to pray for these ranchers that are trying to take care of the livestock. This is the time of year when the calves are born and its really treacherous time out there for them especially if they can't get to water because it's all frozen over."

Now, it turns out as we come into this story, that the truth, the facts are that this isn't about wind turbines. This is about the fact that the coal and gas production was not prepared, as Dana was saying, to deal with this cold snap and they locked up. They got all jammed up. So, you know, to me, its boomerangs on Abbott and its boomerang on people who did not, in fact, invest in the idea of let's say the grid being part of the whole United States instead of isolated. They can't get any support from neighboring states because they designed it that way. So, they are on an island. They can't get help. I mean, they are on an island like, you know, Ted Cruz is down there sipping pina coladas -- very often wonderland. But again, there is real consequence and, you know, I'm sure you guys would point out if this was Democratic leaders, so let me say, all these are Republican leaders who have failed their state."

Republicans warning it will create a surge of illegal immigration and lead to \"blanket amnesty.\" That is happening while a new caravan is on the move in Central America. A group of migrants has already made its way to Mexico. Katie, I noticed yesterday that, or this morning, there is a conservative coalition that's coming together, Heritage Action, Judicial Crisis Network and Americans for Public Trust. They are launching a combined $2 million ad campaign like they had done before for conservative judges that they were supporting. In this case, they're actually running ads about some of Joe Biden's nominees including Xavier Becerra from California. He's been a real champion for decriminalizing illegal immigration. He is of course up for HHS secretary. The politics of this aside from the merits of it, the politics of this are going to get very difficult for the Biden administration pretty quickly I think but would love your thoughts."

There is this issue of unemployment and people trying to get back on their feet at a time when business were devastated last year. The issue of not adding more border security shows that the Democrats and the Biden White House really aren't interested in working with Republicans on this. They know that they have the majority in the House and the Senate, and they want to move forward with this amnesty that they've talked about for years and years. And it's not 11 million people. It's more like 20 million people. And the reason why Republicans always say there has to be a border security component to this is because if you don't do that, you create a magnet. And now we're already seeing border patrol agents saying that they have seen a doubling of unaccompanied minors under the age of 13 in the past couple of weeks. So, they are creating a crisis on a number of different levels and I think we're just seeing the beginning of it."

There's no way it clears the Senate, and they did that on purpose. So, when the Republicans take back the House or the Senate, Democrats can say Republicans are blocking immigration and they can campaign on it. It's the same thing all politicians do. They don't solve a problem and they just blame the other party for that problem. Even the Politico came out and said this is terrible politics and policy. They have an article that says this thing is a recipe for disaster and it's littered with quotes from Democrats on the border and swing states saying blanket amnesty, open borders, we're going to lose our seats. And Politico even says you're already seeing migrants come into these border towns and they're just overwhelming the health care system and the small businesses. AP reports now, the Panama government they basically opened their border and now migrants are flowing out of the Colombian jungle up through Central America. And the Central American governments are saying, hey, come on through as a shakedown so Joe sends them more foreign aid which of course they pocket. I want to just address this 11 million number. I've been at Fox since 2003. I used to be a producer before they put makeup on me. We used to do research packets, how many illegals in this country. In 2003, Dana, it was 11 million. You're saying nearly 20 years later that number is still 11 million? No, no, no, no. It's at least 20 million and everybody knows it."

      "utterance": "Well, I don't see that this is going to pass as a comprehensive bill, Dana, if the buzzsaw on that level. But I must say, when I was looking at it, it looked -- I mean basically it's the same bill as the bill that got bipartisan support in 2013. Remember, it got 68 votes in the Senate, so it was like 14 republicans back the bill. But I think what we're seeing now is that clearly this issue has to be seen through the lens of the last four years of Donald Trump. And I think Republicans have become more aggressive, less open to immigration. And Democrats meanwhile have been saying hey, what about this hostility to immigrants? We want to make sure that we are standing up for immigrants. And you get into like silly arguments, do you call them illegal immigrants or do you call them undocumented. You know what that's all show. It's all theater. The reality is it doesn't solve the problem. So, I think what Biden's best chance is to avoid your buzzsaw, Dana, is to do things in pieces. Like, to go about the DREAMers, to look at e-verify, to look at border security, and then the toughest nugget is going to be dealing with the people who are already here and have been here and live in our communities."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Greg, I don't know if that's -- I don't know if that's accurate in terms of the politics, if it's just simply a Republican versus Democrat issue. I think that there were one of the reasons that President Trump got more Hispanic and Latino votes in 2020 than he did in 2016 was partly because of the focus on the economy and you had seen wages go up for lots of different reasons including this one."

      "utterance": "Yes. There was a bottom-line standard that Trump had. He was pro- American worker. And that means -- that obviously makes him seem harsh to the immigrant, but he has to -- if he's going to make a choice, he has to choose that. But in the -- in the front end of your question, you talked about the politics of this, and that's the problem. We -- the reason why we keep getting into these dead ends is because we look at immigration as a political variable when it's an economic variable i.e. the American worker, that's an economic variable. So, you would moderate the flow of the immigrants based on the changing circumstances of your economy. So, right now we have millions of unemployed American workers. We have lives that have been destroyed by a pandemic. We have an education system that is a mess. Our health care system is stressed. This seems a point when you look at the -- when you look at the switches for immigration that you would turn it back and wait a little while. And then when the country is backed to a time of great growth and the economy is exploding and the population is healthy and there's a surplus of jobs, you can then, you know, turn the -- toggle back up for immigrants. So, the thing is I think we run into a problem when it's always politics."

Economics is the only way to measure the benefits and consequences of a policy. You know when people are doing bad by looking at the economics, how much money they're taking home, how much -- how much money they have for food. So, that's the only way you can measure it. That's why Trump was right. And you're going to find out a lot of this stuff in hindsight. Trump turned out to be way ahead of it. He was ahead of me on this. I disagreed with him."

You know, I think at a certain point, they're going to ask for more money that I don't have. But it's an interesting concept in this -- in the fact that it reminds me of the exact ideology behind the hard left over the summer when they were talking about the riots and the looting and the arson. There were a lot of blue checkers on Twitter saying that looting and destruction is a form of protest when all other protests go unheeded. So, paying a killer not to kill is the same as give us -- give us what we want, or the city burns. It's essentially the logic -- the same logic of blackmail. If you don't pay me or you don't obey me, you will be hurt. And I heard that all summer saying like, hey, this is -- you know, this is -- you know, looting is just part of the deal, right? If you learned -- if you had learned, looting wouldn't happen. It's like, that's how I feel when I hear this."

In season three of The Wire that takes place in Baltimore, they -- the police have this innovative idea that they're going to basically let all the drug dealers deal their drugs and do their drugs in a certain area of town and they're going to look away and not do anything which basically ended up falling apart because it incentivized people to deal more drugs and do more drugs, so I don't think this is going to work.

You know, that kind of thing to say, oh, you know, when people get desperate, crime increases. They do horrible things. But it is -- to me, it's just a nonsense. I mean, I just wouldn't agree to it. I just think it encourages bad behavior. I mean, you couldn't have paid people not to attack the Capitol on January 6th. You couldn't pay people not to try to kidnap the governor of Michigan."

They will never have a positive impact on this world. Her -- she's -- this woman is awesome. Her culture appropriation is called capitalism, right? She's making millions and millions of dollars out of opportunity determination and ideas. These people -- these critics probably couldn't hire an Uber alone. Anyway, that's my point."

I'm sure I'll get written up about the way that I'm describing this but I think that we should be able to enjoy lots of different things that happen to be outside of our culture without getting accused of some kind of crime for enjoying that part of something that you're maybe not completely into. I don't know. It just seems really stupid."
