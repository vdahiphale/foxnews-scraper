The nuclear crisis with North Korea becoming more and more of a pressure cooker, after his bow to respond to new North Korean provocations with fire and fury, President Trump followed it up today by touted the strength of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. This afternoon, secretary of defense James Mattis also released a statement saying, quote, the DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people. Now in contrast, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attempted to bring a sense of calm while heeding to the U.S. territory -- while heading to the U.S. territory of Guam earlier today, which North Korea has threatened with attack.",

The nuclear crisis with North Korea becoming more and more of a pressure cooker, after his bow to respond to new North Korean provocations with fire and fury, President Trump followed it up today by touted the strength of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. This afternoon, secretary of defense James Mattis also released a statement saying, quote, the DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people. Now in contrast, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attempted to bring a sense of calm while heeding to the U.S. territory -- while heading to the U.S. territory of Guam earlier today, which North Korea has threatened with attack."

      "utterance": "The United States is on the same page, whether it's the White House, the state department, the department of defense, we're speaking with one voice. And the world is in fact speaking with one voice. Let's consider what is alarming. What is alarming, two ICBM tests in less than a month. Two nuclear tests that took place last year, it is a big deal what is going on. It's a concern to the world not just the United States. Those are alarming actions. They're provocative actions on the part of North Korea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Now Mark, the spokeswoman there saying one voice, but I think lots of people across America today are hearing a little bit of a dual message, hearing a much more reserved, measured response from Rex Tillerson, hearing something very different from President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK STEYN, THE FOX NEWS SPEACIALIST HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I don't really mind the fire and fury stuff, because being nice and diplomatic about a one man psycho has not really worked for the last 20 years, which is why we're in the situation we're in. And Trump's aim here, North Korea should never have gotten to go nuclear, and the trick now is whatever he does with North Korea is going to be the template that's applied to Iran, and Sudan, and Yemen, and whatever crazy states wants to go nuclear. So if fire and fury doesn't work, so what? Nothing else has worked. And if it does work, then, you know, that's something that's changed."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE BAKER, DILIGENCE LLC PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, to be clear, I mean, Mark is absolutely right when he talks about the fact that restrained talk, diplomatic language, sort of an appeasement policy of the past, almost 25 years, got us to this point. And this point being where North Korea has now realized its ambitions of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. So we have that going for us."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

And so I would take them at almost at their word at this point in their latest assessment, which puts them -- and now, do they have the reentry capability? In other words, they could put a miniaturized weapon. They have that onto a ballistic missile. They have that. Can it survive reentry into the atmosphere? Well, that's the least of the list that they have to go through. But again, I find it interesting, sort of the fire and fury conversation and the fact that -- you know, this situation, the least of our problems right now is President Trump's verbiage."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right."

      "speaker": "BAKER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I see. I see. I see. But Chris, you know, certainly, again, I agree with Mike. The verbiage and the rhetoric is the least of our problems. The reality is so many administrations have failed to have any action at all around North Korea, so the options are so limited at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIGALL",
      "utterance": "Yeah. This is exactly where I think so many Trump voters were excited about the appointment of a guy named Mad Dog. In my view, General Mattis is the guy that needs to do exactly what he did today. And here's the headline from the New York Post this afternoon, Mattis to North Korea, stand down or we will destroy you. I think President Trump if he wishes could say nothing and just let Mattis do the heavy lifting on this and send a clear message. I'll call the shot. I'll make the decision. But I clearly got guys in my corner that are ready to act if you won't stand down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think the rhetoric actually makes a huge difference, because it sounded like he was potentially drawing a red line, saying if you threaten us again, fire and fury, that means do something about it. And then they came out and said, yeah, we're going to get Guam. Does that mean we look like we're bluffing? When you say something like that it could easily interpreted as a red line. So it's not the rhetorical but the rhetoric itself, but the actual implications."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Can I ask you this, Kat. I think that's a very fair point. Yeah, we can't just be talking for the sake of talking. It has to be backed up with action if we're going to put that out there. But some people I think feel, like you've said, President Trump kind of dialing it up with the rhetoric and provoking possibly. But, I don't know, I kind of see North Korea being the provocateur here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah, you know -- they are. Of course, they are. But, you know, us versus North Korea, who wins the morality contest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "But they just threatened to nuke Guam."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Ad we're arguing about whether the president is being too mean- spirited. I mean, what's the point here? Guam is just a territory. If they would threaten to nuke an actual state, we'd get serious about it? When you were talking about the callers on your radio show, Eboni, we're splitting hairs here. We're arguing about whether they can merely nuke Guam or whether they can nuke Cleveland?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "And there's no point arguing about where on that continuum we are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Mark raises a really good point at the beginning, which also is getting kind of very little coverage right now, because nobody really wants to think about it. Much like we didn't want to think about North Korea developing this capability, which is that if you allow a nation to do what they want to do, and we did over a period of years. No doubt about it. Our foreign policy didn't work. Then, they will reach their end game and you shut down your options."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",

      "utterance": "Great point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "And so, we have to be very careful about how we deal with this right now. We don't want to be bellicose. I agree with you about the verbiage and about the rhetoric, and the words have to mean something. But we have to understand that aside from the sanctions, aside from being aggressive now, it's time to stop being overly diplomatic with China. We have to be very aggressive with China in explaining that this is one of those few occasions where we have mutual shared interests. We have to think very seriously about the very few options we have from a military perspective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Mike, do you think this moment is kind of the -- not kind of, if the indicator of what national security under President Trump is going to feel like and look like and sound like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean -- it's a very interesting question. But to be fair, we are here because of the last handful of administrations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Oh, sure. I'm not faulting the president. I'm just asking like you think this is an indicator, like we're connecting the dots around -- it's North Korea today. Is it Iran, is it all of these others."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Well, President Trump maybe unfortunate in the sense that he is sitting in the chair."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIGALL",
      "utterance": "Frankly after this, China. As you bring up, China really seems to have been missing this discussion so far. And where do they come down on this should we act?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "It suits China to have North Korea where it is. And its suits -- and North Korea suits every other nation because it sending the crazy countries in the world, of which there are dozens, the message that if you go nuclear, America can't touch you. That's a bad message."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "That they want respect, right? That's why they want to go nuclear on the first."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "They want to play with the big dogs. And certainly, I think the engagement makes them feel good about that level. But China, to me, they have been the greatest enablers of North Korea's ability to get to this level. And that's why I really feel some kind of wave, really towards the continued efforts -- and correct me if I'm wrong here, Mike, to kind to continue to engage them, to kind of play along with us -- I mean, at what point do we have to stop that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Well, no doubt -- we have to continue that. We can't stop that. We have to understand that we may be getting to a point, and China I think is signaling with that vote over the weekend, for the U.S. draft and resolution, that they realize there's a shift here, there's a problem here. And I think they're starting to see that, yes, it was in their advantage to enable North Korea for a long time. It may not be in their advantage now in the very short term. And I think we will see, if we're smart in how we play China, I think we'll see them come to the table with a different mindset and we have to be aggressive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIGALL",
      "utterance": "To that point, Mike, would it be maybe taking Japan aside and saying what can we do help you? Maybe arm you up a little bit, start strengthening the neighbors. Maybe China takes interest then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "That's all part and parcel of it, right? And that's the difficult part of this. If we talk about things as if it's this or it's that, or it's this. It's all these things. It's the sanctions. It's working with China very aggressively. It's dealing with our allies. It's getting the missile defense system back into South Korea. They have a very progressive president who put the kibosh on that. Kibosh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it's a technical term."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "That's what we've been going wrong, you put the kibosh. The problem though, when you say can't we persuade Japan to militarize and everything? We have a ridiculous situation where the world's wealthiest nations can't defend themselves, and absolute economic basket cases whose GDP is barely measurable are becoming nuclear powers. How long do you think that arrangement is going to last?"
    },

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "We can defend ourselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I don't think anyone is saying that this is a good situation. I also don't really think it's that surprising because we've seen North Korea talk like this, when there's been sanction in the past. What they're looking for is respect, and that's why they have this nuclear program that they're developing. And when we respond to that by sanctioning them and sort of like grounding them, that doesn't make you feel very respected. It makes you feel like a child, and then they're lashing out with their little temper tantrums. We have"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry. We've always had a carrot and stick approach with them, right? They rattled the cage and throw the teddy out of the cot and we do something, and then eventually they get something in return, or China gets something in return. And so, the problem is now, here we are. We're at the end of the road. They've got what they want essentially. And so, the game has changed. We can't continue that process unless we're willing to say, I don't mind. We don't care if little Kim has weapons that are capable of reaching the U.S. if we're OK with that, then fine. Let's step back and focus on other things."
    },
    {

And Comey himself said that Trump told him if there's something going on with my campaign as it relates to Russia, let's get to the bottom of it. I know this continues to be this cloud of Russian conspiracy surrounding Trump. But if Manafort has done something, I feel like Trump pushed all along, let's get to the bottom of it.

At the same time, you know, I'm a law and order guy, right? So, I don't see necessarily why it creates all the angst to say, you know, I'm in favor of immigration, but at the same time, I'm in favor of orderly immigration. I don't know, you know, where that line is. It's way above my paygrade. But, when they start talking about simply trying -- here's where I think I can speak best to. The kerfuffle over better vetting of potential people coming in from war-torn states, chaotic states, right, that turned into such a chaotic mess when they were talking about it.

Something that I found since Donald Trump started talking about this issue. Blue-collar Democrats, working-class Democrats, particularly those on construction sites are deeply, deeply concerned about illegal immigrants taking their work and undercutting their wages.

We have another trillion dollars in health care costs that we're going to owe for the Afghan War. So let's bring it to a close. People might not like the idea of using contractors for that. Let's get used to that idea. It's better than having American soldiers there endlessly. Are we going to be having this conversation in another 10 years?"

Give it to Erik Prince and the private contractor world and we'll be having this conversation in another 10 years because for proper motive, they're going to stay there as long as possible. Look, this is at full disclosure. I've got intelligence and security company. And we moved into Iraq in 2003, had a very large operation there, 700 people. And, yes, we made good jack off of that, right? I mean, so, I can't believe I just said that. But, you know, what I mean, we made cash."

And so we were there when they were trying to form a private contractors association. What does all this mean? What are the rules of engagement? How do you do this? They serve a very important function. But it's a support function. If we decide that being in Afghanistan is important, then that's a job for the U.S. military, the finest fighting force in the world. And yes, U.S. private contractors did provide support logistically and information support and other, you know, security support. But, to turn it over, and I say this being in the commercial world of security and intelligence, turning it over to private contractors, I think, would be a serious mistake."

If we -- again, if we decide and we've all been in Afghanistan much longer than anybody wants to be, and we should have seen this coming. This is one of those cases where we never seem to learn from history, right? We spent a great deal of time trying to get the Soviets out of there. And if you had said at that time, guess what, U.S. is going to be in here for 16 years. Everyone would've thought you were crazy."

You know, the NATO occupation in Afghanistan is responsible for 98% of that country's GDP. And a prominent -- a very prominent Australian politician said to me just last year that the problem with -- when he was there, is that there's a crusade of fault mentality. Everyone's locked up in the basis. They're enjoying Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King on the base. And outside, all the crazy guys are just running around. If you subcontract the war to private contractors, that's all you'll get and nothing else. You either got to get out or you've got actually rethink the way you fight, isn't it?"

After all these years and all the blood that we've spilled, all the treasures that's been expanded there, the Afghan people in general, they don't have a clue with some pseudo-federal system of government. What are you talking about? And we suffered from sort of this desire to do better and to do the right thing. And that's -- God bless, America because we do want to do it. And we tend to, OK, we make a mistake, we self- correct. But in Afghanistan, I'm here to tell you, at the very outset of that, when we finish up that exercise in Tora Bora and we started, you know, doing other things and then next thing you know we had a presence in Afghanistan."

And what I love about it, it's the only song as far as I know about an electrician working for the county.
