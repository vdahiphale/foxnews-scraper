      "sentences": "We start tonight with a massive stunning development that should have Hillary Clinton very worried tonight. The Daily Beast reporting the Department of Justice has in fact reopened the investigation into Clinton's server scandal. Now, according to that report, investigators are now gathering information about how Clinton and her top aides handled classified information including questions about how much classified information passed through her unsecure server? Who put the information onto the server? Which investigators knew about all of this and when did they know about this? Also breaking tonight, John Solomon, who will join us from The Hill, reporting that the FBI has also opened a brand new investigation as it relates to the Clinton Foundation and they are trying to determine whether or not any pay for play occurred while Hillary Clinton was serving as Secretary of State. We have been saying and I have been saying on this program 2018 will be the year that all of these scandals boomerang back on the left, the media, the Democratic Party and tonight it's all beginning to unfold. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now for example, take tonight's new information about the Clinton server scandal and couple that with the DOJ, now looking into the Uranium One Scandal. And we are also learning that the DOJ will give house investigators access to all of the documents and all of the witnesses in the Russia investigation and the dossier investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, all this means -- all this information about the Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda, that fake news salacious dossier, Russian dossier, will finally now see the light of day. You have got to buckle up. It's going to get very interesting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, also tonight -- we will get back to that in a minute. Look, if you don't work or live inside the mainstream media and their giant, well, incestuous almost like bubble, well then you might have seen that the economy under President Trump is on an absolute tear. This is good news for forgotten men and women in this country. Take a look at these numbers Dow Jones, now, soared today to over 25,000 -- its highest number ever. The job market continues to boom. ADP reporting today 250,000 new jobs created in December alone which is the most in nine months for that survey. And take a look at this headline. Job cut announcements in 2017 -- see the lowest level since 1990, Challenger Report says. And here is another headline, Manufacturing in the U.S. just accelerated to its best year since 2004. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And earlier today, the president is moving to now open up offshore drilling, that's right, off the coast, both coasts and in the Gulf, which is vital to America becoming energy independent, the life blood of our economy. And that's just only some of the good news from this week alone. Unemployment, a 17-year low, 4.1 percent under President Trump, before the 250,000 jobs, 1.7 million jobs were created. That's now 2 million jobs. African-American unemployment in America is now at a 17-year low. Food stamp use is at 7-year low, 2 million fewer people using food stamps now under President Trump in one year. Home prices are up six percent. The Trump administration has now taken a chainsaw to burdensome regulation from our government and for every new one they created, in terms of regulation, 16 have been slashed and cut away. There is GDP so far, we have seen two quarters of over three percent growth. And, remember, Barack Obama, the only president in the history of this country to never reach three percent GDP growth for an entire year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, here's what the media will never tell you. Well, there is a night and day difference between the economy just a year ago and now under Donald Trump for one year. And under Obama's economy I will remind you it was God-awful. Lowest labor participation rates since the 1970s, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the worst economic recovery since the 1940s, the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, 13 million more Americans on food stamps. 8 million more on poverty, 43 million total living in poverty under Obama. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In just one year the economy is now turning around and that's before the $1.5 trillion historic tax cut even had a chance to take effect. All good news for us. And liberals, the media, they said, \"Oh, the tax cuts are going to be terrible for the economy. It's only going to benefit corporations.\" By the way, corporations don't pay taxes. It turns out to be a big fat lie. They pass the cost onto us. companies like, look, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Southwest Airlines and others, American Airlines, Fifth Third Bank, even Comcast the parent company of Conspiracy TV MSNBC. Wow, because of the tax cut they have given their employees $1,000 bonuses and pay raises. Other companies have said they will invest now billions back into the U.S. economy, build factories and manufacturing centers and hire new employees. Not to mention you, the American people, will soon start to see money in your paychecks where it belongs. It's all because of what -- this tax bill that the media said was god-awful. It just shows you how clueless and how the media lies to you daily and frankly how much they hate President Trump. They have this Trump-hating obsession which I told you about last night, which means that they will do and say anything to try and hurt him on a daily basis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me tell you how it works because I told you all about CNN, he actually called them a demented liar and then conspiracy TV, NBC has to say, \"No that's not enough. He is not only demented is he deranged and a pathological liar,\" and they talk to each other. What we have now is a media so corrupt -- they are all a bunch of sheep. They are brain-dead. They are hypnotized and it's like watching a horror movie unfold before our eyes. Remember, only days ago the media wanted to you believe we were on the verge of nuclear war with North Korea. Why is that? Because unlike his predecessors, President Trump refused to be an appeaser and capitulate to the threats of Kim Jong Un in North Korea. Watch the media's hysterical coverage as they lie to you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "We start tonight with a massive stunning development that should have Hillary Clinton very worried tonight. The Daily Beast reporting the Department of Justice has in fact reopened the investigation into Clinton's server scandal. Now, according to that report, investigators are now gathering information about how Clinton and her top aides handled classified information including questions about how much classified information passed through her unsecure server? Who put the information onto the server? Which investigators knew about all of this and when did they know about this? Also breaking tonight, John Solomon, who will join us from The Hill, reporting that the FBI has also opened a brand new investigation as it relates to the Clinton Foundation and they are trying to determine whether or not any pay for play occurred while Hillary Clinton was serving as Secretary of State. We have been saying and I have been saying on this program 2018 will be the year that all of these scandals boomerang back on the left, the media, the Democratic Party and tonight it's all beginning to unfold. Now for example, take tonight's new information about the Clinton server scandal and couple that with the DOJ, now looking into the Uranium One Scandal. And we are also learning that the DOJ will give house investigators access to all of the documents and all of the witnesses in the Russia investigation and the dossier investigation. Now, all this means -- all this information about the Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda, that fake news salacious dossier, Russian dossier, will finally now see the light of day. You have got to buckle up. It's going to get very interesting. Now, also tonight -- we will get back to that in a minute. Look, if you don't work or live inside the mainstream media and their giant, well, incestuous almost like bubble, well then you might have seen that the economy under President Trump is on an absolute tear. This is good news for forgotten men and women in this country. Take a look at these numbers Dow Jones, now, soared today to over 25,000 -- its highest number ever. The job market continues to boom. ADP reporting today 250,000 new jobs created in December alone which is the most in nine months for that survey. And take a look at this headline. Job cut announcements in 2017 -- see the lowest level since 1990, Challenger Report says. And here is another headline, Manufacturing in the U.S. just accelerated to its best year since 2004. And earlier today, the president is moving to now open up offshore drilling, that's right, off the coast, both coasts and in the Gulf, which is vital to America becoming energy independent, the life blood of our economy. And that's just only some of the good news from this week alone. Unemployment, a 17-year low, 4.1 percent under President Trump, before the 250,000 jobs, 1.7 million jobs were created. That's now 2 million jobs. African-American unemployment in America is now at a 17-year low. Food stamp use is at 7-year low, 2 million fewer people using food stamps now under President Trump in one year. Home prices are up six percent. The Trump administration has now taken a chainsaw to burdensome regulation from our government and for every new one they created, in terms of regulation, 16 have been slashed and cut away. There is GDP so far, we have seen two quarters of over three percent growth. And, remember, Barack Obama, the only president in the history of this country to never reach three percent GDP growth for an entire year. Now, here's what the media will never tell you. Well, there is a night and day difference between the economy just a year ago and now under Donald Trump for one year. And under Obama's economy I will remind you it was God-awful. Lowest labor participation rates since the 1970s, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the worst economic recovery since the 1940s, the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years, 13 million more Americans on food stamps. 8 million more on poverty, 43 million total living in poverty under Obama. In just one year the economy is now turning around and that's before the $1.5 trillion historic tax cut even had a chance to take effect. All good news for us. And liberals, the media, they said, \"Oh, the tax cuts are going to be terrible for the economy. It's only going to benefit corporations.\" By the way, corporations don't pay taxes. It turns out to be a big fat lie. They pass the cost onto us. companies like, look, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Southwest Airlines and others, American Airlines, Fifth Third Bank, even Comcast the parent company of Conspiracy TV MSNBC. Wow, because of the tax cut they have given their employees $1,000 bonuses and pay raises. Other companies have said they will invest now billions back into the U.S. economy, build factories and manufacturing centers and hire new employees. Not to mention you, the American people, will soon start to see money in your paychecks where it belongs. It's all because of what -- this tax bill that the media said was god-awful. It just shows you how clueless and how the media lies to you daily and frankly how much they hate President Trump. They have this Trump-hating obsession which I told you about last night, which means that they will do and say anything to try and hurt him on a daily basis. Let me tell you how it works because I told you all about CNN, he actually called them a demented liar and then conspiracy TV, NBC has to say, \"No that's not enough. He is not only demented is he deranged and a pathological liar,\" and they talk to each other. What we have now is a media so corrupt -- they are all a bunch of sheep. They are brain-dead. They are hypnotized and it's like watching a horror movie unfold before our eyes. Remember, only days ago the media wanted to you believe we were on the verge of nuclear war with North Korea. Why is that? Because unlike his predecessors, President Trump refused to be an appeaser and capitulate to the threats of Kim Jong Un in North Korea. Watch the media's hysterical coverage as they lie to you."

The media could barely control themselves over the Bannon story and you can bet they will drag this our as long as possible until the next crisis they create comes along. And if it's nuclear war coming, two days later they'll forget about it. Here is the thing when it comes to the media in this country. Their biased abusive attacks against this president are unprecedented. But you know what, in a way, they have always shown their liberal bias. The media has been an extension of the Democratic party for decades. Here's the proof. They have a long history of breathless, hysterical reporting but only when conservatives or Republicans are occupying the White House. The media has also bent over backwards to praise the presidents they so love adore and worship like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, people that appease murdering dictators and despots. Now, let's start with President Ronald Reagan, this is where our history lesson begins tonight, back in 1984. You might remember, it was a microphone check.

But then, it was way too much for the media, the liberal media to handle since they prefer the policies of let's see bowing and kissing rings and appeasement. Here's a quote from the New York Times describing Reagan's speech, quote: \"In the long run, however, the greater danger lies in Mr. Reagan's vision of the super power relationship as good versus evil and his near proclamation of holy war against evil empire.\" Well, it turns out the so-called paper of record, just like the rest of the liberal media was completely wrong. If media followed the advice the Soviet Union, who knows might still be standing. Next remember George W. Bush, he labeled rightly so Iran, Iraq, and North Korea the axis of evil. You may remember this. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT, JAN. 29, 2002: North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens. Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop Anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world."

Bush's speech immediately thereafter. \"Response to terror: Has Bush overstated North Korean threat?\" \"Allies hear sour note in 'axis of evil' chorus.\" And even years later the media is still attacking Bush's speech. Take a look at these examples from the Media Research Center. ANDREA MITCHELL, MSNBC, JAN. 28, 2014: Up until that moment, Iran was cooperating with the United States on the border of Afghanistan. It was post 9/11. Iran was more or less an American ally. By being included in the axis of evil it turned the Iranian government in a completely different direction. It was a turning point in American politics and in foreign policy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, ABC NEWS, OCT. 9, 2006: When Kim's father Kim Il Sung feared the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in his country, that fear was reinforced 50 years later when the U.S. labeled North Korea part of an access of evil with Iran and Iraq. Kim Jong Il feared he would be next after Iraq."

And as for the media, well, they can't stand the kind of tough and direct acknowledgment that America does have enemies, that there is evil in our time. Apparently they would rather their presidents bending down and kissing the rings and bowing and kissing the feet of murdering dictators. Let's go back to the early 1990s, Bill Clinton sucked up groveling to Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il and giving billions in energy subsidies allowing North Korea to keep their nuclear fuel rods, and then goes on TV and tells you, \"This is a great deal for the American people.\" What a lie that was. Take a look. BILL CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT, OCT. 21, 1994: This is a good deal for the United States. North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program. South Korea and our other allies will be better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. South Korea, with support from Japan and other nations will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy it is losing. And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so, will North Korea fully join the community of nations."

Watch this. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT, JULY 14, 2015: Today, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not, a comprehensive long-term deal with Iran that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The media, they didn't care about any of this. They were quick to heap praise on Obama, the peace-prize winner. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"GMA\"/ABC, JULY 14. 2015: The U.S. and world powers reaching a major agreement with Iran blocking one of our biggest rivals from developing a nuclear weapon.

This agreement is supposed to freeze that country's pursuit of a nuclear weapon.

According to Solomon, FBI agents in Little Rock, Arkansas where the foundation was started have taken the lead in this investigation and have already interviewed at least one witness in the last month and additional activities are expected in coming weeks. A huge development tonight. John Solomon joins us along with Fox News contributor and investigative reporter Sara Carter.

And I think tonight we are seeing the first evidence of that coming true. FBI agents in Little Rock interviewed a witness who had information about pay-to-play allegations against the foundation. And senior law enforcement officials told me -- multiple officials told me that there is an ongoing active investigation. And I remember Sarah being on this show months ago predicting that this was still open and something lurking out there that would come back and I think she turned out to be right."

There are a lot of senior FBI agents, a lot of people not just in Little Rock but in New York and in Florida and other places where they have been investigating the Clinton Foundation who are breathing a breath of fresh air right now and are really taking heart to what's going on in Little Rock.

John, you are also reporting Comey's original Clinton memo released nine separate versions?"

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Well, there were five separate instances in the original memo where he used the term gross negligence which is the felony standard for mishandling and all of those were edited out. There is something that goes to the spirited debate you just had with Dr. Gorka and Mr. Rivera. In the original memo, Comey wrote that there was pretty clear and convincing evidence that the -- excuse me, extreme likelihood -- realistic likelihood that her server really had been penetrated by foreign powers but that got edited out, too. It's amazing what got edited out. If you read the original version and what was originally released, it seems like two different documents."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So he -- you are saying that Comey believed that Clinton's server in the mom and pop bathroom closet had been infiltrated with top secret, special access program, classified information and foreign agencies got a hold of it?"

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "He said it was reasonably likely that that had happened. And that is something that we didn't hear in the press conference, right. So, these edits are more significant.

      "utterance": "And why did he write the exoneration months before the investigation which is part of it. Let's go to the Daily Beast. Sarah, I'll ask you, the Department of Justice also reopened now. Now that we know that the exoneration which John is reporting about and the original copies now are out, now they are reporting Department of Justice also has opened that investigation into the server again and I agree with Dr. Gorka. It's about the rule of law. What do you know?"

This was what was promised by the Department of Justice, remember months ago everybody was concerned, but they weren't talking about it publicly. And I think now what we are seeing is a trickling out of all of these investigations, Sean, which are going to be ongoing throughout the year. And I want to go back to something that John just said, you know, this is reason why intent was not important. When you think of Comey and intent and gross negligence and all these words and extremely careless, the fact that foreign agents, foreign states may have more than likely penetrated Hillary Clinton's e-mail server is the reason why gross negligence is the law because we don't want people getting our classified information, particularly foreign states. And that's why it is so extremely important. But the fact that she wasn't held to the same standards as Christian Saucier and others is something that we have to question and something that needs to be --"

Now, why would we ever -- why would Hillary, Eric Holder -- why would know -- Robert Mueller knew that Putin wanted to get a foothold in the uranium industry in America? And he had his thugs in this country bribing, extorting, money laundering, racketeering the whole bit and kick backs. Why would America -- why would anybody ever sign off on giving a foreign entity control of uranium when we don't have enough uranium? On the surface, does that make any sense to you at all?"

He tweeted out this ad begging to be considered the dishonest and corrupt media awards, which will be announced by President Trump next Monday. And we're going to have our own awards tomorrow. Now, according to the poster, Colbert, he's gunning for the fakest dishonesty award. He may just get it. I still hate the show. Good luck, Stephen.
