      "utterance": "The response that we are going to start a trade war is nonsense. We have a very, very imbalanced relationship with China. The president is beyond engaged. He cares about jobs and wages. Politics never comes up. When he is not thinking about jobs and wages, it's wages and jobs."

We don't want to make America 1930 again, and the forgotten men and women of America don't want to be drafted into trade war. If you own a steel mill, today was great for you. If you consume steel, and every American family at the store tonight bought something that has different metals in it, today is a bad day for you."

      "utterance": "Look, I don't know that you would find unanimity in the Democratic party on this. I think there are a lot of Democrats out there who support free trade and who are very nervous about a trade war. I thought Senator Sasse's point there was interesting. If you are a steel manufacturer, you are happy tonight. If you are a steel consumer, hold on to your horses because things are about to get rocky. The last time we had one of these, in 2002 when President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on steel, we saw not just threats of retaliation from the E.U. on the American agricultural sector, so American farmers ought to be sweating it right now. But you also saw manufacturing plants that are consumers of steel put out reports talking about how they had to lay off 200,000 American workers and jack up their prices. There's going to be a lot of political alliances for and against this."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

The President did this. If you are against it, you consider it a crime of opportunity. The president had a couple aides who were for it and they pushed this through. But now they will try to sweat it out, do we take out Canada, do we take out Europe? That's going to make a huge difference."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't know where to start with what happened yesterday. For the president to sit there and essentially punch the NRA in the nose multiple times while essentially downplaying their importance, saying directly he doesn't necessarily need them, and then for him to have Dianne Feinstein, Senator Dianne Feinstein, she was jumping for joy quite literally out of her seat, resubmit her ban on a number of semiautomatic rifles which the Clinton Justice Department said did nothing to combat crime numbers when it came to criminals who are using firearms in crimes, did nothing to actually reduce the number of mass shootings in this country, I have talked to a number of NRA members today who are saying we are willing to give the president a pass on the number of things but the Second Amendment and caving to the emotions of this, the do something attitude when this was a failure at the local level and at the federal level in terms of law enforcement, it's a redline for us. We're not going to go there."

      "utterance": "I don't know if this plays into primary politics. I am old enough to remember when one of the number one talking points against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton was the Democrats are going to come and illegally seize your guns. Yesterday the president of the United States sat there and said seize the guns first, due process later. A Republican president has gone further to talk about illegally seizing firearms than any Democratic president ever has."

    {
      "speaker": "ALLEN",
      "utterance": "Something does get done, but very minimalist. The calculation up here is that whatever credit Republicans would get for going further on guns than they have in the past, they would pay more of a price with their own people. So it's going to be a couple things, nothing like what the president was talking about. They really told him that around the table. They said not this time."
