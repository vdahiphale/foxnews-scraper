It did not have leaders that had a common connection to the kind of people I grew up with. Mark, I grew up dirt-poor in South Arkansas. I'm the first male in my entire family lineage to graduate high school much less go to college. For me, the American dream is not something I read about from someone else, I've lived it. My dad was one of the Americans like a lot of fathers who raise kids that he lifted heavy things. He worked hard, he got his hands dirty. That's the only jobs he ever knew. I felt like those were the people that Republicans, their policies would help the most if we implemented them, but we acted like they didn't exist, and the result long-term was that the economic policies of true conservatism and capitalism, really bringing people to a point of liberty, where they were not forever completely enslaved to their group, but they were looked at as individuals, me this is the fundamental difference between conservatives and liberals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Liberals believe you're in a group, you have to stay in your group, don't leave your group.

I think in this White House, it's certainly intense in a way that we've never seen before, but she's got a very calm demeanor, and I think that's what people admire, whether it's sitting at the Correspondents' Dinner and have someone just intentionally try to destroy her, she maintained dignity and grace or whether it's at the podium every day where people try to accuse her of all sorts of things, and try to take her podium away from her, she never lets that happen, but she does it in a calm way, doesn't escalate the tension, but she knows how to just say, \"We're not going there.\"",

Up close and personal, and every single issue that is faced by the people of our nation, you can put a name and a face on it, because you're dealing with people from birth to death, the best and the worst moments of their lives and you have a perspective of everything from poverty to the challenges of health care. There's nothing you don't see."

Nobody would ever accept somebody who's coming from a pastoral background into politics, but I came believe that it was a terrific preparation, better than being a lawyer or insurance executive or whatever. And so long, thoughtful process, and I said, let's do it, that was back in 1991. My first race was for the US Senate. I lost. I ran the next year in '93."

In the Senate, for example, there were four out of the 35 members of the Senate who were Republican, and frankly, those four were a little suspect. My door was nailed shut on the day I was sworn in as lieutenant governor at the State Capitol. Sworn in at the order of Web Hubbell who working at the White House for Clinton at the time, and they were so angry that a Republican had been elected during Bill Clinton's first year as President, that they just said, \"You've got to stop this guy.\" So my door was nailed shut and stayed nail shut for 59 days until finally, there was such a public outcry, they took the nails out of the door.

And here I was only the fourth Republican to be elected to a state-run office in 150 years, first in 25 years, and now the state's got a Republican governor following the conviction of their Democrat governor. It t was a very, very challenging time, but it was also the greatest period of my life.

And he was willing to let Republican governors try things. Welfare reform came out of the states. It didn't come out of Washington. There were things that we did in children's health care in Arkansas that preceded the idea of S-CHIP. But the way we wanted to build it was that it required paying, it wasn't just a welfare program where you get 100% of your benefits for free. You had a premium, you had a co-pay, you had a deductible. Why is that important? Because if people have skin in the game, they take a totally different attitude towards something than if it's all free and they don't care whether it costs $1,000.00 or $100.00. Those are the kind of innovations that you could you do at the state level and to his credit, as President, Clinton said, \"Give it a shot.\""

It did not have leaders that had a common connection to the kind of people I grew up with. Mark, I grew up dirt-poor in South Arkansas. I'm the first male in my entire family lineage to graduate high school much less go to college. For me, the American dream is not something I read about from someone else, I've lived it. My dad was one of the Americans like a lot of fathers who raise kids that he lifted heavy things. He worked hard, he got his hands dirty. That's the only jobs he ever knew. I felt like those were the people that Republicans, their policies would help the most if we implemented them, but we acted like they didn't exist, and the result long-term was that the economic policies of true conservatism and capitalism, really bringing people to a point of liberty, where they were not forever completely enslaved to their group, but they were looked at as individuals, me this is the fundamental difference between conservatives and liberals. Liberals believe you're in a group, you have to stay in your group, don't leave your group. And if the group does okay, you could do okay. Conservatives believe that our liberty is individual, it's God-given to each person. There are no limits except the limits I'm willing to place on myself because I just refuse to accept the freedom that I've been given, and so I felt like in '08 that we were missing the opportunity, and we were a great party, if you were sitting in the corner office, but we were not a good party if you were standing on the concrete floor eight hours a day lifting heavy things and going home and having to take a shower before your wife lets you sit at the table."

But why would I go and attack one of the other people on that stage? Because if they won, then I was going to have to go to the convention stage and tell everybody how great they would be as President after just telling them they would be terrible. At some point that doesn't make sense to me. Those were not the people that I was trying to oppose. Secondly, I may not be the smartest bulb in the chandelier but I'm bright enough to know this that if you attack Donald Trump, he's going to come back at you and he's going to hit you harder than you ever hit him, and when you're ready to give up in the fight, he isn't, and he keeps clubbing you until you are unconscious and in a coma and can't come out of it. And so I watched all the guys on the stage, they go after Trump. And the next thing you know, they get a nickname they're stuck with the rest of their lives. He pummels them and the press love it so much that they just give him more airtime, so I thought, \"I've seen this movie, it doesn't end well.\""

Yes, we're as different as night and day, but there's things that I admired about him. I admired his candor, his transparency, and quite frankly, one of the things that I've admired about him, is that he did not get where he is politically in the normal way of being beholden to all the special interests who completely own most of the politicians in Washington, and that's why nothing changes. Democrats get elected, things stay the same. Republicans get elected, things stay the same. Because the same people who are throwing dollar bills at the Democrats are throwing dollar bills at the Republicans and the Democrats alike and get the same policies over and over. Trump has upset this whole, this cabaret, if you will, and has changed the tune so dramatically, that's why I really believe he's the right man for the right time."

He said he was going to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the embassy and he's done it. He said he was going to be tough with NATO and tell them that either pay up or we bug out, and he's done it, and they're doing it.

Biblically, I could say it this way, the dry bones have come alive, and the desert is blooming, and literally places that I saw as abject desert now are lush with vegetation that exports fruits and vegetables across the world. But Israel is a very special place. As a person of faith for me, Israel is not just another piece of real estate; maybe the most hotly contested piece of real estate on earth, but it has Biblical dimensions, Biblical connections and that's important to me. I think the title deed goes all the way back to Abraham. So to see a President recognize the rightful home of the Jewish people and the Jewish state and Jerusalem as its capital, and by the way, Jerusalem has only been capital to one people in the history of the earth, and that's to the Jews.

But they like someone who sticks by the black and the white, or the right and the wrong and what they stand for. So Donald Trump, and I had this conversation, and I said to him, \"Mr. President, there are two things evangelicals consider nonnegotiable -- the sanctity of human life, and the second thing is unwavering commitment to the sovereignty of Israel as a Jewish state.\" And he kind of was surprised by that, and I said, \"Mr. President, we're people of the book, and we believe that if God has made a promise, He's going to keep it, and one of the promises is that nations that bless Israel will be blessed and those who curse Israel will be cursed,\" and I just believe that when Donald Trump made this decision, and he was under so much pressure not to do it, Mark, and you know that, you know this very well -- pressure from within the country, pressure from all over the world and world leaders. And later after he had done it, had the opportunity to say, \"What was the deciding force?\" He said, \"Because it was the right thing to do and I said I was going to do it.\" I was so refreshed by a President who is able to say it's the right thing to do, and I said I was going to do it.

I don't think they get that, but there's an anger and a resentment and it's personal, it's not political.

I think in this White House, it's certainly intense in a way that we've never seen before, but she's got a very calm demeanor, and I think that's what people admire, whether it's sitting at the Correspondents' Dinner and have someone just intentionally try to destroy her, she maintained dignity and grace or whether it's at the podium every day where people try to accuse her of all sorts of things, and try to take her podium away from her, she never lets that happen, but she does it in a calm way, doesn't escalate the tension, but she knows how to just say, \"We're not going there.\""

We grew up as a family very tight knit, went through tough times and I think it made us strong, so while there's enough politics that people would expect, it's not that everything is a political discussion when our family is together."

If a reporter puts himself or herself into the story, that's no longer journalism. That's commentary, that's editorialism, and most of what we see, 90% of it has a tinge of being editorial content. I tell people all the time what I do, whether it's on TV or anywhere else, it's not journalism. I don't play a journalist on television. A lot of these people think they're journalists and they're not. When you use a Twitter account and you put your point of view into it, you've stepped across the line from journalism into advocacy, and the problem we have is that journalism has become a lost art and when the President says, \"You know, we have a lot of fake news,\" they get all up on their high horse and they take umbrage to it. What they should do is evaluate what they're saying, what they're writing and ask themselves, \"Am I a real journalist?\" Because a journalist just presents the facts, lets the reader or the listener make the determination of what those facts should mean."

It's insulting. It's insulting to the people who were murdered in the holocaust, and it's insulting, too, to those of us who believe that politics is something about which you can be passionate, but you shouldn't be stupid, and some of these people have just become stupid in pulling out analogies that are beyond the pale."

I would argue, and I've written about this that the Supreme Court, the judiciary generally acts outside of many cases of its constitutional boundaries. The Supreme Court is supposed to be independent, it's not supposed to be supreme of all the branches of government. So we've reached the point -- we don't need to get into how we got here, but here we are where the court is enormously powerful. Where one Justice can decide what is or is not a fundamental right, which is kind of bizarre, if you think about it, so we have this battle brewing over the Supreme Court. Now, whether Kavanaugh is a Clarence Thomas or not a Clarence Thomas, again, you've got a hundred organizations out there, turning him into this evil devilish figure. The left has really, whether it's Trump, whether it's Supreme Court nominees, whether it was Reagan, whatever it is, the left has really become extremely hostile to even our political processes, don't you think?"

What I look for, people say, \"I hope he appoints a conservative,\" and I said, \"I don't.\" I don't want him to appoint a conservative or a liberal, I want him to appoint a constitutionalist."

I want them to look at the text of the Constitution, what it meant when it was written and apply whatever law to that Constitution and strictly stay there. The Supreme Court and the entire judicial branch is exactly what you said. It is one of three equal branches, but it is not a superior branch to the other two. Jefferson even said that if there was a weaker branch, it would be the judicial because the Congress and the legislative branch has the power of the purse, the executive has the power of the sword. The judicial branch really has the power of neither, it only has the power of persuasion, but the judicial branch has become a legislative body. I want to say to people wearing black robes, \"If you want to be a legislator, take your robe off, resign that position and run for Congress, then can you be a legislator, but if you're sitting on the court, you don't get to make law, you get to simply look at the Constitution through the clearest most focused eyes you can, and forget whether it's conservative or liberal, but is it right or is it wrong in the context of the Constitution.\""

We talk about originalism, we talk about textualism and if you have a nominee who says, \"Look, I believe in applying the Constitution ...\" they'll need to at least say, \"No, no, no, precedent,\" because they like the activist precedent and except when they don't like the activist precedent. So, they view the court do, they not, as a way to advance their agenda? Particularly their social agenda. It seems like the Supreme Court is a nationalized cultural and social issues."

So, they couldn't win it legislatively, so they go in the judiciary. Didn't they say, but we can't let the judiciary, the very body that we believe should make these decisions ever change these decisions. Why not? If you live by the sword, you die by the sword. They don't see it that way. It's a truly hilarious almost beyond ironic approach that liberals have when it comes to they can't see their own irony, but there it is. What I think we should start looking at is if we want these changes, if we want them to be done, then do it the old-fashioned constitutional way. Sell the public on it. Get the votes in Congress or your state legislature, get it passed, get an executive branch who will sign it and carry it out. Let a court decide that it is in keeping with the Constitution that we live under, now you've gotten your agenda."

      "utterance": "We'll be right back. We talked about amending the Constitution, the old-fashioned way, there's two old-fashioned ways, really? There's a convention of states, Article V, which basically says that the state legislatures, rather than Congress, can propose to have a meeting, a convention, not a Constitutional Convention, a meeting, and the states can send delegates and they can discuss just as Congress would the Constitution whether or not should there should be amendments, and then it goes back through the ratification process. You still need 38 state legislatures or conventions, this is something you've endorsed?"

It's the only way we're ever going to be able to bring some real reform to our system because Congress is completely paralyzed -- paralyzed because of the money that controls it, paralyzed because of the political interests. People are more afraid of losing an election than they are losing their constitutional republic. So I strongly believe that a convention of the states empowers the people of America to get things done that they've long wanted, perhaps term limits, but never going to get it as long as we put it in the hands of Congress."

Is this not actually in the Constitution? It's part of the Constitution? It can't be a runaway convention, since it still takes 38 states to ratify whatever comes out of there. Isn't this a way to take our constitution as written and take it back?"

That's a conservative bedrock principle and what better way to make our government more responsive to the people at the most local level than the convention of the states which really listens to the people from the states. It's a high bar to overcome. It's not easy, and people say, \"Oh, it could go off the rails,\" not likely. I'd be more afraid they'd never get on the rails, not that it would go off."

That's why you can have your four justices, but beyond that you don't get any, so you have a quota system constitutionalists. Otherwise, we control things. Why do they fight so hard? Because they don't view it as a court, they view it as a sort of Politburo, a political operation that on high can order things. But this cuts under that.

People being hosed with fire hoses in the streets over racism, there were some bad things that happened in this country in the '60s and I though then, we may never make it another ten years, and we did. The one thing I have hope for is that ultimately, I think God has blessed this nation. I don't think we would be here without Him, and I also believe this, that this is a resilient country and sometimes, it goes through tough times and then its people wake up and we decide we are better than this and that is my hope for us now."
