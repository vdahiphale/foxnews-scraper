Fox News alert, an explosive college admissions scandal has landed two Hollywood actresses in big trouble with the law. Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among dozens of people charged in a $25 million bribery scheme. Authorities say rich parents bribed, cheated, and defrauded in order to get their kids into some of the country's most elite schools. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The alleged crimes include paying for someone to take their kids SAT's, paying an admissions consultant to bribed coaches into labeling their kids as recruited athletes to boost their chances, and also faking athletic profiles to make students look like strong athletes when they actually weren't. There is no evidence that school admissions were involved in any of the wrongdoing, the U.S. attorney in charge describing the bombshell allegations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Felicity Huffman, the actress, famed for her role in Desperate Housewives, of course, among 13 people due to appear this hour in the federal court behind me. She, as well as the actress Lori Loughlin are both one -- or two of dozens accused of taking part in what was a wide-ranging scheme, essentially to bribe and defraud the college admissions system to get their children into colleges that those parents presumably thought they otherwise would not be able to get into. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Felicity Huffman and her husband William H. Macy accused for instance of paying 15,000 to alter SAT test scores. Lori Loughlin and her husband, who is the designer, Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to have their two daughters labeled as recruits to the USC crew team. Neither of those daughters ever took part in that sport. So this was a wide-ranging scheme, one essentially run by a company that was run out of Newport Beach, California, by a man called William Singer. He pleaded guilty earlier today to racketeering. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we assume that he has given the feds much of the evidence on which all of these charges are based. So, we will now have these 13 here in L.A. arraigned. We have not seen Felicity Huffman at this point, although she should, by all logic, be inside the courthouse already. We have seen her husband, William H. Macy. He was asked if he wanted to comment on the case, his answer was no. Jesse.",

But to me, there's a bigger story here. As you know there's a lawsuit right now that's been put forward by conservatives using Asians to challenge affirmative action at Harvard. And in the course of that debate, here's what we found, Jesse. You know that, in fact, right now, if you look at it at selective schools, if you have a legacy, and that's what these people -- you know, these people we're talking about athletics, but legacies, in other words, if you went to the school and then applied for your kids, that's even bigger than athletics, 34 percent admitted five times higher than people whose parents did not go to school. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So if you went to Harvard, you're already rich entitled and famous, and now your kid applies, tremendous advantage especially if the kid has good enough grades, even a bigger boast.

Not the black kids, not the Asian kids, not the Hispanic kids. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the second point to make is athletics, if you have an athletic credential on your resume which is what these fraudsters were doing, they were putting pictures of the kids on the bodies of athletes and pushing it out there. But if you're an athlete, guess what, you have about a 50 percent boost in terms of your likelihood to get into a school. And just one last point, most of the athletes in America, despite you see the black basketball players, the black football players, it's not the black -- most college athletes are white, like 70 percent.

Fox News alert, an explosive college admissions scandal has landed two Hollywood actresses in big trouble with the law. Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among dozens of people charged in a $25 million bribery scheme. Authorities say rich parents bribed, cheated, and defrauded in order to get their kids into some of the country's most elite schools. The alleged crimes include paying for someone to take their kids SAT's, paying an admissions consultant to bribed coaches into labeling their kids as recruited athletes to boost their chances, and also faking athletic profiles to make students look like strong athletes when they actually weren't. There is no evidence that school admissions were involved in any of the wrongdoing, the U.S. attorney in charge describing the bombshell allegations."

      "speaker": "ANDREW LELLING, U.S. ATTORNEY",

We're not talking about donating a building so that a school is more likely to take your son or daughter. We're talking about deception and fraud, fake test scores, fake athletic credentials, fake photographs, bribed college officials."

      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Jesse, good afternoon to you. Felicity Huffman, the actress, famed for her role in Desperate Housewives, of course, among 13 people due to appear this hour in the federal court behind me. She, as well as the actress Lori Loughlin are both one -- or two of dozens accused of taking part in what was a wide-ranging scheme, essentially to bribe and defraud the college admissions system to get their children into colleges that those parents presumably thought they otherwise would not be able to get into. Felicity Huffman and her husband William H. Macy accused for instance of paying 15,000 to alter SAT test scores. Lori Loughlin and her husband, who is the designer, Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to have their two daughters labeled as recruits to the USC crew team. Neither of those daughters ever took part in that sport. So this was a wide-ranging scheme, one essentially run by a company that was run out of Newport Beach, California, by a man called William Singer. He pleaded guilty earlier today to racketeering. Now, we assume that he has given the feds much of the evidence on which all of these charges are based. So, we will now have these 13 here in L.A. arraigned. We have not seen Felicity Huffman at this point, although she should, by all logic, be inside the courthouse already. We have seen her husband, William H. Macy. He was asked if he wanted to comment on the case, his answer was no. Jesse."

And it's -- I think what really drives is it's the fairness issue, right? So you're like everybody in the world a human being is born. Fairness is like innate in you. And then help -- making money by helping rich people get their already privileged kids even more privileged so that they can make more money, seems like the system is rigged, like the system is working against you. And kudos to President Trump's FBI who went ahead and got these guys instead -- we're not going to put up with this anymore.

But to me, there's a bigger story here. As you know there's a lawsuit right now that's been put forward by conservatives using Asians to challenge affirmative action at Harvard. And in the course of that debate, here's what we found, Jesse. You know that, in fact, right now, if you look at it at selective schools, if you have a legacy, and that's what these people -- you know, these people we're talking about athletics, but legacies, in other words, if you went to the school and then applied for your kids, that's even bigger than athletics, 34 percent admitted five times higher than people whose parents did not go to school. So if you went to Harvard, you're already rich entitled and famous, and now your kid applies, tremendous advantage especially if the kid has good enough grades, even a bigger boast. So the most privileged kids in America, they get the biggest boost. Not the black kids, not the Asian kids, not the Hispanic kids. And the second point to make is athletics, if you have an athletic credential on your resume which is what these fraudsters were doing, they were putting pictures of the kids on the bodies of athletes and pushing it out there. But if you're an athlete, guess what, you have about a 50 percent boost in terms of your likelihood to get into a school. And just one last point, most of the athletes in America, despite you see the black basketball players, the black football players, it's not the black -- most college athletes are white, like 70 percent. And there are things like lacrosse, crew, ice hockey, I could go on."

And I had a NTSB - - a former NTSB investigator on The Daily Briefing today and he reminds us to be fact-based in our thinking. The flight recorder has been recovered. Boeing is -- has a team there on the way. The problem for people that are anxious about this is that we probably will not get conclusive reasons for this plane going down until Friday or Saturday. So you've got a whole week of people to be worried. But I think that because of the training that we have here in the United States, the pilots that we have, this has not happened here yet. There are a lot of these planes flying in America. Of course, people should be cautious. But, as of right now, I don't think there's any reason to ground them."

And if they could knock the stock price down a little bit and stick it to Boeing, they will. Now politicians are getting involved. Elizabeth Warren who is obviously running for president is calling for them to ground the fleet. Like Dana said, we need to get the facts first. They haven't completed the Ethiopian or the Indonesian study and to find out what's going on. I think we all have learned that we want to bring in the facts before we make a judgment. I don't think the FAA here in this country is going to ground an entire fleet if we don't have concrete evidence there's a manufacturing or design flaw. The New York Times is saying maybe some new computer software and some of these foreign pilots they don't have regulations where they need to have a specific amount of flight hours on this new system. The American pilots have to log a lot more hours on new systems and that could explain the discrepancy. But there hasn't been a fatal commercial airline crash for ten years in this country.

Split-second decisions are needed and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don't know about you, but I don't want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of the plane, exclamation point. He's had a call that was arranged yesterday with the CEO of Boeing, and it says it was only a coincidence that it took place after the tweet. We'll see what comes out of that.

We've seen people panic over nuclear power which is basically prevented us from embracing probably the cleanest technology in terms of energy for at least 40 to 50 years. We haven't been able to do anything with nuclear power because we freaked out, overblown freaking out over a few accidents. The argument in Trump's tweet is based on kind of like the whole Sully idea that, like, could Sully have landed the plane if he wasn't in control? Or was it human fault? Most people believe that a lot of these flights are human error. This is a debate that going to be raised when we get autonomous cars because whenever there's an accident people are going to freak out because the accidents are rare.
