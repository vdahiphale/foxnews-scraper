      "sentences": "When he says \"We are back\" first of all, has he seen the economic numbers? He means that he will continue the noble tradition of subverting U.S. sovereignty by selling out American workers to a world order where key decisions are made overseas with little to no accountability to the U.S. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } citizens here. Now the Obama gang is back, that's for sure. Samantha Powers, Ben Rhodes, Susan Rice and they intend to do whatever is necessary to reverse all the progress Trump's team made in holding NATO accountable for their military expenditures and China accountable for their anti-competitive trade practices. Here are the highlights of Biden's globalist shop of horrors. Buckle up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First, he will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. It should be noted that the U.S. has led the world in CO2 emissions reductions since it exited the Paris Climate Accord under Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Biden's decision to rejoin the agreement would mean severe damage to the American economy. When Obama first joined Paris he committed the U.S. to cut emissions 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 as part of this \"Accord.\" But Biden has promised to impose even more economically crippling climate policies. Meanwhile, China would continue to get sweetheart exemptions. In fact he CCP spent the four-year since a joint at the accord building more than 300 coal plants around the world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Second, Biden would rejoin the World Health Organization. Now after the fiasco with the W.H.O.'s work on the virus, Trump was right to put the relationship on ice. \"The New York Times\" on the day before the election even reported that as it in praise Beijing, the W.H.O. concealed concessions to China and may have sacrificed the best chance to unravel the virus' origin. It agreed not to examine China's early response or begin investigating the animal source. It could not even secure a visit to Wuhan, yet Biden wants to put the U.S. taxpayers back on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in the W.H.O.? Think about that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Third, he's going to reenter the Iran deal. Now the Iran deal was an absolute disaster so of course Biden wants to reenter it. It was supposed to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and improve our relationship with their terror-funding regime but instead it accomplished neither. The Iranians loved it though and why wouldn't they? We literally flew them planes loaded with cash which they likelihood used to fund more terrorists. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Fourth, Biden is also threatening to lift Trump's travel ban from the Jihadi hot spots around the world. So we will not only send Mueller's more spending money but we are going to let their agents into our cities? Biden should have called this foreign policy plan what it is, blow up better. Fifth, allowing NATO to keep ripping us off. Are they now off the hook or will Biden just refund all the member countries $130 billion Trump got them to pony up? My friends, Europe love a compliant United States so of course they love Clinton and Obama. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Except for John Paul II, Europe didn't like Reagan because he didn't take orders from him. They pretty much hated every Republican President for what the past 50 years or so. Brussels loves weak U.S. Presidents because it means international pressure will work even if it means a lower standard of living for average Americans as a result. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The E.U. was already salivating over what a Biden Presidency means for the WTO too. French Trade Minister Franck Riester is already making bold requests to Biden. The AP reports that Riester had another request of Biden to approve the appointment of Nigeria's Former Finance Minister as the WTO's next Director General. We know that today the United States is blocking her nomination, even though there's a large consensus among all the other states. The WTO is paralyzed. We need to give its strength back, he said. Well, of course, China is ecstatic about this as well, knowing that under Biden it will be able to run the table on trade with no roadblocks weak oversight and no tariffs. After all, Biden spent his entire political career kowtowing to Beijing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This lurch backward for America remains - once again how important these Georgia Senate races are. We need the ability to hold hearings on all the globalist nonsense that they are going to be pulling and where possible, threatened to gum up the funding of it.

We're going to say he made the country a mess and they have no alternative because actually, the Pompeo-Trump plan was one of the most successful foreign policies we have seen in 30 years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So they are going to say they're doing all these different things, and are reshaping the Middle East and we don't have a tweeting Donald Trump and then they're going to just copy what Donald Trump did, and that's what's tragic about it because Trump did--",

He means that he will continue the noble tradition of subverting U.S. sovereignty by selling out American workers to a world order where key decisions are made overseas with little to no accountability to the U.S. citizens here. Now the Obama gang is back, that's for sure. Samantha Powers, Ben Rhodes, Susan Rice and they intend to do whatever is necessary to reverse all the progress Trump's team made in holding NATO accountable for their military expenditures and China accountable for their anti-competitive trade practices. Here are the highlights of Biden's globalist shop of horrors. Buckle up. First, he will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. It should be noted that the U.S. has led the world in CO2 emissions reductions since it exited the Paris Climate Accord under Trump. Biden's decision to rejoin the agreement would mean severe damage to the American economy. When Obama first joined Paris he committed the U.S. to cut emissions 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025 as part of this \"Accord.\" But Biden has promised to impose even more economically crippling climate policies. Meanwhile, China would continue to get sweetheart exemptions. In fact he CCP spent the four-year since a joint at the accord building more than 300 coal plants around the world. Second, Biden would rejoin the World Health Organization. Now after the fiasco with the W.H.O.'s work on the virus, Trump was right to put the relationship on ice. \"The New York Times\" on the day before the election even reported that as it in praise Beijing, the W.H.O. concealed concessions to China and may have sacrificed the best chance to unravel the virus' origin. It agreed not to examine China's early response or begin investigating the animal source. It could not even secure a visit to Wuhan, yet Biden wants to put the U.S. taxpayers back on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in the W.H.O.? Think about that. Third, he's going to reenter the Iran deal. Now the Iran deal was an absolute disaster so of course Biden wants to reenter it. It was supposed to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and improve our relationship with their terror-funding regime but instead it accomplished neither. The Iranians loved it though and why wouldn't they? We literally flew them planes loaded with cash which they likelihood used to fund more terrorists. Fourth, Biden is also threatening to lift Trump's travel ban from the Jihadi hot spots around the world. So we will not only send Mueller's more spending money but we are going to let their agents into our cities? Biden should have called this foreign policy plan what it is, blow up better. Fifth, allowing NATO to keep ripping us off. Are they now off the hook or will Biden just refund all the member countries $130 billion Trump got them to pony up? My friends, Europe love a compliant United States so of course they love Clinton and Obama. Except for John Paul II, Europe didn't like Reagan because he didn't take orders from him. They pretty much hated every Republican President for what the past 50 years or so. Brussels loves weak U.S. Presidents because it means international pressure will work even if it means a lower standard of living for average Americans as a result. The E.U. was already salivating over what a Biden Presidency means for the WTO too. French Trade Minister Franck Riester is already making bold requests to Biden. The AP reports that Riester had another request of Biden to approve the appointment of Nigeria's Former Finance Minister as the WTO's next Director General. We know that today the United States is blocking her nomination, even though there's a large consensus among all the other states. The WTO is paralyzed. We need to give its strength back, he said. Well, of course, China is ecstatic about this as well, knowing that under Biden it will be able to run the table on trade with no roadblocks weak oversight and no tariffs. After all, Biden spent his entire political career kowtowing to Beijing."

So he can talk about the W.H.O. and Paris Climate and they have implications, but let's see if he wants to put that Embassy back in Tel Aviv. Let's see if he wants to give 700 million and put the Palestinians back into the center of those negotiations. Let's see if he wants to save Golan Heights they belonged to the Assad kleptocracy. Let's see if he says to his own party, we are going to drop all the tariffs with China and have a new lepton like reset, worked pretty well, he thinks with Russia. I think a lot of it is showmanship and I think the Europeans they praise Biden, they think he's going to win but deep down inside I would be very surprised if they are happy because what it means is if they call Joe Biden and there's trouble in NATO with some Russian aggression or with Taiwan or Japan or South Korea has a problem with Chinese aggression, I don't think they're going to be pleased and they weren't please, necessarily, with Obama. So he can talk all he wants but the idea he's going to come back into the Iran deal with this tottering corrupt Iranian regime, the bureaucracy that's struggling with its economy, oil prices are flat, COVID is running rampant, it's discredited and I don't think so. I don't think that he's going to go say to Saudi Arabia--"

You might remember that in 2016 we were told that we couldn't vote for Donald Trump because of unclear ties to Russia that meant that they would be able to control him, and that was completely not true. But that's not the case when it comes to China, which at the very least has a hold on Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, and has leverage as a result of that that. In addition to Joe Biden having very earnest different foreign policy ideas, right? Remember Robert Gates saying that Joe Biden is wrong on every foreign policy decisions that he has ever come across. And part of that is the thing that he is still was just saying in that clip you showed from Tapper saying that he believes in a strong China. Donald Trump has been transformative in his first term precisely because he has changed the way everybody thinks about whether our posture towards China needed to be as deferential or whether that was dangerous to our economic and national security. He redefined how we handle things in the Middle East. I mean, its Joe Biden - Joe Biden says he wants to get back in bed with Iran, so you're going to tear up all of these great Middle East peace deals that were negotiated in the last year? I mean, you can't have both things at the same time, and so he's going to have some trouble because a lot of the success of this first term, if he's put in as president, a lot of the success of this first Trump term has benefits in terms of peace and economic prosperity. And if he turns his back on those should he be inaugurated, that would be something that he will not be able to reap the economic gains of. Not being in the Paris Climate Accord, re-orienting our posture globally. These are things he might not want to deal with."

That's what Biden did on COVID and I think that is what we are going to see on foreign policy. We're going to say he made the country a mess and they have no alternative because actually, the Pompeo-Trump plan was one of the most successful foreign policies we have seen in 30 years.

Just hand over onto this table and as I got closer, the envelopes were being torn open, there were two people dropping the envelopes, and two people ripping them up open and turning and facing the van and flying on them or marking them and as I got closer, as I was walking they would put things down and pick more paper up and mark on the van and put it down and pick some more up. And as I got closer I thought, those are ballots and I was in my polling uniform, basically, and as I walked by I looked and I thought those are ballots. It was kind of an odd - like, what are they doing? There were four total people but only two are marking and opening the envelopes and the paper. It took about a six minute walk to walk this parking lot and I just did it. I just walked my entire lunch hour. So I came around a second time and they are still opening and marking the ballots."

What happens if we don't maintain control of the Senate and if Biden wins? Everything coming out of the House goes to Biden's desk. The Supreme Court will go from nine to 13 members to make it liberal. The Electoral College will be abolished so New York and California will pick the president. We'll go to open borders with free health care for illegal immigrants. Medicare for all will become the law of the land. And at the end of the day, it will change America as we know it.

He also means epidemiologist Michael Osterholm who coauthored a piece several weeks ago urging that we, quote, \"commit to a more restrictive lockdown.\" Dr. Osterholm is widely expected to be a likely candidate for a top job in the Biden administration. He genuinely seems to despise red state America, where people have just decided we understand the risk, but we have to move on with their lives."

MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, BIDEN COVID-19 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER:  We need to, in a sense, lockdown to drive this infection level to a place where we can actually control it, with testing and tracing and follow up that way, just like the Asian countries have done. And I'm talking about everything from Australia to New Zealand, all the way right up through China and Japan, all those countries have done it already."

He is saying Australia did it right. Melbourne was locked down for 111 days. People are having PTSD when they went back out in public again for the first time. This is what we are going back to even with this vaccine being available for distribution in April, apparently."

      "utterance": "Hey, Laura, thanks for having me. Somebody that would say that, really, is just denying the data that exists on all the places that did lockdowns, because the fact is the lockdown does not get rid of the virus. The lockdowns kill people, the lockdowns destroy families, the lockdowns increase the risk of suicide and drug overdoses, missed cancer diagnosis, missed medical care. All those things happen with the lockdown. But then when you open back up, the virus comes back. And we see this all over Europe. We see it in plenty of the states here that have had various levels of lockdown. And somebody that is saying that just either doesn't know the science, doesn't understand the science, or is lying. It's one of those three."

I think you're going to get vaccinated within the first four months. I would say by April you will be able to be vaccinated."

      "utterance": "Maybe he has cheered up because of the election. But this is the same person who said that we weren't going to have any kind of vaccine data this year even though the president and I both said that we'd probably have some results hopefully in October, for sure hopefully in November. And of course, as we read the data was chosen to not be shown by Pfizer in October. They decided not to look at the date until after the election. And then lo and behold, the vaccine is highly effective. There's all kinds of prognostications that were made, all negative, all to undermine what the reality of the timelines were, all to undermine the president. And I think once you do that sort of thing and make yourself a political animal, basically, you lose your credibility. The fact is the fact. You look at the data and make a --"
