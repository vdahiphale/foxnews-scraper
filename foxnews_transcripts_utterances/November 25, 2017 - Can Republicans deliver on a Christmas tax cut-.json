I do think the personal income tax, part of this change is weaker, but basically because you've got $1.5 trillion to work with, I think that's a very conservative number. The good news is I believe that we are going to outperform it and perhaps outperform it substantially. The bad news is it makes it harder to do this.

But let's look at the individual parts of some of the parts of this bill, as I look at it, I think the two bills, the corporate and business side tax reform is a lot better and stronger than the individual side, which is frankly kind of a mess with a lot of tax credits mixed in, not a real cut in marginal rates very much. How do you see it?"

And I think it's important to note that what you take out is about as important as what you put in, so I think that not only do I believe the lower-corporate rates are very important and very pro-growth, but I think eliminating all of the special interest provisions in the tax code will help the economy by eliminating a system that misallocates resources. I do think the personal income tax, part of this change is weaker, but basically because you've got $1.5 trillion to work with, I think that's a very conservative number. The good news is I believe that we are going to outperform it and perhaps outperform it substantially. The bad news is it makes it harder to do this. But that's the constraint we have imposed, and we have to live with. And I think we can still pass a good tax cut that will give us 3 percent-plus growth again."

But if you go back to the policies that existed in America for 200 years prior to that, we've got a lot of slack in the labor force. There are a lot of people who could and would come back into the labor force. Productivity has been stagnant during the Obama era, investment was so low that it hardly replaced depreciation, so it didn't contribute to economic growth. Those are the things we can improve on dramatically. The problem in the economy is not that the gods have turned against us, the problem is we've had policy that was antigrowth and had other objectives, maybe they were good and maybe they were bad depending on your perspective, but they weren't pro-growth, pro-job."

Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, editorial board member, Allysia Finley, and assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman.

It's so progressive, the top 100 filers generate more than 5 percent of Jersey tax revenue, 100 people. Hedge fund guy, David Tepper (ph), leaves in a few years ago, it's a big deal for state budget.

Look, Paul, whatever his desires to stay out, we cannot withdraw from the region. Russia currently serves as Iran's air force in Syria, the Iranians in deconfliction zone where they are not fighting. The Iranians sit within an hour's drive of the Golan Heights. The Israelis are acutely aware of that. You have transition going on in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are supposed to be allies, but if they see us pulling back in the midst of all this, they are going to start looking towards the Russians or even the Turks."

But I think many in the U.S. business community are most concerned is a series of poison-pill proposals that the U.S. has put forward right now. These are ideas that don't enjoy support across the U.S. business and agriculture community that don't really have identifiable constituencies or really anyone who would benefit from them. And at a time when it makes a lot of sense to modernize NAFTA and bring it to 21st century, we are concerned that this would instead lead to breakdown in the path."

At a time when negotiate, when we are trying to find ways to boost economic growth through tax reform or pulling back on regulatory overreach, blowing up this trade agreement which is our most important one is a real concern and having this sort this idea that within five years the agreement could simply go away, that's not what the business community needs, businesses need to have the confidence and certainty that will allow them to make long-term plans to invest in brick and mortar and to hire and invest and that's what this kind of a proposal would undermine."

The only thing that it would accomplish would be to raise the cost of manufacturing here in the United States. It would create incentive for manufacturing to go outside of north America instead.

What do you make of that analysis of the psychology of Mexico and Canada?"

Another thing that's missed in this analysis is that Canada and Mexico are sovereign states with their own domestic politics, the ability of Mexico, in particular, to just say yes to anything that the Trump administration asks for are things that are not in interest is pretty limited at this point with elections looming next July."

It's American manufacturers who export more \"made in the USA\" goods to Canada and Mexico than they do to the next 10 countries combined. And it's farmers and ranchers who have seen exports to Canada and Mexico quadruple under NAFTA. These folks are pushing back.

We are seeing the importance of that decision. I think the Democrats have only themselves to blame because, as we were just pointing out, and Allysia said, Senator Feinstein questioning Amy about her religious beliefs.
