He's now filed a grievance against the league claiming owners are colluding to keep him out. The NFL and players union issued a joint statement after the meeting, calling it productive.

He was elected, and he wants to do the things he promised the hardworking men and women. And one of those things was that he wouldn't do bad deals.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Tonight, is a resolution coming soon to stop the anthem protest on the football field? NFL owners, players and execs coming together today in New York to iron out how to settle the storm. President Trump has called on the league to suspend players if they kneel during the Star-Spangled Banner. Colin Kaepernick started the protest last season to raise awareness about racial inequality. He's now filed a grievance against the league claiming owners are colluding to keep him out. The NFL and players union issued a joint statement after the meeting, calling it productive. This Eagles player who attended had positive things to say."

They sort of, OK, made the point and now you can go out and do community outreach and continue to strive on behalf of social justice, and whatever you like to express your opinion for in this country. It's why so incredible. But at the same time you can also do the job that you were contracted to do and abide by the NFL's rules. Roger Goodell, yes, showing some Leadership now, but unfortunately, you know, leadership needs to head off crises like this and be there to make sure that all sides feel they're being well represented, that their voices are being heard. The people are listening. Otherwise, then you have sort of this, you know, mismarks evolution of what was initially supposed to be about police injustice, police shootings, and now you're hearing them now spin it. It's got a side message which is white supremacy. So you've got to kind of figure out and follow the bouncing ball."

They don't being threatened first by the president in terms of calling NFL owners, many of whom are big fund supporters, to fire them and being told the owners they're afraid of their black players. Oh, boy. And then, of course, I think there's resistance even when Jerry Jones, the head of the Cowboys says he's going to put in place a rule. Quickly, the NFL said prior to this meeting today there is no requirement that the players stand. They would like them to stand."

So my point though is I think the resolution is along these lines. What you'll see is the NFL saying we're going to invest in commercials, advertising about social justice issues. We are going to back criminal justice reform in the congress. We're going to take positive action so it's not just about kneeling but it's about some substantive change. And on that score, hats off to the NFL."

These are some of my friends who've been pulled over and put into the system. What can we do to change this? This is how we do our job. How do you do your job?

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But that's not what this was about, and that's not what Colin Kaepernick started to do. So lots of things get piled on.

I know some people on the far left say this is about systemic racism in a society, and they want their heroes, the football players, to use their platforms to raise this issue. This is, by the way, one aspect, Jesse. Never gets raised in your calculation. So many of these fans are black people. So when you had Jerry Jones and these other people saying this and that, it's almost like, oh, the white fans are going to abandon us if you do this, and the white conservative Republican fans -- guess what, they're black fans and liberal fans who say, wait a second, we want people to be socially aware and care about their community."

So you have all the fighters that were countering ISIS, and that would be Turkey, Syrian-Kurds, Arabs, Iraqi-Kurds, Iranian-backed fighters and us. We were all working together to defeat ISIS. Now they're actually all fighting each other, so that they can deal with that region. So there are -- this is great news in terms of ISIS being backed down and to only having 10 percent of its territory left, but there are some big looming problems on the horizon."

So they're antithetical to our wonderful way of life. However, the Kurds have been our biggest ally in the Middle East and a very reliable ally at that when we see in so many places shifting alliances. And we think we're friends with someone, we give them a bunch of weapons, and then they turned around and use them on us. The Kurds they want independence. They just passed a referendum. And they turn around and here, you know, the people they were fighting with to defeat ISIS are now attacking them in Kirkuk to Dana's point. And it's really frustrating, but at some point, it's so complicated, it's so convoluted, and it's so deadly. We spent $1.7 trillion in Iraq since 2003. What are we getting out of it? What are our American interests at this point? I think we should be supporting the Kurds. And I think we should be supporting their independence. At the same time, we have to look at places like Turkey and say, maybe you're not a good ally. Maybe you're not a good friend. Same with Saudi Arabia."

We supplied with tremendous airpower in terms of bombing. You know, I was just listening, oh, the Obama administration was so worried about consequences. I was just today looking through the material and I said thousands of people killed, 270,000 displaced, homes levels, I mean, so that you have somebody describing the conditions in Raqqa, Mosul, and Ramadi as Hiroshima-like.

You know, it's like the Shiite militia now from Iran there, we have the Kurds there, they're armed. A lot of these people might settle some old ethnic scores. I like to stay away from that. I don't think we should divide the country into three. That's just going to increase Iran's power. You know, you need a strong bull work geographically against there.

The drug industry then goes to congress and says oh, no, they're getting involved with free enterprise here. We should be making this decision. The standard is raised.

So I think that this is something that he really wants to get done, at least, you know, especially for President Trump. This is something very personal to him. Having lost his brother to addiction.

So they don't really actually kill the pain. What they do is, they mask the pain. They're not treating the underlying problem. The underlying problem can be solved through operations, through physical therapy, through diet, through mental health therapy. But that doesn't profit companies.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So Kimberly, the heart and soul of what Senator McCain was lamenting was that the United States had occupied a leadership role in the world for most of the last century, and he sees us as withdrawing in terms of climate accords, or the Iran deal or trade deals. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "I guess that's what he thinks. I'm not sure exactly in terms of the comments that he just made. But I mean, I personally don't see it that way. I don't see it that we're withdrawing. I think we still maintain a strong leadership position in the world. People know they can count on the United States. No country is more generous in terms of times of tragedy or natural disasters, in terms of providing humanitarian relief around the world, providing military support in the face of brutal regimes and dictatorships. So I see the United States still standing up and taking ownership for those situations. As it relates to President Trump, yes, he has used, you know, themes of patriotism and uniting the country, and I guess if you have an idea about him that's one way or the other, you can kind of, like, say, \"Well, this is what he means by that or this is what he means.\" What I think he tries to under his campaign promises. He was elected, and he wants to do the things he promised the hardworking men and women. And one of those things was that he wouldn't do bad deals. And he said from the beginning of the campaign that the Iran deal was a bad deal, and he said that the climate deal was a bad deal in terms of the large amount of money that the United States was having to proffer for it and, you know, getting kind of return on. So that I think is being consistent with what his campaign message was."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I love John McCain, but he can be a real pain to Republican presidents. I know Dana can agree. He was a little bit of a thorn in George W. Bush's side, voted against the Bush tax cuts, was very, I would say, irritating when it came to waterboarding for President Bush. The Iraq war, not always very supportive, but he helped, you know, turn that around with the surge support. Listen. He's already sunk Obamacare repeal. He's probably going to vote against the Trump tax reform package. I do like what he said, though. I like how he said, \"I'm not going to comment on what Trump says. I'm going to comment on what Trump does.\" I wish a lot of senators would do that, including Bob Corker, including Senator Graham. I think that's good advice for a lot of Republican senators."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I think that when you give a speech like that, that Senator McCain did, you almost have to understand, like, what's going to happen in the morning. What are people going to take away from this? And if it requires further explanation, then you probably should have put more of that in your speech. So when I interviewed Condi Rice last week at the Bush Center, she said she's concerned about the four horsemen of the apocalypse. And it's nationalism, populism -- two other \"isms.\" But basically this whole thing that it's not necessarily just President Trump's campaign promises. It's that there's a global movement around the world to withdraw. That might be better for the American interests when it comes to President Trump, but John McCain from where he comes from and based on his experience, he sees it differently. And he has never been shy about saying what he thinks."

And there's her beautiful baby girl, Hayden. I cannot believe two years has gone by. I was there with her in the hospital after Hayden was born. It was just an incredible moment, to see her joy. Such a wonderful person. Babysitting, taking care of Ronan, making an Eastern bunny cake with him, and I knew she'd be an incredible mom. So I'm happy to see this, and she's sharing the joys of motherhood and having this beautiful baby in her life with all of us."
