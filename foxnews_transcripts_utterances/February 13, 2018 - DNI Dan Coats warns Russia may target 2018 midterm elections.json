These soldiers bravely repelled repeated assault by enemy forces in the battle of Rhode Island. Later they fought at Yorktown where the British ultimately surrendered and America's independence was won. And they would not have surrendered so easily and so quickly without you, that I can tell you. Decades later, African-Americans volunteered to fight to preserve our union in the civil war. Among them was a soldier named William Carney who was born a slave in Virginia and later enlisted in the union army. During the second battle of Fort Wagner, Sergeant Carney saw the color guard of his unit fall and he was mortally wounded. Immediately, he threw down his rifle, raced to grab the flag and carried it forward, planting it on the walls of the fort. Through a hail of gunfire and enduring multiple wounds, he continued to guard that great American flag throughout the entire battle.

We're going to spy. Everybody's spies. We always look at spying as somehow a defensive tool, like we're going to get information.

First, as our non-conscious allies, robots can do good: rescue loved ones from hostages and earthquakes while also assisting the invalid. They can replace humans in other high-risk endeavors like war. They likely won't be traditional bots, though, but swarms of insect-like drones that can get into places that men can't. But the second more disturbing path is of a non-conscious, goal-oriented creature with computation speeds beyond our comprehension. Once unleashed, we can't stop them. If their goal is simply to openly open a door, it may want to open all doors and may dispense with us to do so. It's nothing personal. You're just in their way. We become barnyard chickens, yhe metal gods our merciless farmers. But I digress. I welcome our robot overlords.

So many of our wonderful cabinet. It's really a terrific day. It's so much fun, so much fun to have you here. Celebrate a very important element of our culture and our life, African- American history month, right? We're very glad to be joined by our outstanding surgeon general, Dr. Jerome Adams. Jerome, thank you very much. I also want to recognize our great secretary of housing and urban development, Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? Great guy, great friend. And thank you to all the members of our cabinet and all of you who are here and some of you came from far because this was very important for you to be with us today. Thank you very much. And to the Hope Christian Church choir. I heard that sound outside. I said that is a beautiful sound I'm hearing. And Alveda King is my friend. And you were saying -- I saw you just really moving to the music, Alveda. So thank you very much. Special, special person. Really right from the beginning. So thank you very much for everything, Alveda. I was privileged to sign the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Act just a few weeks ago with Alveda by my side, and that was such an honor. I also want to thank you and Naomi Earp who is with us for serving on the Frederick Douglass bicentennial commission. Thank you very much, Naomi. Thank you very much. As we mark 200 years since the birth of a truly great American icon, 200 years, that's something. As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have really totally inspired us all. Through their brave and really incredible journey, perseverance, they've gone through tremendous perseverance. They've lifted up the conscience of our nations and made America more just, more equal and more free. From the pews to the picket lines, African-Americans civil rights champions have brought out the best in America, calling us to live up to our founding creed and to the truth that we are all made equal by God."

They joined units like first Rhode Island regiment, the first all-black unit of American warriors. Many were slaves. In exchange for their service, they were promised their birthright of freedom. These soldiers bravely repelled repeated assault by enemy forces in the battle of Rhode Island. Later they fought at Yorktown where the British ultimately surrendered and America's independence was won. And they would not have surrendered so easily and so quickly without you, that I can tell you. Decades later, African-Americans volunteered to fight to preserve our union in the civil war. Among them was a soldier named William Carney who was born a slave in Virginia and later enlisted in the union army. During the second battle of Fort Wagner, Sergeant Carney saw the color guard of his unit fall and he was mortally wounded. Immediately, he threw down his rifle, raced to grab the flag and carried it forward, planting it on the walls of the fort. Through a hail of gunfire and enduring multiple wounds, he continued to guard that great American flag throughout the entire battle. He later remarked to his comrades that the old flag never touched the ground. That's a big deal. Sergeant Carney's extraordinary valor made him the first African-American to be awarded the congressional medal of honor. Highest award."

A nation where every families is safe, where every community can prosper and where all Americans can stand tall and proud and free. I know this vision of freedom, equality, and dignity lives in the heart of every American patriot. And just like so many African- Americans throughout our history who have struggled and sacrifice for freedom, we must do our part to make that vision real for every single American. As long as we have faith in our citizens, confidence in our values, and trusting God, we will not fail. We will protect the birthright of freedom for all Americans. I want to tell you. We've made such incredible progress over the last year. It was just announced, and perhaps you heard me say it, we had the lowest African-American unemployment rate in the history of our country."

In the mid-19th century, Alexander Thomas Augusta dreamed of being a surgeon, but he was refused entry to U.S. medical schools because of the color of his skin. Undeterred, he enrolled in medical school in Canada. When the civil war broke out, Dr. Augusta offered his services to President Abraham Lincoln. He was commissioned as an officer becoming the army's first ever African-American physician. He went on to become the first African-American professor of medicine in the entire country, working at the newly formed Howard University right here in our Washington, D.C. Dr. Augusta was honored as the first African-American ever to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery. And following in the footsteps of leaders like Dr. Augusta, today we have trailblazers like General Nadja West. General West, raise your hand so that everyone could see who you are."

But in the meantime, it's the other threats that are also a problem.

The top security threat is technology married to terror. You don't need 10,000 jihadists anymore, you just need one with know-how. It's not like a nation-state which has everything to lose. An individual who wants to die, will take all of you with you because they have nothing to lose. North Korea and Russia you can call them enemies, but they still want to survive because their goal is on the globe. The jihadist goals are in heaven. So our biggest fear or danger is our own complacency. We have to look at the jihadist threat forever. It's not some geopolitical force. This is a toxic ideology and we have to deal with it. About the cyber terror thing, we have to be careful when we keep saying we're under attack. Obviously, Russians are going to spy. North Koreans are going to spy. The Chinese are going to spy. We're going to spy. Everybody's spies. We always look at spying as somehow a defensive tool, like we're going to get information. We're going to get information about Russia or the USSR, way back when, and then for that, that's how we create our defenses. The problem with hacking is when you say somebody hacks, like North Korea, Russia hacks. We think of it as a nation. We doubt -- we think it's a nation attacking us. I think that's a bit dangerous. I think we have to look at this the way we look at normal spying. Hacking is just an adaptation of that spying. It's not a nation on the offensive. It's perhaps a spy on the defensive. It's still bad, but it's something that we have to put it in perspective so we don't mistake a defensive action as an offensive one and launch a war. That's my theory that I've stolen from somebody else."

And now, look at what we're talking about still a year later. Also, the DNC claims they were hacked by the Russians, yet they never handed over their server. How seriously do they actually take it? Podesta said he was hacked by the Russians. He ended up giving them his password which was password. President Obama admitted that he was worried about Russian interference in the election and never said anything about it. Actually feels guilty. So, I'm friends with the guy that runs the Harvard cyber security team and he just briefed congress the other day, and he said this, it's like a crime. You're never going to fully prevent it. You're going to have to realize some of it is going to happen. But when Russia comes to mess with us, we have to hit them back hard so they pay a price."

Recently, in the course of the budget shutdown there was a hashtag called #schumershutdown trending, and it got lots of attention and amplified then by mainstream media. And Democratic politicians in the midst of their effort to say we're going to blame this on the Republican say, hey, boy, look at how social media is playing.

Because in order to make these programs, whether it's boxes of food or welfare, you have to have a strong economy that creates wealth so that -- let's face it -- then it gets distributed. I have this interesting fact. You know, in 1820, 94 percent of the world lived in extreme poverty. By 2015, 90 percent are not living in extreme poverty. That's from our world and data.

So right now the program costs about $70 billion, and I think the poverty line where you quality is about, family of three, $26,000 a year. And you're going to get about $125 a month. That's great. So it's not a racial thing either. Most of the people that get Food Stamps are white. Food Stamp fraud is pretty bad, and I can -- I have a whole list here of people ripping off the federal government for three, four, $5 million. And what happens you come in with your EBT card, and you buy $100 worth of food, not really. You buy $50 worth of food, and then the guy behind the counter gives you $50 cash.

First, as our non-conscious allies, robots can do good: rescue loved ones from hostages and earthquakes while also assisting the invalid. They can replace humans in other high-risk endeavors like war. They likely won't be traditional bots, though, but swarms of insect-like drones that can get into places that men can't. But the second more disturbing path is of a non-conscious, goal-oriented creature with computation speeds beyond our comprehension. Once unleashed, we can't stop them. If their goal is simply to openly open a door, it may want to open all doors and may dispense with us to do so. It's nothing personal. You're just in their way. We become barnyard chickens, yhe metal gods our merciless farmers. But I digress. I welcome our robot overlords.
