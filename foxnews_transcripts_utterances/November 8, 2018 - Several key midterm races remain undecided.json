      "utterance": "The governor, yes, who ran for re-election. So you really saw independent voters, suburban women, which we've talked about quite a bit leading up to this election, do a true split ticket vote in Arizona, voting for Republican governor and then voting for the Democrat female candidate for Senate. And again, that's why I say I think Republicans have some very hard lessons to learn about Arizona, especially when it comes to the machine. This race is a classic example where the governor is incredibly well-liked and did get those independent votes."

If -- let's just play the if game -- Sinema pulls out a win in Arizona, somehow Nelson finds the votes in Florida, you have a Mississippi runoff at the end of November where there will be a lot of attention on that, potentially would only be a one seat pickup for the Republicans if it went the wrong way in a Republican point of view. And that would change the dynamic about, that makes Murkowski and Collins and the people who really are in the middle much more powerful with a one seat majority."

The narrative out of the White House after Tuesday was we have gains in the Senate, we are coming in strong, there's a lot of things we can do, like judges, appointments. There are things we can do just with the Senate. And that absolutely gets harder if you are staring at the kind of tight majority that they've had over the past two years.
