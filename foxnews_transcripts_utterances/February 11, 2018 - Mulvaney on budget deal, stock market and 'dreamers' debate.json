So I do think it's going to go through at some point. The FBI also said they needed to redact certain information. So I think Democrats are willing to look at that and then they're going to, of course, send it back up to the White House. If the president rejects it then, I think you'll see even more partisan bickering. But I think until then we're going to see them working together to get it out.",

Keep in mind, since the chief has come on, we've managed to pass the tax bill, the economy is going again. ISIS is defeated.

Someone who we know and trust and work with, Rob Porter, came to the president of United States and chief of staff and said, look, I'm being accused of these things, they are not true. For the president and the chief of staff to give that person the benefit of the doubt is probably a very normal and human reaction. If your cameraman came to you and said, look, I'm going to be accused of something but it's not true, you'd be likely to try to want to give that person benefit of the doubt until they were proven wrong. As soon as Rob Porter was proven wrong and it was proven that he was not telling the truth when the photos came on Wednesday, he was gone almost immediately. So --"

In fact, when I saw the tweet, I know Rob Porter wasn't mentioned, I wondered if the president was talking about his friend Steve Wynn, who has been accused and essentially condemned without any due process. What you also saw there from the president is a certain sadness that somebody that he liked had let him down."

Here's how our next guest, your former colleague in the House Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, reacted."

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",

The president's first priority, he said this during the campaign, he said this since he was elected, he said it at the other night at the State of the Union, was to defend the nation. We really thought we could cut a deal with the Democrats that would increase defense spending in order to defend the nation. They said that, publicly, they wanted to work with us on that. But when the doors closed, what happened was they would not give us a single dollar worth of additional defense spending without giving us additional money for welfare spending and that's just the world we live in. People think we can do what we want to in Washington because Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. But the truth of the matter is, because of the 60-vote rule in the Senate, we need Democrat support. And Democrats would not support our increase in defense spending without that dramatic increase in social welfare programs."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

There's always a reason. In other words, you're saying, well, it's the Democrats' fault. Obama might have said it was the Republicans' fault in the recession. Bottom line, isn't President Trump the big spender now?"

Again, we haven't had a chance to completely integrate the numbers from the bill that passed a couple days ago to what we are working on last week. But the truth of the matter is that when we roll out the budget on Monday, which is tomorrow now, you're going to get a chance to see how we can avoid that future. The budget does bend the trajectory down, it does move us back towards balance. It does get us away from trillion dollar deficits. Just because this deal was signed does not mean the future is written in stone. We do have a chance still to change this trajectory and that's what the budget will show tomorrow."

These are spending caps. They're not spending floors. So, you don't have to spend all that. So, we are going to show how you can run the government without spending all of that."

But if you're going to spend it, which is exactly what we think Congress is going to do, here's how you should spend it and that will be our 2018 budget. So, take the money that the Democrats want to put to these social programs and move it to things like infrastructure, move it to things like opioid relief, move it to things that are in line with the president's priorities so that if it does get spent, at least it get spent to the right places."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "In your first budget, the one for 2018, for this year that you introduced last year -- yes, it's complicated -- you called for major spending cuts on the domestic side. Let's put them up on the screen: 28 percent less for the State Department and foreign aid, 31 percent cut for the EPA, 18 percent less for the National Institutes of Health. But under the congressional compromise, all of those agencies get more money, not less money. So, in the sense, haven't the Trump-Mulvaney spending priorities for this year and last, haven't they been rejected by Congress?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "No. And keep in mind, I don't want to get too far deep in the weeds, but the bill that passed last week is not a spending bill. It's not an appropriations bill. It will simply set the caps, set the spending limit --"

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "There is. But you are still going to see some reductions in our proposals to the State Department. You still are going to see some reductions in our proposals to the EPA. There's still going to be the president's priorities as we seek to spend the money consistently with our priorities, not with the priorities that were reflected most by the Democrats in Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Now, in this new budget that you're going to be putting out tomorrow, will you allocate some of the money that was going to go to DHS as a down payment on President Trump's border wall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. In fact, a couple different things. Last year in the 2018 budget, we asked for some money for the wall. I think it was about $1.6 billion. We're asking for about $3 billion I think this year for the wall, but we're also putting in a contingency in this 2018, what we call this pivot, as we try and pivot off of the old budget onto the new, to reflect the spending priorities or the spending bill that just passed, is enough money to build a whole wall or actually most of it assuming that DACA gets done. So, what I'm saying in a very confusing way is that we are assuming in our 2018 proposal that a DACA deal is done and that the border wall is funded."

We've seen the two biggest point drops, not percentage drops, but point drops in history, over a thousand points two days. And we're now in correction territory, down 10 percent from the high a couple of weeks ago. One of the big concerns is that the economy is in danger of overheating, that we're going to have inflation, that we're going to have higher interest rates, that that's going to tamp down growth. Under this new spending plan that Congress has passed and the president has signed, we are talking about deficits next year 5 percent of GDP, which is usually only happens during war or recession. Isn't it dangerous to have a 5 percent GDP -- deficit as a percentage of GDP when you're talking about an economy that's going at great guns?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Certainly there's a risk that interest rates will spike and there's a concern -- I think what you saw last week when you started these wild gyrations in the stock market -- keep in mind though, Chris, that that thousand-point drop I think we had of Monday of last was only the 99th largest reduction on a percentage basis. So, even though that thousand points sounds like it's fairly dramatic, in a history of things, it's not that large of a swing. But I think what triggered that was not the fact that we were overheating the economy, but that we were borrowing too much money. The Treasury had reached out to some of the primary dealers last week to --"

This is not a fiscal stimulus. It's not a sugar high. It's not the same thing as what President Obama did -- I'm now talking about the tax bill. We have fundamentally changed the structure of the American economy to where we think we can change the long-term trends of our growth possibilities, the long term trends of the economy, and that we have that sustained growth that could maintain --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I just have to pick up when you -- because now you are also adding $400 billion in new spending and a trillion dollar deficit next year, which only increases government borrowing. You say that could make interest rates spike."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "It absolutely could. Keep in mind though that we are also looking now at a healthier economy than even we expected. The -- when we rolled out the budget last year, we were accused of being way too overly optimistic on our growth rates for this year and for next, and we're already below what we're actually achieving. You saw the Atlanta Fed come out last week and I think predict growth over 5 percent in this quarter. So, if we can keep the economy humming and generate more money for you and me and for everybody else, the government takes in more money, and that's how we hope to be able to keep the debt under control."

But all that seemed forgotten this week with passage of a budget deal with $400 billion of new spending. Joining us now, Congressman Jim Jordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus and still a deficit hawk, which has become something of an endangered species on Capitol Hill.

And in your first segment with Mick, look, he said we don't have 60 votes in the Senate to get some things done. And I'm all for changing the Senate rules. But the last time I checked, Democrats don't have 60 votes in the Senate either and last time I checked, there's more Republicans in the Senate than there are Democrats. More Republicans in the House than there are Democrats and there's a Republican in the White House. So, this deal which increased spending $300 billion, second largest spending increased in a decade, second only to the stimulus, was not what we said we would do and we're going to have to fight harder now as the Freedom Caucus and conservatives to get things back on track."

Let's just grow government, give into the Democrats instead of fighting and stand firm, and do what the people elected us to do. They gave into the Democrats and we got this boondoggle that we passed. I didn't vote for it, but that passed on Friday morning."

Let me put up the reasons that they suggest. You lose the debt ceiling for the next two years as a weapon to demand policy changes. With this to your agreement, you can no longer use the threat of a government shutdown. And with no budget resolution this year, you won't be able to use reconciliation to get a major initiative through the Senate with just 51 votes. Honestly, Congressman, with this agreement, haven't you and deficit hawks like you and the House Freedom Caucus lost your leverage to shrink government spending?"

I remember, right up to the last election, said, oh, the Freedom Caucus is gone now because Republicans -- I think we've been the most effective caucus, and certainly the most talked about caucus on Capitol Hill the last year and a half, and I would argue our chairman, frankly, is probably the member closest to the president, closer than probably any other member in the House or the Senate. So, they can only say they're going to write us off. But what I know is we got a big debate coming, the debate on immigration. And the Freedom Caucus is going to be in the middle of that and the speaker of the House promised the Freedom Caucus, promised conservatives in the House that he would put the Goodlatte legislation, the legislation that is consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election, that he would whip that, bring that to the floor and we would have that --"

He could have stood firm for the position that we passed earlier in the week, the position that our conference then supported. I wish he would have done that. So, do I think the speaker has problems? Yes I do, particularly now as we head into this big immigration debate. Just a few years ago, he was viewed as the fiscal -- the leader of fiscal responsibility in our party and now he presides over a bill that increases spending $300 billion, a trillion dollar deficit, when we were so poised to win this fight. Of course, he's got problems. But the key is let's see what happens next on the immigration issue."

The Senate takes up DACA this week trying to find some solutions, some compromise, and what they are talking about -- and also what the president is talking about, is a package that includes -- now you put the tough part first, the president and some Republicans say that it all comes together, that you're going to have a path to citizenship for the Dreamers in 10 to 12 years. You're going to have tougher border enforcement on our southern border and also tougher enforcement both legal and illegal immigration. Would you support that package?"

What they want is border security first. So, build a border security wall, end the chain migration, get rid of this crazy visa lottery, do things in a way that make good common -- sanctuary city policy, get rid of those. Do those things first and then we'll deal with the DACA situation. That is consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election and frankly consistent with what the president and what Republicans campaigned on."

If they do legislation like what is Chairman Goodlatte's legislation, that's been worked on by him, Congressman Labrador, Senator -- or excuse me, Congressman McCaul.

In other words, the folks that felt, well, the conservative voters, if we elect a Republican House, or a Republican Senate and Republican president, we're going to get conservative policies. Do you think some of them just may stay home if they see Congress --"

And then when you increase spending, $300 billion, just grow government, run a trillion dollar deficit -- heck yes that can hurt us. That's why -- that's why we're so focused on making sure this immigration bill gets done right. That's why we fought the spending bill as hard as we did last week."

But that wasn't the big news this week. The big news is this week was the text message from Lisa Page to Peter Strzok where she said POTUS -- referring to President Obama -- POTUS wants to know everything we're doing. And the significance of that, Chris, was when it came. July 5th, they let Clinton off, no charges brought against Clinton. End of July, Peter Strzok opens the Russia investigation.

Well, congressman, as someone who's seen how Washington works, how do you explain the way the White House has handled or mishandled the Rob Porter scandal?

Let's understand who has a security clearance and who doesn't.

He had been accused in the past of assaulting his wife as well. So this is a process story in part, but it's also a principle story. They have known for months about these allegations. Both wives -- ex-wives went to the FBI, gave them accounts. It was only when it became a public relations problem and the photos came out that the White House actually acted. So I would say in this country right now we are going through a moment where sexual harassment and sexual assault are really -- been a topic of discussion. They're being handled in a much more serious way. And the White House really feels like it's behind the eight ball here in how they handled this. And I think John Kelly has some answering to do for it."

No mention of the two ex-wives."

Nary a word about the alleged victims, of which there are three. And I'm sympathetic to this argument that just because an allegation exists, that someone should lose their job and have their life shattered. But in this case, you have to use reason and evidence. And we know this is three women, there's a photo of a blackened eye, there's a police report, there is a restraining order, and the FBI was not giving this man a security clearance for a reason. There's a pile of evidence. And to sort of elide all of that the way that the president did in his statement, I think did a disservice to this ongoing fiasco at the White House on this issue."

Paul Ryan has said he wants it to be out there for transparencies sake. And I think Republicans are worried that if they don't release this memo or the president blocks them from doing so, that it will just undercut their entire purpose for writing the initial memo, which was to highlight what they say was potential civil liberty obstruction, civil liberty -- infringing on civil liberties of Americans. So I do think it's going to go through at some point. The FBI also said they needed to redact certain information. So I think Democrats are willing to look at that and then they're going to, of course, send it back up to the White House. If the president rejects it then, I think you'll see even more partisan bickering. But I think until then we're going to see them working together to get it out."

It's ten pages instead of four. And it sounds like the FBI, again, said some of this stuff we don't want out there. So Democrats are going to try to work with them on that, get that part out, and then try to release it from there.

      "utterance": "The sister of North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un attending the Winter Olympics and inviting South Korean President Moon to meet with her brother back in Pyongyang later this year. And we're back now with the panel. Well, Marie, as a State Department official, you dealt with North Korea. They're clearly engaged at these Winter Olympics in a charm offensive. And at the opening ceremony, you can see there, there was president -- Vice President Pence (ph). And right over his shoulder, in the second row, was Kim's younger sister, who's also a top advisor. Are they succeeding in their effort, which is pretty obvious, to try to drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's worth keeping in mind that if there is some conflict, if we cannot solve this diplomatically, it is the South Koreans who will bear the brunt of this conflict if it were to happen. So, just from a human interest perspective, seeing the athletes from the North and the South march in together, I actually think was a reminder of the stakes here. And I think the North -- or, excuse me, the South Koreans have been concerned about some of the inconsistencies coming out of the Trump administration about negotiations, whether they're still on the table, what the pre-conditions could be. So I think the North and the South have put out there a possible way to start talking to avoid conflict. We shouldn't be naive. But the Trump administration really needs to, you know, narrow their focus on what their policy is, on what they're looking for out of negotiations, because our allies are pretty scared by some of this talk of preemptive strike, of a bloody nose (ph) strike. That scares them because they will bear the brunt of that conflict."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But, Guy, the point of the Trump policy, to put pressure on North Korea and to isolate them, the reason for all this is because they want to seek Kim stop his nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the nuclear tests. If you get South Korea saying, well, we don't need that, you can keep your nukes, that has a real implication not only for South Korea, but for the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "It could. And I think what the Trump administration would argue is that the previous administration's approach, and frankly others, had been virtually the same for years and has not paid dividends, to put it kindly. And being more unpredictable is actually what is needed in this circumstance. I also briefly want to go back to your point about this charm offensive by Pyongyang at the Olympics. It is distressing and bewildering to me watching how much our media seems to be buying into it. The swooning and the gushing over the cheer squad that is cheering under threat of death, you know, for their families. And this sister of a vicious killer giving side eye to the vice president. A lot of people saying, oh, you know, she's slaying, she's stealing the spotlight. We should not be buying into North Korean propaganda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But here's what -- the only point that I disagree with you, saying that this is media creation. I watched the opening ceremony at they had a North Korean and South Korean athletes, two of them, going up the stairs with the flame to deliver it to the final person who lit the flame. I mean the South Koreans are buying into that. That has real implications in terms of the south Korean-U.S. alliance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "That's fine. That's fine. My concern is the celebration of Kim's sister and talking about, oh, isn't -- aren't these cheerleaders cute. To me that's dangerous because this is a brutal regime and it seems like they are putting out chum in the water and there are people in out media willing to eat it up, and we shouldn't."

      "utterance": "We, obviously, want peace and we want some prosperity, but we've also got to make sure that they don't get the nuclear capability. And so you have to be able to do both. And, again, President Moon, who's still fairly new into this position, is a great partner to the United States. You also saw Vice President Pence sitting next to the prime minister of Japan. And a very important symbol there as well."

Which makes me wonder, Rachael, with all the concern that we saw in those drops about the economy overheating, rising inflation, rising interest rates, was there any talk in Congress as they were passing his huge spending bill, which is going to add hundreds of billions of dollars more in deficits, was there any talk that this only adds to that problem?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BADE",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely, particularly from conservatives. Jim Jordan, as you just interviewed, conservatives are not happy with this deal at all. I mean, obviously, this is a $300 billion increase in spending. A whole debt ceiling increased for a year, increasing the national debt by more than a trillion dollars potentially, over $20 trillion, which it is currently. Look, conservatives are not happy with this at all. This is not something they want to campaign on back home. There was some Republicans who voted for this just because they didn't want to vote against military spending and they were --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BADE",
      "utterance": "You know, a lot of them were not happy that they had to take this vote and leadership has been using the same sort of justification that Mulvaney gave you this in morning, which is, we needed to bolster the military and there was only one way to get it. We had to increase spending for Democratic priorities in order to do this as well. And so a lot of them did so reluctantly, but we'll see how much it hurts the next election."

      "utterance": "They blew up -- they put a torch to the mantle of fiscal discipline. That is long gone. You know, there's been a lot of talk about a parade around here. They should be doing a parade for Chuck Schumer because he took them to the cleaners. I mean he really did. Listen, he got every spending priority that he wanted. Nothing was cut. If took reconciliation, the most powerful tool that the Republicans had, off the table. And it's just unbelievable to me that we were spending this much money. Nobody campaigned on that. And there is going to be a political price taken, particularly in the primaries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "So -- so explained to me, as somebody who was in Congress until recently, why? I mean I understand the argument, well, you need 60 votes in the Senate, which means you needed nine Democrats to come along. Why did Republicans do it? I mean they did have the majority in the House, in the Senate, and they had a Republican president and they went along."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Look at the trajectory over the last few days. It just happened in a couple of days. I mean at least Rand Paul was trying to have at least a little bit of a semblance of a debate on one of the most massive things that the Congress does in this spending. It's absolutely unbelievable to me. I just -- I can't even fathom the idea that if we had gone into the election saying we're going to raise spending and we're going to go back to trillion dollar deficits, none of these Republicans would have gotten elected. We love our military, but we're in the majority in the House, the Senate, and we have the presidency. And we have this kind of deficit? It's unbelievable."
    },

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I've got less than a minute left, Guy. Let's talk about the election. I brought this up with Jim Jordan. What impact does this have on the 2018 midterms? You've got conservative voters out there who were promised certain things if they elected a Republican government. They did, and this is what they get."

      "speaker": "BENSON",
