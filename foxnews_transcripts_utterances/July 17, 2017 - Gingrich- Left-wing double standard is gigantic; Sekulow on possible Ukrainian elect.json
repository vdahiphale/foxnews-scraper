      "sentences": "This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, a major update in the \"Hannity\" investigation into the left's massive double standard on election interference. We have Newt Gingrich, Jay Sekulow, Monica Crowley will all be here with reaction. But first, finally, the political left, the destroy Trump media are waking up to what we have been telling you now for months. Now, we are forcing them to cover stories that they have been ignoring. Now, that is tonight's very important \"Opening Monologue.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, if you watch this program, you know that unlike the destroy Trump media, the establishment media -- they're all group think and think alike every day -- we think the truth is important and that you, the American people -- you deserve to know what's really going on. And for weeks, we have been covering massive scandals and we've been calling on the media, on Congress to start investigating them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For example, there's this explosive report. Remember Politico back in January? Look at the headline we've been telling you about. \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire. Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this scandal revolves around a one-time DNC operative named Alexandra Chalupa. She, along with Ukrainian government officials, worked during the campaign to hurt Donald Trump and help Hillary Clinton. It's in the Politico article. Just read it. Now, we put together a chart to better illustrate what has happened. Now, according to Politico, Chalupa, who's a former Clinton White House employee, worked for years to try and expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Now, this includes by meeting with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy and Chalupa said that those Ukrainian diplomats were, quote, \"helpful\" when it came to finding information. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there's this damaging quote about Chalupa in the article. She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton's campaign. So from what Politico reported back in January, Chalupa tried to share information with the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Oh, sounds like collusion. Now, we did once again -- we reached out to this DNC operative for comment. We have yet to hear back. Now, Chalupa did provide a statement to fake news CNN. Here's part of it. \"During the 2016 U.S. election, I was a part-time consultant for the DNC running an ethnic engagement program. I was not an opposition researcher for the DNC, and the DNC never asked me to go to the Ukrainian embassy to collect information.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, during the period of time, she made $412,000, according to Politico. Chalupa did admit that she did meet with the Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy, but now claims six months later that the topic had nothing to do with the election. OK. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, putting Chalupa's denial aside, now, six months after this article comes out, there are so many questions that we need answers to, and our continued coverage on this scandal is now starting to get the attention of the destroy Trump media and Democrats. And yesterday, even Congressman Adam Schiff was asked, finally, about Ukrainian election collusion. Take a look.",

Now, we still need more answers from the people who headed the organizations that were involved. That includes Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She was the head of the DNC. She needs to be put under oath and testify before Congress about what she knew, when she knew it. And the same goes for former Clinton campaign officials like John Podesta because that DNC operative testified that she tried to share information with both the DNC and the Clinton campaign, also, former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.

And you know, going off my facts, in my opinion, it is worse than the black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories you've been hearing about for 11 months. And with Ukraine, we have real evidence of collusion. We know real information was passed along and may have ended up in the DNC and Clinton campaign. We know that it did impact the election because Paul Manafort ended up resigning as Trump's campaign manager and chairman. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All that evidence is why we are not going to stop covering this story until you, the American people, get the answers that you deserve. Also, another massive scandal that the media, establishment media has not paid much attention to and Congress needs to start investigating. And I'm talking about that Uranium One deal that we've been calling the real Russia conspiracy theory. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton signed off giving up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons, to who? Vladimir Putin, to Russia, the Russians. And while that was going on, people involved in that deal kicked back over $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow! Doesn't that sound like something the establishment media, congressional investigators, Robert Mueller should be focused on, at least beginning to look into? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there's the fake news dossier. Remember the op research firm Fusion GPS that has ties to the Hillary campaign, the Democratic Party, Planned Parenthood? Well, according to those reports, that phony dossier quoting Russians and the Ritz Carlton and hookers was originally commissioned, OK, by a Republican donor, but, eventually, a Clinton ally ended up funding it. Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent, put this disgusting hit piece together, cited Russian government sources or sources tied to the Russian government. Doesn't that sound like colluding with a foreign government to interfere with an election to you? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there's the law firm that has ties to both Fusion GPS, the Russian lawyer who was in that June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. What's disgusting about all this -- the Democrats feigning moral outrage about the idea of Russia collusion were perfectly willing to repeat information from that phony Christopher Steele dossier that used Russian sources in some cases. Well, doesn't that make Democrats complicit in this? Well, we'll let you decide. Take a look at what they were saying about this phony dossier, which is proven false, citing Russians.

We decided to send our cameras all across the country to find out the source of this deep-rooted Trump hate, and that is the subject of tonight's mini monologue. All right, so the mainstream alt-left establishment media goes on and on about how unpopular President Trump is with you, the American people. But this weekend's protests tell a very different story. Small, sparsely attended rallies across some of America's most liberal cities barely garnered news coverage. Those in attendance, they seemed to be protesting a variety of issues that they attributed to the election of president Trump. And, of course, the anti-Trump hysteria is being pushed by CNN, MSNBC, and other fake news outlets. It was all front and center. In case you had better things to do with your weekend, which I imagine you probably did, rather than march around with a sign and mindlessly chant rhyming slogans, well, you're going to want to take a look at what went down at Saturday's sad antifascism rallies and the failure that they were.

We know physical barriers work, and that's why Democrats and even some Republicans don't like them. It's not a money problem or a policy problem. It's a priority problem. The same thing with Obamacare. The mandate from the American people on November 8th was clear -- repeal and replace. Replace the open ended entitlement program known as Obamacare, replace it with liberty. And let's figure out some common sense solution to our health care problem, solutions that don't involve a blank check, by the way. And yes, energy independence is another nonnegotiable. God blessed this land with abundant natural resources. And to think we aren't taking full advantage of science, technology, and innovation all because some snowflakes want to stage another protest, that's absolutely ludicrous. Energy innovation equals jobs and independence, two things the American people absolutely need. Here's what else we need -- middle-class and corporate tax cuts. The silent majority has waited long enough for this. Hardworking Americans are sick and tired of working their tails off to fund bloated government. It's about time we give them some relief and the ability to keep more of what they earn. The government pays for nothing. The American taxpayer pays for everything, and it's time to make America open for business again.

      "utterance": "This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, a major update in the \"Hannity\" investigation into the left's massive double standard on election interference. We have Newt Gingrich, Jay Sekulow, Monica Crowley will all be here with reaction. But first, finally, the political left, the destroy Trump media are waking up to what we have been telling you now for months. Now, we are forcing them to cover stories that they have been ignoring. Now, that is tonight's very important \"Opening Monologue.\" Now, if you watch this program, you know that unlike the destroy Trump media, the establishment media -- they're all group think and think alike every day -- we think the truth is important and that you, the American people -- you deserve to know what's really going on. And for weeks, we have been covering massive scandals and we've been calling on the media, on Congress to start investigating them. For example, there's this explosive report. Remember Politico back in January? Look at the headline we've been telling you about. \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire. Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.\" Now, this scandal revolves around a one-time DNC operative named Alexandra Chalupa. She, along with Ukrainian government officials, worked during the campaign to hurt Donald Trump and help Hillary Clinton. It's in the Politico article. Just read it. Now, we put together a chart to better illustrate what has happened. Now, according to Politico, Chalupa, who's a former Clinton White House employee, worked for years to try and expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Now, this includes by meeting with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy and Chalupa said that those Ukrainian diplomats were, quote, \"helpful\" when it came to finding information. Then there's this damaging quote about Chalupa in the article. She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton's campaign. So from what Politico reported back in January, Chalupa tried to share information with the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Oh, sounds like collusion. Now, we did once again -- we reached out to this DNC operative for comment. We have yet to hear back. Now, Chalupa did provide a statement to fake news CNN. Here's part of it. \"During the 2016 U.S. election, I was a part-time consultant for the DNC running an ethnic engagement program. I was not an opposition researcher for the DNC, and the DNC never asked me to go to the Ukrainian embassy to collect information.\" By the way, during the period of time, she made $412,000, according to Politico. Chalupa did admit that she did meet with the Ukrainian officials at the Ukrainian embassy, but now claims six months later that the topic had nothing to do with the election. OK. Now, putting Chalupa's denial aside, now, six months after this article comes out, there are so many questions that we need answers to, and our continued coverage on this scandal is now starting to get the attention of the destroy Trump media and Democrats. And yesterday, even Congressman Adam Schiff was asked, finally, about Ukrainian election collusion. Take a look."

      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "No, it would (ph) be appropriate for the Democrats to accept help from the Ukrainian government. But I think if you look at the Politico article -- and we're talking about just a single article here -- if you accept all the facts in the article, the scale of what the Russians did is not comparable to anything in that article. It would be problematic to get any kind of support from a foreign government. But again, I think to compare the two is a bit like comparing bank robbery with writing a check with insufficient funds. Both appropriate money from the bank improperly, but a very different degree of seriousness and involvement in this case by a foreign government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "speaker": "JAY SEKULOW, TRUMP LEGAL TEAM",
      "utterance": "Opposition research in campaigns happens all the time. You had the situation with the Ukrainians doing the same thing with the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. We know for a fact, as reported extensively in an investigative journalist piece by Politico, that the Ukrainians were in direct contact with DNC officials and traded information back and forth. The fact is, you know, the Ukrainians at the very same time were working with the DNC and the Clinton campaign to give what? Opposition research on Donald Trump and his associates. I go back to the Ukrainian example. I know you don't want to discuss it because you say it's not being investigated, which raises a question. But here, in the Ukrainian situation, they actually exchanged documents from a foreign government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So finally, we got the establishment media to start talking about Ukraine interfering in our election. Now, we still need more answers from the people who headed the organizations that were involved. That includes Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She was the head of the DNC. She needs to be put under oath and testify before Congress about what she knew, when she knew it. And the same goes for former Clinton campaign officials like John Podesta because that DNC operative testified that she tried to share information with both the DNC and the Clinton campaign, also, former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. He should be seated right next to Podesta under oath to tell you, the American people, what he knows. This is a serious issue far worse than anything Trump/Russia. And you know, going off my facts, in my opinion, it is worse than the black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories you've been hearing about for 11 months. And with Ukraine, we have real evidence of collusion. We know real information was passed along and may have ended up in the DNC and Clinton campaign. We know that it did impact the election because Paul Manafort ended up resigning as Trump's campaign manager and chairman. All that evidence is why we are not going to stop covering this story until you, the American people, get the answers that you deserve. Also, another massive scandal that the media, establishment media has not paid much attention to and Congress needs to start investigating. And I'm talking about that Uranium One deal that we've been calling the real Russia conspiracy theory. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton signed off giving up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons, to who? Vladimir Putin, to Russia, the Russians. And while that was going on, people involved in that deal kicked back over $145 million to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow! Doesn't that sound like something the establishment media, congressional investigators, Robert Mueller should be focused on, at least beginning to look into? Then there's the fake news dossier. Remember the op research firm Fusion GPS that has ties to the Hillary campaign, the Democratic Party, Planned Parenthood? Well, according to those reports, that phony dossier quoting Russians and the Ritz Carlton and hookers was originally commissioned, OK, by a Republican donor, but, eventually, a Clinton ally ended up funding it. Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent, put this disgusting hit piece together, cited Russian government sources or sources tied to the Russian government. Doesn't that sound like colluding with a foreign government to interfere with an election to you? Then there's the law firm that has ties to both Fusion GPS, the Russian lawyer who was in that June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. What's disgusting about all this -- the Democrats feigning moral outrage about the idea of Russia collusion were perfectly willing to repeat information from that phony Christopher Steele dossier that used Russian sources in some cases. Well, doesn't that make Democrats complicit in this? Well, we'll let you decide. Take a look at what they were saying about this phony dossier, which is proven false, citing Russians. Take a look. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, MSNBC, MARCH 9: Do you believe anything about that dossier?"

That's not the same here on the Fox News Channel. Joining us now, author of the number one New York Times best-seller several weeks in a row on the list, \"Understanding Trump,\" former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor Newt Gingrich. So we've been trying to get an answer from this Chalupa lady. The article was written back in January. You have quotes from her in there. Doesn't deny it until tonight to CNN?

So even her denial, I think, may, in fact, not hold up when people look into it in more detail. But it's interesting, you know, there's this huge shock in the elite media that this Russian lawyer came to Trump Tower, et cetera. Well, there's not shock that this DNC operative went to the Ukrainian embassy? Oh, no, that's not really a problem because of this and that and the next thing. The double standard is so gigantic that it is, I think to the average American, very obvious that it is a double standard. And again, notice the difference. We don't have any evidence that anything was done to collude. This is the key word. Where's the collusion? Where's the Russians working directly with Trump? There's no evidence of it. Furthermore, as several liberal lawyers have said, Harvard professors of law, under the 1st Amendment, you are allowed with your free speech rights to try to learn whether or not your opponent has a weakness as long as you're not stealing anything."

We have the corrupt Uranium One deal. I won't give the details. Everyone in this audience knows them. And then you had this phony dossier citing Russians, Fusion GPS, Democrats all hooked into them and paying money to this guy. Comey even wanted to pay this guy $50,000.

You can use this New York Times/Washington Post hysterical language to describe anything. But the one that I think is the most intriguing now that you put your finger on it, and I cannot understand why the Congress has not dug into it -- is the scale of secrecy involved in the uranium deal, the fact that, apparently, there's this Canadian foundation, which doesn't have to disclose what it does with its money or where its money comes from.

So instead of having shattered the glass ceiling, it became how Hillary Clinton shattered her own campaign. And towards the end of the book, there's a whole section -- I'm thinking about writing one of my newsletters on this.

They need to have completed -- show they mean they're going to secure the border. At least 300 miles of the border wall need to be built. They also have to finance it and have a plan in place for the rest of the wall to be built. Second, \"Obama care\" -- I understand Senator McCain is sick. When he gets back, it needs to be repealed, replaced immediately. Third, there needs to be an energy revolution, as Secretary Rick Perry said today, so we create millions of high-paying career jobs in this country. And fourth, we better get that middle class, that corporate tax cut, that multinational corporation repatriation for these companies to invest in America and build factories and manufacturing centers. They don't get that done, they won't deserve reelection, in my opinion. We continue, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, author of the best-selling book \"Understanding Trump.\" Mr. Speaker, those are the -- add Neil Gorsuch, and you got five. The president handled the originalist. I would argue if those four things are not done that there is a very strong possibility 2018 could be a shock election for the country, not good for the Republicans."

And the question is, one, can we have enough energy and drive among our base that they turn out, and two, can we perform well enough that independents decide that they want to reelect us? And I think this comes down in a sense to your list, but also to a deeper sense of, do we represent prosperity, economic growth, higher take-home pay, more jobs or not? Trump, you just him, the president, a minute ago talking about what he wants to do to make America great again. I think that he's in the right general direction. I personally believe that they ought to do as much as they can on health care right now, but they shouldn't spend the whole rest of this year on one issue. They have also got to pass, I think, by Thanksgiving and get signed into law by Thanksgiving, a very large tax cut retroactively designed back to January 1 to make sure that we have enough economic growth in 2018 that Republicans can run as the party of prosperity, of jobs, of higher take- home pay and of economic growth. And I would say the highest focus ought to be on getting the tax bill through because if we don't have economic growth next year, I think we're in real danger of having Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019. If we do get enough economic growth, I think, frankly, we'll probably get reelected."

I'll take health savings accounts opportunities, getting rid of the taxes associated with it. I'll take the opportunity for cooperatives and then getting it better or just repeal it. If that's all they can do for now, do it. How important -- why are -- you -- look, we've been friends for 25 years. I was there emceeing the night you became the speaker of the House.

It's like a military operation in the middle of -- you got to take steps. You have to learn lessons. I think they've got to figure out how to do things faster, more simply. I like what you just said, frankly, about health care. You can't pass the gigantic bill, tell me what you can pass, but get something done that starts to move us away from \"Obama care.\" And I think on each of these things, whether it's infrastructure or it's controlling spending or it's reforming the bureaucracy -- and by the way, the Veterans Administration is a great success story. I think it ranks second only to conservative judges in terms of how the president is starting to really move the country. Deregulation, big success, moving the right direction. I met last Thursday with Secretary Zinke of Interior. He has got a great plan moving in the right direction, former commander of SEAL Team 6 bringing that kind of tough military approach to it. I see things moving in the right direction. But the Congress has got to pick doable things that they can actually get done and not just beat their head against a wall without getting anything done.

But six months ago when it came out, not so much, right? So the president today this morning sends out a statement on Twitter that, you know, political campaigns would have taken opposition research. Political campaigns do take opposition research. And there's a perfect example of it. And not only was it opposition research, but there were set-ups regarding media questions to be asked to go after the -- then the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, to go after his political campaign operation.

And remember, when it was discussed about the substance of the meeting was about adoption, that was information what the substance of the meeting ended up being about. So the reality is they may have said it was going to be opposition research, but it ends up being this Magnitsky Act and the whole issue of Russian adoption, which wasn't even a campaign issue. But take it a step further. Where does the -- you know, draw the lines here, it's not very difficult to see what this is. Everybody is ignoring the fact that this is, you know, politics is a rough and tumble sport. That's the nature of the living in a constitutional republic.

When you look at the facts here of what you have just outlined, and what's been on the record for over six months now, ask yourself why it's not getting the right coverage or why it's not getting coverage. And here's what it is. As on so many issues, it doesn't fit into the narrative. It doesn't fit into the real narrative. You can go back and look at what was going on during the Iran negotiations, the so-called negotiations with Iran and this, you know, reset with the Russians, all of these issues. It doesn't fit into a narrative. Therefore, it's not covered. Fortunately you are covering it. But the reality is that if it doesn't fit into the particular narrative of the media, as you did, Sean, I did five of them yesterday. It was amazing to me to see both the inconsistency and the consistency of what they are trying to get to say versus what you're actually saying and what's the real issue.

We decided to send our cameras all across the country to find out the source of this deep-rooted Trump hate, and that is the subject of tonight's mini monologue. All right, so the mainstream alt-left establishment media goes on and on about how unpopular President Trump is with you, the American people. But this weekend's protests tell a very different story. Small, sparsely attended rallies across some of America's most liberal cities barely garnered news coverage. Those in attendance, they seemed to be protesting a variety of issues that they attributed to the election of president Trump. And, of course, the anti-Trump hysteria is being pushed by CNN, MSNBC, and other fake news outlets. It was all front and center. In case you had better things to do with your weekend, which I imagine you probably did, rather than march around with a sign and mindlessly chant rhyming slogans, well, you're going to want to take a look at what went down at Saturday's sad antifascism rallies and the failure that they were.

      "utterance": "Woodstock revisited. Let's go back to the old days. Now, why were they so small and so disjointed? Why do these protests even matter to you? Let me tell you why. Maybe the establishment media, 24/7, NBC, CNN, maybe they have it wrong yet again with more fake news. Perhaps most people in this country, the people that get up every day and work hard and play by the rules and pay their taxes, maybe they don't really care about this phony, made up Russian collusion conspiracy theory that they have been shoving down your throat for the last, what, 11 months. Maybe the people in poverty, 50 million, the people on food stamps, 50 million, the 94 million out of the labor force, the worst recovery since the 40s, worst home ownership rate in 51 years, maybe Americans care of about that, the great people that get up every day and make this country great. Maybe they are really hoping, the forgotten men and women of this country, are actually hoping that President Trump and his agenda work and get the country back on track again and the country becomes great again. They don't care about these stupid signs and slogans. Coming up, Monica Crowley reacts to this monologue and on Trump hate. And later tonight, conservative political commentator Tomi Lahren, she will have the final word each and every night this week. And she will be on \"The Specialist\" later this week right here tonight on Hannity."

      "utterance": "You know, Sean, the protesters in the 1960s actually had real cause. Civil rights, Vietnam. These protesters are motivated by nothing except a personal hatred for Donald Trump. And when they are asked specifically what is it about Donald Trump? What is it about his agenda? What is it about his policies? They can't really come up with anything except for a lot of the lies and mistruths that they are hearing from the fake news."

And I'm thinking about this, to what extent, because it's 24/7. They are not covering Ukraine interference in our election. They are not covering Uranium One and quid pro quo and the pay to play. They are not covering the phony dossier to confuse our election, Fusion GPS supporting. Is this people that are motivated and indoctrinated by these 24/7 one note Charlie establishment media people, the sheep in the media?"

We know the left has had these armies of Cretans that have come out to protest anything a Republican president has done going all the way to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush. So that element of it is not new. What is new I think is the level of intensity and activism against this particular president by the mainstream media as well as some of these protesters that you're seeing on the street. They so hate Donald Trump and they so hate what he represents as something new and different, somebody who is going to come in and smash the existing system and then reform it, I think they see him as a unique kind of threat. And that's why you get the seeping over from the media into the streets, into these kinds of protests."

If the president gets the items of the agenda that I talked about earlier in the show accomplished, and the Congress finally moves and does their job, all this noise won't mean a thing if people are back to work, out of poverty, and off of food stamps and buying homes. It won't matter."

If he can do that it forgives all else. Just ask Bill Clinton. He had the same kind of situation, a booming economy in the 90s, and guess what, he survived."

      "speaker": "LAHREN",
      "utterance": "Hey, Sean, my final word tonight is this. Let's make the GOP work again. Yes, let's absolutely start with the border wall. For every hour our Republican representatives sit around and talk about this, thousands more illegal immigrants and who knows what else pour into our country. Sean, I am so sick about hearing about the 11 million illegal immigrants living in this country. Priority one has to be to secure the border before 11 million more flood in. We know physical barriers work, and that's why Democrats and even some Republicans don't like them. It's not a money problem or a policy problem. It's a priority problem. The same thing with Obamacare. The mandate from the American people on November 8th was clear -- repeal and replace. Replace the open ended entitlement program known as Obamacare, replace it with liberty. And let's figure out some common sense solution to our health care problem, solutions that don't involve a blank check, by the way. And yes, energy independence is another nonnegotiable. God blessed this land with abundant natural resources. And to think we aren't taking full advantage of science, technology, and innovation all because some snowflakes want to stage another protest, that's absolutely ludicrous. Energy innovation equals jobs and independence, two things the American people absolutely need. Here's what else we need -- middle-class and corporate tax cuts. The silent majority has waited long enough for this. Hardworking Americans are sick and tired of working their tails off to fund bloated government. It's about time we give them some relief and the ability to keep more of what they earn. The government pays for nothing. The American taxpayer pays for everything, and it's time to make America open for business again. Many of our GOP leaders rode into office on Trump's coattails, so it's time they get to work and put America and Americans first. That's the final word. Take care, Sean."
