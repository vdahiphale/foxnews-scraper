      "sentences": "Hmm. I'd say that's an about face, except they're always talking out of their asses. That was a while ago, but this is the left. The problem is never the crime. It's the effect it has politically. Or as Ezra Klein puts it, how crime hurts the liberal project. Liberal project it. Gets it's like the Lincoln project except you molest everyone. Allegedly. In a tweet thread. He says this, violence is spiking. Homicides were up by 25 to 40 percent in 2020. The largest single year increase since 1960. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And 2021 isn't looking any better. Now remember, this is from a New York Times liberal, which is why Klein has to add. This is a crisis on its own terms, but it's also a crisis for the broader liberal project. And he's right, all those dead people make defunding the police look really bad. But Klein knew he couldn't get his side to care, unless he suggested that not caring would threaten their political fortunes. They only feel your pain to get elected. He then adds that violent crime causes families to leave cities, businesses to close, banks refusing loans, his property values drop. There are lifelong impacts that traumatized kids. So wait, is he talking about crime or liberalism? Now this might be the point where Klein sees the value in policing. But instead he focuses on political fallout. Like the Atlanta Mayor isn't running again after being called soft on crime. He points out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There's a recall effort in San Francisco district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who so far has banned cash bail and release felons from jail. Both his parents were weather underground domestic terrorists, I guess the grenade doesn't fall far from the tree. And now Klein were his crimes, the top concern in NYC behind COVID which leads to is key fear. If these numbers keep getting worse than as with Nixon and Reagan in the 70s and 80s it could bring law and order conservatives, including Trump back to power in 2024. So there you go. The reason why you should address crime, it's not about the victims. It's who returns to power. He fears that rising crime could bring back leaders who care about rising crime. He's literally afraid of safe streets. What else is he afraid of? Child car seats and toothpaste with fluoride? Klein realizes that as crime rises, citizens don't vote for liberals. So either you fight the crime or you get more criminals to vote. So what's Klein's solution? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, more liberal policies apparently. Yes, cities destroyed by left wingers just need more of them. That's like giving Dana another picture of her dog. But now they see crime victims are less inclined to sympathize with the liberal system that lets this mayhem unfold. But instead of empathizing, the Dems fret about their power, they say, well, we could lose elections, when they should be asking, why is the crime happening? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But they can't because the answers in the mirror, it's the policies they push. So the only way they could deplore violence is through its political consequences, as opposed to the looting and the rioting that caused billions in damages. Which is why their idea of eliminating the crime problem is to eliminate the stats, just stop arresting shoplifters. Who cares if it's so out of control? Walgreens has closed 17 of its stores in San Francisco alone. Who does that hurt? Not the media, or the rich. No, it's the poor, the elderly, the minorities in those areas. I wonder what the angry white male has to say. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Hmm. I'd say that's an about face, except they're always talking out of their asses. That was a while ago, but this is the left. The problem is never the crime. It's the effect it has politically. Or as Ezra Klein puts it, how crime hurts the liberal project. Liberal project it. Gets it's like the Lincoln project except you molest everyone. Allegedly. In a tweet thread. He says this, violence is spiking. Homicides were up by 25 to 40 percent in 2020. The largest single year increase since 1960. And 2021 isn't looking any better. Now remember, this is from a New York Times liberal, which is why Klein has to add. This is a crisis on its own terms, but it's also a crisis for the broader liberal project. And he's right, all those dead people make defunding the police look really bad. But Klein knew he couldn't get his side to care, unless he suggested that not caring would threaten their political fortunes. They only feel your pain to get elected. He then adds that violent crime causes families to leave cities, businesses to close, banks refusing loans, his property values drop. There are lifelong impacts that traumatized kids. So wait, is he talking about crime or liberalism? Now this might be the point where Klein sees the value in policing. But instead he focuses on political fallout. Like the Atlanta Mayor isn't running again after being called soft on crime. He points out. There's a recall effort in San Francisco district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who so far has banned cash bail and release felons from jail. Both his parents were weather underground domestic terrorists, I guess the grenade doesn't fall far from the tree. And now Klein were his crimes, the top concern in NYC behind COVID which leads to is key fear. If these numbers keep getting worse than as with Nixon and Reagan in the 70s and 80s it could bring law and order conservatives, including Trump back to power in 2024. So there you go. The reason why you should address crime, it's not about the victims. It's who returns to power. He fears that rising crime could bring back leaders who care about rising crime. He's literally afraid of safe streets. What else is he afraid of? Child car seats and toothpaste with fluoride? Klein realizes that as crime rises, citizens don't vote for liberals. So either you fight the crime or you get more criminals to vote. So what's Klein's solution? Well, more liberal policies apparently. Yes, cities destroyed by left wingers just need more of them. That's like giving Dana another picture of her dog. But now they see crime victims are less inclined to sympathize with the liberal system that lets this mayhem unfold. But instead of empathizing, the Dems fret about their power, they say, well, we could lose elections, when they should be asking, why is the crime happening? But they can't because the answers in the mirror, it's the policies they push. So the only way they could deplore violence is through its political consequences, as opposed to the looting and the rioting that caused billions in damages. Which is why their idea of eliminating the crime problem is to eliminate the stats, just stop arresting shoplifters. Who cares if it's so out of control? Walgreens has closed 17 of its stores in San Francisco alone. Who does that hurt? Not the media, or the rich. No, it's the poor, the elderly, the minorities in those areas. I wonder what the angry white male has to say."

He has a podcast where he asked do Democrats have an answer to violence? The answer is obviously no, because we've let them try experiment running our cities for decades. Their answer is always to throw for more money and apply more bureaucracy to a situation instead of actually saying maybe we need to shrink things here. Maybe we need to rebudget. Maybe we need to do these different things. Instead, their entire worldview has calcified into something that's actually more tolerant of criminal behavior. I mean, I live in Washington, D.C.

Look, I'm getting that. All right. Actually, it's too many expose shoulders and low necklines. So you've got the quite scandalous photos on the left and the crude Photoshopped ones on the right. They might as well add bonnets and butter churns. Apparently, Bartram Trail High School's yearbook coordinator, a teacher decided the photos were out of dress code. It did some editing. Mostly adding more clothing to the chest and shoulder areas. I can say that right. So was there a teacher a jerka for adding digital burkas? Oh, man. A district spokesman says it was a teacher who was doing the best she could. I agree. And I think there was no mal intent. She thought she was doing the right thing and trying to be helpful. And I think ultimately, though, it was a mistake. Wow. For now, the school is offering $100 refund to anyone who wants to return the yearbook. Still, I'm glad there was no such thing as photo editing in my day. Here's my unretouched yearbook photo. Can't mess with perfection, I guess. Strange shape of the box, though.

Fauci sipped follows imports that three researchers that the Wuhan Institute of Neurology or with were hospitalized with coronavirus. Symptoms in November 2019. In May of 2020, Fauci in the World Health Organization dismissed the lab leak theory as poppycock, bunkum, and possibly Balderdash. Who disagreed?

I made this mistake than sitting in enjoying dinner with 11 other vaccinated people. That's like the one correct thing you've done over a year now. Your apology, what you should have said is, you know, my bad, I did nothing wrong, you should be able to do it too. Because other people who get busted for this, it's a little worse than them having to sit with their taxpayer funded P.R. team a cup with a statement they lose their licenses, they lose their livelihoods. So, she's to say you're right. I'm a total hypocritical. You guys can live your life especially because it came out -- in Texas, there's been no measurable effects and hospitalizations, deaths or even COVID cases by opening 100 percent to do that, and then also take away anyone who lost their license take that away Take any of the you know, anyone who's prosecuted for this take that away.

All right, Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he will sign a bill that increases penalties for protesters who block roads and obstruct emergency vehicles. Hopefully that includes ice cream trucks.

That chaos won't be tolerated in Texas.\" Well, let's just start hopefully this will expand to protect other users of public roads like truckers, private citizens and prostitutes.
