At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.

The President has shown a willingness to compromise. You heard it tonight. In a funding request to the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, the President asked for items that are also important to Democrats. He alluded to this tonight. Of course, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, and that includes medical support and additional facilities to house migrants, which frankly a lot of Americans probably think would be better spent on Inner City Youth and our veterans.

He had been deported two times, and then he ran people off the road and he shot and he put seven other people in the hospital. So, to say that that's not a common occurrence is just absurd.

And I think it is sad that the APA lent its authority as an institution, lent its credibility as an institution to these guidelines, which are steeped in language, really, of fourth wave feminism.

Jack is all about serving his customers and serving people of all faiths, of all walks of life. But he can't express all messages, and no artist should have to do that. What is even more telling about this setup by Autumn Scardina is that a few weeks later, he called back, and this time requesting a cake asking Jack to celebrate Satan's birthday and promote marijuana. What's even more astounding is that the Colorado commission saw this setup, and 24 days from when the Supreme Court ruled, it decided to get on Autumn Scardina's bus and pursue the hostility and harassment that he was attempting to invoke and put on Jack Phillips.",

My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers, cutting edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected President. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because Democrats will not fund border security. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.

We've an unbelievable series of panels tonight, plus some important cultural and free-speech debates you are not going to want to miss. But first, who are the real shutdown opportunists? That's the focus of tonight's Angle. All right. However you received the President's address tonight, one thing should not be missed. The President scored a major media coup. What am I talking about?

They're targeting them. What do I mean? They refuse to move even a millimeter, the Democrats, towards a commonsense compromise with the President. Now, remember, a year ago, they were willing to give him $25 billion for a wall. Schumer ultimately pulled that off the table. But they were willing to do that. Now, today, they can't even come up with a measly $5 billion. Think of all the waste, fraud and abuse in this town that they could trim a way to get that $5 billion. We'll talk about that in a bit. The President has shown a willingness to compromise. You heard it tonight. In a funding request to the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, the President asked for items that are also important to Democrats. He alluded to this tonight. Of course, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, and that includes medical support and additional facilities to house migrants, which frankly a lot of Americans probably think would be better spent on Inner City Youth and our veterans. But nevertheless, the President is willing to go there. The President is also requesting $675 million for new technology to detect and stop the flow of illegal drugs over the border. Democrats have long said they wanted that. But Democrats don't want to have an honest conversation about border security. They are now the party of obstruction, and everything must bend to their resist-Trump goals. The Hill reports that their latest strategy is to jam up of the Senate by refusing to consider any legislation until the government is reopened."

What? So we're not going to support - oppose boycotts against Israel because Trump wants to do a deal on the border wall? How is that governing in a mature way? Now, I'm sure the new anti-semitic wing of the Democratic Party was thrilled about this development in the Senate, but nevertheless most Americans aren't. Again, don't focus on what they say. It sounds fine, kind of reasonable. Watch what they do. The Democrats want this shutdown to go on as long as possible to divide as many Republicans from the President as they can. They want to peel one off after another and then they want to ratchet up the political pressure. Our safety and our security, forget that bill. That's damned. If they wanted the government reopened, the Democrats could negotiate with the President and reopen the government tomorrow. He's already compromised on the structure of the wall, and he's dropped his asking price, as we know, way down. And while the Democrats feign concern over spending a few billion on the border wall, $5.7 billion, the coastal wonder twins of their party, Governor Newsom of California and Mayor De Blasio of New York have all kinds of money.

Think about that. But the Democrats, they don't have any answer to that. It's not like they're going to go out there and argue, OK, we're going to offer these three policies and they're going to raise your standard of living to a higher level than President Trump has been able to do. No, they've given up on that. All they have to run on is this shutdown and their opposition to the wall. \"Oh, sorry,\" and \"Trump is a racist.\" That's all they have. Oh, and for an added bonus, they actually believe that this stalemate with the shutdown furnishes them with another political weapon to, guess what, further the real nirvana for Americans because this is really going to help your life get better, the impeachment agenda.

It's where we have anywhere from 11 million to 20 million people here illegally already, and we have - we're the most generous country in the world as far as immigration per some time. 60 million people almost. The greatest percentage we've ever had, 15 percent of the population. So 400,000 may not seem as great as it used to be, a million, but it's still an enormous number given the poll we had. And Trump was very wise not to fall into that immigration trap that Reagan fell into a quarter - a third of a century ago when he gave up amnesty and he gave up border security on the promise that he would get a wall or some security, and he never got it, and illegal immigration skyrocketed. The problem, Laura, is not that the Democrats are worried the wall doesn't work. Historically, we know it does. It works in Eastern Europe, Kuwait. Nancy Pelosi's Barack Obama - I have a wall I've built myself with a friend. It works. It stopped entry into my home. But the problem is it works too well. And if - believe me, if electronic surveillance and drones work better than a wall, then the Democrats would be saying that they were both technologically cruel or racist or inadequate or improper."

In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading and dismembering his neighbor. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?"

He is the President of the National Border Patrol Council. Every day he sees firsthand just how bad this crisis on the border is, and he even met with President Trump just last week about it. And Irwin Carmichael is the former Sheriff of Mecklenburg County in North Carolina. Now, he was defeated after he supported a program that allowed his police department to cooperate with ICE and the detainers that are placed on illegal immigrants. And Dr. Jeffrey Mazin. Last year, his son was shot dead by an illegal alien who made it back into the country despite being previously deported. Thank you all for being here. Brandon, you would think that if Democrats felt that they - they had the - I don't know - the upper hand in this debate. They wouldn't be afraid - right - to step in and say, I don't buy it, let's sit down and have a conversation. They don't want to discuss the specifics. They don't want to discuss the case of Irwin's family and so many other families across the country that have been devastated by illegal immigration. They want to - they just hide behind the cliches of, oh, we're a country of immigrants. That's - that's about it for them."

If we go back and we look at what President Trump said, I believe that The New York Times was fact-checking him in real-time. The New York Times found nothing wrong with what he said. They did not say that he lied about anything. But now let's - let's compare what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi said. They said that border barriers don't work. That's false. I can personally tell you that border barriers do, in fact, work. I've worked on the border, pre-barriers, post-barriers. And illegal immigration has dropped exponentially when we've had them. They say that the American people do not want border barriers. That's not necessarily true. It depends upon what poll you're looking at. Then they say that they're for border security. If that was a fact, why aren't they laying out a plan and telling us exactly what they want? Instead, it's the President of the United States that is laying out the plan, and the plan is sound."

And what I know personally is that what he is trying to do is he is trying to protect the American people. He cares about the American people, and because he does care about them, he is trying to secure the border. Why don't the Democrats want to do the same thing?

DWI being the number one crime in this county, and the gentleman, officer seen from California, two DWIs by the suspect prior to. He should have been removed from the country.

Ryon McDermott a psychologist at the University of South Alabama who helped draft these guidelines asks unironically \"What is gender in the 2010's? It's no longer just this male-female binary. If we can change men, we can change the world.\" What exactly are we trying to change them to? Do modern women really dislike traditional masculinity? Here to help us answer this is Emily Jashinsky, senior culture editor at \"The Federalist,\" and radio talk show host Jamila Bey. Emily, let's start with you. What do you think this attack on what is known as traditional masculinity is all about? EMILY JASHINSKY, CULTURAL EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, so the APA specifically names in their definition of traditional masculinity competitiveness, stoicism, all qualities that I think a lot of young women like myself and women of all ages really probably find attractive, probably find compelling. And I think it is sad that the APA lent its authority as an institution, lent its credibility as an institution to these guidelines, which are steeped in language, really, of fourth wave feminism. There's lots of hints at intersectionality, there's talk of privilege, there's talk of all of these different buzzwords.

It was a ruling in favor of a Colorado Christian baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because he said it violated his religious beliefs. Now that same man, Jack Phillips, is suing the state of Colorado, accusing the Colorado civil rights commission of antireligious bias. So what is going on here? The group ruled that Phillips discriminated against Autumn Scardina, an attorney and transgender woman, for the refusal to bake her cake to celebrate her transition. Not so coincidentally, she asked for the cake the same day they Supreme Court announced that it would take up the original Masterpiece Cakeshop case. Joining me now for an Ingraham Angle exclusive is Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, and his attorney Kristen Waggoner, from the Alliance Defending Freedom. Jack Scardina's attorney is arguing the following, saying, \"Nothing about the design of the cake -- a pink cake with blue frosting -- or the event, a birthday, violates any religious belief held by Mr. Phillips.\" There you have it.

They Jack, they love going to Jack's cakeshop because they know they are going to be able to get somewhere with the state commission on this issue, but you heard the argument, and the commission makes this point as well in a statement, and I will read it for you. They say I don't think there is any hostility in the record with respect to religion. There was a single commission member who after this decision was decided expressed his views somewhat inartfully that he doesn't like it when religious views are used as a justification to harm other people. But that's actually the law of the United States, you can't harm other people because it is in your religious belief to do so. So what is going on here? Pink cake on the outside, blue on the inside, I have already gotten confused by that. But what is happening here?"

He said he wanted a cake that reflected and celebrated his gender transition. That is the message he wanted in a cake. Jack is all about serving his customers and serving people of all faiths, of all walks of life. But he can't express all messages, and no artist should have to do that. What is even more telling about this setup by Autumn Scardina is that a few weeks later, he called back, and this time requesting a cake asking Jack to celebrate Satan's birthday and promote marijuana. What's even more astounding is that the Colorado commission saw this setup, and 24 days from when the Supreme Court ruled, it decided to get on Autumn Scardina's bus and pursue the hostility and harassment that he was attempting to invoke and put on Jack Phillips."
