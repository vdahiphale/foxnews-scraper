      "sentences": "-- sick to my stomach. Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a butt (ph) Frisbee, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. As Donald Trump signs yet another trade deal and reveals the Middle East peace plan amid an economic boom, it raises a key question. How can a president do so many effective things and still face a hateful opposition? If you ask people to grade his work based on their lives, they will tell you things are great because the results are obvious. More jobs, higher wages, peace, prosperity. But if you ask them about impeachment or about the president in general, the responses will vary. So why is that? Well, maybe they know what happens if you say anything nice about Trump. Or it could also be Trump's personality. If he rubbed you the wrong way four years ago, maybe he still does. But also the media runs the turf where facts and opinions can be molded into any narrative they desire. We know the golden oldies. Trump is unstable. He's about to cause World War III. He is a racist. He's not responsible for this economy. All are a matter of opinion, born from emotion disconnected from concrete results. And yet, like a t-shirt canon, the media can shoot those messages to you at home and call it an honest day's work. It's safe to say much of the disconnect between Trump's results and the polls are largely media driven. The media is like the bitter ex-spouse whispering bad things to the kids about the other parent. And impeachment is their way to really tar the guy, and they aren't even hiding it. The upside to all this, it seems impeachment really revs up an already competitive president. You try to bring him down and he just does more. If you keep at this, he will probably cure the Coronavirus and make China pay for it. Juan, that monologue was dedicated to you. It was like dedicating a song. I think you would agree, Juan, that with the trade deals, the peace plans, the dead terrorists. Impeachment has made Trump the most effective president in our lifetimes.",

      "sentences": "-- the entire media, OK? Relax. We're just telling the truth over here. Here's what I see what's going on right now, the hatred, all right? Trump is beating the Democrats at their own game. Usually, you can tell a Republican and say, you know, you're only good for Wall Street and you are not good for Main Street. But for the first time in a long time, this president has been good for both. And this has been a bottom up recovery. And not only that, for the working men and women, wages are up, but also for blacks and Hispanics. So that makes the Democrats furious that he's doing what they've been promising to do for three decades and haven't been able to do. And a businessman comes in and does it in three years. So there is an all out assault on him. The second thing is he goes on offense constantly, either it's on Twitter, if it's on the press conferences, we're not used to having a president just bludgeon the opposition so forcefully and so aggressively on all spectrums 24 hours a day. It's unsettling to a lot of people. And people just aren't used to it. And then third, I just think the speaking style is jarring for a lot of people. He's from Queens. He is brash. He gets right to the point and is very politically incorrect. So it's unnerving to hear the president of the United States go directly at people like that and just shake things down to the core. So at the end of the day, you've made this analogy. And I will double down on that, although it's not an Earl Campbell analogy. If you have a platoon leader, you don't like him but you respect him, and he keeps killing the enemy. Or you have a CEO who is robbing you crazy, keeps you at work until 9:00 p.m. But the earnings are fantastic and you've got a great bonus. Or what about a football coach? He's yelling at you all the time. He's making you run sprints but you just won the Super Bowl.

And the answer is because the Senate doesn't want to have a precedent set where the House can just send over any kind of impeachment process without doing all of the work. And as the attorney argued today for the White House, that would enable the Senate to become an investigatory body. It would then force them to be in impeachment forever as the House sends over partisan impeachment. And it's important to point out that there are two sets of witnesses here. The House interviewed 17 people. Those people's testimony has been used in the Senate trial on both sides to prove a point. There's nobody in the Clinton trial who testified in the House and then testified in the Senate who wasn't interviewed before the articles of impeachment and the entire House case was sent to the Senate.

It goes to all the other agencies and you're not always sure exactly how long it's going to take or what information is there.

      "utterance": "-- sick to my stomach. Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld, with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a butt (ph) Frisbee, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. As Donald Trump signs yet another trade deal and reveals the Middle East peace plan amid an economic boom, it raises a key question. How can a president do so many effective things and still face a hateful opposition? If you ask people to grade his work based on their lives, they will tell you things are great because the results are obvious. More jobs, higher wages, peace, prosperity. But if you ask them about impeachment or about the president in general, the responses will vary. So why is that? Well, maybe they know what happens if you say anything nice about Trump. Or it could also be Trump's personality. If he rubbed you the wrong way four years ago, maybe he still does. But also the media runs the turf where facts and opinions can be molded into any narrative they desire. We know the golden oldies. Trump is unstable. He's about to cause World War III. He is a racist. He's not responsible for this economy. All are a matter of opinion, born from emotion disconnected from concrete results. And yet, like a t-shirt canon, the media can shoot those messages to you at home and call it an honest day's work. It's safe to say much of the disconnect between Trump's results and the polls are largely media driven. The media is like the bitter ex-spouse whispering bad things to the kids about the other parent. And impeachment is their way to really tar the guy, and they aren't even hiding it. The upside to all this, it seems impeachment really revs up an already competitive president. You try to bring him down and he just does more. If you keep at this, he will probably cure the Coronavirus and make China pay for it. Juan, that monologue was dedicated to you. It was like dedicating a song. I think you would agree, Juan, that with the trade deals, the peace plans, the dead terrorists. Impeachment has made Trump the most effective president in our lifetimes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Really? Well, first, on the Coronavirus. I have had the sniffles lately. It's been a great concern today because I've --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Now, maybe I don't want him to do. I put eye drops in your coffee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Oh, don't do it. Don't do it. Anyway, in response, I would say this. You could say that, yes, I think the USMCA is a good thing -- especially for our farmers, our trade deals. That is good stuff. I would say if he really had a Middle East peace plan, I would say marvelous. Boy, that would solve so many problems. But that doesn't negate that what he did with President Zelensky and the Ukraine is bad. I mean, it's like saying, yeah, I'm a good person but I robbed somebody. That doesn't work. You can't say to the judge, oh, Katie, Katie is a wonderful partner, but you know, she just beats someone in the head and therefore forget --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, no, because what we heard today, in fact, was this argument about abuse of power. The most amazing part of today, by the way, Alan Dershowitz saying, oh, you know what, if the president believes that his re-election is in the national interest then it doesn't matter. You can't impeach him on that. So he is a king, anything, anything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "No, that's actually true if you believe you are an effective president. But the other thing, too, they don't -- abuse of power is not criteria because it's new vague, Dana. It's vague. You can say that about any policy you don't like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. They -- for any time -- remember when President Obama said I don't need you Congress. I've got a pen and a phone. People were like, you can't do that, you have to go through the Democratic process. But nobody impeach him over it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "We tried."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I'm not making a direct analogy here. But I think that the -- Patrick Philbin, the lawyer for the president's team, he's really effective I think at explaining things to people. And when he emphasized you have not proven these things beyond a reasonable doubt, so anybody who has served on a jury or watched one on TV, that is the standard. Beyond a reasonable doubt, and they haven't done that. And I also think that with the news today, that Cory Gardner of Colorado, the Senator there, has said no on witnesses. I think it is safe to say that by Friday, Mitchell McConnell will have the votes. There will be no witnesses, and the president will be acquitted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You know I consider myself a legal expert from my years of watching Law and Order, so I have to back you up on this. Jesse, we're all going to the Super Bowl, so I thought I would go with a Super Bowl analogy, a football analogy. You know, with this new trade deal and the peace deal. Isn't Donald Trump like Earl Campbell? You know, he can cross the goal line carrying people in. Remember Earl Campbell? He was a big back and he would run. It's like when people would jump on him, he would just move forward and score. Isn't Trump more effective when he has such resistance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "That's right, and we are the offensive linemen, OK, helping him plough the field, right Juan? Fair and balanced. Now, here's the thing about this analogy --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "-- the entire media, OK? Relax. We're just telling the truth over here. Here's what I see what's going on right now, the hatred, all right? Trump is beating the Democrats at their own game. Usually, you can tell a Republican and say, you know, you're only good for Wall Street and you are not good for Main Street. But for the first time in a long time, this president has been good for both. And this has been a bottom up recovery. And not only that, for the working men and women, wages are up, but also for blacks and Hispanics. So that makes the Democrats furious that he's doing what they've been promising to do for three decades and haven't been able to do. And a businessman comes in and does it in three years. So there is an all out assault on him. The second thing is he goes on offense constantly, either it's on Twitter, if it's on the press conferences, we're not used to having a president just bludgeon the opposition so forcefully and so aggressively on all spectrums 24 hours a day. It's unsettling to a lot of people. And people just aren't used to it. And then third, I just think the speaking style is jarring for a lot of people. He's from Queens. He is brash. He gets right to the point and is very politically incorrect. So it's unnerving to hear the president of the United States go directly at people like that and just shake things down to the core. So at the end of the day, you've made this analogy. And I will double down on that, although it's not an Earl Campbell analogy. If you have a platoon leader, you don't like him but you respect him, and he keeps killing the enemy. Or you have a CEO who is robbing you crazy, keeps you at work until 9:00 p.m. But the earnings are fantastic and you've got a great bonus. Or what about a football coach? He's yelling at you all the time. He's making you run sprints but you just won the Super Bowl. You don't have to love the guy to respect him because winning is most important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You know, Katie, you usually get your facts straight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Yep."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. Dana brought up the fact that it's probably there won't be any witnesses. Is that a good thing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it depends. I mean, you can be open to new witnesses who were not part of the House process. But the problem is that the House is sending over a case that doesn't have everything done. So the Senate, you can -- the question is if you are a senator how could you vote against witnesses at this point, knowing what you know about John Bolton and the book? And the answer is because the Senate doesn't want to have a precedent set where the House can just send over any kind of impeachment process without doing all of the work. And as the attorney argued today for the White House, that would enable the Senate to become an investigatory body. It would then force them to be in impeachment forever as the House sends over partisan impeachment. And it's important to point out that there are two sets of witnesses here. The House interviewed 17 people. Those people's testimony has been used in the Senate trial on both sides to prove a point. There's nobody in the Clinton trial who testified in the House and then testified in the Senate who wasn't interviewed before the articles of impeachment and the entire House case was sent to the Senate. And so that's -- I think senators are looking at it and saying, we are not the House and you need to do your job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And you know the rebuttal came from the Democrats who said there have been 15 impeachments and witnesses, in all of them, including in one case. I think this was the Johnson case, like 37 of the 40 had not testified in the House but testified in the Senate. So it's not like this is unprecedented."
    },

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "The impeachment trial continuing on Capitol Hill where senators -- they're getting their chance to ask both legal teams questions. We are monitoring that. We'll bring you the latest. But first, the White House is telling John Bolton not to publish his upcoming book until classified material is removed. And a recent interview with the former national security advisor is getting a lot of attention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "I will be meeting President Zelensky. He and President Trump have already spoken twice. The president called to congratulate President Zelensky on his election and on his success in the parliamentary election. They were very warm and cordial calls. We are hoping that they will be able to meet in Warsaw and have a few minutes together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So there we have -- not unusual, Katie, for the National Security Council to -- I mean, that is the process. You look through it. You might have to ask the CIA, DNI, like, is everything OK? But this is getting extra scrutiny because they had it for a month. And now is the only time that they're first telling them, wait, we've got some problems."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I -- you know, the question -- the publisher of Bolton, his team, have denied leaking this information to the New York Times. And I actually think that's true, because it's not in Bolton's interest to have the book held up forever, not to get it published in March. And because of this leak, now they are looking at it even more thoroughly for classified information. And when you submit a book for classification review, it doesn't just go to your agency. It goes to all the other agencies and you're not always sure exactly how long it's going to take or what information is there. A lot of the media today made this a big deal and said that the president was threatening John Bolton about the book, that they may not publish it. They were simply asked to take out classified information, which is exactly what this review is for. And given that interview that we just played, I think it is very clear that Bolton's so-called allegation about what happened that was published in the New York Times and the second-hand reading of the manuscript may not be all that Adam Schiff and the Democrats are making it out to be. Which is why you are seeing all these other Democrats now possibly coming out for acquittal, which if you're voting for acquittal, you are unlikely to vote for John Bolton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I wanted to mention that. Jesse, it's possible that you could have some bipartisan agreement on acquittal. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Doug Jones of Alabama, they said they're undecided. But as people who count knows -- think that they might vote with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I understand why. In Arizona, impeachment is underwater by 10 points. In Alabama, it's underwater by 15, in West Virginia, 25 points. Impeachment is underwater. I don't see how Manchin or someone like that could vote against their own constituents and side with Chuck Schumer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Can I play the Manchin sound bite about Hunter Biden? Take a listen to this."

      "utterance": "Is Hunter Biden a relevant witness, Senator?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "You know, I think so. I really do. I don't have a problem there, because this is why we are where we are. Now, I think that he could clear himself. What I know and what I've heard, but being afraid to put anybody that might have pertinent information is wrong, no matter if you are a Democrat or Republican."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So Juan, do you think that Democrats might lose a couple of folks that will vote for acquittal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, but you know it's possible, you know. Might is the, you know, operative word there on your part. But to me, what is more interesting at the moment is Republicans who would vote not to hear witnesses when you have 75 percent of the American people, it's pretty overwhelming. And if when you want to talk about people underwater, let's go talk about Cory Gardner in Colorado, you know? Let's talk about what's going on in Arizona. Let's go talk about some of these other Republicans. And for them, the challenge is that once President Trump is acquitted, as we think is likely as we sit here Wednesday evening. He's going to say this is proof. I've been vindicated. You know, it's all over. And these Republicans who vote -- even before acquittal, but vote to block witnesses and to block the admission of new documents are going to be loaded. It's going to be on their backs. At the top of the ticket, they're going to have to explain why you think a fair trial does not include the guy who is the most pertinent to direct testimony about what the president is doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I don't think they are going to run against impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And also, if you're Cory Gardner and you vote -- let's say he has a tough race ahead of him in Colorado, and you vote against the president, then you're going to have no support in Colorado at all anyway. Greg, how do you think about the media's played all of this as they wait to see -- every development that they -- oh, McConnell is going to lose. Just last night that they thought McConnell didn't have the votes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Because -- and now you just sit there and you go that's wrong. And no matter what they say, you just go that's wrong. That's wrong. I'm going to wait until tomorrow. I'm going to wait 24 hours. And you know it's always wrong because they are wrong on everything. And to Bolton's point and to Katie's point, I even -- I have problems even with people here at Fox jumping on Bolton the way they do. Because I don't see how the leak was so damaging. Even though I really still don't really know what the leak is. But the leak, what I hear, vindicates Trump. And I said this -- I said this, like, three days ago, and it is true. It vindicates him because it says he was concerned about corruption in Ukraine. And that was behind his action, which by the way was a quid pro quo. And apparently, a quid pro quo happens to be OK and part of foreign policy, as Dershowitz had pointed out a number of times. And there was an interesting point where Schiff actually gave a little window to quid pro quo, and said, well, you know, there are good quid pro quos. Oh, I thought a quid pro quo was supposed to be evil."

The Rick Wilson's of the world, they're -- now they're kind of stuck in this feedback loop where all they can do is go on CNN and put out. They put out, they invite you back. And that's all that was. So Lemon kind of hung them out to dry there. But I don't -- I don't look down on them because I was them. You know, I was them. I was a never-Trumper. And then when he was elected president, I decided to give them a chance, focus on the measurable results and not the -- not the tweets, and he's impressed me, and I've changed my tune.

You know, America has a much different medical system, both in terms of tech and how they treat things like this, then China does.

Are you going to put the travel ban up today or are you going to wait a week, are you going to wait two weeks, are you going to wait three weeks? I think out of the abundance of caution may be a slap the ban on now, but what you do is you then risk kind of an economic downturn in China that can spread throughout the globe. Right now, our economy, I don't know if that could withstand an international health crisis with the travel ban and all the bilateral trade we have with the Chinese. Is it -- is it worth the risk to do that? And that's a calculation they're going to have to make. But China right now is teetering not because of the slow growth, and you know, the bad press with Hong Kong and the Uighurs, but this virus right now. And it's a country that's very consumed with pride, right flurry, and very attuned to press, international press. And this virus, that is the worst type of PR you can have.

But apparently, this virus does - - you don't show any symptoms for two weeks. So I think, you know, we have to remember that in 1920, 100 million people died worldwide because of the flu. More people died because of that flu than died in World War One and World War Two combined. And that's why you have so many people around the world who are -- their full-time job is dedicated to staying one step ahead of one of these types of flu. So governments, they can have a lot of cooperation. Elizabeth Warren is suggesting that one of the things that we should do is rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, because that will show the interconnect -- because I think you know, candidates just do this. They like throw it out there because they'll say that as the temperature rises, you'll have more of these outbreaks.

OK, you have -- you have China -- U.S. people go into China, China people -- Chinese people -- Chinese go into the U.S. OK, now watch this. Cross this out. Is this actually any better? Half an equation is meaningless. For this to work, you have to cross out -- you have to cross out both of them because you're not cutting off the influx of Chinese people who may be infected into the United States, so we have to. This chart tells you at least for a couple of weeks, because like you say, there's an incubation period. I think that, you know, it's better to be safe than sorry.
