And there's a second reason we're not getting after them. Everyone thinks the problem is helping rehabilitation. Well, health is a major part of it, but rehabilitation is very difficult, and the best kind of rehabilitation is prevention: keeping people from getting it in the first place. If you have poison coming into the system, you don't just set up a number of poison control centers. You try to stop the poison from coming in. And we're not focusing on that part of the problem. And we have to. We've had a couple of successes around the country on this, there's a task force in Southern Indiana that got after it.

He was the valedictorian in his senior class. Now the question, should we allow him to go to college and maybe becomes a software engineer or a doctor, or are we go and make him pick tomatoes?

The governor followed with this statement, quote, attempts to deny access to contraceptives and family planning are an attack on all Oregonians, particularly women of color, low income, and young women. What this means is that insurance companies in Oregon will now be required to cover abortion at zero cost to patients, and companies that cover abortions for illegal immigrants will be reimbursed by the state. Religious employers and insurers that currently do not cover abortion are exempt, but any women who fall into those categories would also have their abortions covered by the state.

If you read the e-mail that he was sent; according to the e-mails, he was asked to meet with \"a Russian attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this purpose on Thursday,\" and that the crown prosecutor has offered to provide the Trump campaign with official documents that were part of Russia's government support for Mr. Trump.

But we also don't know whether he knew about this. We don't know what came of this later or whether there was more discussion. And we don't know if Donald Trump Jr. told his father that there's a Russian prosecutor coming over to give us information about Hillary Clinton. We just don't know any of that.

People are saying, oh, gosh, this is how the Russians operate. That's baloney. If this had been a set up by the Soviets or by the Russians, they would've had something there to get a second meeting, to get to a third meeting. I think it's much more likely what you had, were e-mails, by the way, from a British publicist for a Russian singer. And the e-mails in British publicist exaggerated the woman who walked in the room. She walked in the room, and she had so little to offer that none of the three people thought the meeting made any sense. And that's precisely what they've said. That, you know, Jared walks out. Apparently, Manafort is on his cell phone, and Donald Jr. has said, as a courtesy, he talked to her for 20 minutes, but she wants to talk about this adoption bill that affects one very wealthy Russian. My own point is if, after nine months, all of these hearings, all of these investigations, the best we can come up with is a 20-minute meeting with a lawyer who had nothing to say. There's zero -- by contrast, we do know that a Democratic National Committeeperson flew to Ukraine, worked with the Ukrainian government, sought to get information about Donald Trump. And by the way, what about Paul Manafort? And by the way, I don't see Mueller putting that on his list of investigations. I don't see that kind of collusion has seemingly bothered anybody. So, you have a totally one- sided, anti-Trump story, hyped up with a level hysteria that, I think, historians will look back on, and think, this was like the Salem witchcraft trials. They've created a fever in which people, certain things that are silly."

How come Bill Clinton is getting a half million dollars from a Moscow bank? That's not a problem. How about the fact that the Chairman of the campaign's brother was a registered agent of the Clinton campaign; registered agent of a Russian bank? On, that's not a problem. How about millions of dollars going to the Clinton foundation while the Secretary of State approves on Uranium being given to the Russian -- being sold to the Russian? That's not a problem. This city right now, the news media in this country is in a frenzy that is leading it to desperately seek something. They know something was wrong. They just don't know what it is.

But the basic heart of ObamaCare is still there, and this is what people like Rand Paul object to. The other thing about Ted Cruz -- way back when you remember reading Dr. Seuss on the floor and all that? He warned us that if this passed, ObamaCare passed, it would be near impossible to get rid of, even with majorities, Republican Majorities or Republican president.

Let me quote my friend John Walters in a report he just wrote: \"The current trafficking in opioids in the United States may be the most murderous criminal activity in the history of the United States.\" Let me say that again, this may be the murderous criminal activity in the history of our country; 30, 40, 50, 60,000 deaths a year. And let me explain something because I'm afraid this is just been lost. Everybody thinks that the major part of this problem is overprescribing by doctors. Well, we have had a problem with overprescribing by doctors and some pill mills out there, but that is not the major problem now. Our major problem now is the importation of these illegal drugs, lots of heroin, lots of fentanyl, lots of things like them; they're very cheap on the streets, and we are not getting after them. And there's a second reason we're not getting after them. Everyone thinks the problem is helping rehabilitation. Well, health is a major part of it, but rehabilitation is very difficult, and the best kind of rehabilitation is prevention: keeping people from getting it in the first place. If you have poison coming into the system, you don't just set up a number of poison control centers. You try to stop the poison from coming in. And we're not focusing on that part of the problem. And we have to. We've had a couple of successes around the country on this, there's a task force in Southern Indiana that got after it. But you need a coordinated effort of law enforcement, international efforts, the health care community, and churches, and other voluntary organizations to go after it. If you don't, it's going to get worse."

And average daily consumption for the year, that was more than two and half times the level the CDC recommends avoiding. I mean, and that doesn't even include people who are on cancer treatments, and you know who maybe have a legitimate reason, in those cases, to get these drugs. There's a vast over prescription problem.

Fentanyl, you can get very cheaply as well, and it's all across the country, and we're doing enough to keep it from coming in. Look, we can attack all sides of this problem and we need to; that's what we did in the late 70s -- late 80s and the early 90s. And you know something, we got the problem down.

What he should have done is gone to congress and say look, we've got people who are here because they came as children. We don't want to just force them to leave. They didn't commit a crime. Their parents may have come across the border illegally. And I think that that would've been a legitimate thing for the president to do. But he didn't want take the time to do it legislatively. Now we have two problems. One is of the federal level where you have this issue of what's legal, what we should do with people who come here illegally.

He was the valedictorian in his senior class. Now the question, should we allow him to go to college and maybe becomes a software engineer or a doctor, or are we go and make him pick tomatoes? Quite frankly, from a pragmatic standpoint, he'll pay far more taxes if he's a software engineer or a doctor and he's college educated. So that's a separate issue than the federal issue.

The governor followed with this statement, quote, attempts to deny access to contraceptives and family planning are an attack on all Oregonians, particularly women of color, low income, and young women. What this means is that insurance companies in Oregon will now be required to cover abortion at zero cost to patients, and companies that cover abortions for illegal immigrants will be reimbursed by the state. Religious employers and insurers that currently do not cover abortion are exempt, but any women who fall into those categories would also have their abortions covered by the state. Planned Parenthood, which is struggling financially and has recently shut down four clinics in Oregon, helped draft this bill and then lobbied to pass it.

So coming up tonight, we're going to tell you the story behind some of the viral images that are out there today, including the lawmaker who dared to bear her arms in congress. Also, the lawmaker who forgot to use spell check, look at this, I mean, there's something wrong. OK. And in this picture of an unamused Kevin Durant at last night ESPY Awards. Brian Kilmeade joins me to run down these pictures that tell the story. And there he is."

      "utterance": "So cooler heads are prevailing as the temperature rises in Washington over the Capitol Hill dress code. Last week, a controversy erupted claiming Speaker Paul Ryan was refusing to let women wear sleeveless dresses and open toe shoes during the hot dog days of summer, while the unwritten rule was never Ryan's idea, a long-term policy generated a whole lot of heat. Earlier this week, Republican congresswoman, Martha McSally, defy the rules by wearing a sleeveless dress on the house floor, and today a big announcement from Speaker Ryan."

You can also catch him on the Kilmeade Show on Fox News radio where you can also catch me every Wednesday with Bill Hemmer. How are you doing, Brian? BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX & FRIENDS CO-HOST: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me."

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Right. That would be the problem. Then it would be the double standard. So look what's happening on Friday, I just printed this out because I don't have the money for a color printer. But this is sleeveless Friday is tomorrow. And then, they're going to have a picture on the steps to show that women."

Can you spot the mistake? I mean, if you can't, you have a problem. War of Medicad. Look at all these people standing around that time."

The guy that put it there is just sitting -- would you put the picture up again. His job was to get the easel and put the picture up."

Last year, he went to a great team as a great player, they said you shouldn't have done that. How could you do it? You basically rigged the game. He went and won a championship. So for him to do that, he get called out, people said wow, he's not laughing. Evidently, it's a total put on, he was told to put that face on. He worked it out with Peyton Manning ahead of time. He is not really angry."

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",

So the State Department reportedly dismissed their visa request at least twice, but once the president heard about it he ask the team to try to find a solution for them and they did through a special waiver. We heard about those somewhere else tonight, right. But the tenacious teenagers will have to do the competition without their original robot, which is stuck in customs? That's the part they didn't fix that. But it didn't stop them, they got here, and they remade the robot with household items. They're geniuses, obviously. So the first global challenge is set for this weekend in Washington. Good story, right? Thanks for being here. We will see you tomorrow night at 7:00.
