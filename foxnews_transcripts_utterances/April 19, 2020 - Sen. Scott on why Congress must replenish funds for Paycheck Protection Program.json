If you think about what China did over the course of this thing, they did four things that led to the deaths of many people worldwide. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I mean, first of all, the virus was spawned in China. Second of all, they hid the virus behind the shield of the World Health Organization. The third thing they did was basically hoard personal protective equipment, and now they are profiteering from it. And if you walk through that, you were one of the first in the media to raise the question of whether that P4 lab was involved. That's an interesting issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What we know is that the ground zero for this virus was within a few miles of that lab. If you simply do an Occam's razor approach that the simplest explanation is probably the most likely, I think it's incumbent on China to prove that it wasn't that lab. So that's number one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, more importantly, we know that for a critical six-week period of time, China used its influence at the World Health Organization to hide the virus from the world. This was a time where that virus could have been contained in Wuhan. Instead, five million Chinese people went out from Wuhan and propagated the virus around the world. That was a critical time. So that was that. And then here is what I think should be very disturbing to every American. During that period of time, that six-week interval when they were hiding this virus from the world, China went from a net exporter of personal protective equipment -- they are the largest producer of that in the world -- to a large net importer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They basically went around and vacuumed up virtually all of the PPE around the world, including a lot from this country, which was, for humanitarian reasons, sharing our PPE with them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what that did was leave people in New York, Milan, and everywhere in between defenseless when it came time to have that PPE.

In Wyoming, for one, we have been very fortunate in terms of the disease. But the economy has been flattened, energy, agriculture, tourism, all of those things.

And in that county, there have only been nine people who have tested positive. None have been hospitalized. The businesses have been shut for a month.

      "utterance": "Maria, my focus here at the White House is making sure that the people of America are safe from this virus and getting things like personal protective equipment, masks, ventilators and things like that. But here is what I can tell you about China. If you think about what China did over the course of this thing, they did four things that led to the deaths of many people worldwide. I mean, first of all, the virus was spawned in China. Second of all, they hid the virus behind the shield of the World Health Organization. The third thing they did was basically hoard personal protective equipment, and now they are profiteering from it. And if you walk through that, you were one of the first in the media to raise the question of whether that P4 lab was involved. That's an interesting issue. What we know is that the ground zero for this virus was within a few miles of that lab. If you simply do an Occam's razor approach that the simplest explanation is probably the most likely, I think it's incumbent on China to prove that it wasn't that lab. So that's number one. But, more importantly, we know that for a critical six-week period of time, China used its influence at the World Health Organization to hide the virus from the world. This was a time where that virus could have been contained in Wuhan. Instead, five million Chinese people went out from Wuhan and propagated the virus around the world. That was a critical time. So that was that. And then here is what I think should be very disturbing to every American. During that period of time, that six-week interval when they were hiding this virus from the world, China went from a net exporter of personal protective equipment -- they are the largest producer of that in the world -- to a large net importer. They basically went around and vacuumed up virtually all of the PPE around the world, including a lot from this country, which was, for humanitarian reasons, sharing our PPE with them. And what that did was leave people in New York, Milan, and everywhere in between defenseless when it came time to have that PPE. Now what's happening today..."

Those ships were told to turn around, that China said, we're not keeping any commitments that we had to export any of this stuff. China wants it. And then, as you point out, they cornered the market. They already produce half of the world's capacity of this protective gear, and yet they were in the market buying two billion additional masks in January. Peter, I don't understand what's going on here. This is even more sinister than we thought. First, this virus escapes, sickens the world, and then they turn around and try to make it harder for the United States to get the products they need?"

If we see all of this bad behavior continuing from China, are global companies going to recognize, if they want to sell to 1.4 billion people in China, they need to do so with their eyes open? You have got intellectual theft continuing. You have got a million Uyghurs right now in camps in China. You have got tracking of citizens. You have got all of this behavior going on in China. So I spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, and I asked the secretary, is the world getting it? Is European -- is Europe, for example, our friends in Europe saying to the secretary, look, maybe we will unwind that Huawei technology? Take a listen to what the secretary said in regards to European friends and global businesses and whether or not there's a new thinking around China. Here is what the secretary told me Friday."

And now we have ripped the Band- Aid off the political risk connected to that. Second, the United States government has a responsibility too.

We had -- five weeks ago, I was sitting in my office about 40 yards away, got a call from Honeywell. They wanted to put a factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to make millions of masks. Guess what? This week, they opened that factory. That's something that should have taken baby time, nine months. President Trump's leadership, they did it in five weeks. So we're getting a lot of masks. That is going to help us open the economy. The same week, after President Trump put the Defense Production Act out with respect to General Motors, GM stepped up. In 17 days, Maria, they stood up a factory with Ventec in Kokomo, Indiana, began producing ventilators. And this week, with the help of UPS, we put those ventilators on trucks and delivered them to hospitals in Gary, Indiana, and Chicago, Illinois. That's Trump time."

And we worked with FEMA to help them out. President Trump has been very good about that. And during that conversation, we had this idea that, why not get the Garment District revived there in New York to start making gowns? And this is -- this is a beautiful thing. What Mayor de Blasio was engage a woman named Lindsay Greene at the New York Economic Development Corporation. I brought in Kim Glas from the National Council of Textile Organizations. As we speak, what's going to be over a million yards of fabric is being delivered courtesy of UPS from a factory, Owens & Minor, in North Carolina.

Look, the president, I feel like, is seeing a little relief. I know the numbers are still very bad in terms of coronavirus cases and deaths, but the president did get through the ventilator crunch, and he got through the bed crunch. It doesn't look like we have that breakpoint situation anymore in terms of needing ventilators and beds. Is that a fair statement?

So he basically wanted all the ventilators, and forget about the 49 other states. And we're sending him ventilators and ventilators. And it turns out that a lot of those wound up sitting in warehouses. And no American who needs a ventilator has not had one. And we're going to see the same thing with other kinds of things, including the testing kits. I'm involved quite heavily in the supply chain. And what we're going to see with testing is, we're going to see a similar kind of ramp-up. With ventilators, we went from virtually zero to, we're going to have over 100,000 ventilators by June..."

The president came out with three different phases in terms of doing that, saying that gyms can reopen in phase one if strict standards are met, elective surgeries can resume under phase one. Guidelines say, phase two for states with no evidence of rebound, and urging telework, schools staying closed in phase one. How worried are you that you open the economy too soon, and then we see a relapse of coronavirus?"

If we're looking at the fact that there are states where there is very or little presence of the COVID-19 and those states that are seeing a drop in the number of cases that has hospital capacity, it is prudent to make the first phase focused on getting the economy rolling in those areas where we have the ability to move forward without a strong concern of spreading the virus."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "I think things are -- we are in a position of devastation. And think about places in South Carolina like Charleston, South Carolina. Our unemployment rate was 1.5 percent, Maria, 1.5 percent. And, overnight, we saw thousands upon thousands of restaurant workers, retail workers, folks in the hotel industry driven to the unemployment lines. We have seen a 4000 percent increase in unemployment benefits in South Carolina. It is consistent throughout this nation. One of the reasons why the president has got to balance living and livelihood is because poverty also has a negative consequence that lingers for decades, if not generations. So he is understandably concerned not simply about our health. He's done a great job of trying to balance that. But he's also concerned about the economic health of this nation. And we both know that poverty kills. And so what he's trying to do is to position this economy to come back with a vengeance."

I always like to say that the Democrats who are holding this up, realize you're not negatively impacting businesses, as much as you're negatively impacting people's ability to pay their rent, to pay their utilities, to feed their kids. This is a serious situation, that we shouldn't have a lapse in funding for the PPP program. We should tell Ms. Nancy Pelosi, please give us our paychecks. People need their paychecks. And stop holding it hostage in order to do something else. Going forward, I hope that this week, on Monday, the Senate is able to vote on a package that's agreed upon with the House and the Senate. Tuesday, the Democrats get it passed. And Tuesday, one minute later, we start refunding, replenishing the supply of the Paycheck Protection Program. People are calling every single day. Hundreds are calling our offices, thousands, I'm sure, throughout this nation, because they want their paychecks. And we shouldn't stand in the way of making that happen."

Also, the structure of the -- 75 percent of the money has to go right out the window to employees; 25 percent remaining to pay rent and other expenses may not be enough wiggle room. Are you expecting changes on that structure? And the fight right now is about what, putting more money toward hospitals and giving more money to the states?"

      "utterance": "I think that you make several good points there. First, we certainly need to make sure that we take a look at phase four, or CARES 2, depending on how you want to call it. Restaurants that are going to reopen, they are going to need more space, which means fewer tables. That means your overhead expenses are going to increase. Your labor costs may be static or fall down. So, if you have a program that requires 75 percent of the money to go to payroll, 25 percent for overhead, that will not work. The new normal may require businesses to have higher overhead expenses and few -- and lower labor costs. We need to adapt to that reality. And we need to adapt very quickly."

And they force him to sign a document that says he's a rumor- monger, that these are lies, that there's not human-to-human transmission, the Chinese Communist Party at the highest level. That is President Xi and Wang Qishan knowingly understood that they had human-to-human transmission. We also know now from Scott Gottlieb and also a report from a Chinese doctor at South Hampton University in the United Kingdom that, if they had acted like any human being would act, decent human, if they acted as late as the last week in December, 95 percent of all this wouldn't have happened. That is the crime here. That's the tragedy here."

But he's made every bad decision in this managed decline of the United States. It was Joe Biden -- remember, Joe Biden was saying last summer, hey, China's not no problem. China isn't a problem. It was Joe Biden that took the side of the Chinese Communist Party. He was a useful idiot for the Chinese. When President Trump stands up and says, hey, we have got to stop the traffic coming in here, and we have to quarantine the people that come in, it was Biden that took the Beijing party line.

And tell us about the impacts that Wyoming has seen from coronavirus.      SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Well, it is time to reopen America, to do it in a smart way, following the metrics, using science. But we need to get Americans back to work. Everyone in this country has been impacted by coronavirus, some more from the medical standpoint, others more from the economic standpoint. In Wyoming, for one, we have been very fortunate in terms of the disease. But the economy has been flattened, energy, agriculture, tourism, all of those things. And as an example of how we can start opening the country, we have a county in Wyoming, Maria, it is larger geographically than the entire state of New Jersey. So the sizes are so vast out here. And in that county, there have only been nine people who have tested positive. None have been hospitalized. The businesses have been shut for a month. The hospital itself is on life support because patients aren't coming in for elective procedures. This is an area of the country and the economy that can be opened, using the criteria, watching all of the science. These are the people and the jobs, Maria, that I'm fighting for."

The money in that program is really paychecks for hardworking Americans, people who work for small businesses, which is over half of all Americans. I heard earlier on the news that Mnuchin and Schumer and Pelosi are working on a deal. Every Republican is going to want to scrutinize that, because we know that, when Schumer and Pelosi are involved, we know they slowed down the CARES Act because they wanted their wish list included. So I know members of our conference are going to want to take a scrutinizing look at what is in this agreement."

And there are lots of places, counties like the one I described in Wyoming. There are counties like that all over the country. And that's why it's important to have governors involved, have people at the local level involved. That's the way we can start slowly opening.
