Vladimir Putin putting on a propaganda show for the Russian people as he brings more death and destruction to Ukraine. The unhinged dictator holding a rally in a Moscow stadium boasting about the success of his invasion in Ukraine despite a massive loss of Russian troops. Putin claiming it was justified. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This is what genocide is all about. It is precisely to save people from this suffering, from this genocide that is the main reason for the convincing motive and goal of the military operation that we launched in the Donbas and Ukraine.",

Maksym Kozytskyy who is the regional administrator of Lviv says six cruise missiles were launched over the Black Sea by long range bombers. Two of them were intercepted, four of them made their way to their target. The Ukrainian air force says that Russian X555s with a price tag around $1 million apiece. It's a desperate situation down south in the town of Mariupol where the Donetsk regional drama theater was being used as a bomb shelter. It was clearly marked that there were children inside. It was still hit by Russian aircraft anyway. As many as a thousand people were inside on both the first floor and in the basement. We got reports yesterday that some people got out. Today we are hearing from a politician down there that the rescuers who are attempting to free the people trap in the rubble are being fired upon by the Russian forces and cannot even get to the wreckage to get people out or determine the extent of the casualties. Mariupol itself has become an apocalyptic scene with 80 percent of the housing there destroyed. The people there are resorting to mass graves simply because they cannot handle the logistics of how many dead they have on their hands. The people in that town are leaving. But the humanitarian corridors, they say, are not holding together. The people are desperate enough that they are fleeing under fire, quite literally, running for their lives. Judge?",

So, you've got all we've heard about Putin hiding. Now he's out with about 2,000 people in and around that stadium.

      "sentences": "There was the anniversary of the Crimea invasion. So, you have to held a big rally. It was a fake rally. The BBC had a team of reporters inside and said most of these people were public sector employees that were forced to go there by their employer. A bunch of the younger people were told they didn't even know where they were going. They said we're going to send you to a concert. And we'll let you go to the concert if you can have off for the day. So, they went and they found out it was a Putin rally. One guy gave a quote to the BBC, he said I'll be here for a while and then I'll leave. I think most people here don't support the war, I don't. And the BBC said most people felt ashamed and embarrassed to be there. So, I do feel bad for the Russian people. It's like having your father be a career criminal. It's humiliating and there's nothing you can do about it. And now he's going out there and acting like it's 1945 and just lying his way through a war in 2022. You can't do that. You can't lie about a war in this day and age. It's just impossible. And how humiliating must it be for Vladimir Putin to have to tell all the people around him, these are the lies that we're going to tell and you have to taste my food because I'm so paranoid, you all hate me, I think you're going to kill me. That is an insane way to run a country. He must be a complete psychopath to rule a nation in this day and age like that.",

I'm not -- I'm not joking and I'm not going to talk about -- well, I'm going to use the word assassination but that's the only way that it ends. And by the way, since the annexation of Crimea, the ruble has fallen because of the sanctions. It hasn't come back. Russians are poor since then, there's visa restrictions. There's less prosperity in the country. But you still -- their fidelity to Putin, particularly among older Russians, has not completely been shaken because Russia, since Putin took over, it was a kleptocracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was ruled by criminals. You would get shot in the streets. So, Russia is in better shape than it was. And there is this deep nationalism. And a willingness to endure and suffer. Again, Starbucks closing is not a hardship in Russia. In terms of -- I don't want to get too off track. But the Russian people are in part cut off from information because of our technology grades, Google and Apple. They caved to Putin last fall. They were wildly ignorant of what he was capable of. And they, Google and Apple got threats from Putin's -- his strong men. And they took down an app that was designed to get Russians to register protest votes against Putin that was backed back opposition leader Alexi Navalny. Apple started configuring iPhones to make it easier to promote Kremlin- backed social media com -- companies. And also in Russia, you still don't have access to this Apple security tool. It's a feature designed to make internet undetectable. Apple won't offer that to Russia. And so, they are essentially doing Putin's bidding and again, so much for the freedom of this technology grade.",

Mike Morell says they were just extremists. They weren't Muslim extremist. What were they, Irish extremist? These are political operatives.

Maksym Kozytskyy who is the regional administrator of Lviv says six cruise missiles were launched over the Black Sea by long range bombers. Two of them were intercepted, four of them made their way to their target. The Ukrainian air force says that Russian X555s with a price tag around $1 million apiece. It's a desperate situation down south in the town of Mariupol where the Donetsk regional drama theater was being used as a bomb shelter. It was clearly marked that there were children inside. It was still hit by Russian aircraft anyway. As many as a thousand people were inside on both the first floor and in the basement. We got reports yesterday that some people got out. Today we are hearing from a politician down there that the rescuers who are attempting to free the people trap in the rubble are being fired upon by the Russian forces and cannot even get to the wreckage to get people out or determine the extent of the casualties. Mariupol itself has become an apocalyptic scene with 80 percent of the housing there destroyed. The people there are resorting to mass graves simply because they cannot handle the logistics of how many dead they have on their hands. The people in that town are leaving. But the humanitarian corridors, they say, are not holding together. The people are desperate enough that they are fleeing under fire, quite literally, running for their lives. Judge?"

So, you've got all we've heard about Putin hiding. Now he's out with about 2,000 people in and around that stadium. And you kind of wonder, is he copying Zelenskyy now, or did he think he needed to shore up support? Is his country -- does he need to let them know they're in charge?"

The BBC had a team of reporters inside and said most of these people were public sector employees that were forced to go there by their employer. A bunch of the younger people were told they didn't even know where they were going. They said we're going to send you to a concert. And we'll let you go to the concert if you can have off for the day. So, they went and they found out it was a Putin rally. One guy gave a quote to the BBC, he said I'll be here for a while and then I'll leave. I think most people here don't support the war, I don't. And the BBC said most people felt ashamed and embarrassed to be there. So, I do feel bad for the Russian people. It's like having your father be a career criminal. It's humiliating and there's nothing you can do about it. And now he's going out there and acting like it's 1945 and just lying his way through a war in 2022. You can't do that. You can't lie about a war in this day and age. It's just impossible. And how humiliating must it be for Vladimir Putin to have to tell all the people around him, these are the lies that we're going to tell and you have to taste my food because I'm so paranoid, you all hate me, I think you're going to kill me. That is an insane way to run a country. He must be a complete psychopath to rule a nation in this day and age like that."

I'm not -- I'm not joking and I'm not going to talk about -- well, I'm going to use the word assassination but that's the only way that it ends. And by the way, since the annexation of Crimea, the ruble has fallen because of the sanctions. It hasn't come back. Russians are poor since then, there's visa restrictions. There's less prosperity in the country. But you still -- their fidelity to Putin, particularly among older Russians, has not completely been shaken because Russia, since Putin took over, it was a kleptocracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was ruled by criminals. You would get shot in the streets. So, Russia is in better shape than it was. And there is this deep nationalism. And a willingness to endure and suffer. Again, Starbucks closing is not a hardship in Russia. In terms of -- I don't want to get too off track. But the Russian people are in part cut off from information because of our technology grades, Google and Apple. They caved to Putin last fall. They were wildly ignorant of what he was capable of. And they, Google and Apple got threats from Putin's -- his strong men. And they took down an app that was designed to get Russians to register protest votes against Putin that was backed back opposition leader Alexi Navalny. Apple started configuring iPhones to make it easier to promote Kremlin- backed social media com -- companies. And also in Russia, you still don't have access to this Apple security tool. It's a feature designed to make internet undetectable. Apple won't offer that to Russia. And so, they are essentially doing Putin's bidding and again, so much for the freedom of this technology grade."

But it's like, but Russia -- they didn't grow up with freedom of speech. They don't -- they don't have -- that's the thing that's not in their blood.

We have a mayor that got elected running on a tougher on crime agenda with a criminal justice reform component to it, which I think is basically where everybody wants to be, certainly in the post-George Floyd murder era. And I think that what Gascon is saying in L.A. and what London Breed is saying in that particular statement is a bit of an outlier. And the Biden administration has been clear, you know, from the beginning, we're not talking about defunding the police, we don't think that this rhetoric is helpful.

Progressives deny the brutality and suffering of crime because they don't see it as a human problem. They see it as a political issue that they must indulge to placate their base. So, they talked about criminal justice reform rather than let's help the victims, right? Their base sees victims as a reckoning for 400 years of oppression. Although the last time I checked, elderly Asian women didn't own slaves or support Jim Crow, so I don't know why they're so silent about other minorities being destroyed in the streets. I don't want to get gross, but I will. There's a dude that just attacked a woman in the subway by smothering her with his human feces on her face. He boasted that he was going to get out.

They need to be hauled into a committee and they need to be -- they need to be interrogated beyond belief, because they knowingly helped change an election by helping to shut down a legitimate news story in which the media colluded with them. So, from now on, this is positively Putin-esque. Never take a lecture, never trust anyone in the media again. This is -- this is a great testament to tell you what they can pull out.

We're not talking about machines and voting, we're talking about covering up a huge story. Big tech conspired with the Democrat party with the CIA to snuff out a major scandal that would have changed the results of the election. They did the survey and they said like, you know, 10 percent of Biden voters, if they had known about the laptop situation, wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden in an election which was based on what, 49,000 votes over a couple swing states. That's the deal, man. So, you can now say it's rigged. You can say it. And here's how stupid the media is, Dagen. The media takes the word of the CIA and politicians.

So, now, we've got a kid who's sharing his money with his father who's complaining about the fact that he has to pay for everything for the family. Tony Bobulinski comes out and testifies against his own self-interest that Joe was in a meeting. This isn't just talk. This is circumstantial evidence for which you can prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There's one thing I want to say. I want every one of those people from Mike Morell, to Leon Panetta -- Leon Panetta, to Clapper, to Brennan, to all of them to testify under oath as to why they said it was what it was. And you know what I knew Leon Panetta was a liar when he started saying we couldn't get to Benghazi in 2012 within 13 hours from the -- from the tip of Italy to the top of Northern Africa. Mike Morell says they were just extremists. They weren't Muslim extremist. What were they, Irish extremist? These are political operatives.
