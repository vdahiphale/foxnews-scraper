Parents of a five -year-old Kansas boy, aren't we all, could be on the hook for $132,000.00 after their son knocked over a sculpture at a local community center. It was caught on video. I love saying that. Sarah Goodman says she and her husband were saying goodbye to friends when the boy wandered over to the statue. He hugged it and it fell over. Two days later, she received a claim from the city's insurance company saying it was damaged beyond repair with a letter that read \"You are responsible for the supervision of a minor child. Your failure to monitor could be considered negligent and we will kill your child.\" I added that as a joke.

Thank you. Thank you. That means it worked. For as it becomes harder to deny something is working, the harder the media works to show something is wrong. So how do you smear America as the third Reich when it is not? You lie. Take TIME magazine's cover. This weeping young girl became the media's poster child for the evil Trump's separation policy.

Good, imagine if you have four more years of some Democrat, the human trafficking that happened only under Obama would still be largely ignored. It is true. This abuse happened while he was president. Even the liberal website, Snopes, agrees but then the press forgot that they covered it because amnesia will not interrupt her anti- Trump tantrums. So, now Trump owns while trying to stop it and solve a greater problem. Fact, long-term fixes have short-term setbacks. Adults get this, children never do, and by children, I mean the media. Their outrages unaccompanied by an adult solution. We know separating kids from parents, that's is bad, leaving kids with traffickers that's worse. But I applaud those who are waking up to an issue they slept through under Obama, but Trump is exceeding and that's their nightmare. And even if Trump compromises, it is not enough. And there again, the goalpost is on wheels. Here is the current liberal opinion. Split up a family temporarily, you are a Nazi. Keep the family together, you are also a Nazi. But as for a solution, they freeze. They do not need solutions, all they need are feelings. He is a former Obama official explaining how to solve the immigration problem."

He's a Gandhi, an orange Gandhi, which is why the left is losing it. The latest of course is Peter Fonda. Yes, he has lost his motorcycle and his marbles. This brain-dead basket case suggested kidnapping and assaulting Donald Trump's child. What did I say before? Deem someone evil and you can do anything to him. And so the liberal manifesto has been boiled down to two words - \"F\" you. Actually that's one letter and a word. But instead of professional suicide, Fonda has a movie coming out. What Roseanne did was zilch compared to this. The double standard thrives, but it's not just Fonda, every celebrity. They are all dull conformists, they think alike, talk like - at times, they even walk alike. Here they are on the red carpet. No wonder they hate Trump. He's a bigger star and he is more entertaining. What would you rather watch? Sarah Sanders reducing Jim Acosta to a puddle? Or Peter Fonda trying to eat peas? It is all I can take. But it's not about kids really, it's about 2020 and a willingness to cleave a country over it. Luckily, America gets it. A new poll has a large majority believing the media is inherently biased. As optimism in the country is grows and as more people reject the mainstream media, journalists get furious like mean girls uninvited to the prom. Hence the mental chaos, the threat to Trump's son, shout outs to Hitler. Tweeted pictures of death camps, the world is crumbling. It began when Trump was elected, when Paul Krugman and his ilk then predicted of course, economic collapse. Wrong again you jackasses.

It's a serious issue and it should be treated seriously instead of ignoring it the way the people who had the reins of power for the past eight years it did. It's not going to be easy and there is going to be a lot of suffering, but I think what pisses off the left the most is the idea that there are people who want to come to the United States on their own volition.

And what is the pull factors that we have on our side attracting them, which includes now, catch and release under the former administration. So, I think the journalists that are doing the best work there are people like Brandon Darby and Aurora Delgado, they are amazing because they're not subscribing to that messaging and they are really committing to the fact that it is actually diplomacy which is where we need to put our efforts. And that there is a lot more people involved in these cartels that are financers and bankers and attorneys in these places that they are far more powerful than the actual cartel heads, but again messaging just produces it. So, how are we to actually combat these Central American pull factors and push factors if we don't actually know the whole picture?"

Everybody kind of want the business for themselves, they said whatever they wanted to say, and because it's an ugly thing. But here in the States, this is something that on social media, I kind of got into it this week, it was like, when - if someone in this audience has their children in the car with them and they get pulled over for a misdemeanor and they go to jail, their kids go to the system. Like, being arrested and committing a crime is a rough, ugly thing. It affects a lot of people, and your children, if they are with you, if you are choosing to break the law, they go to the system. Now, I understand the reasons why you are coming to this country, I get it. I grew up in California. I was around a lot of immigrants that were coming in, with one person awesome, and for the most part, they were there to work, raise their families and they worked hard. So, there is also that bad element and we have to be able to screen because even if you let in 500 great hard-working soon to be American citizens and one of them is a mass murderer, that is one too many. We have to screen and we have to vet and we have to do those things."

So, it's actually, thank you Trump for making reporters care once again about children. All right, coming up, the midterms are coming, the Dems are fired up, the Republicans are fired up - everyone is fired up except for my cousin, Steve, because he is a big jerk. He is revving the motors of midterm voters, a new Pew research survey finds that voter enthusiasm for the midterm election is at its highest point in 20 years and it's mostly because of the President. The good news, the eagerness extends to both Republicans and Democrats. The bad, we could all end up killing each other. Some key findings, 60% of voters consider their midterm vote as a vote either for Trump or against him, and 51% said they are just simply more excited about voting than usual, and 98% said I'm better looking than Bill Hemmer and Brian Kilmeade combined. Can't argue with the American voter. So, will it be the blue wave or the GOP undertow. We went our chief political correspondent, my cousin Steve for comment. Old Jimmy was a jerk, and yes, my cousin Steve is a cat, so what?

      "utterance": "I think so. Basically speaking, usually, common law parents can't be held liable for negligence of their children, unless it was willful or malicious, but parents can be held liable for their own negligence in failing to supervise a child. And to me in that video..."

      "utterance": "Yes, and the fact that they weren't - that is not the parents on the couch. The parents were in a different room saying goodbye at a weeding and for the parents to turn around, victimized themselves and claim that it is a travesty that they should be given the bill and their son could've been injured et cetera and we saw him pulling it down and wrestling with it, to me is another indicator that there's absolutely no accountability or responsibility. And now that kid is learning that if he creates damage or causes damage, then his parents will just fight for him in court and, \"Oh, honey, just sit down, I'll fight your battles.\""

      "utterance": "I will tell one thing, Joe, this is why I don't have kids. I don't want some punk kid clearing out my life savings that I've worked hard for. You know, you have a kid. You work for 20 years, you've got a bank - and now your kid ruins it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVITO",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, if the kid is not responsible and the parents aren't responsible - who is responsible then? It wasn't like he bumped into it, he went and pulled it down. And you know who else pull down statues? The Taliban."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Interesting. You know, Kat, I have a theory that the definition of art is narrow. Why can't the broken vase be art? Why don't they just rename it broken vase, double, the price - because anything can be art. Call it broken base."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Too bad you're not this kid's parents, Greg. What a great idea. You know, they are fighting over whether it was the center's fault or whether it was the parents fault. It was the kid fault. This kid is five, not three. When I was - when I was five, I was in the first grade. I was learning how to read, not learning how to not knock things over that don't belong to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You are five in first grade?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, I was. We took a field trip to the Detroit Institute of Art and I did not run around ripping paintings off the walls because I'm not a hellion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "All right, Tyrus, you've got kids."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURDOCH",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes I do. First of all, this is on the parents. There were two of them. While you were dropping your knowledge, I continued to watch the monitor. Those boys walked by that thing three times. The first one touched it and the other was like, \"Don't touch it. I'll touch it.\" And this is what happens when you have two boys. Then eventually one tries to outdo the other one, and they broke the vase, so chi-ching, you bought it. Me, I'd keep the one who didn't and I would donate the other one to the museum."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "All right, you know, if I were the lawyer for the family, this is what I would say. I'd go, \"That child was exercising his right to performance art. That crashing the vase was a performance because it represented his rage against the Trump administration.\" The art world would embrace that. It's like, \"Oh my god, this kid is brilliant. This is the Trump White House.\" And then they would sell the broken vase for $20 million, happy ending for everybody. Don't go anywhere. I may be coming to town near you and I will tell you where. That is next. Don't go anywhere. Before we go, you can preorder my new book, the \"Gutfeld Monologues\" is in stores July 31st, but I would order now because they are running out. Here's the upcoming dates - I am telling the truth - of my book tour. It begins August 4th, I'll be making stops in Fort Worth in Dallas, August 5th, I'll be at the Woodlands, Texas. I will also have events later that month in New York, New Jersey, California and Florida. Like that's a help. Our dates will be coming go to ggutfeld.com for more information of where I will be.
