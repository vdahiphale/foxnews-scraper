So while our media class obsesses over who is and isn't wearing a mask, there's something slightly more urgent going on that needs to be addressed. The tension in Kat's one- week old marriage. She's not here. Anyway. Nope. It's something called murder. Even if you pull that mask up to cover your eyes, it's not going to go away. Now I get it. The media only really cares about crime when it fits their narrative, white racist cop and innocent non-white suspect. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But if they really expect to get this country back to normal, and my definition of normal, not Don Lemon's, we're going to need to address the elephant in the room. Even Axios, a liberal new site admits this, the title of their piece, it's set to be a hot violence summer. They report that in a sample of 37 cities over the first three months of 2021 analysis found that murders soared 18 percent over the same period last year. And last year's homicides were already up 33 percent you could do the math, I won't. These are great numbers if they're coming from your financial advisor at Schwab, not so much coming from the law enforcement Web sites. Also, all but three of the 66 largest police jurisdictions saw at least one type of violent crime increase, and it's likely to get worse as the weather gets hotter. So, this is called a crime wave. A result of Democrats releasing violent mentally unhinged people onto our empty streets where they prey upon innocent victims. All while saying, we need to abolish the people tasked with stopping it. They're turning our cities into a Mad Max movie where getting shot doesn't mean your second Moderna vaccine. The anti-police sentiment made it worse. After all, why would cops go to any dangerous call if they know there's a chance they could end up on LeBron James' twitter feed? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And sorry, Is this the result of white supremacists or even some angry white males?

So Donald Trump goes to jail. OK and simple. OK? Get that monster off the street. Sure. He hasn't smashed synagogue windows, but he smashed our dreams. And you just know if Trump hadn't been president, this man from the Bronx wouldn't have had someone picked up brains like I do. And I get it. I know the feeling. I get angry just thinking about Trump. Meanwhile, a Pennsylvania man was charged with cruelty to animals after police say he shot and cooked his dog. If it were Trump, he probably would have served it well done with a dollop of disgusting ketchup. As you know, Trump is one of only three presidents who didn't have a White House pet. So it's clear he incited this horrific crime. He is the one who should be charged not this Pennsylvania guy.

      "sentences": "My favorite Mika. So why don't the Dems care about their dying cities? It's due to the sunk cost of their bad ideas, the same bad ideas that have governed these cities for decades. And they care too much about holding power over these neighborhoods, even as the victims pile up like fast food wrappers on Brian Stelter's desk. So how does the media deal with this when they finally realize the truth is inescapable? They manipulate language. Instead of violence, they call it gun violence as if the gun just got up on two tiny feet and shot the victim or they'll call crime a public health crisis as a way of removing any culpability. Yes, looting businesses. It's like an allergy. It's just that time of the season. You know, you sneeze but I break windows and steal watches. Look, we agree that when people get murdered, that impacts their health. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But treating it like an outbreak of herpes isn't going to help anyone. There's not enough Valtrex to go around, believe me. At least Axios admits that the pulling back of policing due to the drumbeat of media and activists likely contributed to more murders and fewer of them ever being solved. And yes, dear media most of the victims are black, and ignoring that is as yellow as the crime tape at a murder scene. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By focusing on one attention grabbing issue. Bad cops at the expense of a bigger, more destructive problem, a massive crime wave. You're partly to blame. It would be like a dentist telling a meth head to floss the four teeth he has left. Out of a thousand people shot dead by cops in 2019 nine were unarmed blacks. But if you watch the news, you think that number was in the hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands. The press calls it an epidemic. So if that's an epidemic, what do you call the 7400 black homicide victims in the year prior in which 91 percent were killed by other black males? Don't those lives matter too? Even if they never get tweeted by LeBron James? It isn't that the crime that draws police into the neighborhoods. We're out of millions of interactions you end up with a Chauvin? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look, there are some bad cops but focusing only on race and police, it's not going to make our cities safe again or even functional. And glorifying riots and attempt to make cops look like rejects from Police Academy Five will result in fewer good cops. And it's most damaging to the people it claims to help. But maybe that's the point. No more arrests, no more bail. No more cities. All you have left is empty block after block. If you're into real estate, it's a perfect time to buy. Just don't walk alone at night. Be sure to invest in Kevlar. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But at the end, she tumbled face first and even lost consciousness. Her coach says she wasn't even sure where she was when she came to which she has in common with Joe Biden. That was easy. He gets the mass probably had something to do with it, with her collapse. So, he urged the Oregon Health Authority or OHA as it's known to change the rule, and they agreed. Now, the state's athletes can take off masks while competing in non-contact sports outdoors like say looting Dick's Sporting Goods in Portland.

The media only really cares about crime when it fits their narrative, white racist cop and innocent non-white suspect. But if they really expect to get this country back to normal, and my definition of normal, not Don Lemon's, we're going to need to address the elephant in the room. Even Axios, a liberal new site admits this, the title of their piece, it's set to be a hot violence summer. They report that in a sample of 37 cities over the first three months of 2021 analysis found that murders soared 18 percent over the same period last year. And last year's homicides were already up 33 percent you could do the math, I won't. These are great numbers if they're coming from your financial advisor at Schwab, not so much coming from the law enforcement Web sites. Also, all but three of the 66 largest police jurisdictions saw at least one type of violent crime increase, and it's likely to get worse as the weather gets hotter. So, this is called a crime wave. A result of Democrats releasing violent mentally unhinged people onto our empty streets where they prey upon innocent victims. All while saying, we need to abolish the people tasked with stopping it. They're turning our cities into a Mad Max movie where getting shot doesn't mean your second Moderna vaccine. The anti-police sentiment made it worse. After all, why would cops go to any dangerous call if they know there's a chance they could end up on LeBron James' twitter feed? And sorry, Is this the result of white supremacists or even some angry white males? Well, let's ask an angry white male."

A Bronx man has been released without bail being charged with multiple hate crimes for violently smashing synagogue windows. Four synagogues to be exact. All attacked with rocks. Still, the suspect was release prompting many to say it's time to change bail reform laws. We agree fix the bail. So Donald Trump goes to jail. OK and simple. OK? Get that monster off the street. Sure. He hasn't smashed synagogue windows, but he smashed our dreams. And you just know if Trump hadn't been president, this man from the Bronx wouldn't have had someone picked up brains like I do. And I get it. I know the feeling. I get angry just thinking about Trump. Meanwhile, a Pennsylvania man was charged with cruelty to animals after police say he shot and cooked his dog. If it were Trump, he probably would have served it well done with a dollop of disgusting ketchup. As you know, Trump is one of only three presidents who didn't have a White House pet. So it's clear he incited this horrific crime. He is the one who should be charged not this Pennsylvania guy. He was only reacting to Trump's dog whistle. And finally, Mother's Day is this weekend. I would call my mom and wish her a happy mother's day. But she voted for Trump twice. Yes, I know. She brought me into this world, took care of me, fed me, paid for my education. She really is a lovely, kindhearted person. But none of that matters. She is a Trump loving monster. And I hate her with every fiber of my baby. For ATN, I'm Mika Mitchell."

It's due to the sunk cost of their bad ideas, the same bad ideas that have governed these cities for decades. And they care too much about holding power over these neighborhoods, even as the victims pile up like fast food wrappers on Brian Stelter's desk. So how does the media deal with this when they finally realize the truth is inescapable? They manipulate language. Instead of violence, they call it gun violence as if the gun just got up on two tiny feet and shot the victim or they'll call crime a public health crisis as a way of removing any culpability. Yes, looting businesses. It's like an allergy. It's just that time of the season. You know, you sneeze but I break windows and steal watches. Look, we agree that when people get murdered, that impacts their health. But treating it like an outbreak of herpes isn't going to help anyone. There's not enough Valtrex to go around, believe me. At least Axios admits that the pulling back of policing due to the drumbeat of media and activists likely contributed to more murders and fewer of them ever being solved. And yes, dear media most of the victims are black, and ignoring that is as yellow as the crime tape at a murder scene. By focusing on one attention grabbing issue. Bad cops at the expense of a bigger, more destructive problem, a massive crime wave. You're partly to blame. It would be like a dentist telling a meth head to floss the four teeth he has left. Out of a thousand people shot dead by cops in 2019 nine were unarmed blacks. But if you watch the news, you think that number was in the hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands. The press calls it an epidemic. So if that's an epidemic, what do you call the 7400 black homicide victims in the year prior in which 91 percent were killed by other black males? Don't those lives matter too? Even if they never get tweeted by LeBron James? It isn't that the crime that draws police into the neighborhoods. We're out of millions of interactions you end up with a Chauvin? Look, there are some bad cops but focusing only on race and police, it's not going to make our cities safe again or even functional. And glorifying riots and attempt to make cops look like rejects from Police Academy Five will result in fewer good cops. And it's most damaging to the people it claims to help. But maybe that's the point. No more arrests, no more bail. No more cities. All you have left is empty block after block. If you're into real estate, it's a perfect time to buy. Just don't walk alone at night. Be sure to invest in Kevlar."

A lot can happen in 1200 days or in 20 days, or days with a strong gust of wind. Politico reports that the DNC is already putting together opposition research on more than 20 potential Republican challengers for the presidential nomination, ranging from former President Donald Trump to the my pillow guy Mike Lindell. Good luck getting dirt on that Trump guy he keeps a low profile. Others on the list include former VP Mike Pence, Florida Governor Ron de Santos, Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo, Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida, and even some guy named Tucker Carlson. Which sounds like a fake name. So, basically, the pool of candidates consists of Tucker Carlson, and people who watch Tucker Carlson. Now, the goal of opposition research is to uncover information to publicly discredit your opponent. For example, here's the oppo we gathered on Shannon Bream. Last month, she helped pay for the education of nine orphans. Why not 10? That's going to come back to haunt her. Also on weekends, she participated in a food drive. Makes you wonder what she's hiding. When she's pulling that kind of stuff. Hey, here's your candidate beads. And that's not a severed head in my trunk. Finally, she donates blood regularly. But how do we really know it's her blood? Do you, do any of us? Yes. Makes you think, doesn't it? Hey, we're just raising questions here and Gutfeld."

I can relate although I collapse at the starting line. Little self-deprecation there. I'm actually a great athlete. This is Maggie Williams breaking her school's record for the 800 meters. But at the end, she tumbled face first and even lost consciousness. Her coach says she wasn't even sure where she was when she came to which she has in common with Joe Biden. That was easy. He gets the mass probably had something to do with it, with her collapse. So, he urged the Oregon Health Authority or OHA as it's known to change the rule, and they agreed. Now, the state's athletes can take off masks while competing in non-contact sports outdoors like say looting Dick's Sporting Goods in Portland. But hey, at least Maggie won the race unlike my phone like my buddy Cole, the guy can never finish anything for call. Poor Cole. So, Joe, you don't exercise at all, which I am. Not surprised.
