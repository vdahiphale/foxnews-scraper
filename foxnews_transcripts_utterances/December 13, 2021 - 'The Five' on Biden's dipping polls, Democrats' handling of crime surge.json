He says I only care about the access I'm getting. I don't care about putting on a good broadcast. He's worried about not getting exclusive with Joe Biden, not getting the Mayor Pete exclusive, not getting Kamala sit down. So, he is not going to say anything too critical. He figured out a crafty way to do it, though. He goes, well, you know what, there are a lot of really bad things happening in this country, especially with the administration, but it's not Joe's fault. So, when Donald Trump overpromise and under deliver, that was because he was an incompetent loser. But when Joe Biden overpromise and underdelivers, it's something he can't control.

He felt their pain. And right now, I don't think that Joe Biden is connecting with everyday Americans that way. I think if I were in that White House and you're with the communications team, and it's a good team they have, you got to step back and say something is missing here and how we figure out and how do we bring that about. There is no doubt that COVID remains on the president how our economy and trading markets are reacting to things, whether we like it not.

Their world view is we govern for the green climate movement and their agenda is to pass this giant welfare monstrosity and because they know it will end up being permanent. It's not going away. It is not getting repealed just like Obamacare. So, they want to put in place welfare program after welfare program after welfare program. If they admit spending at least in small part it's part of the problem, then that blows it up and it give Joe Manchin ammunition to say I'm not doing that. But at least Biden and company are consistent on one thing, whether it's the welfare monstrosity, inflation, the border, Afghanistan. The talking points are always completely false, their lies, and they are untethered from reality. And to that point that they don't give a flying damn about any of this because it's just one example.

That might be the right attitude it will be helpful for him. But do you know who else should help him? The Biden administration. They have an opportunity to try to back a new Democratic black mayor in a city that is super important not only to our nation's economy but to the world's economy. And this is a wonderful state with some really good people. They should come in and figure out a way to help him and maybe help themselves in the process because the White House has continued to point to COVID for a reason that crime is up.

Eric Adams position on crime, his position on community engagement, his position on putting police officers back in communities, perhaps even undercover, fully funding. And now to your point, Dagen, reforming bail reform. I think that's the message that the majority of Democrats I know, and I know a lot of them, that's where we are on this issue. And I would even argue that moderate Democrats and even some moderate Republican friends are right where he is. I think the president is probably going to have to speak more specifically and concretely about the ways in which the federal government will partner with cities, be it chiefs of police in Chicago all across Texas, and for that matter all across the country. I saw the former mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter be very critical of the D.A. there in Philadelphia. There is no question that there are a number of D.A.'s that are elected across the country who have adopted a coddling criminal and enabling crime kind of position. And I think it came from a good place. They still got to search and articulate what that good place is, but they've got to figure -- they've got to understand that what they thought they were achieving in a positive way is not working. It's creating more crime, it's creating more violence, it's creating more unsafe areas in cities all across the country. And the people who generally are hurt the most by this are people in the middle class and people who are not in the middle class beneath it. When police officers don't show up when the cops are called, the communities that are hurt the most are the ones we want to protect the most. So, I hope they change this and I hope the White House and others are partners with Eric Adams and others across the country who want to do these things.",

President Biden playing the blame game after yet another brutal new poll. He's now pointing the finger at worried Americans and says they could just be confused about the job he is really doing. The president under water on nearly every big issue the country faces. A growing number of Americans not happy with how he is handling surging inflation and the economy. And Biden is hitting a new low on how he is handling that pandemic. Fifty-three percent like the job he is doing on COVID. After months of bad polling news, Biden says he has stopped keeping track."

Right. Tell them I have inflation under control. Tell them how crime is down. Tell them how I save three cents in gas. Right, Jimmy?

He says I only care about the access I'm getting. I don't care about putting on a good broadcast. He's worried about not getting exclusive with Joe Biden, not getting the Mayor Pete exclusive, not getting Kamala sit down. So, he is not going to say anything too critical. He figured out a crafty way to do it, though. He goes, well, you know what, there are a lot of really bad things happening in this country, especially with the administration, but it's not Joe's fault. So, when Donald Trump overpromise and under deliver, that was because he was an incompetent loser. But when Joe Biden overpromise and underdelivers, it's something he can't control.

You got to sit with them, you got to meet them, you got to let them understand -- the president in my lifetime who understood this best was Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton met people where they were. He felt their pain. And right now, I don't think that Joe Biden is connecting with everyday Americans that way. I think if I were in that White House and you're with the communications team, and it's a good team they have, you got to step back and say something is missing here and how we figure out and how do we bring that about. There is no doubt that COVID remains on the president how our economy and trading markets are reacting to things, whether we like it not. The truth is the market was down today, if you look at the analysis, they say it's the Omicron variant and it maybe what the fed may or may not do.

They can't admit it because they have, they will never ever do anything to fight it. What's important is their agenda and their world view. Their world view is we govern for the green climate movement and their agenda is to pass this giant welfare monstrosity and because they know it will end up being permanent. It's not going away. It is not getting repealed just like Obamacare. So, they want to put in place welfare program after welfare program after welfare program. If they admit spending at least in small part it's part of the problem, then that blows it up and it give Joe Manchin ammunition to say I'm not doing that. But at least Biden and company are consistent on one thing, whether it's the welfare monstrosity, inflation, the border, Afghanistan. The talking points are always completely false, their lies, and they are untethered from reality. And to that point that they don't give a flying damn about any of this because it's just one example.

And then you admire them, right, because as you know, you vilified them when they are alive, and then you admire them when they're dead. So, that's how it works. That's why Chuck is sitting there and going like, what's going on here. It is pathetic. Joe blames misinformation, but saying that Build Better Act will pay for itself, where is that coming from?

That might be the right attitude it will be helpful for him. But do you know who else should help him? The Biden administration. They have an opportunity to try to back a new Democratic black mayor in a city that is super important not only to our nation's economy but to the world's economy. And this is a wonderful state with some really good people. They should come in and figure out a way to help him and maybe help themselves in the process because the White House has continued to point to COVID for a reason that crime is up.

Eric Adams position on crime, his position on community engagement, his position on putting police officers back in communities, perhaps even undercover, fully funding. And now to your point, Dagen, reforming bail reform. I think that's the message that the majority of Democrats I know, and I know a lot of them, that's where we are on this issue. And I would even argue that moderate Democrats and even some moderate Republican friends are right where he is. I think the president is probably going to have to speak more specifically and concretely about the ways in which the federal government will partner with cities, be it chiefs of police in Chicago all across Texas, and for that matter all across the country. I saw the former mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter be very critical of the D.A. there in Philadelphia. There is no question that there are a number of D.A.'s that are elected across the country who have adopted a coddling criminal and enabling crime kind of position. And I think it came from a good place. They still got to search and articulate what that good place is, but they've got to figure -- they've got to understand that what they thought they were achieving in a positive way is not working. It's creating more crime, it's creating more violence, it's creating more unsafe areas in cities all across the country. And the people who generally are hurt the most by this are people in the middle class and people who are not in the middle class beneath it. When police officers don't show up when the cops are called, the communities that are hurt the most are the ones we want to protect the most. So, I hope they change this and I hope the White House and others are partners with Eric Adams and others across the country who want to do these things."

And that's the reason why there's -- the public schools are such a shambles. We all know that, you know, minorities in urban areas aren't be given -- aren't given adequate education. But what's the solution for that if you're already pouring in tons of money? The solution would always be competition, because that improves the quality in every walk of life. And yet what's preventing competition is the teachers union. So, no wonder they get more -- they can get more days off. They'll get whatever they want because they don't have to compete against anybody. What are you going to do, you know?"

I'd be like, build back better whatever. These people need a more vacation, and you throw on top of that winter break -- Christmas break -- they probably call it winter break now. Spring Break, that's another. They get every federal holiday. They can't complain. Half the day started at 8:30. Then they leave at 4:30."

It's all nonsense if they're going to enter a world that is super competitive.

So, if you can't rope in the young people on Instagram, if that's horrible to the parents, do you rope them in and collect data on them in the school system? That's what's going on? It's happening across the country. They're -- one of the problems with the teachers unions, you know, school choice is an existential threat to them. But they have no self-awareness. Why, after all of the ire and anger from parents in the last year, when kids were being schooled virtually, would you want to take time off, you know, for your own we need mental health days off, no self-awareness. And I know that for a fact, because if there was any self-awareness, Randi Weingarten would have told Terry McAuliffe, yes, probably not a good idea that I come to your last political rally when you're running for governor.

But one sophomore on the team, a guard Jamal Shead didn't join in the trash in the arena and walked in the locker room.
