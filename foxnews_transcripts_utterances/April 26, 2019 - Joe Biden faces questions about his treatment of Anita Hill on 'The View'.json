There is going to be an issue for Joe, and I don't think he has the temperament or the talent to handle this. He's not used to being the front runner and he's not used to being attacked from the left. And he's also not used to tough questions from the media. And when he is a privileged, white, straight, Christian male running in this primary, there's going to be a moment in this primary, either in the debate or at -- on the trail, when he's going to get attacked, he's going to snap. And he's going to lose a little bit because he's frustrated. He doesn't know how to handle himself. And those are going to be the defining moments when people attack him, identity politics from the left. The other problem he has is media. Barack Obama had 100 percent media support. Biden is not going to have that. And you've seen now, I think the Daily Beast, which is a traditional partisan attack ragged for Democrats. They have a whole story out today saying this was a bumbling and stumbling interview on the left. Now, if he's going to survive this primary, he needs to consolidate media support because right now his opponents are dumping all the oppo, the traditional media places like the Washington Post and the Times, these online publications, they don't like him anyway because he's, you know, too moderate in their view. And then, cable news, I believe, everybody knows on cable that Joe Biden is an overrated candidate, and they're going to build him up and then they're going to tear him down and you just watch."

Biden offers the psychological strategy. Trump makes you feel bad. He's a bad guy. He makes you feel that. But the problem is it won't work because you don't have to like Trump to vote for him, you don't. We've gone past the idea of personality and that stuff.

I feel like in terms of the president's attack on him too, and to speak to your point -- to speak to everybody's point, it makes me think of -- Trump is like a shark in the water, and regardless of how much money Biden raises he is similar to a Jed in that. He raised a ton of money too, and ultimately it didn't matter. And Trump smells that limp, lame, geriatric seal, and he's going after him just like Jed because it's going to be easy to pick off and he would love to run against him in 2020. But it's easy to pick off now. And to speak to your point about his history, he's 30 years of nothing. And I think for the argument of name recognition there's also a lot of name fatigue and you can see in the media coverage, live you've talked about the Daily Beast, all the memes that came out immediately. There's some reports that, oh, the media was glowing reports of him, and all of the sudden, The View viewers love him. I thought his public display of emotion was manufactured and ridiculous.

Pew finds that about 80 percent of all tweets are sent by just 10 percent of the users. And those users, they tend to be younger, more likely to be Democrats, and have higher incomes than average Americans. Emily, it struck me that this survey showed 65 percent of the people who do the most tweeting are women. I was so surprised by it.

If you stick your neck out there on twitter, if you believe in something they'll chop your neck right off. It rewards people that are offended, that are judgmental, and that are politically correct. So you live in a prison in twitter, and you're afraid all the time. You're afraid of how twitter reacts to what you said, so you're constantly reacting to twitter reacting to what you said, and the mainstream media corporation do the exact same thing.

I will say that when the Russians and those trolls were all around Twitter and Facebook, especially Twitter for me, I was shocked by it and I thought for a long time I didn't know that I had no idea that these were robots basically or half people and I thought these were like my fellow Americans saying these things and I couldn't spell and it was like, no actually you know what, it turns out it was just Russians and when all of those sides got purged - all Those accounts got purged.

So, imagine all the people in the last I don't know five or six years that have lost their jobs and their careers because companies to your point were coward before this tiny knot, this tiny vainly knot of anger who they believed was bigger than it really was. People take every big story, stories that we've covered. Covington, right. Kavanaugh, Smollett. Ask yourself, did Twitter make those stories better or worse. No contest. Twitter floods the zone with hysteria that drives any truth out, any kind of nuance is gone and it's so intense. And companies unfortunately companies that we all know, and love cower before this. So, the question is what do you do. As a normal person do you get off Twitter. That's my first instinct. But if you look at other institutions, academia is very left wing, entertainment is liberal, the media is liberal. So, if you walk away from social media, you forfeit the ball to this tiny group of leftists who subvert another arena. Is it better to stay and fight like Andrew Breitbart wanted to do or steal the value away by leaving? I don't really know.
