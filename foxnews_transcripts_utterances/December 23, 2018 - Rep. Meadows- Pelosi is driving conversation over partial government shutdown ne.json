      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining us exclusively straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" this morning, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows is here. He told President Trump his members would have the presidents' back over a partial government shutdown. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Republican Senator David Perdue on when this stalemate might end. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, also coming up, Democratic Congressman David Cicilline on his party's pending investigations into the Trump administration, and Republican John Ratcliffe on what happens now to all the GOP probes into the FBI and the DOJ. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, General Jack Keane is here on the fallout from the Mattis resignation. And my Christmas conversation with New York Archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Americans get a partial government shutdown for Christmas. It will continue until at least Thursday of this upcoming week, when the Senate has its next session. The big stumbling block in negotiations is funding the president's border wall, with the president demanding $5 billion to fund it, while Democrats continue to say no. Nancy Pelosi says it's immoral. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This morning, President Trump taking to Twitter to write this: \"The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements, and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or a barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old- fashioned wall that works.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } President Trump had a lunch meeting with conservative lawmakers yesterday about border security. And one of those lawmakers in attendance is my first guest this morning. He told the president he would have his back if it came to this. North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows is with us, joining us for an exclusive interview this morning. He's a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mr. Chairman, it's good to have you on the program this morning.

But I can tell you, based on conversations I have had as recent as this morning, it seems like Nancy Pelosi is actually the leader, the minority leader in the -- in the Senate.

They are except, for one problem. Their vote doesn't match their rhetoric. And so we're looking for compromise. I can tell you, I was with the president and his team yesterday.

We have sort of, since the Garden of Eden, chosen it, OK? Christmas gives us the antidote, the antibiotic to that separation between God and the human person, personally, tangibly, in that beautiful little baby of Bethlehem. When we look at that baby, we have got, to borrow from our Jewish older brothers and sisters, Emmanuel, God is with us. In Jesus, we see through God and through man, God and man united. That's the antidote to the division. If we don't bring God into the picture, if we don't bring the message that the whole world is celebrating the day after tomorrow, we're shot, because that's where division comes from. You know what Mother Teresa used to say? She said Christmas is about joy, J-O-Y. Here's the prescription, folks. J stands for Jesus. Put him first. O, other people. Put them second. Y stands for yourself. Put yourself last. We seem to have it backwards, right?

The intelligence agency gets to speak in terms of what will happen in the event of a decision like this, what's the -- what's the implication our allies, and then how do we communicate all that to them?

But I can tell you, based on conversations I have had as recent as this morning, it seems like Nancy Pelosi is actually the leader, the minority leader in the -- in the Senate. And so they have come in at impasse. This is all about trying to make sure that Donald Trump doesn't secure the border. And it's really more out of their dislike for this president than really about the communities that they are -- really should be upholding to make sure that they're safe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this is a really important point that you're making, because this is supposed to be about border security. And the Democrats always say, we are for border securities. And yet we haven't seen any votes yes on ending sanctuary cities, on voting for Kate's Law, on the border wall. So, I mean, there's -- the only other one thing you could think about what this means, and they just don't want the president to fulfill another campaign promise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, you're exactly right, Maria. And I think the other part of that is, is every single Democrat will come on and say that they're for border security. They are except, for one problem. Their vote doesn't match their rhetoric. And so we're looking for compromise. I can tell you, I was with the president and his team yesterday. I saw Mick Mulvaney earlier this morning. They're looking for ways to make sure that we can get this done. Hopefully, we will. But I can tell you, it seems like the Democrats have -- have dug in and are trying to make sure that this shutdown lasts a lot longer than it should."

Don't you have a worse-off situation once the Democrats take the majority in the new Congress?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, without a doubt. When the Democrats are in control of the House, certainly, the 217 Republicans that voted with the president just a few days ago, we will be in the minority. But I think it's all about having options. We spend billions of dollars, Maria -- and maybe this is a solution -- we spend billions of dollars every year in improper payments. So maybe Senator Schumer would -- would go with me and say anything that we recover, that, we can spend on the wall. That's one option that he wouldn't even have to appropriate. There are a number of options that wouldn't cost the American taxpayer money, and yet would secure our border. I think cooler heads need to prevail."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, it's anywhere from $1.6 billion to $5 billion. I can tell you that there are a number of conservatives who believe that the $5 billion was already a concession. When you look at $25 billion to build a wall, we're already -- the president's already come down to $5 billion. But, yes, there's room in there. There were conversations. Senator Graham, I was with him last night. He was talking to some of his Democrat colleagues trying to find a compromise. But, really, what we found is, we found a wall. It's on the Democrat side, because they're not willing to do anything, and yet it's just not a position that is defensible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

You're not going to get a wall. So now the language is changing to, what, steel slats? I mean, they don't want to call it what you're actually coming up with money for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, the president heard that loud and clear. And he actually rolled out a different type of barrier, a steel slat barrier, we call them SSBs. But yet you have got Nancy Pelosi, you have got Senator Schumer and others who voted for 700 miles of fencing. If they want to go ahead and appropriate the money for the other 350 miles that they didn't build on that 2006 legislation that they passed, we will help them with that. This is not about what we call it. This is about what it is. And we need border security. The Democrats don't want it. And most Americans do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what it is, it's all about one campaign promise. They know that this was a central theme for this president. And, quite frankly, it was what ultimately made the day and why Democrats came over, unaffiliateds came over and voted for this president. They know that that was the central theme for part of his campaign, and they just don't want him to fulfill it. When we look at that, yes, they do say they're for border security, but for -- they're for everything that doesn't matter. When it really gets to sanctuary cities, or Kate's law, or a barrier, or asylum reform, they're an absolute no each and every time. And you can look at the voting record and verify that."

The president was trying to make sure that it had minimal impact on federal employees, minimal impact on the American people and say, how can we manage this in such a way that we stay firm and resolved, but that it doesn't have the negative implications?

We will continue to do that and make sure that people are held accountable. Quite frankly, there's so much there, that the American people need transparency.

You can follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures. Let us know what you would like to hear from a senator, as well as a congressman coming up. Stay with us. We're looking ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sends his colleagues home for the Christmas holiday with no new partial government shutdown deal in sight. McConnell, for his part, had negotiated a stopgap funding bill through February 8, which the president rejected.

The president and the Democrats earlier this week had a deal at $1.6 billion for border security, and the Democrats walked away because Pelosi felt like the Republicans couldn't pass it in the House. Well, we not only passed in the House, but we passed a $5 billion border security package with $8 billion disaster relief. Remember, though, that, just earlier this year, Democrats, 44 Democrats in the Senate voted for a $25 billion border security package. So, Maria, this is not about a number. This is about the Democrats not wanting the president to actually follow through on his commitment to secure that southern border."

Senator Cotton and I had another bill up at the same time, and there was a $25 billion funding piece in that bill that 44 Democrats actually voted for. And, honestly, disaster relief has also always been a bipartisan issue in the Senate. They're just trying to play politics with the security of our country, Maria. And the president's going to the mat on this one."

      "speaker": "PERDUE",
      "utterance": "Maria, I had over a half-a-dozen Senate Democrats tell me just Friday that if we called it an anything but a wall, they'd be all for it. This is ridiculous. This is -- if the president -- if the president of the United States, President Trump, said he didn't want border security, he didn't want any money for the wall, the Democrats would be all over him, telling him, oh, no, we have got to do that. So this is all about resisting Trump and not taking care of the business that we have as a Senate. Let me remind your viewers, though, that the reason we're here with a partial shutdown, though, is because we stayed here in August and funded 75 percent of the budget this year, the discretionary budget, which includes defense, health, education and other issues. What's remaining mostly is the homeland security piece, which is mostly essential. The other thing that your viewers should be comfortable with is that the payrolls that go out on the 28th of this month are going out no matter what. So, independent of what we do this week, that payroll is going to be met. It just shows, though, that this president is trying this weekend to get to a deal with the Democrats."

It's just that, at the end of the day, they have backed up from what they had already agreed to. I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail, we will get to some number between $1.6 billion and $5 billion on that. Nobody's arguing about the disaster relief package.

The president is actually talking about different -- I mean, different -- but what we want is barriers, just like we have, we see in other parts of the world. I was in Israel last year, and they have similar situation there. And they do that. Other countries do the same thing. And, as a matter of fact, Maria, in most countries, the military has a responsibility for the sovereignty of their borders. In the United States, we have Homeland Security.

And Democrats support that. We just think it should be done in a smart way. Use technology, use sensors, use drones, use more personnel. Use it in a way that's effective. So I think what the opposition to this, it's not a campaign promise, but it's just not good use of taxpayer money.

Let's let the experts decide kind of how to best use it. But what the is talking about is a $70 billion 1,000-mile wall, which just doesn't make sense. And, in fact, his own chief of staff, his incoming chief of staff, and his departing chief staff both said, this is a simplistic answer to a complicated problem. It won't work. So I think they're right. We have got to be smart about this. We have got to do in a way which secures our borders, but doesn't squander 70 billion of taxpayer dollars just so the president can make good on a promise."

In the last two years, we approved $1.6 billion. The administration has spent less than 6 percent of that. So this notion of like, this is urgent, I need the money, the president has $1.6 billion that he hasn't spent yet. So let's -- let's just be smart about it. Democrats are as committed to border security as Republicans. Of course we are. We want to do it in a cost-effective way."

We have great technology. We can use drones. We can use satellites. We can do cargo inspections. Let's do things that the experts say will actually secure the border, rather than wasting money on a costly, a very costly, ineffective physical wall that just won't provide the kind of security we need. We also need to deal with the underlying causes of immigration. We need to have additional personnel. We need to fix our broken immigration system. So there's a lot of work to be done here.

We voted for $1.6 billion to help secure the border. So there's no disagreeing about that. The disagreement is really about this wall. And I think the truth is, there's an easy deal to be had here. I don't think the president wants a deal. I think he wants a government shutdown. He said it himself. I think he's dealing with a secretary of defense who just rebuked him and left. He's dealing with a difficulty finding a chief of staff. The stock market tanking, he's dealing with."

It would pass the House if the president supported it. What changed? The president's world is starting to kind of crash on him. And so he says, I'm going to shut the government down. What are we talking about today? We're talking about the government shutdown. Mission accomplished for the president. So I don't think he has a big interest.

And part of that is securing the sovereignty and integrity of our territorial borders. That's why Donald Trump made it his number one campaign promise and why Republicans are united behind him and voted to support the construction of a border wall this week by voting for $5 billion towards that. So it's very important. It's what we told people we would do. I think we need to take it as far as we can, until we don't control the House anymore. So I support the president with respect to this. I have heard your prior guest. With all due respect, they keep saying they're for border security, but they keep voting against it. And so I hope that that changes, because the American people are suffering as a result of this shut -- the longer this shutdown goes."

But they have -- they have made this a political issue, to say that a wall is immoral and that they won't support it. As you pointed out, Maria, we have proven that it works. The wall between San Diego and Tijuana is incredibly important with respect to enforcing our immigration laws in this country. So, the bottom line is this. He keep -- Congressman Cicilline kept bringing up they were willing to spend $1.6 billion. As you pointed out, Maria, last week, 234 out of 237 Democrats in the House and the Senate voted to spend $867 billion on a farm bill. And, this week, $5 billion is too much to spend for the number one priority of the federal government, border security."

      "utterance": "Well, Maria, first of all, I have to probably confess to your viewers that, when it comes to Jim Comey, I have probably lost my objectivity, because I was one of the folks that was defending him two years ago. But exchanges like this, this transcript, really demonstrate that Jim Comey's FBI, the disparity and the dichotomy with which he treated two different presidential candidates, folks that were associated with Hillary Clinton benefited from departures from FBI policies and procedures, and folks associated with Donald Trump had those departures work to their disadvantage. The words on the paper make very clear that when, for instance, folks associated with Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, they weren't prosecuted, they were given immunity, whereas we have seen this week what happened to General Flynn for lying to the FBI. Lying to the FBI is a serious crime. You should be prosecuted. But folks on both sides of the aisle should be prosecuted the same way. We saw repeatedly that Jim Comey wasn't willing to do that."

The FBI was aware that at least one of her aides also mishandled classified information, and one of the folks employed on behalf of Secretary Clinton intentionally destroyed evidence known to be subject to a congressional subpoena and preservation order, and lied to the FBI about it.\""

I can't do that as a member of Congress. What I can do is what's reflected in that tweet, create a transcript, create a record for the prosecutors to follow up there. There is enough there for people at the Department of Justice to follow up here and hold folks accountable. We have done what we can. Yes, the Democrats are about to take control of the House, but they can't make these transcripts go away. That's why Congressman Gowdy and myself and others have worked so hard to create a record that hopefully folks at the Department of Justice can use to provide that accountability. There's more than enough there for them to accomplish that."

But, first, I had the opportunity to sit down with Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, to discuss his Christmas message and the immigration debate. But I began by asking him about the cloud hanging over the church in the form of abuse by priests. Here's some of that conversation."

      "speaker": "CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK",
      "utterance": "Thanks for asking, all right, because a lot of people do. My ears bristle with people who let me know how they feel. And the sentiments that you just expressed, Maria, confusion, anger, frustration, it's widespread out there. So we bishops need to be attentive. You know, Christmas comes in the darkest time of the year, right, in nature. The sun is at its lowest. And it's been -- it's been a season of darkness for the church, as all -- as well, as we try to confront this scandal of sexual abuse. I will say this. And I do say, Maria, that adding to my frustration is that the good, the reform, the progress that the church has done -- and even our enemies -- and lord knows there's enough of them -- will say the Catholic Church has been vigorous in trying to reform this. Sometimes, that's ignored. Do we still need some reform? You bet we do. Are there still gaps? Yes, I'm afraid there is. But, in general, we have got a very good process. The problems come, Maria, when we don't obey that process. You know. You have been around for a while in the work of journalism. What, 17 years ago, in 2002, the bishops of the country passed what we call the Dallas Charter, the charter to protect children and youth. And it's gotten widespread acclaim. And things have been very, very -- much better since then. We had a tough summer, Maria, with the McCarrick horror, with the Pennsylvania nausea, with the arguments, with the back and forth between Pope Francis and the former -- his former ambassador to the United States, Carlo Maria Vigano. So, our people, understandably, are saying, what in the world is going on? We thought this was behind us."

And, darn it, we will get through it. Light conquers darkness. That's the message of Christmas. And it's going to happen in the church. For me, Maria -- and this is our Catholic teaching. It's a beautiful -- it's a beautiful kind of prudential middle road. There's a legitimate moral call to defend our borders. So we have to have safe and secure borders. However, there's -- there's also a noble posture of treating an immigrant and refugee with dignity and respect and having an inclination always to welcome and embrace him. We have Americans have done that well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOLAN",
      "utterance": "All right, we do have it, don't we? We have a lot of alienation and a lot of division, Maria. The basic message of Christmas is this. The most toxic virus affecting the human project is the division between God and humanity, between the divine and the human. There's a cleavage there. There's a division. God doesn't want it. We have sort of, since the Garden of Eden, chosen it, OK? Christmas gives us the antidote, the antibiotic to that separation between God and the human person, personally, tangibly, in that beautiful little baby of Bethlehem. When we look at that baby, we have got, to borrow from our Jewish older brothers and sisters, Emmanuel, God is with us. In Jesus, we see through God and through man, God and man united. That's the antidote to the division. If we don't bring God into the picture, if we don't bring the message that the whole world is celebrating the day after tomorrow, we're shot, because that's where division comes from. You know what Mother Teresa used to say? She said Christmas is about joy, J-O-Y. Here's the prescription, folks. J stands for Jesus. Put him first. O, other people. Put them second. Y stands for yourself. Put yourself last. We seem to have it backwards, right? And if we have got this kind of defensive, selfish, narcissistic approach to things, no wonder there is sin and division."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, certainly, I don't agree with that decision. But I -- there's also a process problem here. And I think, in a way, it may have actually contributed to the frustration, I think, that Secretary Mattis felt. Normally, when we're considering a big issue like this, there's a meeting of the interagency. We call it the National Security Council. The deputies meet first, and then all the principals. And we vet all the options in terms of what the risks are operationally, tactically, actually also what political risks there are. The intelligence agency gets to speak in terms of what will happen in the event of a decision like this, what's the -- what's the implication our allies, and then how do we communicate all that to them? That wasn't done. And that's unfortunate. So, all of those principals didn't have a discussion to lay out the risk on this with the president oft United States present. And I think he's finding some new information out now as a result of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, is that what happened in terms of him getting so upset about it? I mean, if you read the letter that Jim Mattis sent to the president -- or presented the president with -- here's a guy who many people have said is incredibly gracious, but he didn't appear very gracious in the letter. He was upset. So, was it the approach, the way that the president announced this, that, basically, he was blindsided?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that I would call it a process foul a little bit. And I think it's a major lesson learned. I have just tremendous confidence in the president's national security team. And I'm sure he will find a very capable replacement to Secretary Mattis. But, unfortunately, I think an injustice was done to him, the president, in a sense that he didn't get this vetted properly, with all the key actors who understand what the ramifications of the decision are and what other options do we have available also. One of the things I am encouraged by, as a result of the president's decision, is this, Maria. The Saudis have come forward now with a sense of urgency, driven by the decision to pull out, to provide reconstruction money that we promised the people in the vicinity of Raqqa, where we have been fighting against ISIS for a year. We have -- and, as a result of that, no electricity, schools have been destroyed, bridges, et cetera, all the infrastructure gone."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, you're going to need -- you're going to need that kind of support. We're all going to need that kind of support, given the fact that you yourself said, if we pull out, that opens a window for ISIS to get empowered and reform in a strong way once again, just the way Obama pulled out of Iraq."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, the thought is -- and some people say, well, OK, if ISIS reemerges and they retake territory again, it's not our problem, let the locals take care of that. Well, the locals are taking care of it now. We're -- and many people don't understand what our role is, Maria."
