Charlie, is the president ready for this new dynamic, new faces? And do you believe the Democrats who are saying we are not just going to be resist. We are going to actually try to work with people and change things?"

      "utterance": "That will be interesting to see. I'm highly doubtful given the rhetoric that we've heard from House from House Democrats. But in a lot of ways, Donald Trump couldn't be happier with what he's going in -- he is going into this with a fight on immigration, on border security, which is a strong suit of his. And even if you get into your basic Democratic voters, if you're going to have to choose between a border wall versus sanctuary cities, abolishing ICE, to oversimplify both sides a little bit, people are going to choose border security. I think the other interesting thing to watch, obviously Nancy Pelosi will probably get picked speaker. But the big difference this time is, in years past, she's had opposition from blue dog Democrats. There are few of them left anymore. She is getting now opposition, some from conservatives, but mainly from the left. And so she's going to have to navigate that for the next two years. And that's going to be interesting."

You've got 235 Democrats, 199 Republicans, one still not yet determined in North Carolina. Then you look at the Senate balance of power, 53 Republicans, that's a net gain of two seats, 47 Democrats. It's 45 Dems and two independents who vote with the Democrats. The bottom line, as the president says over and over, everyone focuses on the House, but he does have a bigger majority in the Senate that can help him."

And then it's going to go to the Senate. And then Mitch McConnell I think has a tough decision to make. Will he put a vote on the floor to reopen the government that does not include border wall funding? The president has said he's not going to sign that bill. This is sort of the first game of chicken of 2019. And I think Pelosi and Democrats, it's incumbent on them as a new Democratic majority to try to show they want to govern."

      "utterance": "That's right. And all the new faces that you showed on the bump, they are going to be very frustrated very quickly, because despite the Democrats' victory on election night, which was real, they only control one chamber of Congress. And to get anything really done, you need at least two chambers. And of course, as Republicans learn while Obama was president, even when you don't have the presidency, you are in trouble. So those new faces will be frustrated. McConnell has said he won't even put to the vote anything that the president won't sign. So we have this impasse where they Democrats say they won't fund the wall and Trump says he won't sign anything that doesn't include funding for the wall."

There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they were not acting in good faith. In the case of Rod Rosenstein obviously he says that he was joking when he joked about wanting to wear a wire to go see the president. But the fact of the matter is, who makes a joke like that? In which atmosphere do make a joke like that except a DOJ that is in a posture to get this guy, to get this president."

The White House seems to be their legal strategy is going to be that this is going to be protected by executive privilege. And remember, the attorney general makes the decision of whether to send the report to Congress. So we will have a Mueller report. But I think the big question that is kind of being overlooked is will the public see it? And will parts, major parts be redacted? And Rudy Giuliani has already signaled this, that they will fight it.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",

And this is one area, Ed, where the Democratic control of the House does matter, because all of the work that Devin Nunes has done over the last two years to uncover the other side of the story that Charlie is talking about, what's happening in DOJ and the FBI in the run-up to the firing of Comey and that appointment of Mueller, that will stop, and now Adam Schiff is going to have the reins, and it will be a very different type of Russia investigation in the year to come."
