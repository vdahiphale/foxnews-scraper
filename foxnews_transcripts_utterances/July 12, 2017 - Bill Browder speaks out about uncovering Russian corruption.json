That's a U.S. firm that helped produce the infamous and now debunked Trump dossier, which offered salacious but phony details about President Trump's connection to the Russians. Fusion GPS denies any involvement with the meeting, but their role, if any, will certainly come up during next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A hearing that was scheduled before the Trump Jr. emails went public and was prompted by a complaint from the financier, Bill Browder. As you mentioned, Browder and his Attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, helped uncover the Russian corruption and human rights violations that led to the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on dozens of wealthy Russians, along with the individuals involved in Magnitsky's death. Vladimir Putin was so furious over the act being passed that in return he banned Russian children from being adopted by U.S. families. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Browder now accuses Fusion GPS of waging an influence campaign against him to put an end to the Magnitsky Act. But the biggest Browder bombshell is his claim that Natalia Veselnitskaya, who says she has no ties to the Kremlin, is, in fact, an agent of the Russian government who was trying to convince the Trump campaign to change U.S. policy on Russia. Veselnitskaya has been a vocal opponent of the Magnitsky Act, specifically the ban on adoptions. But Browder says in her meeting with Trump Jr., she was acting as Putin's proxy to repeal the act saying the meeting was \"an attempt by the Russian government to repeal sanctions that annoyed them by going to the next possible president of the United States.\" For now, the Judiciary Committee only plans on hearing from the Department of Justice and Bill Browder. But Senator Dianne Feinstein has called on Donald Trump Jr. himself to also testify.

And the justice that I sought to get was to freeze the assets and ban the visas of the people who were involved in the murder of Sergei Magnitsky, and the people who do similar crimes. And I took this idea to the U.S. Congress in 2010, and it ended up becoming the Magnitsky Law in 2012, and it imposes visa sanctions and asset freezes on human rights violators from Russia. Vladimir Putin is absolutely furious, and he ended up making it his single largest foreign policy priority to stop it. Now, the other thing that we did was, we tracked down the money from the crime, and we found some of that money in the United States. We reported it to the Department of Justice, they opened up a criminal case and the defendant who showed up was a Russian by the name of Dennis Katsav. And Dennis Katsav was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya, and she then has embarked on a three-year campaign to try to overturn the Magnitsky Act. And it's been a well-financed campaign, they've hired the best lawyers, the best lobbyists, the best public relations professionals, and they've gone all over Capitol Hill. And they eventually found their way to the possible next president of the United States back in 2016 by meeting the son of Donald Trump.",

It found that Ukrainian government officials have tried to help Hillary Clinton and hurt then- candidate Donald Trump during the campaign. Sound familiar? So, instead of allegations about the Trump campaign colluding with Russia, this is about the Clinton campaign possibly colluding with Ukraine; one of Russia's biggest adversaries. Now, at the center of the story is the Ukrainian-American woman named Alexandra Chalupa. She is a veteran Democratic operative who used to work in the Clinton White House. And in 2016, while consulting for the DNC, she reportedly met with the Ukrainian Ambassadors at the embassy in Washington to discuss Paul Manafort's ties to Russia. And that conversation took place right before Manafort was brought on as Mr. Trump's campaign chairman.

      "utterance": "Martha, the Donald Trump Jr.'s legal team says that his meeting with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a set up on behalf of Fusion GPS. That's a U.S. firm that helped produce the infamous and now debunked Trump dossier, which offered salacious but phony details about President Trump's connection to the Russians. Fusion GPS denies any involvement with the meeting, but their role, if any, will certainly come up during next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. A hearing that was scheduled before the Trump Jr. emails went public and was prompted by a complaint from the financier, Bill Browder. As you mentioned, Browder and his Attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, helped uncover the Russian corruption and human rights violations that led to the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on dozens of wealthy Russians, along with the individuals involved in Magnitsky's death. Vladimir Putin was so furious over the act being passed that in return he banned Russian children from being adopted by U.S. families. Browder now accuses Fusion GPS of waging an influence campaign against him to put an end to the Magnitsky Act. But the biggest Browder bombshell is his claim that Natalia Veselnitskaya, who says she has no ties to the Kremlin, is, in fact, an agent of the Russian government who was trying to convince the Trump campaign to change U.S. policy on Russia. Veselnitskaya has been a vocal opponent of the Magnitsky Act, specifically the ban on adoptions. But Browder says in her meeting with Trump Jr., she was acting as Putin's proxy to repeal the act saying the meeting was \"an attempt by the Russian government to repeal sanctions that annoyed them by going to the next possible president of the United States.\" For now, the Judiciary Committee only plans on hearing from the Department of Justice and Bill Browder. But Senator Dianne Feinstein has called on Donald Trump Jr. himself to also testify. Martha."

You worked extensively in Russia, had huge business and investments there at one point and all of that went south when you feel corruption was uncovered by you, and then by your friend Magnitsky, who was subsequently murdered in a jail cell, correct?"

      "utterance": "That's right. I was the largest foreign investor in Russia. I uncovered corruption; they got angry with me for uncovering corruption and expelled me from the country, my offices were raided, they seized my documents, they use the documents to steal $231 million of taxes that we paid. My lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, uncovered, exposed it. He was then taken into custody, tortured for 358 days, and killed seven years ago at the age of 37, and I've been on a mission to get justice for him ever since."

    {
      "speaker": "BROWDER",
      "utterance": "Well, it became clearer that I wasn't going to get any justice in Russia because it's such a corrupt country, so I sought to get justice outside of Russia. And the justice that I sought to get was to freeze the assets and ban the visas of the people who were involved in the murder of Sergei Magnitsky, and the people who do similar crimes. And I took this idea to the U.S. Congress in 2010, and it ended up becoming the Magnitsky Law in 2012, and it imposes visa sanctions and asset freezes on human rights violators from Russia. Vladimir Putin is absolutely furious, and he ended up making it his single largest foreign policy priority to stop it. Now, the other thing that we did was, we tracked down the money from the crime, and we found some of that money in the United States. We reported it to the Department of Justice, they opened up a criminal case and the defendant who showed up was a Russian by the name of Dennis Katsav. And Dennis Katsav was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya, and she then has embarked on a three-year campaign to try to overturn the Magnitsky Act. And it's been a well-financed campaign, they've hired the best lawyers, the best lobbyists, the best public relations professionals, and they've gone all over Capitol Hill. And they eventually found their way to the possible next president of the United States back in 2016 by meeting the son of Donald Trump."

When you heard about the meeting that took place, and she described it, you know, that she got there, and you know, she sort of was incoherent and was, you know, sort of telling them all these stories, and I thought, you know, this is a complete waste of time. This is not what we are here for, they were told that there was some dirt on Hillary Clinton, they were curious to hear what it might be, and then they -- you know, the meeting sort of quickly ended and it was a waste of time. Does that add up to you?"

I mean, I'm sure that they're not the only people who thought she was a waste of time because she hasn't achieved any of her objectives. But it doesn't mean, it hasn't been for lack of trying. So, they went to Congress and try to do the same thing, they went and try to take Sergei Magnitsky's names off of the global Magnitsky Act, and they ended up getting one sympathetic member of the House of Representatives, Dana Rohrabacher, to sponsor that amendment. And when it went to vote, every single other member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee shut him down. So, these people will try everything; the Russians will try 100 things in the hope that one of them works, and this is just one of those hundred things, as far as I can tell."

You know, do you think this is more isolated to, you know, a very intense lobbying effort that employs this woman, who you believe is connected to the Kremlin, to sort of sway their opinion, or do you see something more than that here?"

I think they probably made a dozen different attempts to get to Trump, and I think they probably made a dozen different attempts to get to Hillary Clinton. They were looking for anybody who was going to be in power to hear them out, and hope that that person would be sympathetic to them. Now, these people aren't stupid, they look and study their targets carefully. They look for what they might want, and they try to come up with some type of -- they're not stupid, they understand that if they're going to ask for something big like the repeal of the major human rights bill, they've got to offer something in return, and so they've to come up with something. Obviously, what they came up with didn't make a lot of sense and it all fizzled out, but that's how these guys operate -- they go to KGB school to learn this type of stuff."

But always Putin is going to want Russia, and Trump is going to want the United States, and that's the way it is. People said, oh, they shouldn't get along, well, who are the people that are saying that? I think we got along very, very well. We're a tremendously powerful nuclear power, and so are they.

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what your interview with Browder illustrates, is who the pawn was in this game. That lawyer was not a Trump apologist. We're trying to say earlier in the week, just some do-gooder human rights activist who was trying to help Russian orphans. She's an agent of the Russian government going after this act, which is about human rights, and the purpose is to punish the people in the Putin circle who tortured him and killed him. And I think it's one of the few acts of sanctions that works well because it doesn't have the whole population, it hits the bad guys and their associates. And that's why Putin despises it, and she was used as a pawn in this episode; it doesn't change anything about what was in the chain of Donald Trump Jr. e-mails, which indicates that he was offered dirt from a foreign hostile power, and he went for it."

      "utterance": "Well, the Trump administration action on sanctions has been really zigzagged and inconsistent. The Senate wants to stop on really hard sanctions, overwhelming vote to do it, the administration has resisted. The irony is that that happened in the Obama administration, where they tried to slap on hard sanctions and the administration resisted as well. So, there's a pattern that continues here. I think there's no policy, really. Trump in that interview said we try to get along. Fine, of course, we try to get along. The cease-fire in Syria may be a good thing, we don't know how it'll work out, but that so far is the only fruit of his diplomacy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "I think it's likely there are more stories. But even if there were none, the damage done by this story is enormous. And the reason is, that for six months the administration touted the line that there's no collusion, that's a Democratic exaggeration, it's a delusion on their part, it's calumny on their part, there's nothing here. I supported that line because there was no evidence for it, but now you see the evidence loud and clear. An email that says, the Russian government is supporting your father as part of the effort, we got dirt, we're going to get this. The state prosecutor with documents to support that, we want you to take the meeting, and what does he say? I love it. I love it, are deadly words. Even if it didn't pan out, that doesn't matter. Attempted collusion is still collusion, and that's why I think it undermined the entire story that collusion was a fiction. I always said I don't see any collusion, but I'm open to empirical evidence, this is the first empirical evidence."

      "utterance": "Well, Martha, this all stems from a political article back in January. It found that Ukrainian government officials have tried to help Hillary Clinton and hurt then- candidate Donald Trump during the campaign. Sound familiar? So, instead of allegations about the Trump campaign colluding with Russia, this is about the Clinton campaign possibly colluding with Ukraine; one of Russia's biggest adversaries. Now, at the center of the story is the Ukrainian-American woman named Alexandra Chalupa. She is a veteran Democratic operative who used to work in the Clinton White House. And in 2016, while consulting for the DNC, she reportedly met with the Ukrainian Ambassadors at the embassy in Washington to discuss Paul Manafort's ties to Russia. And that conversation took place right before Manafort was brought on as Mr. Trump's campaign chairman. And a few days later, Chalupa, reportedly briefed the DNC staff about it. According to Politico, \"Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race helping to force Manafort's resignation, and advancing the narrative that Trump campaign was deeply connected to Russia.\" But it goes on to say that, \"they were far less concerted or centrally directed than Russia's alleged hacking in the dissemination of Democratic emails.\" Now, remember, U.S. Intelligence officials have concluded that Russia hacking was personally directed by President Putin, but there's little evidence of a similar top-down effort by Ukraine, so that's the difference. Still, the Trump administration is seizing on the similarities. They claim that this constitutes clear and active coordination between the DNC and a foreign government. Martha."

That does not change the fact that what Donald Trump Jr., did was probably collusion, and admitted to it. He had first lied about it. I think it's important that we talk about the timeline. First, he said the meeting never happened, then, he said it was about adoption, and then, he said, oh, yes, it was to get dirt, but it was actually fine that it was to get dirt. These are just the things that we know about. This showed time and time again from the Trump administration, people very, very close to the president, meeting with Russian officials and lying about it. And we can't depart from the fact."

And that doesn't make what Donald Trump Jr., did right, but it certainly shows the double standard in the sense that this was reported out by Politico in an investigation, the rest of the media did not attach on to it like we would've seen, and as we have seen with them attaching onto the lack of evidence with the Trump campaign colluding with Russia. And on the point of Donald Trump Jr., look, just because this is now coming out and there's a double standard here, doesn't make it right. In the sense that -- you look at it and say look, if this is the initial argument that the Trump campaign and Donald Jr., were going to make, they can say, initially, not after all of the changes in the story, look, Hillary can't campaign, coordinated with the Ukrainian government; we did too, that's how politics works; move on, both sides do it.

And you know, when you think back to the period of these campaigns, right? You had Paul Manafort, and all those stories about, you know, who he was connected to. I mean, you know, it looks like we have sort of entered a phase -- I mean, we obviously entered the phase, where there's almost no limitation to how far this oppo-research goes. And I think these campaigns almost feel like, you know, if you don't push it to the absolute limit, you're an idiot, right?

There is a man at New York University named Jonathan -- who is a social psychologist who has brought out into the open the degree of which sociology and psychology are dominated by one political ideological viewpoint. And he himself, he's not a conservative, is trying to form a group that has people from all parts of the ideological spectrum in the academy who talk to each other. And who say, you know what, it's part of the university to disagree about issues, but that doesn't mean you have to hate each other."

The attorneys have been shouting at each other and it has basically been two gut wrenching days for the parents of Tim Piazza. Visibly emotional at these proceedings, sometimes crying, who can blame them. As these text messages are read aloud in court, such as this one from the fraternity's pledge master who said to his girlfriend, seemingly more concerned with his own wellbeing, texting, quote, I do not want to go to jail for this.

A Piazza family lawyer says the 18 fraternity members plotted and executed the binge drinking through a hazing ritual called the gauntlet, and that Beta Theta Pi president Brendan Young knew that hazing rituals were dangerous and against the fraternity's national policies when he texted the pledge master saying, quote, if anything goes wrong with the pledges this semester, then both us are effed. Lawyers say the members also try to cover up their involvement, and when 911 finally was called, nobody mentioned the fall."

Piazza's father released a statement saying the fraternity members showed no remorse in court and the hearing have, quote, tried our patience as we listen to seven defense lawyers each attempting to justify the unjustifiable, and each attempting to shift the focus, shift the blame, and shift the responsibility from the men who they represent.

Stacy, thank you for being here tonight. We have shown so much of this evidence over the course of the last few months that it's pretty difficult to understand a scenario where there's not enough evidence to go forward with these charges, involuntary manslaughter is the strongest of them. What is the bar for that, and are you, as your opponent claims, overcharging in this case?"

      "speaker": "STACY PARKS MILLER, CENTRE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not. People have to remember, too, that this went through a grand jury in Pennsylvania, and the sitting grand jury already found probable cause. I don't know why Pennsylvania's structure is such that once that happens you have to go through another preliminary hearing and reprove it, and many other states that would be the end of it. Probable cause has already been found once."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's actually a very lower bar that the defense attorney continues to try to present to confuse the judge and the public. They constantly say my client didn't intend to hurt Mr. Piazza, we're not claiming that. Involuntary manslaughter is simply -- unintentionally causing a death through reckless behavior. And the behavior here was wildly reckless. Reckless simply means behavior outside the norms that a reasonable person would practice. And there's no question in our minds in the case that we're presenting is deliberately holding an event which makes someone fatally drunk and risk death is reckless, it's outside the norm, a reasonable person would practice."

      "speaker": "MILLER",

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry we have a little bit of a delay, I don't mean to be stepping on you, so I just want to apologize for that. But you have to prove that they forced him to drink unsafe amounts, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "No, no. That's another complete misnomer. It doesn't have to be forced. It is simply that they engaged in reckless behavior. And in this particular case, it simply that they planned an event in which they deliberately supplied enough alcohol in which people got to fatal levels of drunkenness. It does not matter if you voluntarily consumed it or not. And manslaughter, in fact, says in the definition, they can be engaging in legal or illegal acts with the recklessness. Here it was illegal acts, it was hazing and furnishing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, when you read through these text messages, and you read the preparations, and you hear some of them say, you know, that every time they're upping the ante and we better be careful because maybe we're going too far with this. We're going to get these guys so effed up, as they say, some of them expressed concerned about it. But when you think about it, in some ways, the alcohol almost doesn't even have to matter, he fell down a flight of stairs and he was left there and nobody called an ambulance for 12 hours. In some ways the alcohol becomes less important than the injuries and the fact that these, you know, practically adults, didn't do anything, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "Well, yeah. There's a river -- this case is a river and there are river rocks in it. One of the big rocks is he does take a very serious obvious fall, and falls repeatedly, and falls twice, and they don't get him aid. But the river starts when they get him so drunk he can't protect himself. And our pathologist, part of the case is an opinion that he died as a result of severe inebriation which caused his fall. So it's a chain that is linked. And in Pennsylvania, the hazing part of it has right in the definition that the person's consent to the behavior is not a defense because they realize that to be part of a group people will engage in things, so the whole idea that he consented or went along with it will not be a legal defense for them no matter how much they talk about it."

He has boarded Air Force One on a flight to Paris to celebrate Bastille Day. He was invited to do so with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. That trip could provide a bit of a recess that is probably thoroughly wanted at this point, and to get back to the agenda that the president wants to pursue. Also tonight, an illegal immigrant removed from this country seven times, got behind the wheel, drunk, according to these reports, and killed a father of three. That tragic story next on The Story."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So here some other stories that we're watching tonight. Fox News confirming that Congressman Steve Scalise is out of ICU tonight. He's spending the past week -- he did, rather, in intensive care. He's been battling an infection. He's been in the D.C. hospital for almost a month now after being shot during a congressional baseball practice by a man targeting Republican. The congressman condition does remain serious. Sources tell Fox News that he's likely to have at least two more surgeries, and we wish him well. An illegal immigrant removed from the U.S. seven times accused of killing a father of three in a fiery Nebraska crash, prosecutors say Nemias Garcia- Velasco, a Mexican citizen with a criminal past, drank 12 beers and then got behind the wheel, driving his van a 100 miles an hour into a guard rail, burst into flames, and killed the passenger, Silvano Torres. If convicted, Garcia-Velasco faces, finally, 20 years in prison. So moments ago we showed you the scene at the White House as President Trump headed off to Paris for meetings with the French president as the nation -- as that nation celebrates Bastille Day. The trip comes perhaps in an opportune time as there are suggestions that there's quite a bit of drama among west wing staffers. President Trump responded to those reports with this. The White House is functioning perfectly, focused on health care, tax cuts, reform, and many other things. I've very little time for watching TV, he said. Chris Stirewalt is our Fox News politics editor and he joins us now. How does that spin work for you, Chris?"

So what we see is the president says that, basically, he learned about his son meeting with the Russians on the news. That he didn't know anything about it before. That's what he said today. That's what his lawyer said this morning. And what makes that pretty astonishing is the fact that it was, according to the New York Times, his son-in-law Jared Kushner whose legal team found out about the meeting and then disclosed it. That's not a good look when you have those kinds of factions inside your own family, inside your own White House. When you have that going on, that doesn't look like an organization that can function, and that is probably the first thing that they have to get taken care of."

But none of this goes to the larger issue, and a larger issue is that the president at some point has to say I trust this guy, and you need to tell him everything you know about this right now because we're going to be done with this, no more surprises."

They became international heroes after jumping into action on a high-speed train in France, and they stop a terrorist in his tracks. You all remember those pictures. So now, in another crazy turn, they will now play themselves on the silver screen and be directed by Clint Eastwood in the movie 1517 to Paris. It's a film based on the book that they wrote about the attack, production started this week. No word on when it will hit theaters, but we love this story and we plan to go see it.
