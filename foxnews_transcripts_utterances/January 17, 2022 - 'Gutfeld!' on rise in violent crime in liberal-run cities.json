If you haven't been murdered yet, by a nutbag. It's true. We have an epidemic of crazy people, What we used to call the criminally deranged or The View's audience. But they're everywhere. On the streets, on the subway, one is sitting to my right. But they're also in our city halls, our governments, in our district attorney's offices, from New York to Chicago to L.A. to Baltimore. And they're spreading faster than Omircon. It's not funny anymore. On Saturday morning, a maniac waited as a train entered the Time Square subway station before he happily pushed an Asian woman to her death. Michelle Alyssa Go aged 40 was murdered that morning. The killer stuck his tongue out at the police, like a third grader out the window of a school bus. The perfect metaphor for bail reform or any other garbage that passes the social justice reform. But if you dare ask, why was he out on the street? You probably racist or worse a Republican. Meanwhile, this pump just murdered a teenager allegedly in a Bronx Burger King. It's his idea of having it his way under the new attorney general. Here he is shouting about reparations and slavery.",

      "sentences": "Hell, he sounds like every Democrat member of Congress when they're on Twitter. And if you disagree with him, well, you're probably racist too. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the UCLA grad student was fatally stabbed by -- you guessed it, a deranged creep. Brianna Kupfer, aged 24 was alone working when a man believed to be homeless, knifed to death. Why was he out on the streets with a knife? That's probably your fault because you just don't care enough. There's also Sandra Shells, a hardworking nurse who died after being attacked by a homeless man near the L.A. Union Station. He's probably just down on his luck. Then there's George Gascon. The city's woke D.A. who says he doesn't want to send another deranged maniac. A 26-year-old transgender woman to jail for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl over fears that the deviant will be attacked. Oh yes, God forbid a guard uses the wrong pronoun. Gascon recommends home confinement for the perv because D.A. is trans. Cool, George. How does the guest bedroom in your house sound you (BLEEP) clown. But if you agree with me, I bet that makes you transphobic. I got to hand it to the deviant. They're grifting the grift. Meaning they see how to exploit the woke and sanity with the help of progressive lawyers. They are woke to the woke if you will. By the way, can we stop calling these people woke? They're as woke as the statues they love to tear down. Meanwhile, those woke prosecutors may not be criminally deranged, but they're racking up impressive numbers that would make any Batman villain envious. The only thing that separates them from the psychos they're setting free is a trip to the men's warehouse and at that (INAUDIBLE) With a Joker has nothing on Larry Krasner. Under that fool, Philly has gone from a low of 248 murders in 2014 to 562 killings in 2020. A new all-time record. If only the Eagles offense could put up those kind of numbers yesterday. Like I have watched the game. The victims of this violence are almost entirely non-whites living in the poorest parts of the city. But if you plead for solutions, you'd probably be called a racist. Because lots of those killers are also black. How the KKK couldn't ask for a better solution, do nothing. Meanwhile, Chicago under Kim Fox is seen more than 800 homicides in 2021. Levels not seen since the 80s crack at 90s, crack at epidemic. The Good News, Fox has saved the city a few billion dollars by not prosecuting homicides. So you go girl. And if you don't like what she's doing, well, then you're probably racist and misogynist. But of course there's the hostage crisis at the synagogue in Texas where an anti-semitic theme took a rabbi among others hostage in order to free a terrorist. Initially the FBI said this attack wasn't related to the Jewish community. Probably they were waiting to pin it on a white supremacist.",

You paralyzed our weak leaders with the fear of being smeared as racist, or worse a Republican if they try to fix anything. So they now accept the idea that random crazies can murder innocent people, especially on the streets where homelessness is the go-to choice by unhinged people. And an unhinged person will likely commit unhinged activity. No one in power makes this connection. The person who chooses to live crazily is more likely to do crazy things. Fish swim in water, bears roam the woods and the criminally deranged wander the streets punching Asian women. And thanks to progressive D.A.s it'll happen again. Another student murdered, another Asian woman killed. And why is it always Asians? I'm thinking these street thugs aren't doing it in retaliation for the Wuhan lab leak. That when I was a kid, I saw movies like The Warriors, Death Wish, Sudden Impact, gangs roamed and committed inexplicable violence. How quaint does that see now? Because even in those movies, we at least admitted criminal behavior was evil. And it was the good cop against the evil criminals. The lines were clearly drawn. But in our world today, it's good cop versus criminals and also versus the corrupt justice system, which is scarier than all the Halloween movies combined.",

They are creating -- they're putting them into such a tiny box that then we have to protect them. Let's talk about this crime explosion for a second. So law enforcement last year solved more homicides than they had in five years. But because the homicide rate had skyrocketed, the clearance rate actually declined. And the issue -- people are dabbling in shoving people off the subway platform into the tracks. It is the same people that are committing the same crime over and over and over again. It is a recidivist rate. So even before COVID, two-thirds of every violent offender that had served time were rearrested for another violent felony within five years. Now, there is no deterrent consequences, whatsoever. That pool has brought in so much. Let's take your girl Hannah, you know what she did? It says assault in the bathroom. She took the 10-year-old by the throat, she shoved her into the stall, locked her in and then shoved her hand down her pants and groped her. She was also arrested for in other states battery, drug abuses, other offenses violating parole and the like throughout the country. And this is the kind of person that Gascon wants to protect. You want to protect someone in prison, you put them in the SHU. The Specialty Housing Unit -- the Solitary Housing Unit. There are ways in prison via the Department of Corrections to keep someone safe, right? Unless you're Whitey Bulger but otherwise, guess what, I don't give (BLEEP)",

But you're one of -- one of our staffers actually recognized the subway pusher because he'd been pleasuring himself often on the street. And this is something that is regular.

And China is reporting its highest number of COVID cases ever. I'm sure those numbers are as honest as Brian Stelter's food diary. You're more likely to get accurate information from a fortune cookie than the Chinese government, a racist would say, Emily. As Omicron sweeps through the country, China's cancelled domestic ticket sales and upheld their ban on international fans attending. They've also banned delivery from the Wuhan wet market for orders under $5.00. China maintains a strict zero COVID case policy, so for the game, some 20 million people are said to be in tightly controlled lockdowns, not including the kids hard at work making Nikes. God bless them. Several clips have gone viral, claiming to show the vast temporary quarantine camps set up by the government to battle Omicron. Meanwhile, Team USA is wanting its athletes to use burner phones over fears of cyber surveillance from the Chinese government. Or they can use pagers like E.R. doctors or Kat's shrink. Canada has also warned its delegation about protecting their laptops, what's known in America as the Toobin protocol, and capping it all off.

If you haven't been murdered yet, by a nutbag. It's true. We have an epidemic of crazy people, What we used to call the criminally deranged or The View's audience. But they're everywhere. On the streets, on the subway, one is sitting to my right. But they're also in our city halls, our governments, in our district attorney's offices, from New York to Chicago to L.A. to Baltimore. And they're spreading faster than Omircon. It's not funny anymore. On Saturday morning, a maniac waited as a train entered the Time Square subway station before he happily pushed an Asian woman to her death. Michelle Alyssa Go aged 40 was murdered that morning. The killer stuck his tongue out at the police, like a third grader out the window of a school bus. The perfect metaphor for bail reform or any other garbage that passes the social justice reform. But if you dare ask, why was he out on the street? You probably racist or worse a Republican. Meanwhile, this pump just murdered a teenager allegedly in a Bronx Burger King. It's his idea of having it his way under the new attorney general. Here he is shouting about reparations and slavery."

Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the UCLA grad student was fatally stabbed by -- you guessed it, a deranged creep. Brianna Kupfer, aged 24 was alone working when a man believed to be homeless, knifed to death. Why was he out on the streets with a knife? That's probably your fault because you just don't care enough. There's also Sandra Shells, a hardworking nurse who died after being attacked by a homeless man near the L.A. Union Station. He's probably just down on his luck. Then there's George Gascon. The city's woke D.A. who says he doesn't want to send another deranged maniac. A 26-year-old transgender woman to jail for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl over fears that the deviant will be attacked. Oh yes, God forbid a guard uses the wrong pronoun. Gascon recommends home confinement for the perv because D.A. is trans. Cool, George. How does the guest bedroom in your house sound you (BLEEP) clown. But if you agree with me, I bet that makes you transphobic. I got to hand it to the deviant. They're grifting the grift. Meaning they see how to exploit the woke and sanity with the help of progressive lawyers. They are woke to the woke if you will. By the way, can we stop calling these people woke? They're as woke as the statues they love to tear down. Meanwhile, those woke prosecutors may not be criminally deranged, but they're racking up impressive numbers that would make any Batman villain envious. The only thing that separates them from the psychos they're setting free is a trip to the men's warehouse and at that (INAUDIBLE) With a Joker has nothing on Larry Krasner. Under that fool, Philly has gone from a low of 248 murders in 2014 to 562 killings in 2020. A new all-time record. If only the Eagles offense could put up those kind of numbers yesterday. Like I have watched the game. The victims of this violence are almost entirely non-whites living in the poorest parts of the city. But if you plead for solutions, you'd probably be called a racist. Because lots of those killers are also black. How the KKK couldn't ask for a better solution, do nothing. Meanwhile, Chicago under Kim Fox is seen more than 800 homicides in 2021. Levels not seen since the 80s crack at 90s, crack at epidemic. The Good News, Fox has saved the city a few billion dollars by not prosecuting homicides. So you go girl. And if you don't like what she's doing, well, then you're probably racist and misogynist. But of course there's the hostage crisis at the synagogue in Texas where an anti-semitic theme took a rabbi among others hostage in order to free a terrorist. Initially the FBI said this attack wasn't related to the Jewish community. Probably they were waiting to pin it on a white supremacist."

You paralyzed our weak leaders with the fear of being smeared as racist, or worse a Republican if they try to fix anything. So they now accept the idea that random crazies can murder innocent people, especially on the streets where homelessness is the go-to choice by unhinged people. And an unhinged person will likely commit unhinged activity. No one in power makes this connection. The person who chooses to live crazily is more likely to do crazy things. Fish swim in water, bears roam the woods and the criminally deranged wander the streets punching Asian women. And thanks to progressive D.A.s it'll happen again. Another student murdered, another Asian woman killed. And why is it always Asians? I'm thinking these street thugs aren't doing it in retaliation for the Wuhan lab leak. That when I was a kid, I saw movies like The Warriors, Death Wish, Sudden Impact, gangs roamed and committed inexplicable violence. How quaint does that see now? Because even in those movies, we at least admitted criminal behavior was evil. And it was the good cop against the evil criminals. The lines were clearly drawn. But in our world today, it's good cop versus criminals and also versus the corrupt justice system, which is scarier than all the Halloween movies combined."

Here's the thing that I've noticed that there are no more sane criminals. Like anytime something happens where somebody is murdered, they will -- OK, even including the transgendered, the male to female trans, there's -- thing, he's develop mentally disabled. It's almost like these progressive D.A.s are building a force field around people that are arrested. Oh, they're insane. They're mentally ill. Clearly some of them are. But every one of them?"

They are creating -- they're putting them into such a tiny box that then we have to protect them. Let's talk about this crime explosion for a second. So law enforcement last year solved more homicides than they had in five years. But because the homicide rate had skyrocketed, the clearance rate actually declined. And the issue -- people are dabbling in shoving people off the subway platform into the tracks. It is the same people that are committing the same crime over and over and over again. It is a recidivist rate. So even before COVID, two-thirds of every violent offender that had served time were rearrested for another violent felony within five years. Now, there is no deterrent consequences, whatsoever. That pool has brought in so much. Let's take your girl Hannah, you know what she did? It says assault in the bathroom. She took the 10-year-old by the throat, she shoved her into the stall, locked her in and then shoved her hand down her pants and groped her. She was also arrested for in other states battery, drug abuses, other offenses violating parole and the like throughout the country. And this is the kind of person that Gascon wants to protect. You want to protect someone in prison, you put them in the SHU. The Specialty Housing Unit -- the Solitary Housing Unit. There are ways in prison via the Department of Corrections to keep someone safe, right? Unless you're Whitey Bulger but otherwise, guess what, I don't give (BLEEP)"

But you're one of -- one of our staffers actually recognized the subway pusher because he'd been pleasuring himself often on the street. And this is something that is regular. If somebody is masturbating publicly on the street, chances are he's mentally ill and should probably be behind bars for other things.

You're more likely to get accurate information from a fortune cookie than the Chinese government, a racist would say, Emily. As Omicron sweeps through the country, China's cancelled domestic ticket sales and upheld their ban on international fans attending. They've also banned delivery from the Wuhan wet market for orders under $5.00. China maintains a strict zero COVID case policy, so for the game, some 20 million people are said to be in tightly controlled lockdowns, not including the kids hard at work making Nikes. God bless them. Several clips have gone viral, claiming to show the vast temporary quarantine camps set up by the government to battle Omicron. Meanwhile, Team USA is wanting its athletes to use burner phones over fears of cyber surveillance from the Chinese government. Or they can use pagers like E.R. doctors or Kat's shrink.

She forced herself to eat 32 rolls for a guy owes his two jalapeno poppers as well as miso soup. Who gets that all you can eat? What a waste and edamame, of course, because all you can eat, right? That's something you rarely hear of, a young California woman eating. The next morning, she woke up with such terrible stomach pains that she went to the hospital where doctors diagnosed her with acid reflux. The hospital replied, we'll change your diagnosis to COVID. They discharged her after a few hours but she says it took two -- it took days for her to fully recover. That's also what people say after they see Joe DeVito do stand-up. One reason for that. The woman says she still plans eat sushi in the future and sushi says it still plans on giving her acid reflux. All right, Emily, should she sue the restaurant?"
