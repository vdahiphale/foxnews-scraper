      "sentences": "Look at that. Look at all of these people. Oh, so happy, happy, happy people. Yes, baby. Yes. That's right. Yes, we are awesome. We are awesome. Hello, America. Hello, America and United States of Texas. It's great to be here. It's great to be here. Yesterday we left New York City. What a relief. Leaving there for here. It's like waking up from a bad dream. It's like going from the Texans to the Cowboys. You know what, I don't even know what that means. I don't know anything about sports. It's like going from Joy Behar's bed to anything that isn't Joy Behar's bed. I'd even -- I'd even take a bed of nails. That I know. And thank you, by the way, for the gift basket. I've only been in Texas for one day and I already got an A.R.-15. Yes. Applauding an A.R.-15. I got an A.R.-15, a bible and Beto O'Rourke's balls in a pickle jar. That's an applause line. I -- I'm kidding. We all know Beto has no balls. Even Caitlyn Jenner would tell him to grow a pair. I don't even get that joke. Remember when he said he was coming for your guns? And you said yeah, try it, Nancy. This guy couldn't get a glue gun from an art teacher. And yet he wants to run for governor. That's a joke. His odds of becoming governor are as good as Hunter Biden passing a drug test. Originally, I had Kat's name in there, but I realized Hunter's funnier. But like Beto, right now the Democrats are running into a problem. Whether they want to admit it or not. America is more like Texas than it is like California or New York. That means -- this monologue is going to take the whole show. That means Americans want an America that is more like America. And like our show, a lot of people come in here for that very same reason. Especially from California, which makes sense. The U-hauls are headed in one direction and the apocalypse in the other. The state, California is home to the largest share of the country's billionaires and also the highest poverty rate. They build walls around their mansions, but turn your backyards into truck stop bathrooms except with more poop. Which means it's California goes to hell in a handbasket woven by progressives, the rich and powerful don't care. So, everyone in between has no choice but to leave for greener pastures. I can't blame them. Everything in Texas is bigger and better. Even Kat has grown since she's been here. Yes. She at least -- I think she said at least five-three. But Texas had a better COVID response than New York did probably because your governor didn't kill more grannies than a badly placed slip rug. If only those grandmas had been hotter, Cuomo might have kept them around. That is disgusting. That is disgusting. So, here's a comparison. Texas has no state income tax or inherited tax but California and New York have some of the highest in the nation, which means you, Texans, could have more money to spend on your kids and by kids, I mean firearms. In Texas -- in Texas, the best college football team is named after a majestic impressive breed of cattle. In California, the best college football team is named after condoms. In Texas -- in Texas, you have the bustling new Tesla factory in the homebase of Elon Musk. In California, they have 39 empty cheesecake factories and a homeless guy living in front of each one. So, one state is building cars and the other makes people live in them. In Texas, you have to build a wall to protect the border. In New York we had to build a wall to protect women from our governor. In Texas, the state bird is the northern Mockingbird. In New York, it's a greasy pigeon with one eye and a human finger in his mouth. We call that the Doocy. In Texas you have Joe Rogan. In New York, they have CNN or what's left of CNN. Everyday someone gets fired or arrested. They're so low on employees. Check out their new office assistants.",

Texas has rodeos, New York -- New York has this. There you go. That's what you call it New York rodeo. A rat with a slice of pizza. They both go well together with Deontay.in Texas -- in Texas, you have real cowboys who speak politely and know how to handle their guns. In California, they have Alec Baldwin. In Texas, a hoedown is a dance. And why bother? Why bother? All right. In New York City, it's what a cop says over his radio with a hooker is passed out on your porch. Yes, and the two step -- the two step is when you have to jump over a pile of street feces. Texas is known for its beautiful cattle. That's kind of true in New York City. Yes. Talk about -- talk about open mouth disease. So, here in Texas, there's a vast gulf between the residents in Mexico. In California, there's a vast gulf between the governor's ears. Here in Texas, you have the best barbecue in the world. And California, they put pineapples on pizza. That's like putting a mustache on Miranda Lambert. She could pull it off. In California, they have decaf skinny soy no foam latte. In Texas, you have coffee and testosterone. In California you have San Francisco. In Texas you don't. In Texas, there are males and females. In California and NYC there's just one new gender and it's called loser. They use more hair dye than they do shampoo. In California in New York, you can smash and grab, in Texas you smash and grab, you drop and die. In California, the homeless can poop on your front lawn. Try that in Dallas and it's the last poop you'll ever take. In Texas you produce heroes like Sam Houston and Davy Crockett. Yes. But, you know, California produced this guy. Yes. I was handsome. To California has Warner Brothers, Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures. But Texas has the Greg Gutfeld show. So, the difference is stark. It's a reminder of who makes the country work and how those people make it possible for the other idiots to thrive. You are the people who create a civil lawful society, a place where the idiots who make fun of you can live. Right now, you see how the press treats the truckers. That's how they think of you. The truckers are a proxy for the typical non-journalist, non-media hardworking person, it's you, your family, your states. So, this week we salute you Texas and the hard- working, fun-loving ass kicking Texans that you are. Let's do this, America.",

Yes, but like Kat's assertions that those mushrooms are medicinal, I don't think it makes it legal.

This time a 4- year-old boy in Times Square punched in the head by a nutcase with a history of violence against strangers. And no, it wasn't Brian Kilmeade. And once again its moms to the rescue. The boy's mother tackled the psychopath, two other women to aid in. (INAUDIBLE) kept him pinned down until cops arrived.

This is the whole thing inside my shirt. Do we -- I travel all over doing comedy and it's fun to watch how different states respond to the pandemic and I just wanted to give some props. I like how in Texas you guys went, hey, you know this whole COVID thing, we're going to, we're going to (BLEEP) skip it. You guys did it. I was so excited to be -- I was like nervous and excited. I got here super early because I'm always worried about where to park. That's me right there, it's my truck. Try to tow it, you'll kill people. Staying right there. Ah COVID really made comedy tough though, man. It was weird. Even the shows we did have were bizarre. Like, I saw this one performer. The entire time he was on stage, he wore a mask. Yes, it just kind of ruined it. You know, he was a ventriloquist, or was he? It just feels free here, though. It feels free. I was in an Uber and I go to this guy is just the vibe is different. You know, I guess you guys aren't social distancing. And you're not like wearing masks anymore. And the guy goes, No, dude, we're not afraid. You know, and I believe because I was sitting on his lap, and yes, facing him. I go this guy doesn't care man. He's a nice guy, he's into it. I'm going to be totally honest. I get intimidated sometimes being in Texas because there's like a lot of real men here, you know? And, and I don't know if you can tell by looking at me, but I'm not exactly like what you would call a like a man's man. I'm not even really what you would call like a woman's man. I went to the doctor once I thought something was wrong in that go do could you like do some testing? I feel like I don't have a lot of like the guy tendencies. I don't hunt or fight or anything. And the doctor was yes, we could do like a testosterone thing. We can figure it out for you. She comes back like a half hour later. He's got a clipboard. And he looks very serious. And he goes, I'm glad you came in today, man. Because it turns out, you are what's known as a huge (BLEEP). And I go, come on, there's no way that's an actual diagnosis. And the guy goes, OK, you got me. It's not an actual diagnosis. But I knew I could call you that, and you wouldn't do anything -- based on the testing. Oh, man, but it's good. It's like -- we, I have. So, I'm a married guy. I have three children. And sometimes people will say, Jamie, do you have a favorite kid? Which if there's parents out there, you guys know you're not supposed to, you know, I have one. I'll just tell you, it's my neighbor's kid. You guys, he's just adorable. I got a picture up on my phone here. So, I am divorced. And I -- but I don't feel like it has to be a negative thing. You know, if you're out there and you're in love, I hope you stay together forever, and stay in love. But I do feel like I have to tell you, for anybody that's kind of like on the fence. Um, you get it feels pretty good over here on this side. Yes, I can explain. Here's a way to know if you should get divorced if people start telling you negative things about divorce, and none of it sounds that bad. But these are negatives, these are the negative things. My friend goes, dude, you can't get divorced man. You're going to have to move at your house and live alone in a crappy apartment. I go, dude, when is the soonest we could do something like that? I don't think the lady, that lady likes me that I live with. He goes, yes, but dude, you're only going to be able to see your kids on the weekends. I know that sounds amazing too, to be honest with you. Oh my god, I love these kids. But I don't want to take him to school. It's a pain in the ass. I want those, I want those fun dad weekends. You got any more bad news? People do not know how to react when you tell me getting divorce. I'm like very happy. My ex-wife is very happy. She's a cool chick. My friends didn't know what to say. I was married for 16 years. And a year before that, we met. That's a long time. And my friend goes dude, he goes I'm excited for you. Because now you're going to be able to go out there into the world and get some strange, which does sound kind of exciting because to tell you guys the God's honest truth, I wasn't even getting any familiar. That's the kind you're legally supposed to get. Do you know what I mean? But what I want -- OK listen I'd love you to check out I have a show on Netflix with Rob Schneider, it's called The Real Robin. I'm real proud of it and we tour together and stuff and it's just sometimes I don't want people to think like that like all I do is write off the success of Rob Schneider. It's a lot of what I do. But I also have stuff I do completely on my own. If you guys like my comedy, you want to check out things that are completely separately, please check out my Web site, it's RobSchneidersFriend.com, you can go on there and just check it out. My name is Jamie. Nice to see you guys!",

Hello, America and United States of Texas. It's great to be here. It's great to be here. Yesterday we left New York City. What a relief. Leaving there for here. It's like waking up from a bad dream. It's like going from the Texans to the Cowboys. You know what, I don't even know what that means. I don't know anything about sports. It's like going from Joy Behar's bed to anything that isn't Joy Behar's bed. I'd even -- I'd even take a bed of nails. That I know. And thank you, by the way, for the gift basket. I've only been in Texas for one day and I already got an A.R.-15. Yes. Applauding an A.R.-15. I got an A.R.-15, a bible and Beto O'Rourke's balls in a pickle jar. That's an applause line. I -- I'm kidding. We all know Beto has no balls. Even Caitlyn Jenner would tell him to grow a pair. I don't even get that joke. Remember when he said he was coming for your guns? And you said yeah, try it, Nancy. This guy couldn't get a glue gun from an art teacher. And yet he wants to run for governor. That's a joke. His odds of becoming governor are as good as Hunter Biden passing a drug test. Originally, I had Kat's name in there, but I realized Hunter's funnier. But like Beto, right now the Democrats are running into a problem. Whether they want to admit it or not. America is more like Texas than it is like California or New York. That means -- this monologue is going to take the whole show. That means Americans want an America that is more like America. And like our show, a lot of people come in here for that very same reason. Especially from California, which makes sense. The U-hauls are headed in one direction and the apocalypse in the other. The state, California is home to the largest share of the country's billionaires and also the highest poverty rate. They build walls around their mansions, but turn your backyards into truck stop bathrooms except with more poop. Which means it's California goes to hell in a handbasket woven by progressives, the rich and powerful don't care. So, everyone in between has no choice but to leave for greener pastures. I can't blame them. Everything in Texas is bigger and better. Even Kat has grown since she's been here. Yes. She at least -- I think she said at least five-three. But Texas had a better COVID response than New York did probably because your governor didn't kill more grannies than a badly placed slip rug. If only those grandmas had been hotter, Cuomo might have kept them around. That is disgusting. That is disgusting. So, here's a comparison. Texas has no state income tax or inherited tax but California and New York have some of the highest in the nation, which means you, Texans, could have more money to spend on your kids and by kids, I mean firearms. In Texas -- in Texas, the best college football team is named after a majestic impressive breed of cattle. In California, the best college football team is named after condoms. In Texas -- in Texas, you have the bustling new Tesla factory in the homebase of Elon Musk. In California, they have 39 empty cheesecake factories and a homeless guy living in front of each one. So, one state is building cars and the other makes people live in them. In Texas, you have to build a wall to protect the border. In New York we had to build a wall to protect women from our governor. In Texas, the state bird is the northern Mockingbird. In New York, it's a greasy pigeon with one eye and a human finger in his mouth. We call that the Doocy. In Texas you have Joe Rogan. In New York, they have CNN or what's left of CNN. Everyday someone gets fired or arrested. They're so low on employees. Check out their new office assistants."

Texas has rodeos, New York -- New York has this. There you go. That's what you call it New York rodeo. A rat with a slice of pizza. They both go well together with Deontay.in Texas -- in Texas, you have real cowboys who speak politely and know how to handle their guns. In California, they have Alec Baldwin. In Texas, a hoedown is a dance. And why bother? Why bother? All right. In New York City, it's what a cop says over his radio with a hooker is passed out on your porch. Yes, and the two step -- the two step is when you have to jump over a pile of street feces. Texas is known for its beautiful cattle. That's kind of true in New York City. Yes. Talk about -- talk about open mouth disease. So, here in Texas, there's a vast gulf between the residents in Mexico. In California, there's a vast gulf between the governor's ears. Here in Texas, you have the best barbecue in the world. And California, they put pineapples on pizza. That's like putting a mustache on Miranda Lambert. She could pull it off. In California, they have decaf skinny soy no foam latte. In Texas, you have coffee and testosterone. In California you have San Francisco. In Texas you don't. In Texas, there are males and females. In California and NYC there's just one new gender and it's called loser. They use more hair dye than they do shampoo. In California in New York, you can smash and grab, in Texas you smash and grab, you drop and die. In California, the homeless can poop on your front lawn. Try that in Dallas and it's the last poop you'll ever take. In Texas you produce heroes like Sam Houston and Davy Crockett. Yes. But, you know, California produced this guy. Yes. I was handsome. To California has Warner Brothers, Universal Studios and Paramount Pictures. But Texas has the Greg Gutfeld show. So, the difference is stark. It's a reminder of who makes the country work and how those people make it possible for the other idiots to thrive. You are the people who create a civil lawful society, a place where the idiots who make fun of you can live. Right now, you see how the press treats the truckers. That's how they think of you. The truckers are a proxy for the typical non-journalist, non-media hardworking person, it's you, your family, your states. So, this week we salute you Texas and the hard- working, fun-loving ass kicking Texans that you are. Let's do this, America."

Like, it's like yes, but my solution was like less armed robbery and more like cup of noodles. Like, that's not normal."

      "utterance": "Oh, man, that's so true what Greg just said. I was at the bar and this guy goes, what's the comedy scene like in Alaska? And I go, you're, you're talking to it. This is the whole thing inside my shirt. Do we -- I travel all over doing comedy and it's fun to watch how different states respond to the pandemic and I just wanted to give some props. I like how in Texas you guys went, hey, you know this whole COVID thing, we're going to, we're going to (BLEEP) skip it. You guys did it. I was so excited to be -- I was like nervous and excited. I got here super early because I'm always worried about where to park. That's me right there, it's my truck. Try to tow it, you'll kill people. Staying right there. Ah COVID really made comedy tough though, man. It was weird. Even the shows we did have were bizarre. Like, I saw this one performer. The entire time he was on stage, he wore a mask. Yes, it just kind of ruined it. You know, he was a ventriloquist, or was he? It just feels free here, though. It feels free. I was in an Uber and I go to this guy is just the vibe is different. You know, I guess you guys aren't social distancing. And you're not like wearing masks anymore. And the guy goes, No, dude, we're not afraid. You know, and I believe because I was sitting on his lap, and yes, facing him. I go this guy doesn't care man. He's a nice guy, he's into it. I'm going to be totally honest. I get intimidated sometimes being in Texas because there's like a lot of real men here, you know? And, and I don't know if you can tell by looking at me, but I'm not exactly like what you would call a like a man's man. I'm not even really what you would call like a woman's man. I went to the doctor once I thought something was wrong in that go do could you like do some testing? I feel like I don't have a lot of like the guy tendencies. I don't hunt or fight or anything. And the doctor was yes, we could do like a testosterone thing. We can figure it out for you. She comes back like a half hour later. He's got a clipboard. And he looks very serious. And he goes, I'm glad you came in today, man. Because it turns out, you are what's known as a huge (BLEEP). And I go, come on, there's no way that's an actual diagnosis. And the guy goes, OK, you got me. It's not an actual diagnosis. But I knew I could call you that, and you wouldn't do anything -- based on the testing. Oh, man, but it's good. It's like -- we, I have. So, I'm a married guy. I have three children. And sometimes people will say, Jamie, do you have a favorite kid? Which if there's parents out there, you guys know you're not supposed to, you know, I have one. I'll just tell you, it's my neighbor's kid. You guys, he's just adorable. I got a picture up on my phone here. So, I am divorced. And I -- but I don't feel like it has to be a negative thing. You know, if you're out there and you're in love, I hope you stay together forever, and stay in love. But I do feel like I have to tell you, for anybody that's kind of like on the fence. Um, you get it feels pretty good over here on this side. Yes, I can explain. Here's a way to know if you should get divorced if people start telling you negative things about divorce, and none of it sounds that bad. But these are negatives, these are the negative things. My friend goes, dude, you can't get divorced man. You're going to have to move at your house and live alone in a crappy apartment. I go, dude, when is the soonest we could do something like that? I don't think the lady, that lady likes me that I live with. He goes, yes, but dude, you're only going to be able to see your kids on the weekends. I know that sounds amazing too, to be honest with you. Oh my god, I love these kids. But I don't want to take him to school. It's a pain in the ass. I want those, I want those fun dad weekends. You got any more bad news? People do not know how to react when you tell me getting divorce. I'm like very happy. My ex-wife is very happy. She's a cool chick. My friends didn't know what to say. I was married for 16 years. And a year before that, we met. That's a long time. And my friend goes dude, he goes I'm excited for you. Because now you're going to be able to go out there into the world and get some strange, which does sound kind of exciting because to tell you guys the God's honest truth, I wasn't even getting any familiar. That's the kind you're legally supposed to get. Do you know what I mean? But what I want -- OK listen I'd love you to check out I have a show on Netflix with Rob Schneider, it's called The Real Robin. I'm real proud of it and we tour together and stuff and it's just sometimes I don't want people to think like that like all I do is write off the success of Rob Schneider. It's a lot of what I do. But I also have stuff I do completely on my own. If you guys like my comedy, you want to check out things that are completely separately, please check out my Web site, it's RobSchneidersFriend.com, you can go on there and just check it out. My name is Jamie. Nice to see you guys!"
