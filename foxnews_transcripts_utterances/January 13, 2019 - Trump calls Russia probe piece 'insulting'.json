The Daily Caller ran a pretty inflammatory headline about the freshman Democratic congresswoman who is getting so much media attention.

The story itself said the bogus bathtub photos were not of the congresswoman but of Sydney Leathers. She is the one who once engaged in an erotic correspondence with Anthony Weiner. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about the fake nude photo, calling it, it's posting completely disgusting behavior from conservative outlets. The Daily Caller changed the headline, saying, we regret the error as the intent was to inform our audience that a fake image was circulating online. But the headline was pure clickbait.

A media explosion over Michael Cohen testifying before Congress next month, but are journalists raising expectations too high? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez apologizes to Donald Trump Jr. and picks a fight with, yes, the media's fact checkers. Is the freshman congresswoman starting to get burned by the spotlight? Plus, Amazon chief and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos undergoing the biggest divorce in history as The National Enquirer reports on an affair with a former TV anchor. Given the president's criticism of Bezos, was he targeted by the tabloid owned by Trump's pal? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz. President Trump is pushing back against two major investigative pieces that are breaking this weekend. The New York Times, the FBI once launched a counterintelligence probe. This was right after the Jim Comey firing into whether Donald Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia. The Washington Post, Trump has concealed details of his face-to-face encounters with Vladimir Putin from senior administration officials."

I have to say there is this incredible eagerness among journalists to see this more as an indictment of Donald Trump than of the FBI. You get nine paragraphs down into The New York Times report and there is a note right there that says there is no public evidence that has emerged to suggests that Donald Trump has been -- was taking direction from the Russian government. Nine paragraphs --"

So I think when Trump says that there has been no collusion and that of course is what mainstream media wants to attack him to, he doesn't help himself out by having notes not recorded of these meetings. I understand that for national security, we don't want everything released to the media. But if he really wants to help himself out, plenty of these meetings were recorded with Putin. He did have Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state, come out. But I think for his own credibility in these stories that continue to come out, they want to damage him based on some supposed collusion and connection with Russia, he should realize that and be above bar and realize I got to be careful with this."

The story itself is an example of that as is all those stories that were leaked about his phone conversations with world leaders, Australia, Mexico. Sometimes, transcripts were released. Maybe he just doesn't trust the people around him. President told Jeanine Pirro, I don't care, I'm happy to have this stuff released. All right, let's go back to all the media hypes surrounding the Oval Office address. What did you make as we saw at the top of commentators and anchors, not just commentators, accusing the president of outright lying before he even delivers his speech?"

And in some cases, he absolutely does have problems trafficking straight facts. There is no question about that and it's absolutely true. KURTZ: One quick example, he said that the former president supported him on the border wall. All living ex-presidents have come out and said that that's not true."

You would never hear this by President Obama. This is his first Oval Office address. I actually think one of the reasons why they decided to cover it was so that they could check about the wall of misinformation, the term that they use, and Democrats use it as well, but also because you have the rebuttal by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. So, they figured this would be good TV. But I think this should have been, given it is a seven-minute address, you show this because it is such a concerning issue in the country."

There has been a media freak out over the president saying and almost making it imminent that he is going to use emergency powers to get funding from other agencies, namely the military, to fund the wall. And then for now, he says he is not going to do that. Lindsey Graham said he spoke to the president this morning, went on Fox News Sunday and said he rather make a deal. But do you think the media criticism to this, including from National Review about a stretch of executive power that would be, may have been a factor in the president's decision to hold off at least for now?"

Not only did he have criticism from different conservative press, but he also have criticism from senators on the House, Republicans, like, you cannot do this because we all know if you want to get money for this wall, come to Congress, and actually let's make a deal. There is room for a deal to be done, but the president has to be willing to move off of this idea that he is going to get $5 billion for his wall not matter what."

But at the same time, the president tweeted about this, about the off-the-record. He said, \"who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers\" So Beverly, I have reported on off-the-record meetings at the White House in which journalists were involved because I wasn't bound by any agreement. But I did think that, man, if I was in the room, I wouldn't tell anybody about it because you're giving your word that you are going to play by those rules unless the White House, as sometimes happens, agrees to put it on background, agrees to put it on the record."

If they're constantly worried about leaks, they're not going to come straight forward with what's going on.

He said that a reporter from another organization approached him, trying to, like, went on (ph) behind while you're eating the salad, and he wouldn't discuss it at all. And he made the point that the White House might stop doing this. Now, some people think you shouldn't have off-the-record. Journalists find it useful. It's a whole tradition on state of the union speeches to find out what the president is thinking. I also reached out to other anchors about this, Chuck Todd of NBC, Chris Cuomo of CNN, told me they couldn't discuss it because the meeting was off- the-record. So this comes now to the question of if you're going to go eat the meal and accept the ground rules, then can you turn around and dish what was on the menu?"

When you give a whole bunch of surrogates to speech early, parts of it might get out, and that is the risk that every White House takes.

The Times ran a correction saying Manafort wanted the data sent to wealthy guys in Ukraine further removed obviously from Vladimir Putin's inner circle. The Daily Caller ran a pretty inflammatory headline about the freshman Democratic congresswoman who is getting so much media attention. Here is the photo some people describe as a nude selfie of Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. What? Nude selfie? The story itself said the bogus bathtub photos were not of the congresswoman but of Sydney Leathers. She is the one who once engaged in an erotic correspondence with Anthony Weiner. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about the fake nude photo, calling it, it's posting completely disgusting behavior from conservative outlets. The Daily Caller changed the headline, saying, we regret the error as the intent was to inform our audience that a fake image was circulating online. But the headline was pure clickbait.

And that he makes it effectively impossible to continue the charade that you have, certain networks, certain newspapers as objective, non-partisan news sources. This is a joke. I mean, CNN from an editorial perspective, not everybody there, there are good journalists there, just like everywhere else. But from a broad editorial perspective, CNN exists to launder liberalism for its audience. Essentially, the audience thinks that they're getting objective news. They want to believe that. They think they're just getting the facts. But when you Acosta and something like this, not only is he not disciplined, he is effectively celebrated by the institution.

I think it's a legitimate question when you have a president before the speech who said Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Four different presidents support the wall, which they don't.

And he said no, those were people who were picked up at airports. She sort of backed off. Kellyanne Conway went on TV a day or two later said Sarah Sanders had misspoken.

She is not going to be on the intelligence committee, the oversight committee, maybe she will be on financial services. But that's not really at play.

But I also think there might be a place for that. It's just going to be interesting to see how that plays with the rest of her party. As we saw from the political story this past week, a lot of Democrats are saying and some by the way with her own ideology, the ideology she embraces as well.

She has no fear about going after journalists. And in that respect, I think she sees herself as the far-left Trump. And she's going to do this to satisfy the progressive base. The question is whether or not some of the older, more established Democrats in Congress will say, oh, wait a minute, we have their own way of doing this.

Well, the question is, can we really minimize such big inaccuracies this way, from not only her, but any politician in Washington. I think it would have been better to own up to the inaccuracies a little bit more, which she did a little on Twitter. But I heard a little sense of sarcasm as well. And by the way, if she's trying to again push this progressive agenda that something that her own party even seems to shy a way from, with some of the people, some of the Democrats in the House and the Senate, then you really need to make sure that your facts are sound. If you want people to believe what you are trying to, again, push forward, then you have to have a very bullet proof set of armor on you. And that comes with sound facts."

That's a very, you know, significant liberal line. A few days ago, she voted to fund ICE, as part of a big appropriation. And I question whether or not she was even aware of that.

She will be paid for the rest of her $69 million contract after being ousted from the Today Show, over that black face controversy. She will also be free to take another television job. I still think the network used the flap to force her out over sagging ratings. And Susan Zirinsky, a respected producer at CBS for four decades is kind of a surprise choice to take over CBS news. Z, as she is known, very much earned that job, but it can hurt the network to have a woman in charge after Les Moonves and Charlie Rose were ousted for sexual misconduct.

Does the company run differently if, you know, the wife, MacKenzie Bezos, is involved? I kind of doubt it. The markets are not reacting that way. It seems like there's enough money to go around.

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But not all of the stuff the Inquirer found, maybe it's so unseemly they don't want to do it. The broadcast networks have not touched it. I'm just raising the question. Quick thought."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "I mean, I think -- listen, there is a value to reading this stuff. I've read it, I know everybody else has read it. They read it in the Post and The Inquirer.
