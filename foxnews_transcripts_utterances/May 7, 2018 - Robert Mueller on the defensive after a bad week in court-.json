And I think it is sort of thematic of a lot of these asymmetrical -- the Iran deal, the open borders, the NATO contributions that we thought what was normal really wasn't. It was predicated on the idea that we were so strong and powerful we could always make concessions. And then in 2016 the people in between the coast said, you know what, we don't want to make concessions because we are not as powerful, at least we aren't, and as affluent as you people who create these deals.

Andy McCarthy is here to expose the details behind their outrageous double dealings. And also, why are the media so obsessed with John McCain's funeral plans? Wow. We will reveal it. Plus, the Kanye effect is growing. A pastor is now calling on African- Americans to consider how illegal immigration is damaging their community. He will join us. And breaking just moments ago, a powerful New York Democrat forced to resign after shocking allegations of assault. We will bring you all the details. But first, three women, one double standard. If that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Today, the first lady announced her formal agenda for the remainder of her husband's time in office.

Except for a brief moment during the Monica Lewinsky affair, I don't recall this kind of granular relationship coverage when Bill and Hillary Clinton of course were in in the White House. Now, if you want to know why the media has trained its sights on the first lady, it's simple. She's a real asset to the president and her popularity is soaring. A new CNN poll released today shows that her favorability has gone from 47 percent in January to 57 percent today. She has even jumped 15 percentage points with Democrats. Imagine if we had a fair press. Melania Trump is also a presidential spouse. Let's face it, who brushes off the celebrity culture and avoids politics. Where Michelle wanted to retool everything from nutrition guidelines to school lunches and Hillary wanted to remake all of health care, Melania just wants to help kids well-being and also to raise our son. That brings me to the media coverage of Gina Haspel, President Trump's nominee to head the CIA. It's confirmed she will be the first woman to ever lead that male-dominated agency. Haspel is a patriot. She served the agency for 33 years, most of it undercover. So, why won't the left cheer her for breaking the glass ceiling? Do you know why? Because killing off her nomination would hurt Trump and because she carried out her duties as instructed."

They make it sound like she invented the interrogation technique. She did not. It was authorized by George W. Bush and approved by his legal team who briefed Congress on it. There was further static about Haspel being involved as you heard with the destruction of nearly hundreds of tapes of interrogation. A newly declassified review showed that she did not order the tapes to destruction, her superior did, and with good reason. The anti-Trump bullies almost drove Haspel to withdraw her nomination, but she is holding firm. Good for her. Those vilifying her are despicable. I am very disappointed in Rand Paul for opposing her nomination as well. But the media have found one woman with a Trump connection to actually salute. It's a woman they literally roll out the red carpet for, porn star, Stormy Daniels."

It's amazing to watch the media disparage and attack women of real substance while they laud a woman who spends most of her time hanging off a pole half or completely naked. She has already signed a detailed letter stating that she had no affair with Donald Trump, but now she has changed her story to sell tickets to her strip act. Her greatest accomplishment may be stripping the Mueller investigation of all credibility. So, let the media plod there darling of the moment. She is actually a good representative of what they have become. But for America, we are going to stick with substance and truly independent women and that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now for reaction in New York is Tammy Bruce, the president of Independent Women's Voice and a Fox News contributor. Also, in New York is Cathy Areu, a liberal analyst and publisher of \"Catalina\" magazine, and with the onset is Anita McBride, chief of staff to First Lady Laura Bush. Great to have all of you strong, independent and smart women of substance on the show with me tonight. I want to start with you, Anita. I was so angered by what, first of all, they've done to Melania from the very beginning, ridiculing her accent, talking about how she is in prison, that's the me, free Melania. She pulls out this new initiative and its dismissed and denigrated before it even begins, double standard?"

I think it's great, number one, that you are covering this tonight because she is a woman of substance and I have to say there's no question in my mind why the polls are in her favor because people are beginning to see a lot more of her. She has beautifully represented us overseas as a graceful and gracious first lady. Her first state dinner was flawless. And also, we know we've seen her with children, she is authentic with children, she cares about them. You can see it, it's the perfect initiative for her to talk about how we should all, everybody that touches the life of a child as a responsibility to help them lead a better life. That's what she talked about today."

It's the #metoo moment, of course, we will get to Schneiderman later. We got the #metoo movement. We got women breaking glass ceilings everywhere, it's a good thing Here we have a first lady who has not really delved into politics. This is all new to her. She takes a while to get her footing. She announces this initiative today and what she is introduced with by The Washington Post is a story filled with anonymous sources claiming to know when the president and the first lady eat together, not eat together. And in the White House briefing room saying she doesn't even live in the White House. Don't you think we would know if the first lady didn't live at the White House? Your reaction to this?"

I stand by \"The Washington Post\" and their reporting. The problem is the irony of this, she's going after cyber bullies, that's her initiative and her husband is known as a cyber bully. So, I think that's the problem with her initiative. It just so happens that the day she doesn't he's tweeting angry tweets. It's unfortunate because she is trying to do the right thing with this initiative."

She got Congress -- frankly, really put the pressure on Congress to push this $5 billion initiative for school lunches. The thing was a total disaster. Kids hated the lunches. They threw them away, they made videos about them. You can get in on this, Tammy, did you ever hear a member of the media criticize Michelle for a school lunch initiative that fell flat, well-intentioned, I'm sure it was. We have to get rid of all obesity, all of that is good. On the substance there wasn't even criticism of Michelle. It's all push- ups on Ellen, going on Fallon, on the cover of magazines, she's most beautiful. That's fine. But come on, the double standard here is pathetic. I'm enraged by this.

And she was involved in policy, a powerful advocate and usually if you implement something that doesn't work you might want to change it, but there was none of that.

The notion that we are in fact responsible for ourselves -- when Mrs. Obama wonders what are we thinking? We are thinking about the future. We are thinking if we can afford to pay the rent, if we can clothe our children. If we can get them into schools that will serve them best. These are the decisions we made and with Donald Trump we clearly made the right decision.

As I said, the New York state's attorney general, Democrat, Eric Schneiderman has resigned tonight. It comes hours after an explosive report from the \"New Yorker\" magazine were four women accused him of horrific acts of physical abuse. Despite his resignation, he is denying the accusations, but he has been a champion, let's not forget, of the #metoo movement. Earlier this year, he even denounced Harvey Weinstein saying, \"we have never seen anything as despicable as what we have seen here.\" Cathy Areu, I believe he's the guy to also go after the Trump Foundation if my memory serves correct.

Everyone just assumes it's all true because Stormy Daniels had a guest spot on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Here's a couple of tweets. I will let the other women on the panel respond. No one is above the law. I will continue to remind President Trump and his administration of that fact every day. October 11th, 2017. Another tweet. Without the reporting of The New York Times and the New Yorker and the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment that they endured at the hands of powerful men, there would not be the critical national reckoning underway. Tammy Bruce, national reckoning."

It was all about what we are your protectors, we are your advocates and that had kept them safe. This is about power, it's about complete control and with the report, if true, it's not about sexual harassment but physical violence. Perhaps even some crimes in a dynamic now here in New York is going to be very complicated. This is not unusual. If it fits within the same kind of template that we saw with Weinstein and everyone else in this framework and I think liberals have to think about what is it about men on that side -- I'm still a registered Democrat in California. What is it, is it that they've given them a pass for so long because they've had power and they said we will effectively we will do this, but we will protect you otherwise and that otherwise the entire narrative of the liberal agenda will collapse if you don't protect us.

What we learned when you compare the two documents, once we got the new passages shown is that what they had tried to conceal was the information that was exculpatory in nature about Flynn and the information that actually went to their decision-making process, including how they investigated Flynn. The fact that they couldn't get their story straight about what the basis of considering him to be a criminal suspect were. It just really, very depressing for somebody who is proud of having come from the Justice Department and working there for such a long time. Some of the stuff they held back was actually public information that was out already. They didn't want to put it in in the context that it came up in the report because it calls into question the prosecution of Flynn."

I think he thought he was allowed to have conversations as incoming national security advisor. Sally Yates rushes over to his office, brings a couple agents including Peter Strzok and he says I will answer questions. He didn't even have a lawyer present. He just sat down and answer questions."

If you've got a guy like Flynn, who has a big intelligence background. He's a combat veteran of the United States. Actually, wrote a book in 2016 that labeled Russia as an enemy of the United States. So, if you really want to advance your intelligence knowledge and you have a recording of Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador, what you would do is play the recordings for Flynn and ask him what did this mean, what did that mean, so you can enhance your understanding, right?

So, you have to wonder, everything else that they are withholding, why are they withholding it? And yet they are attacking Nunes. You think they would be attacking the people who were holding back documents. The one fair criticism I think they make is that ultimately the president is in charge of the executive branch and he's got to do -- to my mind, he's got to do a lot more than tweet that he's angry that there's not enough cooperation.

But McCain's fondness for the media hasn't always been a two-way street, as they routinely have trashed him when it suits their own purposes. In a 2006 article headlined \"John McCain, The Sellout Express,\" \"The Huffington Post\" called the senator a, quote, \"pandering politician who will stop at nothing to get elected.\" McCain's great sin? Agreeing to speak at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University. The Atlantic ran a piece during the 2008 presidential campaign titled \"McCain, The Sellout,\" based on a fear that the candidate might govern as a conservative. And in a 2010 Vanity Fair piece headlined The Man Who Never Was, McCain is called so desperate to keep his Senate seat that he, quote, \"repudiated his record, his principles, and even his maverick repetition, entrenching himself as the anti-Obama.\" Here to talk about McCain, the man, is James H. Warner. He was a POW with him during the Vietnam War. Jim was a POW for six years and also my old colleague in the Reagan administration, a former policy adviser to President Reagan. And Frank Luntz, esteemed pollster, he's going to show how the media have used McCain over the years to fit whatever narrative that they find convenient at the moment. It's great to see both of you. Jim, I want to talk to you first. First of all, it's great to see you. Long time. I was young, you were even more handsome back then back in 1987, sharing an office together."

I warmed up an audience for him the day after the convention in a big rally north of Detroit, and he tried to introduce me to Sarah Palin, and we couldn't get near her because she was just mobbed by people. He was there at the convention when he introduced her, and he saw the electricity. I will tell you how it affected us. We were up in the booth. I turned to my left, I was sitting next to Bud Day, the most decorated American warrior in all history, and Bud had tears in his eyes. He was so moved. And that's the effect she had. So for him to be doing that -- I'm not going to hold anything against John for what he says in the last year.

That caused some analysts to worry that President Trump's application of tariffs and public pressure on China isn't working. Other analysts, however, believing that Beijing will eventually have to agree to a deal because it's so dependent upon the United States for trade. Let's get a read on the negotiations from a \"National Review\" columnist, Victor Davis Hanson, of the Stanford Hoover Institute, and NYU Professor Ian Bremmer who is the author of the great new book \"Us Versus Them.\" VDH, let's start with you. Coming up empty, or is this just the normal process? It's not going to happen overnight. We didn't lose ground for China overnight and we're not going to have a deal with China overnight either."

And then Trump, when he came into office, I think everybody realized there was an asymmetry with China whether it was patent infringement or copyright or technology appropriation from American companies and dumping and cyber warfare, et cetera, et cetera. And that theory that if we work to give these concessions to China in the early '80s we would bring them into the family of nations and then their affluence and their economic boom would make them democratized and they would be sort of a helpful player in the world scene, that has been revealed to be flawed. And I think it is sort of thematic of a lot of these asymmetrical -- the Iran deal, the open borders, the NATO contributions that we thought what was normal really wasn't. It was predicated on the idea that we were so strong and powerful we could always make concessions. And then in 2016 the people in between the coast said, you know what, we don't want to make concessions because we are not as powerful, at least we aren't, and as affluent as you people who create these deals. So there is a domestic, political element in all of these negotiations that Trump has to be careful of."

Financial Times -- I'm paraphrasing, but \"Financial Times,\" Marco Rubio's way over, probably to the right of Trump on China, and now it is pretty much commonly thought China is cheating on a whole host of issues, they are stealing a lot of our intellectual property, and they are poised to eclipse the United States in a lot of different ways unless we recalibrate at least the playing field. Where do things stand now, and then we are going to move to the Iran deal real quick. IAN BREMMER, AUTHOR, \"US VERSUS THEM\": They are more powerful. They are a larger economy. Their ability to promote their own companies because they are not becoming a free market economy is making it much harder for the Americans to have access. Trump has been hitting them particularly hard on the technology side, and that's where, frankly, we don't have a lot of interdependence. That's where I think the relationship is going to be more challenging. On trade, they want to export to us, we want to import from them, and it's a lot of our companies that are actually manufacturing and exporting to the United States.

And the sad thing about it, they were bleeding about $125 billion to $150 billion a year from those really tough sanctions. I give Obama's administration credit for finally ratcheting it up. Over the life of this first 10 and then the additional five years they are going to have about a half a trillion to $700 billion that they otherwise wouldn't have had. And we can see where that is going. It's going to destroy Syria. It's going to shoot missiles into Saudi Arabia. It's going for Hezbollah. And it's going to -- it wasn't more than six months after this treaty and they were shooting a missile at the USS Truman. They hijacked an American boat and they sort of humiliated people. So it didn't have the added effect of affecting their missile program or their behavior, and I don't think they were going to be able to produce any nuclear weapons in that 10 year period because they had civil unrest and their economy was ruined.

The French and the German leaders were here asking Trump to give them some time so that they could try to come up with what would be a tougher deal against the Iranians. If I was advising Trump right now I would say, you know what, May 12th is your deadline. Say that you listened to the allies, give them two more months. And then if it turns out they don't come up with anything else, you say it's their fault. You listen to the allies, you have the ability to blame them. If they give you something better than you are a hero and you've also got better credibility on Iran. Also one other point, Trump never brings up the fact that the one thing Americans care about is not the Middle East, but they want oil prices down. And this deal is actually keeping them down. He rips it up, prices go back up. That hurts Americans."

And guys like myself, we've been doing this, and this is not our first rodeo. I'm glad again he's had this epiphany. But when I hear about the freedom from people like the \"Post\" and other super left leaning organizations, really it's pretty insulting. The real reason is because the Democratic Party has always been the party that has really kind of kept blacks on the plantation. They were ones that gave you the KKK. They are the ones that also gave you slavery. They are the ones that gave you the Jim Crow law.
