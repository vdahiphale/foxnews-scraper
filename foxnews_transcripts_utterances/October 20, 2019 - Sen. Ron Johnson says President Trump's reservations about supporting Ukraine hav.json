But then again, not just that specific, but just general. President Zelensky got a mandate from the Ukrainian people, 73 percent to end the corruption in Ukraine, so it's obvious, Ukraine is a corrupt place, and any Presidents ought to be asking a pretty hard question -- is this a place where we really ought to be providing a lot of support to? And then secondly, and he has been very consistent on this, why isn't Europe stepping up the plate?

So no, we have got such a treasure trove of unvarnished testimony, quite honestly, from those Strzok-Page texts, and we don't understand everything they're talking about. Again, I can't tell you for sure what the insurance policy is. I can't tell you exactly what he means when there's no there, there, but it's unvarnished. It's backed up with other pieces of information that I think are quite revealing. And my whole goal in this process is to lay out the timeline, you know, going back to, like, basically our investigation of the Hillary Clinton e- mail scandal and the texts that were being produced during that mid-year examination, and then how that all morphed. Now, here's a little fact, did you realize that the F.B.I. met with Christopher Steele on July 5, 2016? You know what's remarkable about that day? That's the exact same day that James Comey held his press conference exonerating Hillary Clinton. So he went right from right from that operation, you know, what can we do? How can we produce an investigation that looks like it's real, but that we really don't fully utilize the grand jury? It's not a real serious investigation. It's really one about, you know, how do we exonerate Hillary Clinton to okay, now we're going to make sure that Trump never becomes President. And when he became President, how can we use the same information to sabotage his administration? I don't know. Do I have all the evidence on this? No, but I've got an awesome lot of smoke. There's an awful lot of indication. And again, it's those Strzok-Page texts that are so unbelievably revealing. And when you start stringing those things out in the timeline and you can take a look at news reports coming out. It's pretty powerful evidence.",

And I'm just going to skip a few words, but here's a relevant section under the Espionage Act. \"Whoever having lawful possession or control of any document relating to the national defense, one, through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or two, having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody and fails to make prompt report of loss is subject to fine up to 10 years imprisonment.\" The Inspector General of the Justice Department came up with the precedent on this that somehow that very clear wording has nothing about intent in it. None whatsoever, required in order to prosecute some measure of intent, malicious intent to actually store this in a place where it can get in the hands of a malicious actor. I mean, I don't know where that all came from. But that's to the person that is improperly through gross negligence handling this. What about the person just has knowledge of the fact and one of the things I've never gotten an answer on is what do those e-mails between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were? What did those look like? What did President Obama see in terms of the Clinton e-mail address? Did he see HillaryClinton@statedepartment.gov.classified? Or he's did he see hillaryclinton.com?

One of the reasons I wanted you here is because two Sundays ago when you tried to actually talk and explain yourself on \"Meet the Press,\" Chuck Todd kept cutting you off. And I thought it would be important to bring you back here on my program, to hear what you had to say, but also because of your position in the United States Senate. You're the chairman of a Committee that sort of oversees the activities with Ukraine and the United States, among other positions you hold in the United States Senate. Now we have this document that came out, the President's phone call, a transcript of it, with the President of Ukraine back in July. And people are trying to -- Democrats and the media in particular -- say that the President was seeking a quid pro quo. I don't read this in here. You have some background on this. You had a meeting with the President and others in May of this year, you want to tell us about it?"

We'll again, and just on that transcript, I read that and I think it's a pretty gracious phone call on the part of the President, but I went to Ukraine on May 20th to attend the inauguration of President Zelensky. I went there with Secretary Perry, Gordon Sondland, who is the Ambassador to the European Union and Kurt Volker, who is the Special Envoy to Ukraine. So the four of us were pretty much that delegation. We felt it was important coming back, we were pretty impressed with Zelensky, we thought was important to meet with the President and really get him supportive of Ukraine. And so we had a meeting in the Oval Office on May 23rd --"

Again, we just really were encouraging the President to show a strong support for the people of Ukraine. We were -- I was certainly surprised with the President's reaction, which has been consistent throughout this. And first of all, he talked about the level of corruption in Ukraine and Mark, there's all kinds of smoke about Hillary Clinton campaign, the D.N.C. being involved in the 2016 election. But then again, not just that specific, but just general. President Zelensky got a mandate from the Ukrainian people, 73 percent to end the corruption in Ukraine, so it's obvious, Ukraine is a corrupt place, and any Presidents ought to be asking a pretty hard question -- is this a place where we really ought to be providing a lot of support to? And then secondly, and he has been very consistent on this, why isn't Europe stepping up the plate? You know, why aren't they showing that kind of support? So those was those two main reasons. And so I think the four of us left that meeting, realizing we've got a sales job to do. We all supported Ukraine, we want to make sure the President is supportive of it. And that was the first start of certainly my knowledge of the fact that President Trump had some real reservations about providing full support for Ukraine."

And the day before, or a couple of days before, I'd heard that the President was considering or was holding some of this military support, which by the way, he has provided the lethal defensive weaponry that Obama didn't provide. So he has already provided this in the past. But now, he was reconsidering ending the fiscal year, and so I first called up Gordon Sondland the day before, asking what was happening here. And it was at that point --"

Anyway, I put in a request to talk to the President, and he called me back on the following day on August 31st. And I was trying to convince the President in that phone call to give me the authority a few days later to say that the support is on its way. Trying to talk the President into it. Once again, the President was incredibly consistent and said, Ron, I mean, you know how corrupt a place this is. You know, it's -- so he made that point. And then he really hammered on the lack of European support. He talked about Angela Merkel. You know, Ron, I asked Angela, you know why don't you fund these things? And he says, you know, Angela tells me because you guys will. So Ron, we're schmucks. We're schmucks. So that was his -- that was the reason he gave me. I, then brought up this rumor I'd heard that well, is there something in the works? Is there -- I mean, does Zelensky have to do something or does Ukraine have to show you something in order for this support to be released? And that is where he made the adamant vehement, angry denial. And again, I describe it as expletive deleted, no way. No, no, I would never do that. Who told you that? At which point I feel a little guilty. Well, though it was Gordon. That was that conversation. I went on the record, I guess, last Friday, with The Wall Street Journal, laying that out after the text between Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker were made public. I thought it's important to have on the public record that when I spoke to the President, well, before this whistleblower complaint was made public, out of the blue, he didn't know I was going to raise that issue. His immediate reaction was an adamant, vehement and angry denial. No, I would never do that. So I thought it's important to get that fact out on the table."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "I think it's crucial. I just want to underscore the point. In May, he says, look, I'm concerned it's corrupt over there and why doesn't Europe step up and give them support? You talked to him on August 31st. He says basically the same thing. I already told you, Ron, he says, they're corrupt over there. Where the hell is Merkel and Germany? Let them provide him with support. Never discussed with you any kind of quid pro quo, is that correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Correct. I'm the one that raised the issue from my phone call to Gordon Sondland. Again, I wasn't quite sure what was in the works. So it's all rather nebulous. But, you know, I described it enough where he got ticked off and he did not like hearing that and he vehemently denied it."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",

So it's not the President coming up with an after the fact explanation for what took place. It's the President of the United States doing exactly what the President has said since, which is, no, no, no, they got the support. But I needed to make sure they weren't going to basically, you know, run away with the money. They weren't going to abuse the money. And also we wanted support from other allies. Is that accurate?"
    },

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",

And there's no dispute that there's a lot of corruption in Ukraine. So it's a legitimate concern the President had and he was consistent in expressing that concern."

      "utterance": "You're a United States Senator, you hold a couple of powerful positions in the United States Senate. One of them is your relationship with Ukraine. You've been there several times you told me. You kind of know the actors over there. You have discussions with the President of the United States in real time on this support, on this aid. You're trying to lobby him to provide it. He eventually does, having absolutely nothing to do with a whistleblower or whatever. And yet, your message is being drowned out. There is static out there. They would rather listen to Adam Schiff trying to connect the two, trying to push a quid pro quo. There's no quid pro quo in this telephone call. You're telling me now, back in May of this year, August 31st of this year, you talked to the President, nothing of this sort ever came up. It was a consistent argument he made. They are corrupt, I don't want to just give them money and where the hell of the Europeans? Is that correct?"

Once I entered the public realm, what has really been reinforced to me because you know, I listen to you, I listened to Rush, I'm a fan. I've always known the bias in the media. But what I've really -- what's been really, really reinforced to me is the bias in the media is revealed far more in what they don't report, what they're not curious about versus the very overt and real bias in what they do report. So it really is. If they're not curious about something, if they're not reporting it, it's not a news story, and that's what drives conservatives. That's what drives me. It drives you. It drives President Trump nuts."

It is written by Ken Vogel, who now works for The New York Times and again, he is talking about the potential of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the D.N.C. involvement, working with potentially corrupt actors in Ukraine trying to dig up dirt on President Trump or candidate Trump at that point in time, Paul Manafort. But you know, it's also very possible and people don't really realize this as well, but you know, Hillary Clinton had a primary. There was one Joe Biden, potentially getting into that race as well. Is it just possible or plausible that maybe the D.N.C., maybe the Hillary Clinton campaign was also trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden back then in Ukraine? So no, there are so many questions. I'm really not throwing out any accusations. I'm not making any allegations. I'm just saying there's so many questions that remain unanswered. And they really remain unanswered, because by and large, the press has no curiosity about trying to get the answers to these things."

At the same time you had that same black ledger showing that people associated with the Democratic Party were paid, but that doesn't get covered. That wasn't revealed. That wasn't -- to my knowledge -- highlighted by the Ukrainian officials. So it seemed to be at that point in time, pretty one sided."

Ukrainian officials also reportedly, quote, \"... helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\" That is damnable and yet it kind of just went under the radar. Never heard about it again. Is it conceivable that a C.I.A. Director, John Brennan, in particular, this sort of thing is going on and he wouldn't know about it?"

Not allowing the President's counsel to be present, not allowing cross examination of witnesses, not allowing the Republicans to subpoena witnesses that happened in Nixon and Clinton, pushing this narrative on Ukraine, when in fact, the big story is, Hillary Clinton and the D.N.C. went to the Ukraine where their surrogates did to try and take out the President of the United States."

You know, when we began the whole Clinton e-mail investigation out of our committee, you couldn't obtain the information. There's a criminal investigation. So that always hampers congressional investigations. You know, many years later, we still don't have all the information. There's so many unanswered questions, but when we start developing it, by the time we lay it out for the public, why are you worried about that? I mean, it's just all old news. I mean, you're just conspiracy theorists. That is my big concern. And from my standpoint, as I hear the Adam Schiff's of the world talking about, you know, this Ukrainian call was the greatest threat to our democracy and to our Constitution. No. The greatest threat to our Constitution is potentially a duly elected President of the United States having his administration sabotaged by former members of a previous administration. You know, people potentially in the C.I.A., potentially in the F.B.I. I mean, what was the insurance policy? Why did Peter Strozk before agreeing to be part of the Mueller investigation before he is fired? Why did he say his concern was there's no big there, there. He was the lead investigator on the Russian collusion investigation by the F.B.I. So here it is, many months later, he is already thinking, you know, there's just nothing there.

She announces before the transcript of the phone call is even released that she has declared like Eva Peron, you know, that we're going to conduct a formal Impeachment Inquiry, which they've really been conducting, not a formal Impeachment Inquiry but going after the President -- Nadler and all the rest of them trying to pick their topics that they want to focus on. She had to have known about the complaint because Schiff knew about the complaint from his staffer by then. She had to know of the complaint. They thought they had the President of the United States with the secondhand C.I.A. operative Democrat with connections to Biden complaint. But then the President says, you know what? I'm going to release this thing. And he releases the telephone transcript after conferring with the President of Ukraine. But in and of itself, what does that do to a country? Releasing a transcript like this?"

It drives me crazy to hear the Schiff's and the Pelosi's of the world talk about this phone call as being the greatest threat to our democracy and our Constitution. No. The greatest threat is now you've really damaged any President's ability to conduct foreign policy. What foreign leader is going to candidly speak to the President, either in private or over the phone when somebody is around? And oh, by the way, you know, there's a reason we have executive privilege. In order to govern, a President has to have candid advice from his advisers. During this impeachment process, executive privilege would be weakened as well. So the damage is being done to our democracy, the damage is being done to our Constitution. It is being done by Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, you know, whoever started this whole false Russian narrative, you know, Russian collusion with the Trump campaign that result in the Special Counsel that has produced all of this. There's the damage to our Constitution. That's the problem with our democracy."

The American people are dragged through this. A so-called legal analyst going on and on about how the President is going to be indicted or there's a secret indictment in the Southern District of New York under the campaign finance laws, none of it happens. Zero. They keep working it. They bring Mueller in. Mueller falls on his face for obvious reasons. They still keep working it. They can't. And then they get Ukraine. Ukraine -- they have a so called whistleblower, a guy who tips off Adam Schiff and his staff. The guy hires lawyers who really were out to get the President of the United States. A secondhand guy gets information, who was tight with Biden, but heard stuff. You know, when I worked in the Reagan administration, if you had a C.I.A. guy, or gal who is gathering information on the President of the United States, who really has no business gathering information on the President of the United States, and then goes to a Democrat on Capitol Hill, and then dresses it up as a whistleblower complaint, you know what we used to call that in the Reagan administration? A spy. A spy. And what you're telling me, this isn't the first time the C.I.A. has conducted itself in a way to sabotage this President or clearly the senior level of the F.B.I. Are we ever going to get to the bottom of this stuff?"

      "utterance": "Well, I'm sure they are trying to. But yes, I mean, we, in our oversight capacity, we have read the text when, as Page or Strzok was talking to Page again about putting an Intelligence community guy in the transition with Vice President Pence, you know, try and get basically a stool pigeon involved and inserted right into the administration. So no, we have got such a treasure trove of unvarnished testimony, quite honestly, from those Strzok-Page texts, and we don't understand everything they're talking about. Again, I can't tell you for sure what the insurance policy is. I can't tell you exactly what he means when there's no there, there, but it's unvarnished. It's backed up with other pieces of information that I think are quite revealing. And my whole goal in this process is to lay out the timeline, you know, going back to, like, basically our investigation of the Hillary Clinton e- mail scandal and the texts that were being produced during that mid-year examination, and then how that all morphed. Now, here's a little fact, did you realize that the F.B.I. met with Christopher Steele on July 5, 2016? You know what's remarkable about that day? That's the exact same day that James Comey held his press conference exonerating Hillary Clinton. So he went right from right from that operation, you know, what can we do? How can we produce an investigation that looks like it's real, but that we really don't fully utilize the grand jury? It's not a real serious investigation. It's really one about, you know, how do we exonerate Hillary Clinton to okay, now we're going to make sure that Trump never becomes President. And when he became President, how can we use the same information to sabotage his administration? I don't know. Do I have all the evidence on this? No, but I've got an awesome lot of smoke. There's an awful lot of indication. And again, it's those Strzok-Page texts that are so unbelievably revealing. And when you start stringing those things out in the timeline and you can take a look at news reports coming out. It's pretty powerful evidence."

I got pilloried in the press when all I said was, it didn't surprise me to hear a secret society because I had a whistleblower talking about secret meetings held off site. And then I said, it shows me there's possible corruption at the highest levels of the F.B.I. I got creamed in the press. But I don't care. Because bottom line is, I want to get to the truth. I think the American people deserve the truth and I'm just tenacious enough to get. It takes a long time. It does. I have no patience. None. I've been forced to have patience because of this whole process."

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's all part and parcel of the same thing. It's just their involvement in the sabotage of this administration. I warned voters prior to the 2018 election, if you put Nancy Pelosi in charge of the House, it will not about effective governing. It is not going to be about creating greater opportunities for Americans. It's all going to be about investigations and impeachment. Again, that was easy to predict. I'm not some grand soothsayer. And that's what we're seeing play out here. It's a completely unfair process. I mean, the fact that Nancy Pelosi announced they are going to start this impeachment process before we even knew what was in the whistleblower complaint. And of course, you know, Trump by releasing that transcript, I think he had to do it. It is unfortunate he had to do it, but that's some real damage being done. But I think, certainly Republicans in the Senate, we see how grossly unfair this process is. And, you know, if and when it comes over to the Senate, I think McConnell has already said we are going to break -- you know, take it up, but we'll be in total control of what the process is going to be in the Senate. And so if it's completely unfair in the House, I would say we'll take that into account in terms of how we view a trial in the Senate."

I mean, you've got a situation going on here where one party is driving this. They have a small majority of 37 members, apparently several of them don't even want to do this. You have effectively six Committee Chairman pushing this really, one, who is a liar, who lied to the American people about a number of things. And so my concern is the Senate sits there, the media is all excited. C-SPAN has its camera. And we treat this like, like it was done in the Clinton time, the Nixon time, or even the Andrew Johnson time and it's not. This is bogus."

The House, a simple majority to impeach. The Senate a supermajority to remove. There's no discussion on how the trial is supposed to be handled. We know the Chief Justice is the Chief Justice. He is the judge of the trial. You guys have your rules that had been in place apparently for some time. You can't change your rules. I heard it said we need 67 members to change the rules.

Harry Reid then set the new precedent in the Senate that you can change rules with a majority vote. So Republicans have never, from my mind, we've never used a nuclear option. Harry Reid did that. We've just followed his precedent, but we've done it sparingly. And we may part company on this. I personally think the 60-vote threshold on final passage has protected America from all kinds of --"

And again, I'll go back to you know, my investigation in the Clinton e-mail scandal. I'd like to just read you the statute that I believe not only Hillary Clinton broke, but President Obama did. And I'm just going to skip a few words, but here's a relevant section under the Espionage Act. \"Whoever having lawful possession or control of any document relating to the national defense, one, through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or two, having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody and fails to make prompt report of loss is subject to fine up to 10 years imprisonment.\" The Inspector General of the Justice Department came up with the precedent on this that somehow that very clear wording has nothing about intent in it. None whatsoever, required in order to prosecute some measure of intent, malicious intent to actually store this in a place where it can get in the hands of a malicious actor. I mean, I don't know where that all came from. But that's to the person that is improperly through gross negligence handling this. What about the person just has knowledge of the fact and one of the things I've never gotten an answer on is what do those e-mails between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were? What did those look like? What did President Obama see in terms of the Clinton e-mail address? Did he see HillaryClinton@statedepartment.gov.classified? Or he's did he see hillaryclinton.com? Obviously known that this was not a secure site. I think the point is that's why I think the entire Obama administration circled the wagons around Hillary Clinton and made sure she was exonerated because I think the President was culpable."
