I think this week showed why, General Mattis is obviously someone who is externally qualified and well loved. It's also true that we were not seeing the president's foreign policy being implemented by everyone in the Pentagon. President Trump could not have been clearer, going back to 2013, that he does not believe that endless war in Syria is a good idea. He has said that repeatedly and consistently. And for some reason, the plans of the Pentagon and the State Department keep putting forth involve staying there for a very long time. So, I think there was obviously a conflict there. The president is, according to the Constitution, the commander in chief, not someone who -- that responsibility is with him, and he has the right to have a cabinet that fully supports his foreign policy. Because again, it was one of the reasons why the American people elected him, because he was going to depart from our foreign policy posture that involved a lot of wars. Like, you know, the war in Afghanistan is now on its 17th year. I think a lot of Americans say we should fight wars quickly, get them done, achieve our victory, and bring our troops home.",

General Jack Keane, joins me in just a moment. President Trump announcing a short time ago that General James Mattis will \"retire with distinction\" this February. That news comes on the heels of two very controversial foreign policy decisions made by President Trump surprises in their timing both of them. One, two pull thousands of U.S. troops out of Syria, the other today that he will do the same essentially in Afghanistan. General Mattis releasing a copy of his resignation letter to the president that reads in part, \"You have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\" Here now, General Jack Keane, a four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, and chairman of the Institute for the Study of War.

We were both of one mind in our opposition to the decision to pull our forces out of Syria and what its ramifications of would be. And I just want to say, Jim's a tremendous officer, a tremendous leader, and the quality of the service that he's provided to our country is certainly very, very significant, and the American people are in his debt."

But I've said many times, I think President Trump has managed to surround himself with one of the strongest national security teams I've ever observed. Jim Mattis was a very important part of that, but he's not the only part of it. And I'm confident the president will be able to find a successor who's very capable and will support the President's agenda, and also disagree with him strongly when necessary."

And so, he makes this decision to pull out of Syria which he did say on the campaign trail. He wanted to do, I know you very much disagree with it, and you're certainly not alone. Afghanistan, he also wanted to extract us from over time. Do you believe that he had conversations with the Defense Department, with General Mattis saying, \"You know, I really want to put our focus there.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He said, \"My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity, and values. And we are strengthened in this effort by solidarity of our alliances.\" He seems to be disturbed by the president's attitude towards our allies."

      "speaker": "KEANE",

But I, I know and I have believed that the president in terms of what he was doing in NATO, and trying to strengthen NATO, and get everybody to burden ship properly is the right course of action. I think going out and dealing with China and its malign and aggressive behavior in Indo-Pacific and working with our allies is also the right -- the right decisions. And what he has done in the Middle East, his first visit was to Riyadh last July. 55 leaders in the room with him when he said, \"I'm going to stand here -- I'm standing here with you and I am going to confront the Iranians with you and deal with their aggressive behavior as they've trampled over your interests and those of ours.\" And he also talked about Islamic extremism and how -- and how we need to get rid of it together. So, I think in a broad sense, I think they both agree on that. But there may be some specifics that I'm not aware of that they disagree. So, I, I don't know why that comment, comment is in there."

In a few minutes, we're going to be voting here on the House. I expect that it will pass and we'll send it over to the Senate tonight. But it -- but it's really about a president who was not willing to fold without a fight. You heard him make the comments there. He wasn't going to sign another bill.

But the president has made it very clear. If there is not border security and a real effort to do that, he's not going to sign a bill. And quite frankly, it's -- it shouldn't come as a surprise. He campaigned on this, he has said it over and over again. And the vast majority of the American people that I'm hearing from, my phones have lit up.

Typically it's the deadlines that set it before us. But somehow, there were a number of people here on Capitol Hill that thought our negotiating position would be better in February with Nancy Pelosi, with the Speaker's gavel. And most Americans didn't buy that. I didn't buy that. And so, it was now or never and I believe that the President heard from the American people and decided to side with them. And I applaud him in that."

      "utterance": "Well, I think the question of the day is the one you asked, Martha, what changed between yesterday and today? And I think the answer is that the President's base people like Ann Coulter and others said that the big, beautiful wall was not going to be built and you have not kept a major campaign promise, Mr. President. And I think he responded to that kind of political pressure from the base for fear that the base would somehow abandon him if he did that. Then it's interesting because much of the rest of the Republican Party, not necessarily the base, has been very clear, we don't have the votes. Remember, when he had session with Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office, Pelosi dared him and say, we'll, go ahead, if you -- if you have the votes, go ahead."

But that's -- at this moment, he didn't have the votes, we'll see if he has does but he clearly as you pointed out in your talk with Congressman Meadows, this been two years of a Republican Majority, they didn't get it done. They didn't have the vote."

Can I point out first, the little speech from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer is so hypocritical considering the fact that they shut down the government just as last January over DACA and then they're here pointing their finger about President Trump holding to his guns over the wall funding. And look, clearly, people believe that having some sort of physical structure at the southern border to serve as a deterrent matters. That's why Democrats in the past have supported fencing along the southern border. Quite a lot of Democrats, in fact. And in 2013, almost $50 billion for a border security including 700 miles of fencing. A lot of democrats voted. So clearly, we're in a agreement here that some sort of physical structure."

Now, the other side of their mouths say, we hear so much about border security. Then the President essentially I think offered sort of an olive branch. He said, it doesn't matter if it's a concrete, it could be steel slats. Like let's get together and secure the border. I mean, that's what he wants to do. I think he indicated that he is open to technology, to steel slats, to other ways of doing it. So are Democrats really happy with people climbing across the wall and getting in? 60,000 people last month? I mean, it's ridiculous."

Democrats won't trade anything to give President Trump the money he wants for the wall. They want to deny him that victory, they don't want to have -- they don't want to give him that hiding into 2020 but I also think on immigration there was a key victory for President Trump today in -- with Mexico and having asylum-seekers stay in Mexico while they go through the immigration process here in the United States. Because that's a big issue that we're facing right now. You've got 90 percent of asylum-seekers aren't going to get granted asylum in immigration courts and the problem is a lot of those people go missing while they wait for their cases to come up. And they become part of that 22 million illegal immigrants living here in the country."

For Democrats, a successful border wall is now considered bad politics. Salad bowl multiculturalism, growing tribalism, and large numbers of assimilated immigrants added up to a politically advantageous demography for Democrats in the long run and they don't want to give that up.

The British defense ministry has brought in special equipment to assist but it's tricky because the same jammers that disrupt radio signals between drones and our operators can also disrupt radio signals between pilots and the air traffic controllers.

If the nose of the jet bashed in -- remember back in 2009 when U.S. Air Flight 1549 hit a flock of geese, knocking out both engines, forcing the Airbus 320 to land on the Hudson River. Experts say drones pose an even bigger risk to a jet engines. Drones are also big enough that a high-speed collision with the plan as you saw earlier can pierce a whole right in the fuselage.

The vote was to be razor tight, and in the end, it came down to one woman. Senator Susan Collins from Maine, she voted yes and gave a speech that was heralded as one of the best ever in the history of the deliberative body. But the untold story here is what Susan Collins endured on the way to that moment. She shared details with us that she has never spoken of before.

My husband and our dog, and parts of our house had to be quarantined. Hazmat teams brought in. But what was even worse was what was done to my staff. They had to be subjected to all sorts of abuse. A 25-year-old caseworker and my staff who deals with social security problems and the V.A. and immigration answered a call in which the men told her that if I voted yes for Justice Kavanaugh, that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated.

It's needed and has helped to heighten awareness, and I hope that if there's anything good has come out of this terrible process, it is that the survivors of sexual assault will feel more empowered to come forward, and that they will come forward at the time of the incident, and that they will be heard. Not everyone is going to be giving an accurate story, but everyone deserves to be treated with respect."

And I want to be able to look in the mirror in the morning and know that I did what I felt was right, no matter what the consequences may be. My job as a United States senator is to apply my best judgment, and that's what I did in this case, despite tremendous pressure, horrible tactics, abuse of my family, my staff, and myself. But I really won't ever be intimidated. I have to do what I think is right, and I will let the chips fall where they may."

Looking now at the floor of House of Representatives this evening, they are about to vote on their version to keep the government open and to fund the president's border wall. We're going to see where that goes tonight, it could be a long one. And in the meantime, Mollie Hemingway is senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor. Mollie, thanks for being with us tonight."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yes. It is interesting news. I'd actually suggested a few weeks ago on Special Report that it might be a good departure. I think this week showed why, General Mattis is obviously someone who is externally qualified and well loved. It's also true that we were not seeing the president's foreign policy being implemented by everyone in the Pentagon. President Trump could not have been clearer, going back to 2013, that he does not believe that endless war in Syria is a good idea. He has said that repeatedly and consistently. And for some reason, the plans of the Pentagon and the State Department keep putting forth involve staying there for a very long time. So, I think there was obviously a conflict there. The president is, according to the Constitution, the commander in chief, not someone who -- that responsibility is with him, and he has the right to have a cabinet that fully supports his foreign policy. Because again, it was one of the reasons why the American people elected him, because he was going to depart from our foreign policy posture that involved a lot of wars. Like, you know, the war in Afghanistan is now on its 17th year. I think a lot of Americans say we should fight wars quickly, get them done, achieve our victory, and bring our troops home."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Again, he had a campaign promise that he cared very deeply about a border wall, and it keeps on getting kicked down the road. So, I think it is important that the fight we had, but it's even just important from a bipartisan -- you know, we have a bipartisan problem of Republicans and Democrats avoiding dealing with serious issues on border security and border enforcement. It's just good for the country to deal with it. They always seem to have an excuse for why they can't do it now. I think, you know, people really elect their representatives and senators, so they will address these problems, and I hope that they do."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "They seem to address them in the last five minutes of the term, then they all complain about they can't go home. Maybe if they got their work done sooner, they might be able to. Just one more quick sound bite from Susan Collins, and I want your reaction on the other side."
