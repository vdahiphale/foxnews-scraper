What a concept. Wake up, Hollywood. There is a huge audience out there that is turning off and tuning out the garbage that passes as entertainment today. Sex might sell but real love, love of family, neighbor, country and yes God that sells too. And in the end it's a lot more fulfilling. And that's \"The Memo.\"",
