And Hillary Clinton if she were elected president, likely would have exercised the same authority and discretion and dismissed Director Comey. Right now, President Trump is trying to get out there to give the narrative and explain it but I think what would have helped from the beginning in terms of the communications was just sort of a clear delineated timeline.

That was something that was improper for him to do. There's a number of things that happened since the timeline, going back to July 5th. President Trump had the authority to do this. He acted based on his evaluation of this person's ability and suitability to serve and made the decision to terminate. Informed his AG and his Deputy AG who then prepared the memorandums that backed up and justify the termination. That is where we stand. But still 48 hours later, you have the detractors. People trying to make something out of this. There's no evidence so far to suggest any kind of collusion with the Russians. There is no funds that have been, you know, averted or, you know, short staffed to be able to continue any investigation. So, what exactly is the problem?"

Then she basically -- Comey says, okay, well, that is why I had to step in and basically crossed that redline into the prosecutorial role. Which basically leads to the frustration that Rod Rosenstein, the Attorney General says. But tonight, and there is more reporting on this in the New York Times tomorrow morning that President Trump met with Comey several times and was pressing him to ask him about an investigation. Do you see hypocrisy there?"

And I guess the FBI director said he wasn't. And we also know that Grassley Republican and Dianne Feinstein Democrat both said, Comey said, Trump was not subject of an investigation. We're also hearing that none of Trump's top aides are the focus of the FBI investigation. Some of the reporting shows what's going on are two things. The counter intelligence investigation being done by the FBI is whether or not a handful of American citizens wittingly or unwittingly were compromised by Russian spies. The criminal probe by the FBI is looking into not collusion with the Russians but whether or not there were laws broken in terms of money laundering, tax schemes, and things like that. Lobbying. So, we also heard today from the guy at the justice that they don't need a special prosecutor. And there's tons of resources for this probe going forward."

That's the whole thing.

But yes, you should follow the order and chain of command and go abide it. The rules are there for a reason. Nevertheless, we have a situation here where all the discussion about this isn't about the propriety as to whether or not the President have the authority to dismiss, a directive that he felt was not serving the best interest of the country and of the FBI but about the process, and about the communications and sort of the roll out like we discussed last night. Like the objections to the travel ban. So, that is something that is like, you know, a repetitive theme here. But in terms of the President, even Comey says the President had the right to dismiss him and the acting director said, he had the absolute right to do what he did.

He is just going around, and he doesn't realize what's happening above the water. And going back to the point I made to you, Bob. I believe that he believes, I think he believes in what he is saying. Which is why when you say he is lying, it's not lying if you believe it is the truth. I mean, it's not -- again, you can't be in this prism of two ideas.

And so, I don't know exactly what will come of this. In the realm of possibility, in the world we're living in today, I could see it happening. But I will tell you this -- I think that the Trump administration has got to figure out who they're going to nominate for FBI director, and try to make sure this is a stellar nominee that they can get confirmed. Because this question will absolutely come up at a hearing that that FBI nominee will actually have to then say what is or her intentions would be even if they couldn't actually say, that will be a big sticking point for the Democrats.

And then on the email case, I think that her I.T. guy got immunity, took the fifth, and for other associates of Hillary took immunity. You know, I don't see how firing an FBI director is a cover-up, but keeping a secret server, deleting 30,000 emails under subpoena, and then smashing your iPhone with a blackberry is not a cover-up. It strikes me as a cover-up. And then the left keeps talking about collusion between Trump and Russia, I think collusion is when someone at CNN like Donna Brazile gives the big questions to Hillary ahead of time, that strikes more is collusion."

Mediaite, an industry web site that vomits predictable assumptions said that, quote, maybe DeVos should have taken the hint because of an earlier petition that was circulated against her appearance at the school. Meaning: Don't show up. So there's a solution. If people wish to silence you, stay home. Censorship, approved by the media. Other reporters on Twitter seem to enjoy the mass bullying too. So imagine if Betsy wasn't Betsy, but Michelle Obama, a Hillary, a Liz Warren, what would be media industry's take then? We know the answer. Because we know the media isn't much different that today's students. After all, campuses are where the intolerant left-wing sausages made and we've just got another glimpse of the assembly line where the cases get filled. So this is -- I want to do - - I've got to give credit for the college because the college could have canceled and they didn't. They went through it. A lot of people canceled these events, or I mean cancelled these speakers, but they went through it. This was Edison Jackson, who is the president."

It's really sad what's happening and it's happening very quickly in rapid succession across this country. And it's not -- institutions of education.
