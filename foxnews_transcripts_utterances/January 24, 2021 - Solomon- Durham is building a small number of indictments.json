It's also that contraband, the drugs, the weapons, and everything along those. So, as I look at the measures that were taken by the Biden administration, I ask three things. One, is it lawful? Do these orders comport with law? Two, is it going to make our law enforcement officers at DHS, is it going to make their job more difficult? And, three, are the policies going to entice more individuals to come?

And what the Biden administration is saying is, we are not going to deport them because we're going to focus on other things, and, again, very, very concerning. They're moving resources to the border to process immigration, to process asylum claims. I think, in a COVID-like environment, that's very dangerous. Again, the department was on a path to return individuals within about two hours of them coming over the border. I hope that continues.

They need the access roads, they need the cameras, they need the lighting, they need the fiberoptic cables, they need that entire package for them to do their jobs. And we have said -- or I would say, the last administration, when I was at DHS, said over and over again, we do not need a border wall system on every mall -- every mile of that border. We need it in strategic locations. And that's what CBP has done. But to say that we don't need an effective border wall system in very high- traffic areas, in areas that we know cartels use over and over and over again, I think is very naive. I think it's the wrong approach. I think you can do an effective border wall system with effective technology. I know the Biden administration is pushing more technology at ports of entry.

Now, this is not designed so much to punish Trump administration officials for taking a tough line on China, but to send a shot across the bow to Biden administration officials. Just let me give you a couple of examples of how these could influence a U.S. government official's thinking. So, for instance, many former officials like to write memoirs, and those memoirs can contribute to our understanding of public events. China specifically threatened publishing houses that give book contracts to administration officials they have sanctioned with cutting off all access for all their books in the Chinese market. Or, to take another example, a lot of government officials are lawyers. They leave big firms, they go back to big firms. Even if they have no clients with any business in China, that law firm probably does. And what if China goes to one of those big corporations and threatens to cut off their access if they don't cut off that law firm? This is the kind of unspoken, insidious effect these sanctions can have on senior government officials. We cannot tolerate it. The Biden administration needs to denounce it forcefully. They need to impose reciprocal sanctions on Chinese officials. They need to find out if the China -- Chinese ambassador was involved in it. And, if so, they need to kick him out of the country. We cannot tolerate China trying to influence government officials at the highest levels of American government.",

There was chatter about that on social media, yet they didn't request enough backup from the FBI or the Park Police and the National Guard. Muriel Bowser, the left-wing mayor of Washington, D.C., declined to let the National Guard that was present be armed and prepared for riot equipment.

It just shows an extraordinary effort by the FBI to participate in what they knew was a political dirty trick. They knew Christopher Steele's intention was to help Hillary Clinton get rid of her e-mail scandal, distract the public from it in the last quarter of the election. They also knew that he wanted to help Great Britain, because he thought Donald Trump would be bad for the U.S.-Great Britain relationship. They knew a foreigner was influencing our elections, and they allowed it to persist, not for weeks or months, but for two-and-a-half years. I think, at the core of it, that is the big headline that these documents make. Then you can go through all the things like Senator Graham just said. A double standard is irrefutable. Hillary Clinton was being targeted by a foreign power. They were going to route money into her campaign. The FBI tried to get a FISA on the country to spy on it. James Comey's leadership said, no, no, we're not going to do that. And they gave her a defensive briefing, probably a good thing. They did not do the same thing for President Trump.

And he never stepped aside in the Russia investigation, obviously, even though Hillary Clinton's evidence was what started the whole Russia case, the Steele dossier. These declassified memos, including McCabe's own notes that he took for meetings, show there was grave concern that McCabe was staying around and participating in these cases. Rod Rosenstein in 2017 May, right after Comey is fired, tries to push McCabe to step aside, saying, it's just not good, it's bad optics, it's going to hurt the integrity of the FBI, if you stay in charge of the Russia case, given all we know about your wife's campaign. And, at the end of the day, McCabe stood there and said, I'm going to stay in there. Now, even special counsel Mueller, Robert Mueller, was aware of this. He said, I'm not going to get into the conflicts, but you should know, Andy McCabe, you're probably going to be a witness in my Russia investigation. McCabe still doesn't step aside. So, that stuff, we did not see going on."

But all the evidence is pointing toward him trying to bring criminal charges probably in the first quarter of this year. That's what I'm hearing. Of course, there's a new sheriff in town. When Merrick Garland gets confirmed as attorney general, as we expect he will, he will have a say. And maybe he will take the -- and put the case and set it aside. But, right now, John Durham is -- looks to be building a small number of indictments focused on the top of the FBI. That's very important.

I leaked to the news media to create a different storyline in the public. And, secondly, I considered Donald Trump to be my main opponent, and I didn't want him to be president because he would help my -- hurt -- I think he would hurt the Great Britain-U.S. relationship. Now, remember, he's a foreigner. He's a British former MI6 agent. This is the clearest evidence that a foreigner intervened in an election. We started the Russia collusion investigation thinking Donald Trump and Russia were colluding together. And we ended it knowing that Hillary Clinton's handpicked MI6 investigator intervened in our election because he didn't like Donald Trump and he wanted to help Hillary Clinton. What a role reversal."

The real issue wasn't that she was messing around or that she was mishandling classified intelligence. It appears that there was nasty stuff in those e-mails they didn't want getting out. So, they needed to smear Donald Trump as a Russian asset. And, of course, this operation continued for a long time. And it's very funny then to see Rod Rosenstein and Robert Mueller both saying, as the British would put it, it's a little bit too much on the nose, Andy, to have you still running this investigation here at the FBI, given the amount of money that Clinton allies paid for -- paid for your wife's campaign.

But, actually, they have been spending their time targeting the president of the United States, Donald Trump. And now, under the new administration, we hear from think tank experts, journalists, current and former law enforcement officials that what the FBI now wants to do is, they want to use the same methods -- methods and techniques that they have been using to target Islamic extremists, they're going to redefine Donald Trump supporters as domestic terrorists.

He came out swinging on immigration, strengthening legal protections for the dreamers, abolishing the Muslim ban, canceling the Trump administration's interior enforcement rule, halting construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, and extending deportation protection for Liberians. Your reaction to what we heard from President Biden on day one?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "Well, Maria, I think what concerns me the most is, as we continue to respond to a global pandemic on COVID-19 and an economic crisis, trying to get millions of Americans back to work, I'm afraid that some of the actions that President Biden and the administration has taken is actually going to cause an immigration and border security crisis on our southwest border. And that's something that we don't need right now. And it's really what I'm watching through these executive actions and through legislation that he's also pushing as well. So, a number of these things concern me. The department has done a good job over the last several months of keeping increased number of folks coming to the border illegally under control. And we have done that through a variety of different authorities. And now we see a rollback of some of those authorities. So, it really is concerning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "You have firsthand experience in terms of understanding the threat, understanding what the risk is from all of these things. Assess the situation for us. Why do we need the border secure? What happens when you have this -- these illegals in the country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "So, it's a couple of different things. One, illegal migration is not only very dangerous from a cartel perspective. So, we have a number of transnational criminal organizations that operate in Mexico. And they basically control all of the pathways that come into the U.S. So, it's not only illegal individuals coming here. It's also that contraband, the drugs, the weapons, and everything along those. So, as I look at the measures that were taken by the Biden administration, I ask three things. One, is it lawful? Do these orders comport with law? Two, is it going to make our law enforcement officers at DHS, is it going to make their job more difficult? And, three, are the policies going to entice more individuals to come? And I think when you answer all three of those questions, particularly when you look at the 100-day moratorium on deportations, there's cause on each of those and there's concern for each of those questions. Absolutely, it goes against the law. The law -- they're now saying, we're not going to deport individuals with final orders of removal, criminals, in most cases, we're not going to deport them for 100 days. That is concerning. They have gone through their due process. They have gone to an immigration judge in some cases, and they have that final order of removal. And what the Biden administration is saying is, we are not going to deport them because we're going to focus on other things, and, again, very, very concerning. They're moving resources to the border to process immigration, to process asylum claims. I think, in a COVID-like environment, that's very dangerous. Again, the department was on a path to return individuals within about two hours of them coming over the border. I hope that continues. I hope that the Biden administration understands not only the border security, the real concerns and threats there, but also how that works within a COVID environment. So, a number of these things are concerning."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

      "utterance": "Your reaction?"

    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "So, that's just not true. The action of the border wall system absolutely works. The men and women of the Border Patrol, if you go down and visit them -- I'm not sure if she's ever been to the border or not -- they will say, first and foremost, they need an effective border wall system. They need that impedance and denial for them to do their job. They need the access roads, they need the cameras, they need the lighting, they need the fiberoptic cables, they need that entire package for them to do their jobs. And we have said -- or I would say, the last administration, when I was at DHS, said over and over again, we do not need a border wall system on every mall -- every mile of that border. We need it in strategic locations. And that's what CBP has done. But to say that we don't need an effective border wall system in very high- traffic areas, in areas that we know cartels use over and over and over again, I think is very naive. I think it's the wrong approach. I think you can do an effective border wall system with effective technology. I know the Biden administration is pushing more technology at ports of entry. I welcome that. But to just scrap the entire border wall system as ineffective just ignores the reality and the facts on the ground."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

And our viewers were pleased that we actually took this program to the El Paso wall and the border to show our viewers what was going on. And, literally, right in front of me, while I was at the wall, I saw people crossing the border coming in. And, in many cases, it was children. They were in dangerous situations. And that was around the time, Chad, that we had all those caravans headed to America. We have another one right now, a second migrant caravan expected to leave Honduras this week, this upcoming week, at a time that the CDC is forecasting 100,000 COVID deaths in the next few weeks. So, when you add this all together, to see this new caravan coming this way is obviously frightening. And is this administration ready for it?"

What we saw in 2018 and then again, in 2019, when the crisis really reached its height, when we had over 100,000 individuals coming into the country illegally per month for several months in a row, I think what the Trump administration did and what we did at DHS is, we put a number of policies and procedures in place to address that crisis and to bring those numbers down. And I think it's a very effective network of policies that we have done. And, again, the Biden administration, look, elections matter, and they get to do what they -- the policies that they set out. But we -- this is about homeland security. So it's not just good policy for politics. They need to make sure that border is secure, that we don't go back to catch release, that we're not releasing individuals that may have COVID into American border communities to put additional strain on our health care system. All of that factors in. Hopefully, they're looking at all of that. They're understanding that. They understand how that intersects and interplays with one another. It's very dangerous and it's very complex."

And we did that within the law. So, I'm happy to have anyone take a look at that. Again, the policies that we put in place, the measures we put in place, the actions that we took, along with the president and others, were to protect the homeland, so, whether we look at an effective border wall system, whether we look at interior enforcement or the travel restrictions, again, a policy that the Biden administration has now rescinded, travel restrictions, making sure that we know more about individuals as they come into this country than we ever have before. And so we put a policy and a procedure in place that governments are sharing more information with us now than they ever have before. Again, that has been rescinded in the last several days.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Maria, these sanctions against former Trump administration officials are a dangerous and insidious escalation of China's effort to influence American policy. On Wednesday, just moments after Joe Biden took office, a couple dozen Trump administration officials were sanctioned by China. Now, at first, one might just laugh them off. I was sanctioned last summer, and I kind of laughed it off. But these sanctions apply not just to these individuals. They apply to any company or institution that associates with them. Now, this is not designed so much to punish Trump administration officials for taking a tough line on China, but to send a shot across the bow to Biden administration officials. Just let me give you a couple of examples of how these could influence a U.S. government official's thinking. So, for instance, many former officials like to write memoirs, and those memoirs can contribute to our understanding of public events. China specifically threatened publishing houses that give book contracts to administration officials they have sanctioned with cutting off all access for all their books in the Chinese market. Or, to take another example, a lot of government officials are lawyers. They leave big firms, they go back to big firms. Even if they have no clients with any business in China, that law firm probably does. And what if China goes to one of those big corporations and threatens to cut off their access if they don't cut off that law firm? This is the kind of unspoken, insidious effect these sanctions can have on senior government officials. We cannot tolerate it. The Biden administration needs to denounce it forcefully. They need to impose reciprocal sanctions on Chinese officials. They need to find out if the China -- Chinese ambassador was involved in it. And, if so, they need to kick him out of the country. We cannot tolerate China trying to influence government officials at the highest levels of American government."

For instance, Antony Blinken, the incoming secretary of state, said he agreed with Secretary Pompeo's designation of China as a genocidal regime for what they're doing to religious minorities in their northwestern province of Xinjiang. But what we really need to hear is from the top. President Biden needs to condemn these sanctions. He needs to condemn the actions that China is taking against Hong Kong in the South China Sea, just recently threatening Taiwan again. It's important that the president say that, not just the president's spokesman, not just his Cabinet officials, but the president himself."

And you made this point on this program many times, that the CCP knew -- when they knew, when they learned that this disease was as deadly as it was, they allowed it to escape their borders, correct? We haven't heard anything like that from Joe Biden."

      "utterance": "Yes, that's right, Maria. It was a year ago this month when I was trying to ring the alarm about this virus that was creating an unknown kind of pneumonia in Wuhan. The rest of Washington was obsessed with the impeachment trial. Obviously, we're now still in the midst of a deadly global pandemic. I think all the evidence -- it's circumstantial, but all evidence continues to point to the Institute of Virology in Wuhan as the source of this virus, not some food market in Wuhan, that China's covering it up, just like they covered up for weeks how deadly this virus was, and let what could have been a local health challenge in Wuhan in the middle of China turn into the deadliest global pandemic in a century."

I want to get your take, domestic issues, as well. Senator, this week is a big week. You will get sworn in. But you also have some things to vote on. Tell me about what you're expecting this upcoming week, as Nancy Pelosi is asking to keep National Guard troops in place at the Capitol all the way until mid-March. Is that -- is that what's happening?"

      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right, Maria. And I don't think that's necessary. Look, I'm on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have consulted with Senate leadership. I don't -- I'm not aware of threat reporting that suggests we need 7,000 troops and razor wire around the Capitol. What happened on January 6 was in part the failure of the senior security leaders on Capitol Hill to anticipate the kind of violence we saw from the mob that broke into the Capitol on the 6th. There was chatter about that on social media, yet they didn't request enough backup from the FBI or the Park Police and the National Guard. Muriel Bowser, the left-wing mayor of Washington, D.C., declined to let the National Guard that was present be armed and prepared for riot equipment. Then we had a major reaction, one might say an overreaction, of bring 26,000 National Guard troops in for January 20's inauguration. But the inauguration is behind us. These troops did a great job. I respect their service. They deployed on short notice. But it's time to send home the troops. If there is threats..."

Lay out the week for us. And, by the way, we should mention that, on day one, Joe Biden got the United States back into the World Health Organization as well. Your reaction there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I think it was a misguided decision to go back into the World Health Organization. They have largely been carrying water for China for the last year. Reporting since the early days of this pandemic has made that clear. On the impeachment trial, I made it absolutely clear the day the House passed its article of impeachment that a trial after the president has left office is beyond the Senate's constitutional authority. I think a lot of Americans are going to think it's strange that the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove from office a man who left office a week ago. That's not the role of impeachment. Impeachment is designed to remove a current officeholder from office. I suspect that the president's attorneys at some point, if they don't go to court, will come to the Senate with a motion to dismiss, as beyond -- this trial is beyond our constitutional authority. The more I talk to other Republican senators, the more they're beginning to line up behind the position I announced a couple weeks ago."

      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Joe Biden basically announced to the entire world that it's olly olly oxen free at our border. He stopped construction of the border wall. And he said that we're going to -- now we're going to resume allowing people showing up at our border, making bogus claims of asylum to come into the country, to be released, to come back, perhaps, probably not, for a hearing months or years later. Look, we had a very strong agreement with Mexico, which was keeping these migrants in Mexico while their asylum claims could be adjudicated. For no reason, Joe Biden tore up that agreement. And now we're going to see yet another surge at the border. You already see some caravans coming through Central America."

    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "No, the bill that Joe Biden sent last week I think will be dead on arrival. It's far to the left of any immigration bill that Congress has considered. It would flood the labor markets with millions of unskilled migrants, whether they're here presently as illegal aliens or they're rushing to the border now. That would be terrible for working-class Americans, taking their jobs away or driving their wages down."

We just heard from Tom Cotton about the severity of the China threat. So, why is The New York Times praising Beijing as -- quote -- \"one of the safest places in the world\"? Journalist Glenn Greenwald is here. And he will investigate with us. And join me all week, this upcoming week, on FOX News at 7:00 p.m. live. I will be hosting \"FOX News Primetime.\" We will have breaking news and newsmakers and informed opinion. Monday, my exclusive interviews with Congressman Jim Jordan and former acting DNI Ric Grenell later on in the week. Secretary Ric -- we will talk about it."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. Well, we talk a lot on this program about having faith in our government, but how about the news media? A new Edelman poll examined just found that only 46 percent of Americans trust their traditional media, and that 56 percent agree that the media purposely tries to mislead the public. Wow. That is a major problem, as big tech continues to snuff out free speech on its platforms. Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist who, in 2014, won a Pulitzer for breaking the Edward Snowden story about the NSA surveillance and the surveilling of private citizens under the Obama administration. Glenn, it is good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us. Your reaction to the media trust, trust in the traditional media, mainstream media, at an all-time low?"

      "speaker": "GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST",
      "utterance": "I think it's incredibly important story that's receiving almost no attention because the people who should give it attention are the ones that this poll found are losing faith and trust. And this is not a new, sudden development. This has been taking place for years. If you look at the bar graph of how many people trust the corporate media, the establishment media in the United States, it has been dropping precipitously over the course of many years. And when they do talk about it, they do one of three things. Either they complain about it and say that it's unjust that they have lost trust, as though they are divinely entitled to have it, or, number two, they blame others who criticize their reporting, their bad reporting, as though they're being unfairly vilified. ' And when that doesn't work, what they're doing now is a third response, which is trying to censor their critics and those who are actually inspiring trust by saying, kick these people off the Internet, their audience is too big, censor these people, throw their platform off the Internet. They know that they're losing faith and trust. The one thing they never do, Maria, is ask what it is that they have done that is causing the public to lose faith and trust."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Unbelievable. And let's -- look, let's not forget, The Washington Post and The New York Times, they won Pulitzer Prizes over their coverage of the Russia hoax right? So, they don't want to give the mea culpa that, oh, wait, we were had, we were -- we were taken for granted and taken advantage of by the FBI, who fed us stories that were just lies. So, no mea culpas from either of them. But I want to zero in specifically on The New York Times, because I don't know if the Chinese state media is writing their scripts or what the story is in terms of this, but look at this New York Times January 4 article that says: \"While many countries are still reeling from COVID-19, China, where the pandemic originated, has become one of the safest places in the world. The country reported fewer than 100,000 infections for all of 2020. The United States has been reporting more than that every day since November.\""

The country will be the only major economy to have grown this year.\" What -- does The New York Times not recognize that the media is controlled by the communist government? Or did the Chinese write that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "So, I think what -- this points to a broader media pattern that has been going on for many years in the United States, and it's reflective of the United States government policy as well. The United States government is partners and allies with some of the most brutal and repressive dictatorships on the planet. And that's long been true. And whenever those governments that are perceived to be allies of the United States or in some way favorable to the United States engage in brutal human rights oppression, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Gulf states, for example, the media tends to ignore it or downplay it, whitewash it. And, instead, we get a lot of focus on the human rights violations in countries that are perceived to be enemies of the United States, like Venezuela or Russia."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. We are back with journalist Glenn Greenwald, who writes for Substack. And, Glenn, we were talking about The New York Times shilling for Beijing and the communists. I just find it really shocking that the media does not care about what we're seeing in terms of censorship, does not care that, for example, Jack Ma disappeared after he criticized the CCP. He disappeared for two months. We just saw him recently in a video. But that should be a real message for all those American companies gearing up to go set up shop in Beijing. You're also worried, though, about what you're seeing domestically. And it was called earlier in this program domestic terrorism. Tell us about it."

      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "There's clearly a new war on terror that several key parts of both parties want to unite in order to launch domestically, led by people like Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney, that will be incredibly, incredibly repressive. Fortunately, there's now opposition on the left. And I hope that House Republicans and Senate Republicans concerned about civil liberties will work with them to stop what will be an incredibly dangerous effort to replicate the war on terror, but this time aimed at U.S. citizens."
