So, tell me, what we do know from one of your colleagues -- I was speaking to Ron DeSantis from Florida, who was earlier telling me that this guy walked up to them, presumably the shooter, James Hodgkinson, and who was asking whether there were Republicans or Democrats playing there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, he had clear intent, if that is the same individual. When I showed a picture, the license picture that we have all seen him by now, he identified him as such. But these are events that normally are pretty safe and routine.

A couple of hours ago, I was asked to lead the entire Congress in prayer. I had them join hands. We understand that we have got to work on our rhetoric However, we cannot ignore the fact that these Republicans were targeted by this individual. When it comes to the second part of your question, there's no doubt in my mind that we would have 15 to 20 members of the Republican House that would not be with us had Steve Scalise and his two or three detail that he travels with -- we have actually teased him about it before.
