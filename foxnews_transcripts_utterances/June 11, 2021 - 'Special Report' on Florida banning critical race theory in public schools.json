And I`m very curious to see a number of things emerging from this G-7 summit, including, of course, this meeting with Vladimir Putin, which, unfortunately, I think, is set up to be really a coup for Putin in so many different respects.

The Obama administration always made the argument that if we got back into the deal that Iran would improve their behavior on a number of different fronts. We saw that didn`t happen. In fact, Iran got more aggressive once they were in the nuclear agreement. We are now seeing that the more the Biden administration negotiates with them, the more aggressive they`ve become. Whether that`s sending ships to Venezuela for a weapons transfer or whether that`s funding Hamas to wage a war against Israel through Hamas, whether it`s finding other proxies in the region like the Houthis against Saudi Arabia.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs went on to say the number one military threat as we go forward is China, but he considers Russia a major competitor. This as, obviously, the president continues his European trip. Let`s bring in our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, and Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital. Ben, your thoughts about that? BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, obviously, I dispute President Biden`s notion regarding climate change. And I`m very curious to see a number of things emerging from this G-7 summit, including, of course, this meeting with Vladimir Putin, which, unfortunately, I think, is set up to be really a coup for Putin in so many different respects. He`s already got the Nord Stream pipeline. He is not going to have anything change in Belarus. Ukraine is going to continue in terms of a simmer, you`re going to continue to have Russian actors, whether government-backed or not, extract ransomware from companies around the world. And I think that you really are going to see a continued crackdown on any kind of domestic pushback against Putin`s regime, especially from Alexei Navalny. This is really going to a situation where after all of this talk of the Trump administration being soft on Russia, the outcome when it comes to the Biden administration is almost certainly going to be some angry language or some very stern talking to from the president. I don`t really expect anything to come out of it that is going to encourage any of us who believe that America ought to be pushing back stronger against Russian influence."

The Obama administration always made the argument that if we got back into the deal that Iran would improve their behavior on a number of different fronts. We saw that didn`t happen. In fact, Iran got more aggressive once they were in the nuclear agreement. We are now seeing that the more the Biden administration negotiates with them, the more aggressive they`ve become. Whether that`s sending ships to Venezuela for a weapons transfer or whether that`s funding Hamas to wage a war against Israel through Hamas, whether it`s finding other proxies in the region like the Houthis against Saudi Arabia. And so this concept of offering Iranians a nuclear agreement and hoping that in return they will somehow change their behavior, we have seen the opposite of that happen, and it`s happening as we speak while they are trying to negotiate some kind of agreement."

This president was in a direct attack, also, I think, at China, or direct line of attack at China as he said we are not looking for concessions or favors from those nations that we seek to help. I have had a little different opinion. I found some of the analysis interesting with some of the other panelists, but my perspective is slightly different. I think this effort to build, to strengthen our multilateral approach, or should say strengthen relationships with allies, build even stronger ones with countries we are seeking to have a better relationship with as we enter the ending of this cold war with China I think is a very smart thing. The world is a messy place. It`s a dangerous place. It always has been. I`m relieved a bit by the experience this president brings, and I hope that he and Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin won`t be afraid to pull and use every lever. And you have to be encouraged here and watch him use the soft power lever as much as they are. Without question, the dominant organizing theme for our foreign policy over the next five, 10, 15 years, my kids` years in middle school and high school and college, will be how we compete and beat China. That`s what I heard from our military leaders today in Congress. And that`s what I continue to hear from President Biden and his team, as well."

That is because of this back and forth with House Democratic leadership and Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar. It stems from this original tweet that Omar put out about Hamas and the Taliban and the U.S. Here it is, \"We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crime against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan and the Taliban. I asked Secretary Blinken where people are supposed to go for justice.\" That prompted this response from House Democratic leadership, saying \"Drawing force equivalencies between democracies like the U.S. and Israel and groups that engage in terrorism like Hamas and the Taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress toward a future of peace and security for all. We welcome the clarification by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar that there is no moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel, and Hamas and Taliban,\" which prompt add tweet from Omar which said, \"It is shameful for colleagues who call me when they need my support to now put out a statement asking for clarification and not just call. The Islamophobic tropes in this statement are offensive. The constant harassment and silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable,\" according to Congresswoman Omar. Back with the panel. Harold, let me start with you. As we head towards 2022, How do House Democrats deal with this? Not only Congresswoman Omar, but all of the squad then came to her support. But the leadership said we had to put out this statement to kind of put out this fire."

      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you have to deal with it directly. I think the seriousness of any member of Congress, this congresswoman or, for that matter, anyone is measured by how serious you conduct yourself. And I find the way this congresswoman -- the congresswoman has gone about expressing her views here to be, at best, irresponsible and reckless, and at worst, not serving her constituents well. But I think the leadership did what they had to do. It sounds like they are going to need not just a progressive caucus and a Congressional Black Caucus and a Hispanic caucus. They`re going to need a peacemaker caucus soon on the Democratic side. But I think leadership did the right thing releasing that statement. And it sounds like the congresswoman, I thought she clarified, but the last tweets you showed maybe I`m not totally up to speed on where this story is."

Plus, our \"Whatever Happened To\" segment continues every Friday. Whatever happened to Syria? What`s going on there right now? Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That`s it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. FOX NEWS PRIMETIME hosted this week by Tammy Bruce is so good we`re going to toss it four seconds early."
