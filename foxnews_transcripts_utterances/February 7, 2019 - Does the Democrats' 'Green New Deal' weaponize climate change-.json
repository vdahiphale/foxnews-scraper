Elizabeth Warren's ongoing race- faking scandal. Adam Schiff's disgusting conflicts of interest that we will break tonight. And we're going to cover it all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We begin tonight on our “Hannity” watch, the rise of socialism featuring freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, while some of you may be quick to think, oh, this is ridiculous, this couldn't happen in the United States of America, well, history is riddled with the road kill and the misery of many versions of socialism almost always ending the same way -- false promises, broken promises, failure, poverty, misery among the people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is a real serious threat to our way of life. It doesn't matter Republican or Democrat. So, today, Ocasio-Cortez rolled out what is a horrific frightening piece of legislation. She's calling it the green New Deal, how everything we've been saying about the new radical Democratic Party, what they were hiding in 2018, now it's all in writing and it might be even worse than we thought, because just hours ago, Ocasio-Cortez and others put forth one of the most dangerous, impractical, misguided, economically guaranteed to be devastating plans ever championed by any American politician.

      "sentences": "All right. Before we get into this, I promise you might be thinking this is fake news. It is not. This is a real proposal, real ideas from real lawmakers and the new radical extreme Democratic Socialist Party of America beyond dangerous and beyond scary. Now, in a six page overview released by her office today, well, Ocasio-Cortez is now calling pay close attention. For the United States of America to move to 100 percent clean and renewable energy in 10 years, in other words, she wants the government to them eliminate all fossil fuels, all of them in ten years, which by the way, that energy is the lifeblood and the engine of all economic success. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She wants the government to radically alter the way you heat your home, the way you commute to work, what you cook, how you cook, how you eat, and live your life. In doing so, well, the Socialist Democrats, they plan to nationalize and literally illuminate, you know, in many ways the most profitable industry in America, the fossil fuel industry. Millions of American jobs were be wiped out if we were able to follow this plan -- the industry that has led the technology and technological advances, the lifeblood of our economy and why do we have the highest standard of living that we have today that is the envy of the world. And it gets worse according to a study from Stanford. This plan at a minimum is going to cost $13.4 trillion. In just a reference in 2015, the entire federal budget was just $3.5 trillion. Now, sadly, it's even a lot more to report. The so-called \"Green New Deal\" proposes the elimination of air travel -- all air travel -- and the creation of more high-speed trains. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, forget about jetting around the world in mere hours and enjoying your train ride to Europe, Japan, Australia, good luck with that train. I can't wait for her to explain how those trains are going to be built, kind of like all aboard, the poverty express is coming. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And this gets even more bizarre. Her plan also wants to take on the problem of cow flatulence by potentially putting an end to red meat consumption. Why? Because cows create CO2. No more stake. I guess government forced veganism is in order. And also the green new deal would redo literally every single building in America. I'm not kidding. Legislation the government would upgrade or replace every building in the U.S. for state-of-the-art energy efficiency. Well over 100 residential homes we rebuild every home in the country, every business in the country in ten years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, how is everybody going to pay for all of this? And beyond that, remember, deep down, this plan is really just the socialist wish checklist. It's what they've always believed that now they're getting more vocal about. That's why in this utopian horror, it grants every single person, these are the promises she's making, it guarantees that everyone will have income including those that are unable, OK, to work, even unwilling to work. Nobody has to work. The government handouts, they don't stop there. They want free health care, free education, free housing, free retirement, it's all in there. Free, free, free. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's a great bumper sticker and a great slogan. Wait until the bill comes in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What the government gives, the government taketh away. What made America a great prosperous nation, it was built on liberty and freedom, the pursuit of happiness and capitalism. Goods and services that people want, need, and desire being provided by other people. I didn't grow up with a lot of money in my life. I have very modest background. My parents worked very hard. My grandparents, all four of them were poor. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } My mom a prison guard, my dad data corrections officer, they have modest 50x100 lot home, one bathroom, three older sisters. Kind of tough for a younger brother. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And for a good portion of my early adult life, I did struggle to make a living. I was a painting contractor, hang wall paper, lay tile, did all sorts of jobs in construction, every conceivable restaurant job almost 20 years of my life. I worked odd jobs, lived in a small apartment. I even bought a 1971 Ford Maverick very running for 350 bucks. I've bought an old providence company work van for $200 the best I have ever spent. I was never guaranteed income. Didn't have health care when I fell nearly three stories offer roof, and thank God I learn something. The value of hard work, digging deep, taking risks, like all of you do in your everyday life. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The U.S. has lifted more people out of poverty, our capitalist system that than any other system in the history of the world. If we have learned anything from all of these socialist countries and experiments, when government squashes human initiative, the system to send into chaos. Maybe on paper it sounds great, everything is free, you are safe and secure. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, how are those schools doing now that they want to add free college on top of everything I mentioned? How did Obamacare and those promises work out? Did you keep your doctor, your petplan? Are you paying less? How many of you have less than one option, only have one option? Do you what? Do you really trust Sanders? Medicare for all, $33 trillion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kamala Harris, her plan to get rid of private insurance for 177 million Americans. Elizabeth Warren's plan, after you've already paid taxes, and maybe you save 35, to 40 cents on the dollar. She wants to come back and say, give me more, which would be illegal and unconstitutional. That would -- literally, we would be giving a license to steal. They would be creating a law to rob you blind. Do you want the government in every aspect of your life? Socialism always promises everything. It takes all your fears away, every one of them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The problem is, tell me where it's working. Give me a great example. Venezuela? The former Soviet Union, Cuba? This is a false security based on false promises that are absolutely impossible to keep and will literally destroy the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Still this new extreme radical socialist Democratic Party, they want to upend everything. They want to sacrifice your well-being, eliminating great paying jobs that are now in the pipeline thanks to Donald Trump and the energy sector. We have two pipelines online, Keystone, Dakota Pipeline and ANWR will get more oil. You know, now we have surpassed literally the Saudis and Russia as the number one producer of energy in the world. Now, we are an exporter of energy. Great also for national security, we're not begging countries that hate us for more. You know what? We'll get rid of the literally energy sector, the airline sector, the healthcare sector, why? So the government can take over these industries? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, of course, no answers about how to pay for it. Her answer was just, we will print more money. We'll just take money. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And this comes as we are so energy independent, these are going to be high- paying jobs, not relying on foreign oil where truck drivers remember in North Dakota were making over 100 grand a year and they were getting trained to do the job. But Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic socialist, they claim that the world was going to end in 12 years because of climate change, which is, of course, is not true. Now, green energy, this new deal, will destroy America, our economy as we know it. It will turn back the clock. It will take us back to another century. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But like all good socialists, they claim it's going to be great. But you know better. Now, sadly, this is what most Democrats don't understand, socialists don't understand. But don't be fooled, we have to take this seriously. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is what many in the Democratic Socialist Party want. This will be their major theme as they the nomination in 2020. That and open borders. Ocasio-Cortez, when she's pushing this radical government takeover of the entire economy, oh, she was bashing ICE again today.

Now, this is just the latest sad disturbing example of the hypocrisy of the left, because every two years, every four years, Republicans are racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you know my list. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But tonight, their action speaks so much louder than their words. Now, by the way, which brings us to the third Virginia Democrat embroiled in a serious scandal. That's the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax. He's currently facing a serious allegation of violent sexual assault. His accuser released a detailed statement claiming that Fairfax physically forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room at the 2004 Democratic convention in Boston. Last year, she reportedly confided in Virginia Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott about the incident. He did nothing. So much for #metoo. And last year, she also reported a story to \"The Washington Post\". They did nothing because they called it a he said/she said matter. Of course, \"The Post\" was more than happy to obsess about the he said/she said in the Kavanaugh case just a few months ago. Remember during the Kavanaugh confirmation? Nearly everyone on the left, they rushed to judgment, rushed to support the accusers. No matter how unverified, unsubstantiated the claims, \"I believe\" was the phrase of the day. Democrats threw due process, and the presumption of innocence to the wind, flushing the U.S. Constitution down the toilet, trying to ruin a man's life and his family's life over uncorroborated claims. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Democrats now that it's a Democrat, they sound remarkably different, virtually nobody has said \"I believe\" when it comes to Lieutenant Governor Fairfax's accuser, many avoiding the subject completely. They are hiding from the press and others calling for an investigation before making a determination. Look, I am never not going to be the PC police here, we don't rush to judgment on the show. We don't call for firings on the show. We don't support boycotts to silence people on the show. That's up to people. They decide to watch whatever show they like. And unlike the left, we are consistent. Serious allegations deserved serious investigations like the Republicans gave Professor Ford -- due process , presumption of innocence. If all three top elected Democratic officials are forced to resign though in the Commonwealth of Virginia, again, the Republican speaker of the house of delegates would be the next governor. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I wouldn't hold your breath thinking those three leading Democrats in Virginia are going anywhere. It's all about power not about principle. Not about people. Again, they'll use anything to bludgeon Kavanaugh or Trump, but when it's them, they just go -- let's not talk about it anymore. We'll keep you posted as the story develops. First, we're covering another embarrassing scandal for the Democrats. Look at presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is in hot water yet again after her Texas state bar registration was unearthed and it showed that she registered as an American Indian. Yesterday, she did her best to dodge questions once again about what is now a long history even though she once denied it of race-faking. Take a look.",

Devin Nunes then House Intelligence Committee Chairman goes to the White House, exercises his oversight responsibility, tries to find about some unmasking abuses and Adam Schiff goes banana. \"This is an abuse. He didn't tell the Committee. He can't be trusted. This taints our whole investigation\", right? Remember that?

The author of the dossier, and he is there talking with Glenn Simpson. And this is at a time when Schiff's Committee and Nunes' Committee knows it's highly possible that there's been lies in his testimony. He has a meeting. He doesn't tell anybody in the Committee. It isn't until I find this photo in the last couple days showing them together, that we now learn that they had this meeting.

It's the weaponization of weather, the weaponization of climate. The idea that the average person doesn't know what happened in the 70s or the 30s or the 40s or the 50s - like - people like me, what they do is they simply take advantage of it.

Elizabeth Warren's ongoing race- faking scandal. Adam Schiff's disgusting conflicts of interest that we will break tonight. And we're going to cover it all. We begin tonight on our “Hannity” watch, the rise of socialism featuring freshman Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, while some of you may be quick to think, oh, this is ridiculous, this couldn't happen in the United States of America, well, history is riddled with the road kill and the misery of many versions of socialism almost always ending the same way -- false promises, broken promises, failure, poverty, misery among the people. This is a real serious threat to our way of life. It doesn't matter Republican or Democrat. So, today, Ocasio-Cortez rolled out what is a horrific frightening piece of legislation. She's calling it the green New Deal, how everything we've been saying about the new radical Democratic Party, what they were hiding in 2018, now it's all in writing and it might be even worse than we thought, because just hours ago, Ocasio-Cortez and others put forth one of the most dangerous, impractical, misguided, economically guaranteed to be devastating plans ever championed by any American politician. A plan, if it's ever implemented, guaranteed to fail and the result will be disastrous for the American people. But, she and others couldn't be more proud. Take a look."

      "utterance": "All right. Before we get into this, I promise you might be thinking this is fake news. It is not. This is a real proposal, real ideas from real lawmakers and the new radical extreme Democratic Socialist Party of America beyond dangerous and beyond scary. Now, in a six page overview released by her office today, well, Ocasio-Cortez is now calling pay close attention. For the United States of America to move to 100 percent clean and renewable energy in 10 years, in other words, she wants the government to them eliminate all fossil fuels, all of them in ten years, which by the way, that energy is the lifeblood and the engine of all economic success. She wants the government to radically alter the way you heat your home, the way you commute to work, what you cook, how you cook, how you eat, and live your life. In doing so, well, the Socialist Democrats, they plan to nationalize and literally illuminate, you know, in many ways the most profitable industry in America, the fossil fuel industry. Millions of American jobs were be wiped out if we were able to follow this plan -- the industry that has led the technology and technological advances, the lifeblood of our economy and why do we have the highest standard of living that we have today that is the envy of the world. And it gets worse according to a study from Stanford. This plan at a minimum is going to cost $13.4 trillion. In just a reference in 2015, the entire federal budget was just $3.5 trillion. Now, sadly, it's even a lot more to report. The so-called \"Green New Deal\" proposes the elimination of air travel -- all air travel -- and the creation of more high-speed trains. So, forget about jetting around the world in mere hours and enjoying your train ride to Europe, Japan, Australia, good luck with that train. I can't wait for her to explain how those trains are going to be built, kind of like all aboard, the poverty express is coming. And this gets even more bizarre. Her plan also wants to take on the problem of cow flatulence by potentially putting an end to red meat consumption. Why? Because cows create CO2. No more stake. I guess government forced veganism is in order. And also the green new deal would redo literally every single building in America. I'm not kidding. Legislation the government would upgrade or replace every building in the U.S. for state-of-the-art energy efficiency. Well over 100 residential homes we rebuild every home in the country, every business in the country in ten years. By the way, how is everybody going to pay for all of this? And beyond that, remember, deep down, this plan is really just the socialist wish checklist. It's what they've always believed that now they're getting more vocal about. That's why in this utopian horror, it grants every single person, these are the promises she's making, it guarantees that everyone will have income including those that are unable, OK, to work, even unwilling to work. Nobody has to work. The government handouts, they don't stop there. They want free health care, free education, free housing, free retirement, it's all in there. Free, free, free. It's a great bumper sticker and a great slogan. Wait until the bill comes in. What the government gives, the government taketh away. What made America a great prosperous nation, it was built on liberty and freedom, the pursuit of happiness and capitalism. Goods and services that people want, need, and desire being provided by other people. I didn't grow up with a lot of money in my life. I have very modest background. My parents worked very hard. My grandparents, all four of them were poor. My mom a prison guard, my dad data corrections officer, they have modest 50x100 lot home, one bathroom, three older sisters. Kind of tough for a younger brother. And for a good portion of my early adult life, I did struggle to make a living. I was a painting contractor, hang wall paper, lay tile, did all sorts of jobs in construction, every conceivable restaurant job almost 20 years of my life. I worked odd jobs, lived in a small apartment. I even bought a 1971 Ford Maverick very running for 350 bucks. I've bought an old providence company work van for $200 the best I have ever spent. I was never guaranteed income. Didn't have health care when I fell nearly three stories offer roof, and thank God I learn something. The value of hard work, digging deep, taking risks, like all of you do in your everyday life. The U.S. has lifted more people out of poverty, our capitalist system that than any other system in the history of the world. If we have learned anything from all of these socialist countries and experiments, when government squashes human initiative, the system to send into chaos. Maybe on paper it sounds great, everything is free, you are safe and secure. Well, how are those schools doing now that they want to add free college on top of everything I mentioned? How did Obamacare and those promises work out? Did you keep your doctor, your petplan? Are you paying less? How many of you have less than one option, only have one option? Do you what? Do you really trust Sanders? Medicare for all, $33 trillion. Kamala Harris, her plan to get rid of private insurance for 177 million Americans. Elizabeth Warren's plan, after you've already paid taxes, and maybe you save 35, to 40 cents on the dollar. She wants to come back and say, give me more, which would be illegal and unconstitutional. That would -- literally, we would be giving a license to steal. They would be creating a law to rob you blind. Do you want the government in every aspect of your life? Socialism always promises everything. It takes all your fears away, every one of them. The problem is, tell me where it's working. Give me a great example. Venezuela? The former Soviet Union, Cuba? This is a false security based on false promises that are absolutely impossible to keep and will literally destroy the country. Still this new extreme radical socialist Democratic Party, they want to upend everything. They want to sacrifice your well-being, eliminating great paying jobs that are now in the pipeline thanks to Donald Trump and the energy sector. We have two pipelines online, Keystone, Dakota Pipeline and ANWR will get more oil. You know, now we have surpassed literally the Saudis and Russia as the number one producer of energy in the world. Now, we are an exporter of energy. Great also for national security, we're not begging countries that hate us for more. You know what? We'll get rid of the literally energy sector, the airline sector, the healthcare sector, why? So the government can take over these industries? And, of course, no answers about how to pay for it. Her answer was just, we will print more money. We'll just take money. And this comes as we are so energy independent, these are going to be high- paying jobs, not relying on foreign oil where truck drivers remember in North Dakota were making over 100 grand a year and they were getting trained to do the job. But Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic socialist, they claim that the world was going to end in 12 years because of climate change, which is, of course, is not true. Now, green energy, this new deal, will destroy America, our economy as we know it. It will turn back the clock. It will take us back to another century. But like all good socialists, they claim it's going to be great. But you know better. Now, sadly, this is what most Democrats don't understand, socialists don't understand. But don't be fooled, we have to take this seriously. This is what many in the Democratic Socialist Party want. This will be their major theme as they the nomination in 2020. That and open borders. Ocasio-Cortez, when she's pushing this radical government takeover of the entire economy, oh, she was bashing ICE again today. Take a look."

Ted Danson, he did it as well during a roast to Whoopi Goldberg. Now, this is just the latest sad disturbing example of the hypocrisy of the left, because every two years, every four years, Republicans are racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you know my list. But tonight, their action speaks so much louder than their words. Now, by the way, which brings us to the third Virginia Democrat embroiled in a serious scandal. That's the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax. He's currently facing a serious allegation of violent sexual assault. His accuser released a detailed statement claiming that Fairfax physically forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room at the 2004 Democratic convention in Boston. Last year, she reportedly confided in Virginia Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott about the incident. He did nothing. So much for #metoo. And last year, she also reported a story to \"The Washington Post\". They did nothing because they called it a he said/she said matter. Of course, \"The Post\" was more than happy to obsess about the he said/she said in the Kavanaugh case just a few months ago. Remember during the Kavanaugh confirmation? Nearly everyone on the left, they rushed to judgment, rushed to support the accusers. No matter how unverified, unsubstantiated the claims, \"I believe\" was the phrase of the day. Democrats threw due process, and the presumption of innocence to the wind, flushing the U.S. Constitution down the toilet, trying to ruin a man's life and his family's life over uncorroborated claims. Now, Democrats now that it's a Democrat, they sound remarkably different, virtually nobody has said \"I believe\" when it comes to Lieutenant Governor Fairfax's accuser, many avoiding the subject completely. They are hiding from the press and others calling for an investigation before making a determination. Look, I am never not going to be the PC police here, we don't rush to judgment on the show. We don't call for firings on the show. We don't support boycotts to silence people on the show. That's up to people. They decide to watch whatever show they like. And unlike the left, we are consistent. Serious allegations deserved serious investigations like the Republicans gave Professor Ford -- due process , presumption of innocence. If all three top elected Democratic officials are forced to resign though in the Commonwealth of Virginia, again, the Republican speaker of the house of delegates would be the next governor. I wouldn't hold your breath thinking those three leading Democrats in Virginia are going anywhere. It's all about power not about principle. Not about people. Again, they'll use anything to bludgeon Kavanaugh or Trump, but when it's them, they just go -- let's not talk about it anymore. We'll keep you posted as the story develops. First, we're covering another embarrassing scandal for the Democrats. Look at presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is in hot water yet again after her Texas state bar registration was unearthed and it showed that she registered as an American Indian. Yesterday, she did her best to dodge questions once again about what is now a long history even though she once denied it of race-faking. Take a look."

That's what due process is for, and that's what women have asked for. And now, this woman in this case, is being looked at. And the Democrats for some reason are treating her as though she can't be believed. So the American people are looking at this and they're seeing the double standard.

You can't trust what women are saying about men or about politicians, and this is courtesy of the Democrat Party. It is courtesy of a party that says they're the champions for women and within a few short months they have burnt it to the ground.

Devin Nunes then House Intelligence Committee Chairman goes to the White House, exercises his oversight responsibility, tries to find about some unmasking abuses and Adam Schiff goes banana. \"This is an abuse. He didn't tell the Committee. He can't be trusted. This taints our whole investigation\", right? Remember that? And Devin Nunes stepped aside for a while, had to undergo an ethics investigation, was cleared. Well let's fast forward to this summer. Adam Schiff is at The Aspen Institute. Who's he meeting with? The author of the dossier, and he is there talking with Glenn Simpson. And this is at a time when Schiff's Committee and Nunes' Committee knows it's highly possible that there's been lies in his testimony. He has a meeting. He doesn't tell anybody in the Committee. It isn't until I find this photo in the last couple days showing them together, that we now learn that they had this meeting. And my favorite line in this is, when asked what this meeting was about, Glenn Simpson said, \"Oh, it was just a small talk meeting. I considered what Ernie and Bert do on Sesame Street, small talk.
