The White House stirring up outrage over the supply chain crisis as some CEO's say President Biden waited way too long to fix the nation's broken system and the Christmas is coming very soon. The president's chief of staff, Ron Klain, again sparking backlash after promoting a tweet playing down the inflation and supply chain concerns millions of Americans have referring to them as high class problems. Here's the quote. \"Most of the economic problems we're facing are high class problems. We wouldn't have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent. We would have instead have had a much worse problem.\" Okay, fine. But the White House defending the tweet saying this.",

And then when things don't work out and there's a crisis as a result of all these policy positions, instead of changing the policy or pivoting, they attack the industry and say you have to bail us out, you have to fix this. Now, it's one thing for Christmas presents not to get delivered on time which can we call Joe Biden Scrooge or the Grinch yet, but it's another thing when basic goods can't get delivered on time. And this administration tends to bury its head and say there's nothing happening, there's no crisis here. This was inevitable. But they better get ready because there will be civil unrest if they don't prepare for things to get delivered like milk and food --",

So for someone who promised to unite the country, you can't even unite Democrats around his agenda. But the real question for people like Van Jones is what did you expect? I mean, Joe Biden is a guy who really didn't do much when he was in the Senate in terms of getting really big pieces of legislation passed. He did a few things here and there that then the left turned on him for like the 1994 Crime Bill.

And the pandemic of course as we've talked about a number of times has really shined a light on what kids are learning, where people's money is going, and whether people really want to keep their kids trapped in these school.

The president's chief of staff, Ron Klain, again sparking backlash after promoting a tweet playing down the inflation and supply chain concerns millions of Americans have referring to them as high class problems. Here's the quote. \"Most of the economic problems we're facing are high class problems. We wouldn't have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent.

But they're not being well served by the mainstream media who makes everything to be about Trump. If you -- even he gets a win, let's say he gets a win, a smaller win on some of these spending deals. You still are not going to feel the impact of that for years. Do you know how long it takes to build a plug-in for an electric car or how long it takes to get a new government program off the ground? All you're going to see immediately are tax hikes. So he's coming into a winner. You could see more COVID in the northern United States. You're going to obviously see high home heating bills.

He's having a very hard time getting his Build Back Better agenda passed. Bernie Sanders came out today saying they're not budging. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin is saying we're not budging either. So for someone who promised to unite the country, you can't even unite Democrats around his agenda. But the real question for people like Van Jones is what did you expect? I mean, Joe Biden is a guy who really didn't do much when he was in the Senate in terms of getting really big pieces of legislation passed. He did a few things here and there that then the left turned on him for like the 1994 Crime Bill. And people warned about this and they said that he was a guy who could bring everyone together because he had 40 years of Washington experience, but he's proving that he actually is a bureaucrat of the system and he really can't get things done that he promised on the campaign trail."

Instead, they're talking about $3.5 trillion and even the giveaways people aren't even into that. And then the other two things that are happening is that they're not -- we're not arguing about universal child care or free community college. People are focused on the fact they can't get out of the grocery store for less than $100. And they're being told that their home heating bills are going to go up 53 percent over last year. And that their kids aren't going to get the Christmas presents that they want this year. The other thing is they don't -- he doesn't take questions. Reporters of all stripes, they have two sacred cows -- access and process. They give them neither. And so at this point, what are we left arguing over? Tweets.

And if there's pornographic books in the library for people who are under the age of 18, especially young children, Glenn Youngkin believes that you should be able to go in and say I don't want this book in my kid's library. Terry McAuliffe made a big mistake during the last debate by saying no, parents don't have the right to go into their schools or have really any control over their kids' education. And the pandemic of course as we've talked about a number of times has really shined a light on what kids are learning, where people's money is going, and whether people really want to keep their kids trapped in these school.

And black women who are really very good at getting out the vote, they're not enthusiastic either. So, Democrats have a lot of problems. However, I was told today by two different people who called me separately saying they are concerned because they've realized now that Democrats are waking up to the fact that they could really lose in Virginia.

So, she then edited it and made them look like they were enabling felons and domestic terrorists and that they were all for no laws at all. So, she's done this before. And she also has been a critic of conservative citizen journalists who have gone -- like, James O'Keefe for example, who has done under undercover investigative reporting and videos and saying, oh well, they deceptively edit all of their information when all that video came out of Planned Parenthood. So, she's allowed to do it, but criticizes others for doing it. And yes, to Dana's point, the arrogance that she thought that RBG needed to be protected, I mean, come on."
