They formally closed it up and said, we will see you back here on the bench October 1, and no hint of any retirements. But what we didn't know is that Justice Anthony Kennedy had already made up his mind. He wanted to talk to President Trump before issuing a very simple letter this afternoon to the president, and it went public, in party saying this: \"Please permit me, this letter, by this letter, to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how to best know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises.\" He truly has been a swing vote. He doesn't like that term, but he's been a key in all these 5-4 decisions, many of them of landmark consequence.

He's been celebrated by folks in those camps. And those advocates, they now today are lamenting the fact that he's going to be gone. They're very worried about the kind of person that President Trump will pick. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They're unhappy with Justice Neil Gorsuch because he's proven to be what conservatives had hoped he would be. And now the president quickly getting another chance, a second seat. Already, in the Senate, a number of reaction. You played there sound from the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer. They don't want tots seat filled. They say they're going to do what they have to try to block it, although as long as they're in the minority, there are limits to what they can do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Senator Kamala Harris out of California, herself viewed as very progressive and liberal, is saying this today. She says: \"We should not vote on confirmation until they have voted at the ballot box.\" She doesn't want this before the midterms, saying: \"The president's list of potential nominees are complete nonstarters.

Not clear how she plans to stop them. But as long as this is done before the midterms and the Republicans maintain at least a 51 percent -- or 51-vote margin there in the Senate, it's going to be really tricky for Democrats to have anything to do with really shutting this down, Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Circuit, and the Justice Amy Barrett of the Seventh Circuit, the leading candidates for men and women, Barrett in he mid-40s, and Kavanaugh's about 53 years old. But the president has to take that list of 25 and narrow it down to a single person. The president said that discussion began today with Justice Kennedy.

It's our only issue this hour. It is that important right now. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil And Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And get ready for a summer to remember, as a Supreme Court justice is getting ready to hang up his robe. We have got you covered with Joe Lieberman on the very big battle to come, religious leader Bob Vander Plaats on the holy war -- yes, you heard me right -- yet to come, then Republican Senator Rand Paul, yes, on whether any of this gets done. First to Shannon Bream at the Supreme Court, where the search is now on. Hey, Shannon."

      "speaker": "But what we didn't know is that Justice Anthony Kennedy had already made up his mind. He wanted to talk to President Trump before issuing a very simple letter this afternoon to the president, and it went public, in party saying this",
      "utterance": "\"Please permit me, this letter, by this letter, to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how to best know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises.\" He truly has been a swing vote. He doesn't like that term, but he's been a key in all these 5-4 decisions, many of them of landmark consequence. There have been a lot of these decisions even in the last week. But over time, we think about him being a key vote in cases involving abortion, involving LGBT rights. He's been celebrated by folks in those camps. And those advocates, they now today are lamenting the fact that he's going to be gone. They're very worried about the kind of person that President Trump will pick. They're unhappy with Justice Neil Gorsuch because he's proven to be what conservatives had hoped he would be. And now the president quickly getting another chance, a second seat. Already, in the Senate, a number of reaction. You played there sound from the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer. They don't want tots seat filled. They say they're going to do what they have to try to block it, although as long as they're in the minority, there are limits to what they can do. Senator Kamala Harris out of California, herself viewed as very progressive and liberal, is saying this today."

They are conservative ideologues, instead of mainstream jurists. We cannot and will not accept them to serve on the highest court on the land.\" The president has prepared a list of 25. Not clear how she plans to stop them. But as long as this is done before the midterms and the Republicans maintain at least a 51 percent -- or 51-vote margin there in the Senate, it's going to be really tricky for Democrats to have anything to do with really shutting this down, Neil."

Remember, last year, I think it was probably sometime in the spring and then later on in the fall, the president released a list of a number of names up from which he would draw a nomination for the Supreme Court. Conservative groups are very happy with every name on that list. I talked to Carrie Severino at the Judicial Crisis Network. She said, we're very pleased that the White House is a list of justices, potential justices at least, that we don't have to worry about and she said that she could throw her support behind any one of the people who are on the list. The president, though, when he was meeting with the president of Portugal earlier in the Oval Office, paying the expected tribute to Justice Kennedy, who he said had come down to see him and spent about a half-an-hour talking with him. Listen here."

      "utterance": "Justice Kennedy will be retiring. And he is a man that I have known for a long time and a man that I have respected for a long time. He's been a great justice of the Supreme Court. He is a man who is displaying great vision. He has displayed tremendous vision and tremendous heart. And he will be missed, but he will be retiring."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "Now, the president also said the Oval Office that nominating a person to the Supreme Court is about one of the most important things that a president can do. And there are a lot of people, Neil, who have said, short of committing U.S. troops to battle, it is the most important thing. The president this time too has the opportunity to cement a 5-4 conservative majority at the court for a number of years to come. Clarence Thomas is 70 years old. Justice Alito is 68 years old. They could conceivably, if you look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg, serve for another 10 at least, if not 15 years. But then when you look at Justices Gorsuch and Roberts, they are still relatively young. And they could serve for potentially a generation. And the two leading candidates that the president is looking, Justice Kavanaugh of the D.C. Circuit, and the Justice Amy Barrett of the Seventh Circuit, the leading candidates for men and women, Barrett in he mid-40s, and Kavanaugh's about 53 years old. But the president has to take that list of 25 and narrow it down to a single person. The president said that discussion began today with Justice Kennedy. Listen here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Had a very deep discussion. I got his ideas on things, including, I asked him if he had certain people that he had great respect for that potentially could take his seat, which is a very hard seat to fill. So we talked about different things. And he was here for about a half-an- hour."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

We are going to be replacing a swing vote with someone who in all likelihood will be a conservative, a reliable conservative across the board. I think that is going to have massive ramifications for everything, from economics cases, business cases, constitutional cases, abortion, Second Amendment. Everything. This just changes the entire fundamental dynamic of the United States Supreme Court, potentially for a generation."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. And it's striking to me that he appreciates the fact that this is one of the most somber, significant, sacred responsibilities that he has. The justices that a president appoints to the court are one of the few things that we know will outlive his tenure for decades potentially. And given the way the court is currently constituted at this point in time, 4-4, with Justice Kennedy right in the center, this is a really, really big deal."

President Bush thought he was picking a conservative. Turns out that he was much more liberal. So, you don't know for sure. And I know people evolve in that role. But then this list that you have been privy to and it's out there now, what do you think of that? Is that a hard and fast, right list?"
    },

      "speaker": "DUPREE",

      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "That's what he said. I mean, I suppose he could expand the list, but he's been pretty firm and consistent that he's going to choose from this list. And I would say that, while there are no guarantees that someone will adhere to the ideology and the thinking about the Constitution that he or she brings to the office, at the same time I think the vetting process is very different today than it was back during the first President Bush, when Justice Souter was selected."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. They said he will be home run for conservatives. You know what? He wasn't. He wasn't even a single. But I think at this point we are now sufficiently sophisticated in the process that people who advising the president can look at the track record, what has this person written, what has this person said about the Constitution? So by the time the president ultimately makes his decision, I think he can have a very, very good degree of confidence that this person is as advertised."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",

      "utterance": "Yes. Right. I know. And it's funny. Justice Scalia was confirmed unanimously. Can you imagine something like that happening today? So whoever he chooses, I think it's a safe bet this is going to be one of these razor's edge, 51-49-type votes. And for that reason, they need to make sure they manage this confirmation process the same way they managed the Gorsuch process, that is to say, very professionally and successfully."

It was just a matter of when we were told, not even if. But, again, as we indicated, the Supreme Court justice indicated to the president today, he wanted to stop by, talk to the president, tell him in person that he wanted to step down. And now the choices. The president has a list. He's going to use that list. Now, on that list so happens to be the Utah Senator Mike Lee. I want to get the read on that from Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, what he makes of that. One senator on the list, Senator, and your colleague Mike Lee. How do you feel about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.",

He and I are allies are so many things, constitutional war powers, criminal justice reform, personal privacy. All of these issues, Mike Lee has been right there with me. So, I would hate to lose him from the Senate. But he's a very thoughtful guy, well-read, well-spoken and knows the law better than anybody that I have ever met probably. So, he would be a great pick. But I would be of divided loyalties, because I think we really need him in the Senate, where we're often outnumbered by people who don't really seem to give a darn at all about the Constitution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, that is high praise from you, Senator. Obviously, it would be a little convoluted, too, because then he would have to leave the Senate. And then obviously the governor of that state would appoint a replacement. And that could be confusing. But do you think that there's anyone on that list that could surprise folks, because some people look back, particularly on the conservative side, and say, we have been disappointed before. They use the Souter example and others, even Anthony Kennedy, who surprised people with how he could go from conservative to a swing vote, albeit an important vote. But what do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know anybody on the list. But I do know that the guy who was at the top of the list, Neil Gorsuch, is amazing. I just read his opinion in the Carpenter case. This is a case about whether the government can track your location forever, all of the time, without a warrant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "And his was the only dissent that said, when you give your records to a third party, a telephone company or a bank, Gorsuch was the only one that says the Fourth Amendment still should comply completely and always, that you still have a privacy or a property ownership in information when you let somebody hold it. You haven't given up an expectation of privacy. And Gorsuch's opinion was better than anybody else's on the court. So, you're talking to a guy who is a big fan of Gorsuch on the Fourth Amendment and I think on property and on a lot of other issues. He is going to probably end up being the most libertarian justice we have. So if anybody else is in the mode of Neil Gorsuch, I'm all for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Senator, some of the recent decisions that have been close ones and 5-4 rulings have prompted some to say we need a more decisive court. One more conservative vote in this case could potentially make 5-4 rulings 6-3 rulings. The other side laments that process, though, and hints that this is going to be a very, very divisive summer into the fall. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "I -- if I had to predict, I think Supreme Court vote, no matter who President Trump picks, will be divided among party lines, because the Democrats have dug in. And I don't think they're willing to look at each individual person that is nominated. They're so angry, they're now talking about violence. There are people in the Capitol pushing people, yelling kidnapper. It's really gotten kind of out of hand. You have members of Congress fomenting this kind of stuff. So, no, I think they're going to dig their heels in and just yell and scream and vote against anybody President Trump picks. But there's about eight states where Democrats are running for the U.S. Senate where President Trump won by between 20 and 40 points. And so if they want to yell and scream and say they hate everything about Trump and they're not going to do anything and not listen to anything Republicans have to say, their voters might think otherwise in November, because I think they're tired of Democrats making everything so partisan, frankly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, this other view that, oh, what's the rush? And you hear that many on the left and said, there's no need to rush. And they use that. And Chuck Schumer, I believe, used that, I'm paraphrasing here, Senator, that Mitch McConnell had used that argument in holding off on a Barack Obama appointment for the Supreme Court position that was ultimately filled by Judge Gorsuch, that the same applies here. So they wonder why. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "It's sort of -- I would say it's a completely different situation. When Senator McConnell said we need to wait until after the election, it was a presidential election. The president gets to pick Supreme Court. So you can see how, when you're in the middle of deciding who the president is, you probably shouldn't, at the very last minute of a presidency, when that president is not running, have them pick. You can how the election might really be important to decide who the next president is going to be. We're not going through a presidential election. We're just going through a congressional election. So, no, I think we should proceed forthwith. And, like I say, if President Trump nominates somebody half as good or nearly as good as Neil Gorsuch, I will be very happy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Because there is another thought here. Whatever happens in the House, Senator, there's a good likelihood, at least in the Senate, Republicans could pick up seats. Way too early to say. And you and I have gotten into this before. But the math might improve for the odds of getting a pick approved. Right now, it's as close as you can get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, I think that it's very likely that the Republicans keep their majority in the Senate or actually maybe expand that authority or majority. I think, in the House, it's going to be historic. But, typically, throughout history, when a president wins in one party, the other party often takes over 30 seats or more in the House. I think it's looking less likely than that, because the Democrats' problem is, they're now the party of social sort of a specific, sort of small percentage, sort of victim groups spread out through society. But they have sort of lost track of being for the working man. And I think just the general working man who is not part of some sort of special class or special group, victim group, who just wants a good job, is starting to say, gosh, the economy is picking up, wages are picking up. This may be the most rapid growth we have seen in a decade or more. I think we are going to hit 4 percent GDP growth. The enthusiasm I feel, I think we could hit 5 percent GDP growth if we could just sort of calm the waters on the trade front. But if we can get beyond this trade war, and it doesn't escalate, I think the tax return is just starting to get into the economy. And I really think you're going to see some amazing economic growth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You mentioned the economic growth and the wind that has been at the back certainly for the president. Of course, we had the market trip up today, as we have had in nine of the last 11 trading days. So, I don't want to get too overly obsessed with that. But is it your concern, Senator, that a chief justice should be a strict constitutionalist? In other words, just following what our forefathers intended, and not trying to reinterpret that or add to that? Because, by that definition, a lot of modern-day decisions were apart from that, and that even so-called conservative justice, now swing vote justices, have veered from that. What does a Rand Paul want to see out of the Supreme Court pick?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Someone who reads the Constitution as it was intended, is aware of the original intent of the framers of the Constitution, and understands basically that they wanted a very small government that did very little in the marketplace, and actually had a very modest and moderate foreign policy that made it difficult to go to war. We only went to war when Congress voted on it. So, a Constitution that was -- not only thought it was important to protect privacy, but John Adams said that James Otis' arguments against general warrants or writs of assistance, he said it was the spark that led to the revolution. So, Fourth Amendment privacy issues are very big for those of us who believe in the original interpretation of the Constitution. All I can say is, I don't know everyone on the list, but I do think that Neil Gorsuch, who was at the top of the list, has turned out to be a great justice. And if we can get any more similar to Neil Gorsuch, I will be exceedingly happy."

He is the one who actually pushed it back until we had the presidential election. But this is not a presidential election. We do have President Trump. He's going to appoint the next Supreme Court justice nominee. And I believe this Senate is going to confirm his desire. Even if it got pushed off, Neil, I think what you're going to do is, you are going to see a rallying of the base. When they thought the base on the right wasn't going to be energized this time, I think the base of the right is going to be very energized. They see what is at stake.

Wade argument was, if we could ever determine if that that baby was a person, that whole case collapses. A heartbeat does that. We knew the courts were going to be changing. We didn't know Kennedy was going to be retiring. But we knew, if Gorsuch was there, and if Kennedy did retire, or if Ginsburg stepped off the court, we knew Trump was going to be a constitutional conservative president who would appoint constitutional conservative judges. And we have a chance to take down Roe v. Wade. This is a historic moment in the pro-life community today."

It's not been through the people. It hasn't been through the elected officeholders. And now the courts are changing. And so we think marriage needs to be debated again.

And that's I think what you saw with your previous guest, Rand Paul, wanting a constitutional, conservative Supreme Court justice who understands it's not their job to make law, and it's not their job to rewrite the Constitution. A constitutional amendment is done by we the people, not by five Supreme Court justices. So, I think there's going to be a lot of issues up for debate.

You might think that the president would look for a moderate here to try to engage a few moderate Democratic votes. I don't think so. I think he made a commitment during the campaign. He's going to take his nominee off of the list provided be the Federalist Society or the Heritage Foundation, and it's going to be a real conservative.

Remember, the ruling, the Abood ruling which made the precedent here was made in the late '70s.

      "speaker": "ALEX SMITH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN RISING PAC",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at the not-so-distant past, in 2010, when President Obama had a Supreme Court pick come up, you know, he nominated Kagan in May, and she was confirmed by August. So I think the president is going to pick another qualified jurist, like Justice Gorsuch. And I think that, as a practical matter, the politics of this midterm election dictate that these senators in red states, states that the president won in 2016, simply are not going to allow Democratic senators to stonewall these kind of deliberations. Someone like Claire McCaskill, someone like Bill Nelson, in their state, they are not going to be able to get away with jamming up the president on the judicial nomination process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Or they can just reject. In the end, that's another thing. But, Doug Wead, obvious , we're assuming here that everyone is in synch and monolithic, all Democrats go one way, all Republicans go another way. There's a possibility among some of those Republicans -- and it's not much wiggle room here -- among the 50, if two or three certainly are going to be concerned about overturning Roe v. Wade or any hint of that out of presidential pick. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEAD",
      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. And then there's the idea that he is going to automatically pick another Gorsuch. He made it look easy. But Ronald Reagan picked a conservative who turned out to be a liberal and picked a conservative who turned out to be a swing vote. And George H.W. Bush picked a conservative who turned out to be a liberal. So just saying that he's automatically going to pick another Gorsuch, he is going to try. And then there's what you just mentioned. There's the fact that the media is going to go after these senators. They only have to pick a couple of them off. It's not just the nominee that is going to have every bad thought he's ever had exposed. It's one by one these senators. They're going to be on the spot. The media is going to hold their feet to the fire."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Robert, what are you looking for in whoever the president chooses? And a lot of your friends, what are they looking for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what we have to look at is most who is going to be a fair jurist, somebody who has a similar judicial philosophy to Anthony Kennedy, someone who can be explained -- but I don't understand at what point in American politics we got the Supreme Court justices picking a team and voting with that team 100 percent of the time. Let's get justices in place who follow the tradition of a Sandra Day O'Connor, who can analyze facts, who sometimes they will vote liberal, sometimes they will vote conservative, but we're getting the best rules and the best laws out of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Alex, sometimes, the candidates, to Doug's point, will surprise you, and not be predictable. And we have even seen it out of this court and the Gorsuch votes and some of the Roberts votes. Of course, it was Justice Roberts who infuriated a lot of conservatives by essentially keeping Obamacare alive. So they can surprise you. What do you look for in the hearings to hint at that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think, personally, what I'm looking for in a Supreme Court nomination is, I'm looking for someone who shows fidelity to the Constitution, someone who is looking to interpret as it was originally intended. And I think that is what is on display in the list of 25 very qualified jurists that the president has put out there for everyone to evaluate. He said that he was going to look to that list to make his pick. We got Justice Gorsuch out of that. And, as you mentioned, Chief Justice Roberts, he is incredibly deft and political at narrowing these decisions, so that they don't go -- they don't swing one way or the other too hard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, he might swing, though, right? Alex, there's a real possibility there. And, Doug Wead, I want to raise that, that his name has been mentioned as becoming the new Kennedy, the new swing vote. I don't know how this will morph and who will become what. But that does happen in history, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEAD",
      "utterance": "It sure does. It seems like, just when you think the court is going to tilt one way or the other, one of these justices starts rethinking. But I will just say this. That's what this election was all about. You can hear all these theories about jobs in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, why the conservative Catholic labor were voting for Trump, and why a few more Hispanics than normal, why the evangelicals are solidly in his camp, in spite of his bad language. It's the Supreme Court. That is what it was. And now we're at that moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I think you're right. That is what he kept hanging his hat on there, that is, candidate Trump, that, look, this is what he can do. Robert, is it your belief that it will be the monolithic, that all Democrats will vote one way, Republicans another, for the most part? Because that's gotten to be almost the routine with these votes. Gone are the days you would have 97, 100 to nothing votes. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, what we have seen on the Democratic side is leadership being completely feckless and having no ability to marshal their troops or get people in line. So you won't see 100 percent of Democrats vote against this nominee just based on party lines. You can see someone like a Warner or McCaskill switching over. But, at the same time, you might see Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski voting against the candidate. So, it won't be an up-or-down, straight-down-the-line vote, because I have no confidence in the Democratic leadership to be able to get their people in line to do so."

It's going to be a hot summer right now, and for Anthony Kennedy, taking advantage of this moment when Republicans sort of run the table to say, I'm leaving the table. \"The Five\" is now.
