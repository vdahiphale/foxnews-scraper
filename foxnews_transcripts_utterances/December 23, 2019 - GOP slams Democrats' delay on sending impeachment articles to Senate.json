Impeachment went so well for them the first time that by planning to do it again and telegraphing that you're going to do it, get over Don McGahn's testimony? That seems a little far-fetched. Yeah. This reminds me of the government shutdown. Do you remember that there was a government shutdown last year?"

Now, the president didn't get his while money, but the Democrats ended up having to cave pretty much. So, I think that impeachment feels the same. But there's something that happened that is not getting a lot of attention, I think it's because of all the other activity and it's the holidays. But Doug Jones, who is the Democrat from Alabama, is a senator who's basically said he's not for this impeachment thing. I think that is as big as Jeff Van Drew switching parties from Democrat to Republican on the House side, because it matters a lot. And I think maybe that is because, again, we're all so busy. A lot of Democrats think that other Democrats are in trouble -- Republicans are in trouble, like Cory Gardner of Colorado or Susan Collins of Maine, that they're actually going to have trouble getting reelected. But Doug Jones saying he's not for impeachment, I think shows that he knows it's not meritorious and he's definitely not going to vote for it."

      "utterance": "Yes, but no big headlines on Doug Jones. Just like, you know, the switching parties wasn't that big of a story in the mainstream media. What was the big story? Somebody at Christianity Today wrote an article against Trump, so that makes the headline. So, on that side, if you can find anybody at all. And they tried to make it seem like it's this big movement, evangelical support is crumbling."

      "utterance": "I mean, I think, and we've heard them saying, well, she's trying to get the upper hand because obviously she doesn't have any director jurisdiction over what's happening. Here's what I think the strategy actually is, although I think no one will ever say it. And certainly, you know, Speaker Pelosi will never actually lead with this. But I think it's because there is a lot of apprehension about impeachment and, you know, its public acceptance. And I think what's happening here is, okay, they were able to satiate the base by actually doing some kind of vote on impeachment in the House. But they know there's going to be acquittal in the Senate. So, they have to slow down the train to essentially, you know, play both ends to say, well, look, you know, the Senate wasn't going to be fair, so we weren't going to let this go forward because, you know, this is going to be rigged --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Waters",

      "utterance": "I think you might be right about that? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Emily Compagno, guest co-host",
      "utterance": "Well, the problem with that, and not with your theory, but the problem with the strategy is the fact that the base didn't need anything additional. All this is is causing those votes that actually do matter more for retaining any support for the Democratic Party, which is those Independents, are the ones that are so exhausted by this and are showing their fatigue and are not supporting this. So, it's like an unnecessary rally. And the other problem is, it belies the entire point of this, which is that it's gamesmanship. It never had anything to do with substance. Otherwise, there would be more of a commitment to evidence. There wouldn't be the hurry up and then slow down that there is now. You know, in law we have consumer confusion and this is like citizen confusion. No one understands this strategy. And during this break -- by the way, this isn't just an average break. This is a holiday break where people are reconnecting with their families. They're restoring from their everyday crazy lives. So, to me, on the other end of this, when Congress reconvenes, there will be an added exhaustion and fatigue and that kind of momentum coming into the new year. Everyone will be extra sick of this. Like, this again? No way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Waters",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "So, the dismay that Democrats have about evangelicals and Trump is not new. This has been going on since the very beginning. Like, how dare you? How could you? This, remembe,r going back to Access Hollywood tape, and on and on. And, like, for me, my faith is actually very personal. I don't like to mix it in with politics. I'm not part of the evangelical movement, born Lutheran, baptized Lutheran, but I understand and respect evangelical positions. I also think that if somebody wants to write an editorial in Christianity Today, so be it. Let them. Everybody has an opportunity to give their opinion, we're blessed that we have this opportunity here, we get to do it on television. But it shouldn't be that big a deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tom Shillue",
      "utterance": "I think you see, also, the timing of it. You saw The New York Times op-ed by those Republicans, or former Republicans. They know they're trying to take out some of these Republicans in the Senate and they need an all out pressure campaign against Republicans to guilt them and to shame them into supporting this president, as the stakes are so high with impeachment."

      "utterance": "You -- look, elected officials are going to listen to the people they work for, and that is the voters at home, not necessarily The New York Times or any other media outlet that's going to try to shame them. I mean, look, there's always been this disconnect between President Trump and his personal, you know, lifestyle or however you want to say being married a number of times and that sort of thing, and that being incongruous with, quote, unquote, \"evangelical values.\" The reality is he has governed very strongly for that group of individuals when it comes to appointing judges in a number of executive orders. And that's what they're looking at, not necessarily his personal conduct."

And I think that what matters -- you know, people can have a distaste, but what matters is what happens at the ballot box, and that kind of -- the turnover of the circuits and the judge placements and pushing those through that speaks louder than anything else."

      "utterance": "Well, Dana, you're right. It's -- anyone can write an editorial. The thing is, this is one guy, Mark Galli. I watched him on the Sunday shows because, of course, he had a huge open forum and they tried to make it seem like this was a national movement. Really, it's just this one guy and maybe the owner, Dalrymple, of Christianity Today. The thing you look at, though, is the fact that the media treated this it was like some kind of watershed, when it wasn't. They really just -- the follow up article is very interesting, because they just want to, they said, plant a flag. They don't like the fact that the evangelical movement is so tied to Trump. It's hurting them with recruitment with certain groups and they will admit that. So, it's not about impeachment, of which they are very inarticulate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",

I think -- [Laughter] I think the larger part, other than actual -- you know, making wine is more about agriculture and like digging in the dirt. It's difficult to turn a profit for a winery. But anyway, that -- this is one more example of Elizabeth Warren and others from the left telling people that their voters matters less and they are valid less as a voter because of something about them. So, remember, after the debates, we talked about this, that there were elements. There are people in the mainstream media saying that the \"Trump Regional Party is now from the mountain and the south.\" And the non-college educated chimed, a WaPo contributor. And then we have Elizabeth Warren who claims she's a capitalist; and yet, to someone who became a billionaire off of a capitalist society, potentially creating a service that actually helped others in this society, that definitely created employment, that definitely gave them insurance and paid taxes on, that -- she said they \"shouldn't elect our president.\" So, their vote matters less. And this kind of alienation, it won't be forgotten. It doesn't matter that, like, it always happens. We start far from the left and then, by the time we get to the general, they've corrected. I don't understand how the correction can come back from this when the strategy is alienation of others of how they should be demonized because of something about them."

His entourage thinks it's good, because usually he's a boring interview. And now he gets real animated when he talks about how much he hates Trump, so they're going with it. Also, I don't think people care about what these celebrities say about politics anymore. It's because -- 20 years ago, they were the only ones who can get on their soapbox and have a platform.
