There are some dry stretches of main street leading that way, but in between there are these massive areas that have been flooded. So earlier today, we went out with some relief workers, some volunteers and some members of the Harrison Fire Department from Northeast Texas and they had a high water vehicle, they're driving through the floods, towing a boat on a trailer, and they go through the dry areas through another flooded area to another dry area to get to another flooded area, that's the only way these boats could get in there that then send the boats in and pick up people, get their pets, bring them out, put them back on the track and then drive them back out again. They evacuated, the police chief told me 1200 to 1500 people. There are some people who didn't want to leave their homes are now wishing they did. Some of those people are now being rescued and the police chief tells me that they're moving from this recovery operation to a law enforcement operation. They have had some looting issues here.

That sparks a key question, is Comey now a credible witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller as his probe of Russian Meddling in the election and whether the president's firing of Comey was obstruction. The New York Times reporting tonight, Mueller has obtain a letter, the president and the top aide Stephen Miller drafted to justify Comey's firing. The top White House lawyer Dan Megyn blocked it. That may help Mueller figure out the original intent of the firing. The White House issued a separate letter drafted by the deputy Attorney General that talked about Comey mishandling the Clinton case that leads us to new information unearthed by Republicans, Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, FBI officials suggesting that Comey was drafting an exoneration statement for Clinton in April or May of 2016 leading the Senators to charge Comey came to a conclusion before any fact gathering. The President tweeting it looks like he exonerated the Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over and so much more, a rigged system.

President Obama's executive order was illegal and technically these kids are illegal but at the same time you don't punish the son for the sins of the father.

It's 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Texas and Louisiana are still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. You are looking at video of a fire that broke out at a chemical plant in Crosby, Texas, earlier tonight we are monitoring the situation and we are going to be bringing you updates throughout the hour. Back in Washington, President Trump is continuing his aggressive response to Hurricane Harvey just tonight asking Congress for $7.9 billion for Harvey recovery operations. Tomorrow, Mr. Trump travels to Texas and Louisiana to meet with victims and today, the president declared Sunday as a national day of prayer for Harvey victims. Mr. Trump is praising the response of the area's hardest hit by the storm."

      "utterance": "The people of Texas and Louisiana were hit very hard by a historic flood and their response they have taught us all a lesson, a very, very powerful lesson. There was no outbreak in crime. There was an outbreak of compassion only, real, beautiful strong compassion. And they really inspired us as a nation. To be honest, they've inspired the world because the world is watching."

      "utterance": "Jesse, this is a pretty typical scene in Orange, Texas. The house closest to the highway might have three or four feet of water damage. Further down you go to the neighbor, five or six feet. By the time you get to the end of the street, some of the houses are completely underwater. All day long we have been watching people pull things out from these soaked houses trying to save what they can out on the sidewalk you will see soaking wet couches, carpets, even dry wall. This brown stinking water seems to destroy almost everything it touches. This is tough work here to try and clean it up and emotional work as well. More than 37,000 houses have major structural damage from this hurricane. So, the cleanup effort is going to be huge and a lot of people still don't know how bad it is. We've seen people come to the edge of the water, point down the road and see that third telephone pole down there? That's my house. What you see there is nothing. Nothing but water. So, a lot of people have it very bad but they still don't know how bad yet. They can't get to their houses. There is 10 feet of water in the way. Jesse, back to you."

      "utterance": "Jesse, this town got a year's worth of rain in four days and Main Street remains underwater tonight. The Naches River, the peak of the river, the flood record which is 13 feet, today it crested at 21. So, eight feet above the previous record. This town could not have seen that coming and just like much like Southeast Texas, it is dealing with some horrific conditions here. Tonight, there is a curfew on effect, the power is out. Residents were lined up at a nearby store all day trying to get some basics, water, food, that sort of thing. And there are people behind me in neighborhoods that are basically islands at this point. There are some dry stretches of main street leading that way, but in between there are these massive areas that have been flooded. So earlier today, we went out with some relief workers, some volunteers and some members of the Harrison Fire Department from Northeast Texas and they had a high water vehicle, they're driving through the floods, towing a boat on a trailer, and they go through the dry areas through another flooded area to another dry area to get to another flooded area, that's the only way these boats could get in there that then send the boats in and pick up people, get their pets, bring them out, put them back on the track and then drive them back out again. They evacuated, the police chief told me 1200 to 1500 people. There are some people who didn't want to leave their homes are now wishing they did. Some of those people are now being rescued and the police chief tells me that they're moving from this recovery operation to a law enforcement operation. They have had some looting issues here. And they're dealing with those as they continue to hope that these waters recede a little bit quicker than they are so far -- Jesse."

They're trying to find a narrative that matches their grim world view because Harvey has destroyed their world view. There is no more division. There is no more bigotry, there is no more racism, conflict. All you are seeing 24/7 is unity Americans all the time working together. So, they go like, what can we do now, let's go after Trump. Because that might work. Just another note about what Harvey has done, one of the positive things offers a contrast to things like Twitter. Twitter encourages antagonism because it's not face-to-face interaction, so I can attack you and you because we never actually know each other. You can't find one example in a Harvey coverage of negative human interaction. You can't find one because it's face to face. It's human. There is nothing, there is no antagonism.

I don't think Trump plays a huge factor in this. He didn't have to because what you are seeing is it is so important in Texas. You are seeing victims not acting like victims after years of people embracing victimology who are not victims.

They're going say, wow, how about those neighbors who paddled a canoe through dangerous waters to their neighbor's house to rescue pets and children. They're going to talk about the people who risked their own lives, the individuals who risked their own lives to save others. That's what they're going to be talking about.

You look at the role churches opening their doors serving food and water, taking people in. You look at even corporate, big corporate giants like Wal-Mart donating $20 million. I think it was the Chamber of Commerce estimated that big corporations are donating $143 million. You look at the role the private sectors playing, the local communities are playing.

They had buses idling by, they couldn't evacuate. Superdome was a mess. The governor didn't even mobilize the National Guard and then after that failure the left said we need bigger government. What happened here? The response was excellent and the left still says, yes, this is why we need bigger government but it's not about bigger government. It's about who is running the government. Abbott, the Governor is doing a fantastic job because he is controlling things and Texas is lean and mean. So, it's not just about government. Though 90 percent of the people doing a lot of these rescues are local guys. Texans have a lot of trucks.

One of the things that we can't do is directing all the resource s that come from our taxes into one area. You can have some kind of decentralized help. Everybody is sending money to the Red Cross.

These new allegations by two Republican Senators months before finishing the investigation, the FBI Director decided in the spring of 2016 that Hillary Clinton should be exonerated before various witnesses were even interviewed including Clinton and top aides like Huma Abedin. That sparks a key question, is Comey now a credible witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller as his probe of Russian Meddling in the election and whether the president's firing of Comey was obstruction. The New York Times reporting tonight, Mueller has obtain a letter, the president and the top aide Stephen Miller drafted to justify Comey's firing. The top White House lawyer Dan Megyn blocked it. That may help Mueller figure out the original intent of the firing. The White House issued a separate letter drafted by the deputy Attorney General that talked about Comey mishandling the Clinton case that leads us to new information unearthed by Republicans, Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, FBI officials suggesting that Comey was drafting an exoneration statement for Clinton in April or May of 2016 leading the Senators to charge Comey came to a conclusion before any fact gathering. The President tweeting it looks like he exonerated the Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over and so much more, a rigged system. Now Remember Comey came out in July 2016 and said despite apparent wrong doing, Clinton would not be charged. So look at this exchange under oath in September of 2016."

I don't trust James Comey as far as I can throw him which is not far but you can look at things he has said that are not backed up by facts. He has repeatedly either given blatant lie or misleading statements he said he leaked the memo in response to the May 12 tweet, representing possible case. You go back to The New York Times article and it mirrors the memo he released allegedly four days later after that tweet. He testified that he didn't think his memos contained classified information. The Hill found more than half did. He said Trump's conversation made him nervous but Loretta Lynch instructed him to use the word matter instead of investigation. He didn't write memos about her so why not. He said The New York Times took the extraordinary step telling the intelligence committee that the Trump team was under investigation meanwhile we know behind the scenes he was telling President Trump he wasn't under investigation, so there are so many things he has said that are contradictory and seemingly a blatant lie."

Sanders who was a changed candidate could have very well have beaten Trump but instead, they rigged it so she got it. So there are two riggings going on.

This was something that people looked at and said what is happening to our immigration system. We are allowing these people in. Right or wrong that is part of the vision. I would like to ban the word dreamer, because we are all dreamers. I dream every day. I dream about cheeseburgers and espresso and flying on the back of a unicorn. I'm tired of other people being dreamers. The solution, being a law and order President is to amend the program so that you can stay as long as you have a clean slate. A good citizen with no busts no arrests that is, Trump ties this to law and order because he is a law and order President. He will win. He just got to do it that way, I think."

I would, instead of amending it myself as president through executive order, I would kick it back to congress and let congress deal with immigration. That is the role of congress. President Obama's executive order was illegal and technically these kids are illegal but at the same time you don't punish the son for the sins of the father. It's like charging a kid for like an accessory to a bank robbery, because the mom put the kid in the car, the getaway car it's just not fair. So, you know, sometimes you make decisions based on your heart and sometimes you make decisions based on your mind. I think the president obviously has been wrestling with this issue because it's very thorny for him. I believe he is going to make the right decision. This whole leaking that he might kill it is probably a pump fake to make everybody go one direction and he will come back and hopefully hold it in place."
