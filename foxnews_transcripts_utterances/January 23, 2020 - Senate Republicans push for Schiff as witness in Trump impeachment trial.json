So, when President Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, as well as the wild conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, those were absolutely interpreted by President Zelensky and his staff as a demand. And that is where the White House meeting enters into the equation. When Ukraine did not immediately cave to Rudy Giuliani in the spring and announced the phony investigations, President Trump ratcheted up the pressure as leverage. He chose the White House meeting, he dangled during his April 21st call, precisely because President Trump knew how important the meeting was to Ukraine. Following their visit to Kyiv for the new Ukrainian leader's inauguration, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, and Secretary Perry met with President Trump. And each of them encouraged the president to schedule the meeting. Here is what Ambassador Sondland had to say.",

JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: I think Sanders might be a little bit upset. He's had a nice bump in the polls since Senator Warren tried to kneecap him on that private conversation they had, so he's probably a little unhappy about this. But the problem, I think, is this has not only taken some of these candidates off the campaign trail, it's taken them off message. Impeachment is not something they've been talking about a lot on the campaign. They sense that it isn't resonating much with voters, so they're probably are not happy about that.

When Ukraine did not immediately cave to Rudy Giuliani in the spring and announced the phony investigations, President Trump ratcheted up the pressure as leverage. He chose the White House meeting, he dangled during his April 21st call, precisely because President Trump knew how important the meeting was to Ukraine.

To support this reformer, we asked the White House for two things. First, a working phone call between presidents Trump and Zelensky, and second, a working Oval Office visit. In our view, both were vital to cementing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. Demonstrating support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and advancing broader U.S. foreign policy interests."

And Jason Riley, Wall Street Journal columnist, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Matthew, they are making the case, each of the managers in a way that is kind of stitching together both the House and judiciary and Intel committee hearings using sound bites from that testimony in a pretty interesting way as they tell this story. It is the same story, but it's told different -- in different packaging."

And the question is -- behind all this, does the conduct that President Trump initiated rise to the level of an impeachable offense? And even though this story may be slickly produced, and well-told, at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to convince any Republicans. And part of the reason is, right now, we're in the part of the trial where the platform is entirely given to the prosecution. That will change over the weekend.

To me, at least, it's been clear that was wrong, to a lot of people it was wrong. What's so interesting here is that the Republicans as a matter of the case that Trump's team is making are not really being offered the option of saying it was wrong, but not impeachable. They're going to be told by the defense here, nothing wrong, nothing at all was wrong.

No one's arguing that the president cannot ask a foreign leader to investigate corruption. They're saying what's wrong here is that he did that with the intent of helping himself politically. The problem and the reason they may say nothing wrong, the Republicans, is because all presidents conduct foreign business with the next election, in line, Trump is not the first one to do it. We know President Obama did it with Russian officials that way to my election, give me more time, stop pushing back on this missile defense stuff, I'll have more flexibility. After the election, he was asking a foreign official to do him a political favor. So, this is regularly done. And for us to set a new standard here, where the president can be impeached for doing something he's allowed to do legally but did for political reasons, I think, is a very low standard, a dangerous standard."

The House prosecutors spent a good amount of time this afternoon saying there how there was absolutely no corruption involved between Hunter Biden and Burisma, that Joe Biden had no conflict of interest when he got the prosecutor with jurisdiction fired who was potentially looking into Hunter Biden and Burisma. So I think it was a very strange choice on their part, but it really highlighted that so much of the House's case turns on Hunter Biden, Burisma, and saying that there was no corruption there. So here's my bottom line -- if we call witnesses, I think the House has made it very clear we're going to have to call Hunter Biden, probably Joe Biden."

I think that you can certainly say that Mr. Schiff is acutely aware of when he is on primetime television. He referenced being on California TV a couple of times yesterday. It's become something of an open joke among the senators. So I think really at this point, I don't sense them actually trying to convince senators. I think they're playing to their own bases, their own audiences at home. And I think what Mr. Nadler said about the Senate being corrupt, about refusing to call their witnesses would be akin to a treacherous vote against United States, I think that that's the spin, they are heading there.

I think it's worth emphasizing he did that of his own accord. He wasn't asked to do that. He admonished the parties, inserted himself there, which is very unusual in any trial in appellate setting, extremely unusual here, and it was in direct response to Mr. Nadler talking about treachery on the floor of the United States Senate, saying that if senators voted against his amendments, they would be committing an act of treachery against the United States. I don't know if he meant to accuse us of treason or to accuse us of disloyalty, or what it was, but it was deeply inappropriate, and the chief justice was right to admonish them."

      "utterance": "So Bret, my take is the House managers have provided a mountain of evidence to support their charges. It's very clear that President Trump withheld vital military assistance to Ukraine and denied the Ukrainian president a coveted White House office to pressure the new president of Ukraine to open an investigation or announce an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden. The facts are crystal clear on that, and that is an abuse of power because he's using the office of the presidency that only he has in order to try to get the Ukrainian government to do something politically to help him in the 2020 election. That's the heart of --"

      "utterance": "I have not made up my mind. President Trump said he wanted to call witnesses. He mentioned back on December 3rd he wanted Mick Mulvaney to testify in the United States Senate trial. So do I. So if the president lawyers want to contest the facts that I just outlined that support this claim, then let's have them be sworn in under penalty of perjury like people testified in the House. The White House denied these key witnesses in the House. So if the president says he wants to call them, let's call them. Let's call John Bolton, who called this a drug deal, and all the information supports this characterization."

      "utterance": "When you hear Republicans say, listen, it's the House's job to be the grand jury. They should've waited, they should've fought the battle through the courts, they should have done it, that the pitch about urgency and then holding on to the articles for 33 days doesn't really line up. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "First of all, the House did act like a grand jury investigation, and when you get to trial you often have more evidence, information, and witnesses. That's exactly the point. And it is fair to wait to try to get an agreement from the Senate that the trial will be fair, like we hope most trials in America will be. So for example, just the other night I offered an amendment to say let's let the chief justice of the United States make the preliminary ruling on requests for witnesses and documents. The chief justice was nominated by a Republican president, he can call the balls and strikes. Let's let him decide on who is a relevant witness and what are relevant documents. Republicans all voted no. No one can argue that that's an impartial approach. That's the way we do it in courts every day across the country, the judge decides what comes into evidence. They said no."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "It is lining up to those big votes about witnesses and documents. The office he already had them, but falls in line after the initial arguments here. How much pressure do you think is on the four moderates that are under a focus on Republican side but also somebody like Doug Jones from Alabama who is a Democrat in a state that is obviously upside down as far as where it stands in impeaching and removing this president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "I hope the pressure will be on everybody to get to the truth, and the more witnesses that you have who are sworn in under penalty of perjury will have material evidence, right, who have relevant information to this case, and the documents, you would think that if people want to get to the truth, and whatever it is. You asked me earlier, what was my bottom line? I haven't gotten to see all the evidence because the White House has been blocking those witnesses and blocking those documents. And at the same time the president said he wants those witnesses to testify. So let's have it."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right, so when you hear the White House argument, and they say this is not impeachable, we shouldn't be here, then make the case about the constitutional aspect of this, and Dershowitz makes his case about how you need a crime on the Senate floor, you are open being swayed by the White House argument?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "Not that. That's a legal argument that says you need a statutory crime in order to impeach a president. That's a question of law. And that has been debunked by all the constitutional scholars, including, by the way, Jonathan Turley, who was the White House's witness, the Republican witness at the House hearing when it came to the question -- now, Dershowitz is a criminal lawyer. And as you've seen the tape, I'm sure, I don't know if you guys played it, but he had a very different view a couple years ago."

Whoever decades ago decided that senators should not have any sort of electronic devices on the floor of the Senate, that was a good idea because people aren't trying to sneak the next text or look at their emails. People are focused. I'm looking through all the information, I'm taking notes as we go on the relevant parts. I really hope, Bret, that if our goal is to get to the truth of what happened, and people can make up their own mind about whether or not that's an impeachable offense or not, that's an important question. But we should all be interested in getting all the relevant facts to make the ultimate decision. And that's why it is so important to call witnesses and documents, and that's why the overwhelming majority of the American people understand that's part of a fair trial."

Jason, state of the race right now as you look at how things are congealing with some of the senators stuck here in Washington. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: I think Sanders might be a little bit upset. He's had a nice bump in the polls since Senator Warren tried to kneecap him on that private conversation they had, so he's probably a little unhappy about this. But the problem, I think, is this has not only taken some of these candidates off the campaign trail, it's taken them off message. Impeachment is not something they've been talking about a lot on the campaign. They sense that it isn't resonating much with voters, so they're probably are not happy about that. Someone like Amy Klobuchar, though, who's really an Iowa or bust candidate, and not well-known, I think she's the one who is probably hurt the most by having to do this Senate trial."
