      "utterance": "Senseless I'm not sure is true here. This is a guy who went out not to shoot people. He went out to shoot Republicans. That was clear when he asked who these people were. It's a combination. First of all, you've got a guy who is living out of a car since March. So you know this is a man who is somewhat unhinged. Who knows? His life is falling apart, though he seems to have had sort of a normal adulthood, or at least he didn't have any signs of psychosis. Let me just contrast this the shooting of Gabby Giffords, which is the only analogous event."

      "utterance": "Right. She was shot. Within minutes, within hours, there was a meme showed up in the major newspapers and elsewhere that this was a result of the climate of hate, of violence perpetrated by Sarah Palin and other extreme Republicans. And they highlighted her website where she was \"targeting,\" quote-unquote, Democrat districts for winning in the next election and implying this was an invitation to shooting. The guy who did this, a guy called Loughner, was clearly psychotic from the first moment. He had a history of it. People who knew him had complained about his wild behavior. There wasn't a political idea in his head. That was pure psychosis. In this guy, you likely have a combination of somebody who is unhinged, falling apart, but clearly driven by a political purpose and one that, I would say, to echo the words that were used in the Giffords case, a climate of anti-Trump almost hysteria that has become the norm. I think this will help to pull people back and to realize that the kind of language, to celebrate, for example, the \"Julius Caesar\" in Central Park in which the Julius Caesar is clearly Donald Trump as some kind of great cultural achievement I think is really appalling. And this is part of all that. I'm not accusing anybody of doing anything, but if you're going to have a standard on this, let's not have a double standard on this."

      "utterance": "It's not as though this guy represents the extremes of the political debate. Obviously, as you say, a lot of people post extreme things, say extreme things, never commit violence. But the fact that our rhetoric generally has gotten so extreme I think encourages people who are unhinged to take action, who hear words that people mean as metaphors to be instructions, and end up doing things. And that's true in both these cases. I don't think Democrats are responsible for this guy. I don't think Republicans were responsible for the shooting of Gabby Giffords, but the climate does contribute to people who are not totally there, who are deranged to do things that are really unspeakable."

      "utterance": "I think there is real distinction between a psychotic like Loughner who had no political motive, who had an obsession with the congresswoman as a person, and somebody who acts, speaks about, is highly political, acts in the name of -- asks somebody, are these were Republicans or Democrats, and then shoots, who I'm sure is not a normal guy. Normal people don't shoot. But I think there's a big difference there, and that's why people ought to be very much more responsible with Trump derangement syndrome."

      "utterance": "It is usually temporary. Nancy Pelosi also said that she prays and hopes that President Trump is safe and his family is safe and for the success of his presidency. That is certainly a step in the right direction. Again, you can disagree on things but also be civil. But one thing I think that is worth mentioning is the uncivil environment that we are in is not just a result of congress. It's also a result of the larger narrative from the left and the right, and that is perpetuated in the media as well. And I think that conservatives, Republicans, Trump supporters, Tea Party supporters have been very, very frustrated over the last six or seven years because they have constantly been accused of fomenting this vitriolic environment, of fomenting violent rhetoric. And yet here we are today, and the actions of this gunman are his and his alone. However I think they are frustrated when there's a direct political connection to someone like Bernie Sanders. If this had been on the other side of the coin, I think they environment would have been much different."

We have to fight this Islamist terror. And in the end, nothing much happens. It's the same old story, and I just really think we hear all this but in the end nothing will really change. And one of the reasons is not just that politicians want to in the end win and attack their opponents. Social media, the way that people express their views these days enables the darkest and worst aspects of human nature to come to before. And I think we are going to see more of it unless we are prepared to really rein it in, which I don't think we are. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
