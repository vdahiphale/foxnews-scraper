      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Race clowns Rush in. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, liberals today think that Americans, especially white Americans, are pretty much the worst thing out there. In other words, anyone who doesn't sign on to the view that America is fundamentally racist and evil, expect them to be called a white supremacist, and then publicly vilified. For example, according to a new book, \"Biden assessed Fox News as one of the most destructive forces in the United States. And reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns write that, Biden was even more critical of Fox Corp patriarch Rupert Murdoch, telling an unnamed associate last year that Murdoch was the most dangerous man in the world.\" Think about that. Think about what that really means. More dangerous than Putin, more dangerous than Xi, more dangerous than Kim Jong-un. OK. And as the 'Angle' has told you many times, today's Democrat Party believes that conservatives are a far bigger threat to America than the most powerful dictators in the world. We warned you about this. And remember, more evil than the dictators who have nuclear weapons pointed at the United States. Well, and we were right. Now - but some people require more direct proof. Now, let's take the case of Andrew Sullivan. The supremely talented writer and well-known commentator who wrote the seminal book for gay marriage and is vehemently anti-Trump. Perhaps he thought that his withering criticism of Trump would have earned him fair treatment as a guest on a show hosted by the ever snarky Jon Stewart. But he was wrong. Instead for merely insisting that the story of America is not one of irredeemable evil, he was annihilated. Here's how it all started. Jon Stewart paying homage to the race gods of the BLM Movement. JON STEWART, HOST OF \"THE PROBLEM WITH JON STEWART\": The problem with white people. For however sincerely we want to reckon and listen, the truth is, America has always prioritized white comfort over black survival. Black people have had to fight so hard for equality that they've been irreparably set back in the pursuit of equity. And any real attempt to repair a ton of that damage, reparations, sets off white people's they're coming for our *** alarm.",

As if everything is already settled. We know this country is, for example, a white supremacy. Well, I don't believe that. I think it's possibly the most absurd hyperbole I've ever heard. I come from - I'm an immigrant. So I have a slightly different view of this. I can tell you, America, in 2022 is the most multiracial, multicultural, tolerant, diverse melting pot that has ever existed on planet Earth, and there is no other place on Earth even like it. That's why 86 percent of our immigrants are non-white.",

So if you refuse to buy into the allyship, don't you love that word, and the privilege lingo? If you refuse to say that you support reparations, you are as despicable as any slave holder from the early 1800s. That is what they believe. You think I'm exaggerating?

Now, this guy was so afraid of debating Andrew Sullivan one-on-one that he needed to have the whole situation be like a three against one. Then he tagged him as a white supremacist. And he's the same sneering prig, who 18 years ago, lectured the host of Crossfire on CNN about the need for more respectful, more informed discourse. Well, today, he's just another race activist, desperate for credibility in an America that, as Andrew said, is the most multicultural, multi-ethnic that it's ever been. He and almost the entire Democrat Party, radicalized by the fringes rail against the old pernicious practice of redlining, while they essentially hope to redline their political opponents. Instead of trying to win over America First populists or independents like Sullivan or someone, let's say, like a Glenn Greenwald. They try to destroy them, or make them so toxic that they can't even make a living in any mainstream setting. Again, these people see no logical inconsistency in the fact that the CCP is still active on Twitter, while Trump, maybe someone like Sullivan, is banned. In fact, they're fine with that. They have to ban Trump. They have to investigate him. They have to hope to prosecute him, put him in jail, anything. Anything but debate him, and try to defend their abysmally horrible record running our schools, our cities and the country. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Harmeet Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberty. Harmeet, great to see you tonight. Is there anything, first of all, that you want to own up to as yourself?

But like you say, in California, we're debating reparations in our state for the descendants of slaves. And that would affect me as a taxpayer, the daughter of a refugee from British partition and India. And so it makes no sense, Laura. But this is not a coherent framework in which to view American history. I think Andrew Sullivan was exactly right. The history of our country includes slavery, but it also includes well-meaning people of all different backgrounds coming together to eliminate that shame from our country. And it happened a long time ago. And so, Laura, though some of the people who are watching this, may be surprised to see this extreme example of race hucksterism and demagoguing white people, but it's actually been the case in America in corporations for a long time now. We've seen American corporations starting in Silicon Valley and to the boardrooms of New York and finance, explicitly shame and degrade white people and white men specifically, and then also Asians, because they are overrepresented in the population of successful corporations. And so people have silently nodded and had had to swallow this for a long time.

That's something that the president has stated over and over again since the campaign. No matter what happens in the Delaware grand jury, there's no question that what Hunter Biden did was wrong. He was engaged in influence-peddling, perhaps one of the largest influence-peddling schemes we've seen in Washington, which is considerably a long list of examples. But influence- peddling can be done legally, but it is corrupt. It is perhaps the most damaging form of corruption in Washington. This is how you influence influential people in Washington. You give money to their siblings, their spouses, their children. And that's what happened here. Now, the question is, is there more? Does this violate the criminal code? Clearly, the U.S. attorney's office thinks it might have. There's a long line of people still going into the grand jury. Now, the statement that this has nothing to do with the president simply ignores reality. The president is referred to in many of these e-mails. And while the press has agreed that the laptop is legitimate, they have really tried to avoid talking about what's on the laptop. And those e-mails refer to the president under code names like \"Celtic\" and \"the big guy.\" In one e-mail, a person is told not to use the president's name. But there are plenty of details there involving money that may have gone to the president to pay for expenses, an office that was allegedly being arranged for his use and the first lady's use. Those are all connections. But the biggest connection is that this was an influenced-peddling scheme, and he was the object. He was the reason people were giving millions to these various firms to his son. And so it's bizarre to claim that this was an influence-peddling scheme where the object was entirely irrelevant.",

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Race clowns Rush in. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, liberals today think that Americans, especially white Americans, are pretty much the worst thing out there. In other words, anyone who doesn't sign on to the view that America is fundamentally racist and evil, expect them to be called a white supremacist, and then publicly vilified. For example, according to a new book, \"Biden assessed Fox News as one of the most destructive forces in the United States. And reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns write that, Biden was even more critical of Fox Corp patriarch Rupert Murdoch, telling an unnamed associate last year that Murdoch was the most dangerous man in the world.\" Think about that. Think about what that really means. More dangerous than Putin, more dangerous than Xi, more dangerous than Kim Jong-un. OK. And as the 'Angle' has told you many times, today's Democrat Party believes that conservatives are a far bigger threat to America than the most powerful dictators in the world. We warned you about this. And remember, more evil than the dictators who have nuclear weapons pointed at the United States. Well, and we were right. Now - but some people require more direct proof. Now, let's take the case of Andrew Sullivan. The supremely talented writer and well-known commentator who wrote the seminal book for gay marriage and is vehemently anti-Trump. Perhaps he thought that his withering criticism of Trump would have earned him fair treatment as a guest on a show hosted by the ever snarky Jon Stewart. But he was wrong. Instead for merely insisting that the story of America is not one of irredeemable evil, he was annihilated. Here's how it all started. Jon Stewart paying homage to the race gods of the BLM Movement. JON STEWART, HOST OF \"THE PROBLEM WITH JON STEWART\": The problem with white people. For however sincerely we want to reckon and listen, the truth is, America has always prioritized white comfort over black survival. Black people have had to fight so hard for equality that they've been irreparably set back in the pursuit of equity. And any real attempt to repair a ton of that damage, reparations, sets off white people's they're coming for our *** alarm."

As if everything is already settled. We know this country is, for example, a white supremacy. Well, I don't believe that. I think it's possibly the most absurd hyperbole I've ever heard. I come from - I'm an immigrant. So I have a slightly different view of this. I can tell you, America, in 2022 is the most multiracial, multicultural, tolerant, diverse melting pot that has ever existed on planet Earth, and there is no other place on Earth even like it. That's why 86 percent of our immigrants are non-white."

Now, this guy was so afraid of debating Andrew Sullivan one-on-one that he needed to have the whole situation be like a three against one. Then he tagged him as a white supremacist. And he's the same sneering prig, who 18 years ago, lectured the host of Crossfire on CNN about the need for more respectful, more informed discourse. Well, today, he's just another race activist, desperate for credibility in an America that, as Andrew said, is the most multicultural, multi-ethnic that it's ever been. He and almost the entire Democrat Party, radicalized by the fringes rail against the old pernicious practice of redlining, while they essentially hope to redline their political opponents. Instead of trying to win over America First populists or independents like Sullivan or someone, let's say, like a Glenn Greenwald. They try to destroy them, or make them so toxic that they can't even make a living in any mainstream setting. Again, these people see no logical inconsistency in the fact that the CCP is still active on Twitter, while Trump, maybe someone like Sullivan, is banned. In fact, they're fine with that. They have to ban Trump. They have to investigate him. They have to hope to prosecute him, put him in jail, anything. Anything but debate him, and try to defend their abysmally horrible record running our schools, our cities and the country. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Harmeet Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberty. Harmeet, great to see you tonight. Is there anything, first of all, that you want to own up to as yourself? A first generation immigrant to the United States, so that Jon Stewart and other race clowns don't come after you, Harmeet. I know there's something you must have to say to the audience."

But like you say, in California, we're debating reparations in our state for the descendants of slaves. And that would affect me as a taxpayer, the daughter of a refugee from British partition and India. And so it makes no sense, Laura. But this is not a coherent framework in which to view American history. I think Andrew Sullivan was exactly right. The history of our country includes slavery, but it also includes well-meaning people of all different backgrounds coming together to eliminate that shame from our country. And it happened a long time ago. And so, Laura, though some of the people who are watching this, may be surprised to see this extreme example of race hucksterism and demagoguing white people, but it's actually been the case in America in corporations for a long time now. We've seen American corporations starting in Silicon Valley and to the boardrooms of New York and finance, explicitly shame and degrade white people and white men specifically, and then also Asians, because they are overrepresented in the population of successful corporations. And so people have silently nodded and had had to swallow this for a long time. That's why you see a whole audience of people clapping at an obviously absurd debate between four white people talking about racism in America."

It is because these race hucksters of no matter what their race is, are getting paid tons of money, be it Robin DiAngelo and her book White Fragility, which I first learned about during a lawsuit I filed against Google, to the this woman and her partner (inaudible), who charged white women $2,500 for dinner, to hear themselves shamed and degraded and humiliated. It's a new form of kink. And by the way, the only consumers of this are rich white people. So there's no amount of money that can legitimize this, Laura. And so it's really a spectacle.

You don't want any person who's a non-minority treated this way. And everyone's got to say, this is ridiculous, you must stop and we will not submit to this any longer. Harmeet, since I have you, I got to turn to the Supreme Court. Mitt Romney, big shock, joined two other Republicans today, Senators Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, to support judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination. Writing in a statement, \"Jackson's well-qualified. She more than meets the standard of excellence and integrity.\" Harmeet, nevertheless, the people of Utah know that Mitt Romney voted against her court of appeals appointment last year. So what changed? And isn't it pretty obvious that when it comes to the Second Amendment, religious liberty, she's going to be voting with Sotomayor and the left. And is that what Utah, Maine and Alaska really want? Bye-bye gun rights so they get their way."

It's truly shocking and a repudiation of the voters of Utah. And so he is up for election in 2024.

They have greater rights than American citizens."

I mean, is it - what's the point of having American citizenship, if indeed people who - the first decision they make is to violate our laws, get a free bus ticket. They get a monthly stipend. They get all sorts of help from Catholic Relief Services and Lutheran Services. And meanwhile, parents are trying to figure out how to be able to send their kids to school, and afford fuel and food these days. And I know you're also dealing with this surge of drop offs in Uvalde, which I read about just a few days ago. At 8am and 4pm, you guys are getting busloads of people dropped off from the border area. Tell me why that's happening, Mayor?"

News cameras came here to film it. They haven't been so - ready to drop them off here. But why it's happening, because there's so many people at the border. They're overwhelmed. The border patrol is - these agents are good, hard- working men. This administration is pulling them out of the field. They're having to go in and process these people, and they have no place to put them. So they want to send them to places like Uvalde, or Crystal City, or (ph) Crazy Springs. And we're not equipped to handle these people."

And this administration does nothing about it. I mean, I had to take money - the county judge and I had to take money from our citizens and hire buses to haul these people from Uvalde, because there's no public transportation here for them."

He's going to tell us what this means in November for the Democrats. Plus, Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain, claimed that none of Hunter Biden's transgressions involve the President. Jonathan Turley says, that ignores considerable evidence to the contrary. He's here to tell us why, next."

According to the RealClearPolitics average, just 27 percent of Americans think the country is headed in the right direction. Who are those 27? Like, Jeff Bezos maybe. He's made a lot of money. Joining me now is Newt Gingrich, Fox News contributor and former Speaker of the House. I'm also going to ask him about this new theory about Mitt Romney and what he might be up to leading into 2024, given his vote for Judge Jackson. Newt, before we get to that, the reaction to this entire deal with what Biden is trying to do with the country, the Democrats' plans, is to just go full steam ahead. There's no recognition that maybe it's time to tack to the middle, or work with Republicans on some of these issues, like the border that we just talked about. It's just full steam ahead on leftism."

They can - what they're doing, they think of is sort of divinely inspired by their own brains. They can't back off. They warned about this back in 1972, when he said that the liberal ideology had become a liberal theology. It's 1972. It's all gotten worse. It's all gotten sicker. Donald Trump was exactly right in Michigan the other day to point out that their position on transgender is virtually insane, that they would have children doing things that might be not reversible. They would have - they clearly placed transgender above women. They're destroying Title IX and women's sports. They have policies on the border, policies on inflation. (ph) Peter Basham of the Democracy Institute, just did a survey, in which he asked a question, which would do more to help America, Biden leaving office or Putin leaving office? And by 52 to 43, the American people said Biden leaving office was better for America's future than Putin leaving office. Now, I would think if you were a Democrat that number would be very, very sobering. But it doesn't seem to have any effect."

And there's a lot that Democrats can talk about in this upcoming midterms. I'm well aware that midterms are obviously always difficult for the party in power.

Why doesn't she go and talk to some of the women athletes who are currently seeing themselves being crowded out by transgender men, who clearly have unfair advantages.

She's going to be in trouble in Utah after this vote, given what it's going to mean perhaps for the Second Amendment, religious liberty, and the state of Utah, Alaska, Maine. But do you see someone like Mitt Romney, perhaps running as a third-party candidate, especially if President Trump is in the race to win it again in 2024? Because clearly, he's just possessed by Trump as so many of these people are. And like Liz Cheney seems to be--"

I think he's more likely to run for president than to run for reelection to the Senate. And it's a free country. I think he has every right to do what he thinks is best. But I think you clearly see Massachusetts' values in a Utah senator. And I think that that's probably not sustainable. He probably can't get reelected, when you got to come down to it. So he's probably better off to go out in a blaze of glory, running for the president one more time."

    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "First of all, one could take considerable umbrage at the statement that they're confident that he has done nothing wrong. That's something that the president has stated over and over again since the campaign. No matter what happens in the Delaware grand jury, there's no question that what Hunter Biden did was wrong. He was engaged in influence-peddling, perhaps one of the largest influence-peddling schemes we've seen in Washington, which is considerably a long list of examples. But influence- peddling can be done legally, but it is corrupt. It is perhaps the most damaging form of corruption in Washington. This is how you influence influential people in Washington. You give money to their siblings, their spouses, their children. And that's what happened here. Now, the question is, is there more? Does this violate the criminal code? Clearly, the U.S. attorney's office thinks it might have. There's a long line of people still going into the grand jury. Now, the statement that this has nothing to do with the president simply ignores reality. The president is referred to in many of these e-mails. And while the press has agreed that the laptop is legitimate, they have really tried to avoid talking about what's on the laptop. And those e-mails refer to the president under code names like \"Celtic\" and \"the big guy.\" In one e-mail, a person is told not to use the president's name. But there are plenty of details there involving money that may have gone to the president to pay for expenses, an office that was allegedly being arranged for his use and the first lady's use. Those are all connections. But the biggest connection is that this was an influenced-peddling scheme, and he was the object. He was the reason people were giving millions to these various firms to his son. And so it's bizarre to claim that this was an influence-peddling scheme where the object was entirely irrelevant."
