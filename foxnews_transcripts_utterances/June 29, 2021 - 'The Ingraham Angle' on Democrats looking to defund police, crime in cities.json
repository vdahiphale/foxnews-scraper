In other words, this committee will have free rein to harass and vilify Pelosi's own political opponents. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker and host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast; and Gregg Jarrett, Fox News legal analyst. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. Dinesh, this just shows that the Republicans who voted against the original January 6 commission were correct. This is just going to be used as a political cajole. And what is it that she needs to know anyway at this point? DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: I don't think that this can be seen as any kind of genuine investigation or impartial inquiry. I think what's happening is that the Democrats' narrative about January 6, which they began to put out as the event was occurring, this idea that it was a seditious had an attempt to overthrow the government, it was a riot, it was akin to 9/11, or the Oklahoma City bombing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So you've got all these statements made by Mayorkas, made by Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, made by Biden himself \"the worst violence since the Civil War\". And as we begin to learn more about January 6, one after another, these lies are beginning to collapse. The only - there was no people - there were no people in the Capitol who took weapons with them. The only shot fired was fired by a Capitol Hill police officer into the neck of a Trump supporter. And there were all these lies about Brian Sicknick. So they know this and so their narrative is falling apart. And I think this taskforce is intended to kind of try to shore up a collapsing building.",

But the message behind this, Judge, is that we're going to recognize and look at this as the moment our president turned his back on our country, because they're not standing against these cultural Marxists. He's actually allowing them to do what they have to do because he's afraid of him. So that's going to be the message out of this, and Americans will see this more and more that he's turning his backs on our nation. And this is a good example. By the way, if she does love our country, why doesn't she do something else?

BRANDON TATUM, \"BEATEN BALCK AND BLUE\" AUTHOR: Yes, absolutely. Out of control what they're doing. The dumbest people on planet Earth, the worst president in American history, we are seeing on display, talking about the Republicans being the ones that defund the police, they are the ones screaming defund the police, actually defunding the police in reality. And they hate the police. They kiss the rear end of criminals like George Floyd, not saying he deserved to die, but the guy wasn't Jesus Christ. And they sit here and they pump up all of these thugs that are getting killed by Police, in many cases, justifiably. And they want to say that they support the law enforcement officers. Well, your rhetoric and the way you talk is an example of why you don't support the law enforcement officers. And you can say that you're going to add to the budget, but we can see what you've been doing and is not acceptable when it comes to boosting the morale of law enforcement and changing the criminal behavior that is happening in our country."

Janine, New York City, New York State is a Democrat-run state. It's a city council. We have Mayor de Blasio, who is probably the worst mayor in American history.

And while crime runs rampant in the streets, the Democrats' focus is on targeting Trump supporters with a new January 6 committee. Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi unveiled legislation to create one that would have subpoena power and no fixed end date. In other words, this committee will have free rein to harass and vilify Pelosi's own political opponents. Here now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker and host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast; and Gregg Jarrett, Fox News legal analyst. All right. Dinesh, this just shows that the Republicans who voted against the original January 6 commission were correct. This is just going to be used as a political cajole. And what is it that she needs to know anyway at this point? DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: I don't think that this can be seen as any kind of genuine investigation or impartial inquiry. I think what's happening is that the Democrats' narrative about January 6, which they began to put out as the event was occurring, this idea that it was a seditious had an attempt to overthrow the government, it was a riot, it was akin to 9/11, or the Oklahoma City bombing. So you've got all these statements made by Mayorkas, made by Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, made by Biden himself \"the worst violence since the Civil War\". And as we begin to learn more about January 6, one after another, these lies are beginning to collapse. The only - there was no people - there were no people in the Capitol who took weapons with them. The only shot fired was fired by a Capitol Hill police officer into the neck of a Trump supporter. And there were all these lies about Brian Sicknick. So they know this and so their narrative is falling apart.

And as you point out, Janine, it's unnecessary. We all watched what happened on January 6. There's no great surprise there. People breach the Capitol, they committed crimes. They're being prosecuted as they should for that. So we're not going to find out anything terribly new here. And third, it's redundant. The House and Senate already investigated this. It was called Trump impeachment. Number two. But in Nancy Pelosi, his twisted mind, no dead horse will be left unbeaten when it comes to the great villain Donald Trump. And finally, we know what this is going to look like. It's going to be blather central. Yes. They'll call a few witnesses who will be lucky to get words in edgewise. Instead, the members of the committee will prance and preen in front of television cameras with over the top outrage over what happened on January 6. Please spare me the fake hysteria.

Hey, look, this guy used an obscenity.\" Very often, if you get a little bit of an enlarged picture of what happened, you see that that poor guy is getting tear gas thrown at him, so naturally he shouts something out. And so what's happening here is the government is editing the data that's being made available to the American people. So we don't need another slanted commission.

It's a very mild variant, whether you get the vaccine or not, patients will get some very mild symptoms like a cold. And they can be easily managed through it. If patients have severe symptoms or are at high risk, we can use simple drug combinations at home and get them through the illness. So there is no reason now at this point in time to push vaccination. We have over age 65, the highest risk group in the United States, we have 77 percent vaccinated.

So there's no need for masking in the general public. Each version, there's been fearmongering. I remember when the U.K. variant was coming, there was great fearmongering. That was a very mild variant. It wasn't a big deal in the United States. And at this point in time, the Delta will give us a small bump, but we're going to manage it very easily with medical therapy.

You wear the flag on your uniform, the National Anthem is played when you win metals, the flag is draped over you. If you have a problem with America, if you have a problem with the flag, then you shouldn't participate in the Olympics. It's that simple. She should be off the team."

They're going to grow up hating our country because they see their heroes hating our country. So yes, they're hurting an entire generation, particularly those folks who are at risk, the black community, who are learning through these kinds of people that this country is not for them. And that's the worst message you can give anyone in a country that gives so much freedom and opportunity."

And then you wonder, if people are so upset about this country, what have they done to make it better? Have they even voted? Have they voted in a school board meeting, in a local town council? Have they sat on a jury? Have they done any of the things that maybe could change America if it isn't what they think it should be? And I guess my last question to you, Jake, would be, in the future, should there be -- apparently the international Olympic team does not allow this, whereas this is not yet the international Olympics. Are you familiar with that?"

But I think you're exactly right also that I think people should have the proper perspective about how great this country is. If you served in uniform and seen what I've seen in places like Iraq, you have an immediate appreciation for how tremendous and magnificent this country truly is. And so I think if everyone had that perspective, they would think about things like disrespecting the flag a little bit differently."

Stay tuned to find out how and why this could force these universities to relent. That's next."

After Yale University informed Kendall Cote that she could not return to campus if she did not get the vaccine, she reached out to We the Patriots USA. Not only did that group help Kendall get a religious exemption, but they also helped her convince Yale to change its policy that restricted who could qualify for one. Joining me now is Kendall Cote, a nursing student at Yale University, and Cameron Atkinson, Kendall Cote's attorney. Kendall, you've achieved more than changing Yale's policy. You have showed students across the country that they can actually fight back against these vaccine mandates. How did you do it?"

It ended up being a ripple effect because they had a contract that they wanted me to sign, and I refused to sign it until I was guaranteed and out of not getting vaccinated. And because I would not sign that contract, they deactivated my badge on June 14th. So everything needed to be expedited before fall semester because I'm running through the summer semester in this program. And that's when WethePatriotsUSA.org connected me with Cam and Norm to have representation to get Yale back to off their discriminatory policy."

So they panicked then and went into an emergency board meeting to discuss it."

One, it could be against a private university such as Kendall's case here, in which case we have to look to public accommodations."
