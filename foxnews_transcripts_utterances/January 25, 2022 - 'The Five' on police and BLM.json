You have AOC, you know, she got sick partying down in South Beach. So there is part of the party that wants to live free. But there is going to be people that are bitter clingers, remember those, the bitter clingers, the dead-enders, and they are going to stay until there is only one more case count in the United States because, judge, it's given their life meaning. They like the structure. They like to submit. Before, maybe they didn't have a way to find meaning in their lives, but now they have a doctor and they have a ritual, they are, you know, Cuomo- sexuals. They worship Fauci. And maybe it's in place of religion. I don't know, but there is a part of a human desire to kind of want rules to follow and then be able to judge other people that don't follow those rules. Now, the media likes it too because the media, number one, it gives them ratings and number two, it lets them be the snobs that they naturally are. So, while they're telling people what to do, other people will, yes, they will follow those rules. They will wear the face shield while they wash their blueberries with gloves and that will never end. And that will never end. And you know, Pfizer's got the money train going.

And there are -- now there is a reluctance to return to normal. And you had what I wrote down was that there is this poll this week that said that people who are twice vaccinated and boosted are more worried about getting COVID right now than the unvaccinated are worried about getting COVID. Also you have this other dynamic though with parents. I think 2022 is going to be the year that the parents roar and you will see this across the country. We saw it in Virginia, a little bit in New Jersey. You're going to see it across the country. Sixty-five percent of parents said they were more worried about their kids missing school than they were about their kids getting COVID. Only 30 percent said they were worried that -- for that. We had this situation in New York where they wear masks for a month. This is supposed to -- it's supposed to end a week from now. Then the governor, she got thrown out and the court said last night, actually no. We're throwing that out. There's a stay and now we're going to -- it's a week more.

It's happening. Why rush it?

That's the rule, you follow the rule. You know, you -- the reason the disease is so worrisome is that it is infectious and you can give it to someone else that it's not you. In other words, you are making the choice not to be vaccinated, you give the disease to someone who has not made that choice, a kid under five years old for example.

Even as police were getting shot, you actually couldn't say anything. If you said blue lives matter or all lives matter, somehow that was an attack on BLM and you were racist. The media embrace the narrative that contributed to a nationwide Ferguson Effect, right, devaluing a police and ultimately a crime wave in the crumbling of cities run by liberals. So, what do you think of the smash and grabs, the random murders, the carjackings, the gang violence comes from? It was an acceptance of an idea that America was hopelessly corrupt, and therefore looting and arson were seen as justifiable behavior. That opened the doors to progressive nightmares like no cash bail, early release of violent felons, defunding the police, early retirement of cops. All of this came from the same mentality.

You started seeing the cracks though when Gayle King said she wanted to break the lock down and then run buck naked through Times Square. Then you have Maher coming out. You have AOC, you know, she got sick partying down in South Beach. So there is part of the party that wants to live free. But there is going to be people that are bitter clingers, remember those, the bitter clingers, the dead-enders, and they are going to stay until there is only one more case count in the United States because, judge, it's given their life meaning. They like the structure. They like to submit. Before, maybe they didn't have a way to find meaning in their lives, but now they have a doctor and they have a ritual, they are, you know, Cuomo- sexuals. They worship Fauci. And maybe it's in place of religion. I don't know, but there is a part of a human desire to kind of want rules to follow and then be able to judge other people that don't follow those rules. Now, the media likes it too because the media, number one, it gives them ratings and number two, it lets them be the snobs that they naturally are. So, while they're telling people what to do, other people will, yes, they will follow those rules. They will wear the face shield while they wash their blueberries with gloves and that will never end. And that will never end. And you know, Pfizer's got the money train going. These governors have the emergency powers. They're going to milk it for as long as possible."

So, I think that one of the reasons you see Biden's numbers where they are is there's a lot of things, but one of the big ones is he didn't crush the virus, but also there is a wariness because we are not returning to normal. And there are -- now there is a reluctance to return to normal. And you had what I wrote down was that there is this poll this week that said that people who are twice vaccinated and boosted are more worried about getting COVID right now than the unvaccinated are worried about getting COVID. Also you have this other dynamic though with parents. I think 2022 is going to be the year that the parents roar and you will see this across the country. We saw it in Virginia, a little bit in New Jersey. You're going to see it across the country. Sixty-five percent of parents said they were more worried about their kids missing school than they were about their kids getting COVID. Only 30 percent said they were worried that -- for that. We had this situation in New York where they wear masks for a month. This is supposed to -- it's supposed to end a week from now. Then the governor, she got thrown out and the court said last night, actually no. We're throwing that out. There's a stay and now we're going to -- it's a week more. And instead of just taking the win and being a leader, she said she wants to fight it in court."

But I am - - I like Bari Weiss. I like Bill Maher, but I'm with Whoopi Goldberg on this. How dare you be so flippant? I mean, as you know, I lost my beloved nephew Bobby Reid, 868,000 Americans have died. I mean, it's a number that you have to really gulp, 868,000 Americans have died. You know, it's -- it will come. It's happening. Why rush it? And in terms of those Virginia parents, they send their unvaccinated kid to a school that's requiring vaccinations, they have to get ready for that child to be isolated in the auditorium, because that's the rule and that -- and you're not -- you are exposing -- even if you think the risk is minuscule in your own heart. That's the rule, you follow the rule. You know, you -- the reason the disease is so worrisome is that it is infectious and you can give it to someone else that it's not you. In other words, you are making the choice not to be vaccinated, you give the disease to someone who has not made that choice, a kid under five years old for example. I think that just calm down, it's coming. Week, two weeks, a month, six m months, some people forever, look at the Japanese, that's okay, not me. But, you know, that's the way it is."

It's like the slow boiling water that a frog is placed and you don't know until entertainers and journalists and the radical we've known for years, Geraldo, starts sounding like the man starts embracing the side of enforcement. Start saying like we can't have any risk in our lives! It all has to be zero or you are evil! That's B.S., right? Right now, you got to be aware of wars that don't have endings. We saw that with Afghanistan. We saw that with the drug war. If you don't want to war without an end, it's up to the sentiment of the population to declare the war over. That means you stop wearing your mask. If you go to stores and you got to restaurants or any establishment and they ask you to wear your mask, you say you know what coming essay, you know what, I'm following the science and you leave. It's time for everybody, I'm not talking about me. I'm not talking about Don Lemon. I'm not talking about Whoopi. I'm talking about the Americans, the viewers, the general public. They have to civilly disobey an end this thing once and for all because the problem is the government is lying to you.

Of course it will. So, actually Biden was correct. It was a dumb question, but that's the best part about Fox News. We aren't CNN. We aren't wetting our shorts and calling this, you know, an attack on democracy or an insurrection. Every time Acosta acted like a stone tool and got CNN's cavalcade of Karens, you know, fretted about the coming reign of terror. The fact that we find this hilarious and that we can make fun of Peter Doocy says everything about how much fun this network is. But if it were Jim Acosta, they'd have to change Anderson Cooper's sheets. Carl Bernstein would say it's worse than Watergate.

And the bottom line is this, you've got all of these politicians who now come out and say, you know, we stand with the police and all this nonsense. They don't stand with the police because they were in favor of defunding, they were in favor of eliminating bail, releasing criminals and lowering criminal charges. And then all of a sudden because the winds kind of blown in favor of the police officers, they want to be, you know, out there with the group. Well, you know what, they ought to put their money where their mouth is. And the bottom line in this country is, until we start respecting cops, until we tell our children to respect cops, nothing is going to change because these politicians aren't going to change. They are activists, social justice warriors. I never knew what that meant, now I know what it means. You know, they talk about white privilege. This is criminal privilege. Criminals have all the privilege. And you've got Black Lives Matter, the organization, not the movement. I want to be really clear. If they care about what their title alleges, then they would want to be in the inner cities where most of the victims of crime are African- Americans and Brown children. That's why you got Eric Adams saying, I'm going to start really bringing in street crime units again, I'm going to start focusing on where these kids are. If you really care about black children, then get involved in mentoring, put some kind of after-school program in, give them an internship, make believe you care for the Black lives that are being lost.

Even as police were getting shot, you actually couldn't say anything. If you said blue lives matter or all lives matter, somehow that was an attack on BLM and you were racist. The media embrace the narrative that contributed to a nationwide Ferguson Effect, right, devaluing a police and ultimately a crime wave in the crumbling of cities run by liberals. So, what do you think of the smash and grabs, the random murders, the carjackings, the gang violence comes from? It was an acceptance of an idea that America was hopelessly corrupt, and therefore looting and arson were seen as justifiable behavior. That opened the doors to progressive nightmares like no cash bail, early release of violent felons, defunding the police, early retirement of cops. All of this came from the same mentality.

And then, we get all these statements from these like -- sounds like communist revolutionaries. And they say, oh, no, that was just a chapter that was unaffiliated with a national organization. That happened 10 times. You start thinking like, oh, my God, this isn't what they said it was. And I always look at these movements for their results. Where are the results? You didn't get police reform. You got a lot of property damage. You defund to the police it cost a lot of Black lives. And now, the brand has sunk to below 50 percent approval.

No, this is our country, 10 million people landlocked, been invaded a lot over the last 1000 years, and we want to control it comes in. We're not against immigrants. We just want to know who they are. And if you come here without permission, we're -- here's their whole immigration strategy. I watched it firsthand. They take the guys, they take their picture, they interview them, and then like 15 minutes later, they lead them outside the fence and let them back into Slovakia. And that's the whole thing, and it works. And that's kind of what they do in everything in Hungary. It's not a radical country. It's not a theocracy. It's a very sort of simple, sweet country with some problems like every country, but they just kind of tried to make it better. That's all they do.

And the Hungarian government is basically just said out loud, we don't like this. This is subverting democracy. These are non-citizens, they're not Hungarians trying to influence our internal political program. Again, that's what we would call this country an attack on democracy. The Biden administration supports it. They attack the Hungarian government because they don't want foreigners try to decide who gets elected there.

But his program for the past 15 years at least, has been to make the societies he focuses on more dangerous, dirtier, less democratic, more disorganized, more at war with themselves, less cohesive. In other words, it's a program of destruction aimed at the West. Now, I don't -- you know, I don't know what his motive is. I'm certainly not going to guess. People are complicated. He clearly is.

So, this is a country that tolerates dissent in a way that the United States doesn't. I mean, I talked to people who were opposed to the Orban government. You know, they were eating outside in restaurants. Again, there are people sitting on your set right now who can't do that in New York because someone would spit on them. So, like, the caricature -- it's not my job to defend Hungary, only to learn from it as an American and trying to hold up the lessons for us to emulate. But the idea that this is a police state or some theocracy or even like a right-wing country, that's like ridiculous. Ask anybody who spends -- you know, a lot of the movie business is now working out of Budapest because of tax breaks. Ask any of those guys, you know."
