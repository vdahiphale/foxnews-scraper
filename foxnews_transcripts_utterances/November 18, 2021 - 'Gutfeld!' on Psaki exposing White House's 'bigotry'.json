The long way for a butt joke. CNN had reported this growing infighting as an exclusive story, meaning it came from the White House. Now maybe CNN could have just made it up like the Russian collusion crap, but this story had too many integral facts coming from too many sources. Fact is if the White House wants a story out there, all it has to do is pick up Biden's Sports Illustrated football phone and it's on CNN faster than Stelter's pudgy fingers on a powdered donut. I'll take it. So when Psaki claims that some attacks on Harris are based on her identity, she's actually referring to the very criticism that came from the White House. Meaning Joe and his staff are having a problem with women of color. They're the white supremacist, huh? How does that feel, Joe? Heard about fair play after your Rittenhouse smear? Remember, Joe went to a funeral for a grand Cyclops which is not a person with a zit in the middle of their forehead. It's the title of a higher up in the KKK, as in Democrat Robert Byrd. He probably didn't even check his watch during that funeral. Joe also made fun of Indians before observing that they only work in 7-Elevens, remember that? So Jen has to be talking about Joe but it's hard to tell since Jen unloads more crap than Joe Biden after three bowls of All-Bran. I know. That's another poop reference. Was that too much, Phyllis?",

As if there's on a Do Not Disturb list. Remember when SNL forced poor Fred Armisen to impersonate Obama, and they made him so incredibly boring, so as not to offend anyone. It's really the worst insult. We don't think you can take the criticism, which allows some of the biggest crooks to get away with anything. Hell, some can even marry their brother. I don't know who I'm talking about. So it comes down to this. When in trouble, smear the others. When in doubt, call the bigots out. Call them racist, call them sexist but never call for the truth. It's a difference between this White House and the previous one. Who did Trump go after? The media, China, the NBA, the NFL, Democrats and Republicans, celebrities. He punched up not down. He didn't single out citizens or voters. Here the White House sees you, the individual as the problem. And they see group identity as its protection. It's a racket.

The long way for a butt joke. CNN had reported this growing infighting as an exclusive story, meaning it came from the White House. Now maybe CNN could have just made it up like the Russian collusion crap, but this story had too many integral facts coming from too many sources. Fact is if the White House wants a story out there, all it has to do is pick up Biden's Sports Illustrated football phone and it's on CNN faster than Stelter's pudgy fingers on a powdered donut. I'll take it. So when Psaki claims that some attacks on Harris are based on her identity, she's actually referring to the very criticism that came from the White House. Meaning Joe and his staff are having a problem with women of color. They're the white supremacist, huh? How does that feel, Joe? Heard about fair play after your Rittenhouse smear? Remember, Joe went to a funeral for a grand Cyclops which is not a person with a zit in the middle of their forehead. It's the title of a higher up in the KKK, as in Democrat Robert Byrd. He probably didn't even check his watch during that funeral. Joe also made fun of Indians before observing that they only work in 7-Elevens, remember that? So Jen has to be talking about Joe but it's hard to tell since Jen unloads more crap than Joe Biden after three bowls of All-Bran. I know. That's another poop reference. Was that too much, Phyllis?"

A coal miner could finish a 10-hour workday covered at sun and they'd call him out for blackface.

We tried to talk Harris Faulkner into it, but she said dinner at Fuddruckers wasn't enough. That is you can impersonate anyone except the protected classes designated by the legacy media. As if there's on a Do Not Disturb list. Remember when SNL forced poor Fred Armisen to impersonate Obama, and they made him so incredibly boring, so as not to offend anyone. It's really the worst insult. We don't think you can take the criticism, which allows some of the biggest crooks to get away with anything. Hell, some can even marry their brother. I don't know who I'm talking about. So it comes down to this. When in trouble, smear the others. When in doubt, call the bigots out. Call them racist, call them sexist but never call for the truth. It's a difference between this White House and the previous one. Who did Trump go after? The media, China, the NBA, the NFL, Democrats and Republicans, celebrities. He punched up not down. He didn't single out citizens or voters. Here the White House sees you, the individual as the problem. And they see group identity as its protection. It's a racket.

One of them passed the House last month, 424 to 3. So, we're the three dopes who voted against it? You have AOC, Rashida Tlaib, and Cori Bush. You wonder what their reasoning for their vote was, maybe they thought the money should be spent elsewhere. Flashy gala dresses, maybe? Who knows? But the fact is, they can vote against cops because they don't need to worry about security. They have their own arm detail and laugh in the face of danger like these guys. So, that's where those little, little fellas went. I turned my back for one moment and they slip right out, the door. Matt, OK, are we supposed to be - - are we supposed to be thankful to Joe, for -- to Joe Biden for trying to solve the problem that he started by not saying anything during the riots last year sitting on his hands, and now we're -- oh, finally."

But you know, we -- I have such a high amount of respect and admiration for the men and women of law enforcement for first responders. They do the hard work, they're there, they're running to the sound of guns while everyone's running away. We can't do enough. The challenge though, is we can't federalize local law enforcement either. We need to support the families, obviously, when officers are injured or killed in the line of duty.

Because how do you say to communities in in criminals that, oh, you can no longer just wheel out carts full of beer now. That policy has changed. So, this this idea that you can just decide what in society we're going to obey and we're not. It's not going to work. They've empowered the criminals. They've they did worse than defund the cops.

Now, that may seem kind of low especially for, you know, you know who. But it was enough to make the entire area smell like beer which led to the water getting tested in the first place.
