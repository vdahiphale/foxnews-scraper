The middle class is still shrinking. Housing prices in our cities are crushing an entire generation of ambitious young people. China's economy is about to overtake ours. So that's all the bad news right there.  But have no fear. Here's the good news. Washington is on it. Your representatives in the capital city -- this city -- just spent their third day in a row yelling at each other about a phone call Donald Trump once made to some guy in Ukraine.  In other words, the impeachment trial of the President rolls on tonight and if nothing else, that means that amateur thespian and full time Congressman Adam Schiff gets to try out new parts for the camera.  Yesterday, you'll remember, Schiff played the role of wartime general rallying the country in the face of an imminent military invasion.

By the end, he had accused 16 million Americans of colluding with Vladimir Putin simply by the act of voting for Donald Trump. It was a conspiracy that profound. Except it wasn't, and that's the remarkable part. Schiff was wrong. None of this ever happened. And we now know that conclusively, so is Schiff punished for this? Driven from polite society for falsely impugning the integrity of millions of Americans with lies -- which he did. No, he wasn't. He just got more famous and more revered on MSNBC.

Schiff seems happy, and why wouldn't he be? He got it all completely wrong, but he wasn't punished -- just the opposite. He was rewarded. That's how Washington really works.

Obama put hundreds and from all this, don't forget, you also had people that were on the National Security staff that that went over to Adam Schiff's staff, okay, that knew the whistleblower. Vindman, the guy, you know, he served his country. That's great. He wants to be called Lieutenant Colonel. That's fine. His brother is also there as a lawyer. So all of these people colluded and coordinated with the whistleblower. They coordinated with Adam Schiff's staff. So, you know, really what you had there is you had a den of thieves there at the National Security Council. Look, I have said this over and over and over again. I said this to McMaster, I said it to Bolton, and I've said it to the new National Security adviser, O'Brien that they just need to get all of those people out of there.

Well, if we were in China right now, I think we should really be worried because the Chinese government is locking down five cities, as you mentioned that began with exotic animals in a market, and these animals, by the way, harbor this virus, and they pass from one species to another, and then humans get infected occasionally. Here's the problem. It's now spreading from human to human, and we don't know how many cases there are. And I frankly, don't believe that it's only 600 cases. I'm suspicious. I think it's many more cases than that, and many more deaths than that. And that's the problem. It is going on in China. So that's one reason that I would really urge people not to travel to China right now until we figure this out. Here's the billion dollar question, Tucker. Exactly how contagious is this from human to human? Now over here in the United States, I'm much less worried because as you said, we have one, possibly two cases. We have the Centers for Disease Control and several other agencies on the job, monitoring these cases, isolating them, making sure they're not coming in contact with other people. But there's another problem, which is you can spread this virus without knowing it. It's a week to two weeks before you start to develop symptoms. So even screening in airports has limitations, especially in flu seasons. You know, you screen for a fever or you screen for a rapid heart rate, that can be anything and there's a lot more flu out there than there is this. If we look back in history, to the early part of this century, when you and I were discussing this in one of the best interviews I ever had, by the way, we talked about SARS, which was a very similar coronavirus.",

You don't make $60 billion by being a moron. But then the consultants got to him and they flattered him. They appealed to his vanity, which is considerable, and Bloomberg decided to go ahead and do it and humiliate himself in the exact way he said he would have to. So back when he was Mayor of New York, one of his biggest accomplishments was building what Mayor Rudy Giuliani did, reducing crime rates. Bloomberg took a city that was already safer than most American cities and he made it one of the safest major cities on Planet Earth. One reason he was able to do that was his stop and frisk policy and that policy took thousands of illegal guns, the guns, he's always talking about, illegal guns. He actually took them off the streets along with dangerous criminals. And that saved lives, particularly the lives of young black men who are the most frequent victims of violent crime. Now, that's a legacy. Who else has done that? Has Amy Klobuchar done that? No. Bloomberg did. He could be running on that. But no, the current Democratic Party requires candidates to side with criminals over normal people. So Bloomberg abandoned his old faith for his new faith. Watch.",

POLITICO watched it and called it a bid for African-American support. Right? People are not so easily fooled. Maybe you should call Beto O'Rourke to find out how well that works. It shouldn't be hard to reach him because our O'Rourke isn't too busy these days. As Bloomberg campaign has continued, it has only become more cringe worthy, increasingly embarrassing. Like a middle schooler with low self-esteem and rich parents, he is set to try to buy his popularity. So staffers for other campaigns take low salaries, live in motels to support a candidate they actually believe in. Not Bloomberg. Bloomberg's campaign poaches staff with goodies. Even at the state level, people who work for Mike Bloomberg for President -- there's a short lived job -- can earn $12,000.00 a month. Every staffer gets a free iPhone 11 and a MacBook Pro on their very first day. They're fed three catered meals. Shockingly, all the gifts, the apologies, the self-abasement, none of them is working. All it's doing is embarrassing him. Like Richie Rich, Michael Bloomberg still has to learn that while money can buy influence, it can buy power, it cannot even now buy democracy. He is polling in the single digits and it has been since the First day of his campaign, because in the end, there is a God. He missed out on the last Democratic debate for the Iowa caucuses. In a desperate bid for attention, his campaign's Twitter account, spent the evening comparing Bloomberg's appearance to a meatball and posting bizarre statements designed to get your attention like Mike can telepathically communicate with dolphins and Mike can fit nine D batteries in his mouth at one time. Yes, okay, show us. Because he can't even do that. Imagine if instead on running on all the mistakes he made, running away from them, committing -- you know, admitting to all the sins like being born, Bloomberg actually ran unapologetically on the things he's really done, like built a massive company, like made New York better. He still might not win. The Democratic Party is pretty broken, but at least he would live out his final years on Earth with dignity, and he won't have that in the end. Well, President Trump's trial is not the only thing going on right now. Harvey Weinstein is also on trial in New York City. The testimony there has not helped Hillary Clinton or her claim that she knew nothing about Weinstein's behavior. An amazing moment that we don't want you to miss.

Weinstein's behavior may have been exposed far earlier if it wasn't for the protection he received from many powerful friends. One of those friends -- this is beyond dispute -- was Hillary Clinton. That came out in court by the way when Lance Maerov, a Board member at The Weinstein Company is maybe the only one who knew from the beginning that Weinstein was a bad actor, said that Weinstein often bragged about his closeness to the Clintons. And yet Hillary Clinton claims total ignorance of this. She had no idea -- no idea -- what Weinstein was doing. And again, the trial testimony indicates she and her husband, Bill or certainly, her husband Bill spoke to Weinstein every other day on the phone.

Senator Jim Risch of Idaho though was not impressed. He felt dead asleep the other day, and he probably wasn't the only one to do it.  If it weren't for the fact that most senators can nap with their eyes open, it would be clear at the whole chamber has been unconscious since Monday, and can you blame him for that? It's interminable. And yet, on cable news, it's like Christmas. America's newsrooms maybe the last place in the English speaking world where Adam Schiff is still considered impressive.

By the end, he had accused 16 million Americans of colluding with Vladimir Putin simply by the act of voting for Donald Trump. It was a conspiracy that profound. Except it wasn't, and that's the remarkable part. Schiff was wrong. None of this ever happened. And we now know that conclusively, so is Schiff punished for this? Driven from polite society for falsely impugning the integrity of millions of Americans with lies -- which he did. No, he wasn't. He just got more famous and more revered on MSNBC. You can find him most weekdays now having lunch in the best restaurants in the city right across from the guys who planned the Iraq War and got rich from securitizing subprime mortgages.

Keep that in mind as you watch Adams Schiff strut around the Senate this week, playing whatever character he's chosen that day. This is the guy making the big decisions. This is the guy they admire.

Mr. Vindman has been offered three times. Pretty remarkable. But here's something even more remarkable. This show has learned that even after saying what you just saw, even after testifying against his boss, the President; even after admitting a foreign power keeps trying to recruit him -- speaking of recruitment by foreign powers -- Mr. Vindman is still serving on the White House National Security Council right now. Hard to believe that, but apparently it's true. He's not alone either. Jennifer Williams is a Mike Pence aide who also testified in the same vein. She's still on her job, too. Congressman Devin Nunes represents the State of California. He was elected, unlike the people you just saw. He joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. This is a small thing, but it represents something much larger, I think, you know, it's not our job to go after Mr. Vindman, but how could someone like that keep his job at the National Security Council?"

      "utterance": "Well, there's a lot of problems with the National Security Council and the Trump administration is trying to get it under control. The new National Security adviser is doing what the previous National Security advisers under Trump didn't do, and that is to try to reduce the size and scope. So there's hundreds and hundreds of people over at the National Security Council which, look, I've never been on the National Security Council, but if you go back 20 to 30 years ago during the Reagan days, I'm told that, you know, you had a couple dozen people, maybe three, maybe four dozen people total that were on the National Security Council. Obama put hundreds and from all this, don't forget, you also had people that were on the National Security staff that that went over to Adam Schiff's staff, okay, that knew the whistleblower. Vindman, the guy, you know, he served his country. That's great. He wants to be called Lieutenant Colonel. That's fine. His brother is also there as a lawyer. So all of these people colluded and coordinated with the whistleblower. They coordinated with Adam Schiff's staff. So, you know, really what you had there is you had a den of thieves there at the National Security Council. Look, I have said this over and over and over again. I said this to McMaster, I said it to Bolton, and I've said it to the new National Security adviser, O'Brien that they just need to get all of those people out of there. Like if you were there and worked for Obama and you were a holdover, just, you know, get a used building somewhere on the other side of the Potomac, just get them out of there. They have done so much damage to this presidency, I couldn't agree with you more."

It looks like nothing. Remember, this is a man who has accused -- Adam Schiff is accused -- and Pelosi -- the leaders of the Democratic Party have accused me of being a Russian asset; Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic candidate of being a Russian asset. The Senate Majority Leader of being a Russian asset, of Donald Trump of being a Russian asset. I think he even accused you of being a Russian asset at one point in time. So this --"

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Well, simply this. President Obama believes that Bernie Sanders is both unelectable in the General Election and he is a bridge too far. I mean, if you think about it, President Obama was a very progressive President, but he did put together a coalition of blue collar whites, African-Americans, women, it was -- he did not socialize the banking system. Remember, a lot of people were calling for nationalization of the banking system? He continued the bush bailouts. He did not socialize medicine. He created a new mandate - Obamacare. He took a lot of flak from the Bernie Sanders' wing of the party because of that. Now, he is sitting there and he's saying, whoa, we have a candidate who is literally saying we should give away free stuff. He's not telling us how to pay for it. The far left likes him, but he is basically unelectable. Now, my sources are people, you should know that spoke directly with President Obama. They are Democrats. They are people that work on Wall Street often. They are much more moderate than you would say, a Bernie Sanders supporter, but I will say this, Tucker. People talk a lot about all of the fraying fractures in the Republican Party, the conservative movement, what we have right now, and you know, President Obama might not come out and do anything."

But this is my life that we're talking about here. You know, for me as a soldier, as every service member does, I took an oath of loyalty to our country, the country that I love, willing to put my life on the line for our country deploying twice to the Middle East to do so, still serving in uniform in the Army National Guard today now for almost 17 years. The essence of this service, this love of country is who I am. So when you have someone as powerful as Hillary Clinton, seeking to smear my reputation, essentially implying that I'm a traitor to the country that I love, what she essentially is doing is taking my life away. So what this lawsuit is about is actually valuing the honor and the loyalty and integrity that every one of our service members embodies and saying that no one can try to defame them, we will not allow that to go unchecked."

We need a Commander-in-Chief who will work to end this new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and redirect our taxpayer dollars towards really serving the needs of people here at home.

      "utterance": "Hi, Tucker. How worried should we be? Well, if we were in China right now, I think we should really be worried because the Chinese government is locking down five cities, as you mentioned that began with exotic animals in a market, and these animals, by the way, harbor this virus, and they pass from one species to another, and then humans get infected occasionally. Here's the problem. It's now spreading from human to human, and we don't know how many cases there are. And I frankly, don't believe that it's only 600 cases. I'm suspicious. I think it's many more cases than that, and many more deaths than that. And that's the problem. It is going on in China. So that's one reason that I would really urge people not to travel to China right now until we figure this out. Here's the billion dollar question, Tucker. Exactly how contagious is this from human to human? Now over here in the United States, I'm much less worried because as you said, we have one, possibly two cases. We have the Centers for Disease Control and several other agencies on the job, monitoring these cases, isolating them, making sure they're not coming in contact with other people. But there's another problem, which is you can spread this virus without knowing it. It's a week to two weeks before you start to develop symptoms. So even screening in airports has limitations, especially in flu seasons. You know, you screen for a fever or you screen for a rapid heart rate, that can be anything and there's a lot more flu out there than there is this. If we look back in history, to the early part of this century, when you and I were discussing this in one of the best interviews I ever had, by the way, we talked about SARS, which was a very similar coronavirus."

      "utterance": "And we said at the time, look, we're worried about this. We're concerned about it. But we still don't know how contagious it is and public health measures helped to contain that. And right now, I'm optimistic that we can contain this in the United States. We still don't know though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I mean, this is not the first virus we've seen in China specifically jump from an animals to humans and you've got to believe it. I know we have to pretend all cultures are the same and all behaviors are the same, but it's not, and mistreating animals, eating koalas and snakes and bats and dogs, which is common apparently, in this city, Wuhan, that's the reason that we have this, correct? Caging animals too close together, mistreating them, eating them alive. I mean, why shouldn't we say something about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "That's an extremely important scientific point, and you left out bamboo rats and badgers. But bats are often the reservoir for this, and we're literally talking about a culture where people and animals are living right on top of each other. And as you mentioned, people are eating exotic animals that are not fully cooked, and that's how it spreads to humans in the first place. Most of the time it ends there. Occasionally, it doesn't and this coronavirus is of the same family of as I mentioned, some more severe viruses that have a fairly high death rate, can cause pneumonia. We've got to contain and isolate this, and I think you're absolutely right that it starts with the culture over there."

      "utterance": "So Michael Bloomberg is running for President. He is worth about $60 billion. That's enough to make him one of the 10 richest people on Planet Earth. He spent more than a decade as the Mayor of New York City, the biggest city in this country, and overall, most people who live there would believe he did a pretty good job. So even in politics, he has distinguished himself as a savvy operator. He's personally bankrolled a 50-state effort to roll back our gun rights, and it's been pretty effective. So by his measurements, you think he'd have nothing left to prove, but suddenly, at 77, he has decided to get in to the race, and by so doing, humiliate himself. Less than a year ago in March of 2019, Bloomberg said he was not interested in becoming President or running for it, because it would force him to apologize for all of his achievements, and even apologize for who he is. Here's what he said."

      "speaker": "MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY",
      "utterance": "It's just not going to happen on a national level for somebody like me starting where I am, unless I was willing to change all my views and go on what CNN called an apology tour."

    {
      "speaker": "BLOOMBERG",
      "utterance": "Joe Biden went out and apologized for being male, over 50, white. Beto, whatever his name is, he has apologized for being born."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So everything you just heard in that clip is true, and there were very good reasons for Mike Bloomberg not to run for President this year. He must still know that. You don't make $60 billion by being a moron. But then the consultants got to him and they flattered him. They appealed to his vanity, which is considerable, and Bloomberg decided to go ahead and do it and humiliate himself in the exact way he said he would have to. So back when he was Mayor of New York, one of his biggest accomplishments was building what Mayor Rudy Giuliani did, reducing crime rates. Bloomberg took a city that was already safer than most American cities and he made it one of the safest major cities on Planet Earth. One reason he was able to do that was his stop and frisk policy and that policy took thousands of illegal guns, the guns, he's always talking about, illegal guns. He actually took them off the streets along with dangerous criminals. And that saved lives, particularly the lives of young black men who are the most frequent victims of violent crime. Now, that's a legacy. Who else has done that? Has Amy Klobuchar done that? No. Bloomberg did. He could be running on that. But no, the current Democratic Party requires candidates to side with criminals over normal people. So Bloomberg abandoned his old faith for his new faith. Watch."

    {
      "speaker": "BLOOMBERG",
      "utterance": "I got something important really wrong. I didn't understand that back then, the full impact that stops were having on the black and Latino communities. I was totally focused on saving lives. But as we know, good intentions aren't good enough. I was wrong, and I'm sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "There's something poignant about watching 77-year-old billionaires get woke. Also, something amusing about it. Sorry for saving all of those lives. My bad. Would you please vote for me now? That's what he is saying. Those were the words he was reading written by some 28-year-old Wesleyan grad who works for him. But Bloomberg didn't stop there. Last year, he was mocking Beto O'Rourke for going on \"The View\" and apologizing for his skin color, and he was right to mock him. You shouldn't apologize for something you can't control. But now just last weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bloomberg did exactly the same thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLOOMBERG",
      "utterance": "As someone who has been very lucky in life, I often say my story would only have been possible in America and I think that's true. But I also know that my story would have turned out very differently if I have been black, and that more black Americans in my generation would have ended up with far more wealth had they been white."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "How much would you pay for the internal dialogue going on in Mike Bloomberg's head as he said that? What was he really thinking as he reads those words? We will never know. POLITICO watched it and called it a bid for African-American support. Right? People are not so easily fooled. Maybe you should call Beto O'Rourke to find out how well that works. It shouldn't be hard to reach him because our O'Rourke isn't too busy these days. As Bloomberg campaign has continued, it has only become more cringe worthy, increasingly embarrassing. Like a middle schooler with low self-esteem and rich parents, he is set to try to buy his popularity. So staffers for other campaigns take low salaries, live in motels to support a candidate they actually believe in. Not Bloomberg. Bloomberg's campaign poaches staff with goodies. Even at the state level, people who work for Mike Bloomberg for President -- there's a short lived job -- can earn $12,000.00 a month. Every staffer gets a free iPhone 11 and a MacBook Pro on their very first day. They're fed three catered meals. Shockingly, all the gifts, the apologies, the self-abasement, none of them is working. All it's doing is embarrassing him. Like Richie Rich, Michael Bloomberg still has to learn that while money can buy influence, it can buy power, it cannot even now buy democracy. He is polling in the single digits and it has been since the First day of his campaign, because in the end, there is a God. He missed out on the last Democratic debate for the Iowa caucuses. In a desperate bid for attention, his campaign's Twitter account, spent the evening comparing Bloomberg's appearance to a meatball and posting bizarre statements designed to get your attention like Mike can telepathically communicate with dolphins and Mike can fit nine D batteries in his mouth at one time. Yes, okay, show us. Because he can't even do that. Imagine if instead on running on all the mistakes he made, running away from them, committing -- you know, admitting to all the sins like being born, Bloomberg actually ran unapologetically on the things he's really done, like built a massive company, like made New York better. He still might not win. The Democratic Party is pretty broken, but at least he would live out his final years on Earth with dignity, and he won't have that in the end. Well, President Trump's trial is not the only thing going on right now. Harvey Weinstein is also on trial in New York City. The testimony there has not helped Hillary Clinton or her claim that she knew nothing about Weinstein's behavior. An amazing moment that we don't want you to miss. Of course, you're still keeping an eye on the Senate for any breaking news there. Stay tuned, we'll tell you, if they do."

We've been watching that trial all week and of course, we will continue to do it. If anything happens, you'll learn about it right here right away. But there's other trials going on, including Harvey Weinstein's trial in New York at this moment, it's underway. Weinstein's behavior may have been exposed far earlier if it wasn't for the protection he received from many powerful friends. One of those friends -- this is beyond dispute -- was Hillary Clinton. That came out in court by the way when Lance Maerov, a Board member at The Weinstein Company is maybe the only one who knew from the beginning that Weinstein was a bad actor, said that Weinstein often bragged about his closeness to the Clintons. And yet Hillary Clinton claims total ignorance of this. She had no idea -- no idea -- what Weinstein was doing. And again, the trial testimony indicates she and her husband, Bill or certainly, her husband Bill spoke to Weinstein every other day on the phone. Geraldo Rivera knows pretty much everyone in this story. He is Fox's roving correspondent-at-large and he joins us tonight. So, Geraldo, you've been around a long time, you know, everybody."

It was not the second sentence, Tucker that he brought up Bill Clinton, thanking me for my work in helping, you know, the President then beat impeachment you know, that time around. He was very complimentary. He said, way to go, well fought, and made it very clear that he took it as a personal, you know, compliment to him, a favor to him that I had been so strong on the President's behalf. There's no doubt -- I don't know if the Clintons carried him in high regard. I never asked them about Harvey Weinstein. But there was no doubt that Harvey Weinstein thought that he was close to the Clintons and took it personally that I had assisted President Bill Clinton in defeating the forces of impeachment back then."

I didn't really know him, but everyone in the company knew that he was a pig. I mean, everybody knew that. He used to light a cigarette in the elevator with people in it, like everybody knew Harvey Weinstein is a pig. Could the Clintons not have known? How could have they not known that?"

Here in New York was the world's largest Willowbrook, over 5,000 people in horrible conditions. I busted in with my camera, exposed it all for the first time.
