Putin's invasion of Ukraine taking the most terrifying turn yet after Russian forces took control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant during a middle of a attack on night. The facility was damaged but regulators are reporting that radiation levels appear to be normal. Putin now has control of one quarter of Ukraine's power supply and can pull the plug any time at once. And workers at the plant who are being held at gunpoint are warning that Russia could use it to blackmail all of Europe. To the east, the city of Kharkiv continues to be pounded by Russian shellings, and then in the north, Putin's convoy of tanks and armored vehicles inches closer to Ukraine's capital.

The north, the south, the east, the Russian forces are taking more territory. They've surrounded the city of Mariupol. They are moving on the city of Odessa. Kharkiv is being bombed to the ground, and as you say, Kyiv is being approached more gradually by the Russians. You know, what we have seen in this conflict, though, is the sheer number of videos that come out. We're able to track this conflict or what just has happened.

While south of Kyiv today at least a few children were killed in various strikes, some killed in their home, some killed in their cars. And all the while Russia is tightening the noose on the capital. The Russians defense ministry releasing this video overnight that shows tanks and armored vehicles now crossing into the Kyiv region, and they have been intense air campaigns just outside Kyiv. Speaking remotely today to rallies, to gathered -- people gathering in European countries. Zelenskyy urged supporters to keep speaking out and he held a minute of silence for those who had died. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Don't be silent, come to the streets, support Ukraine, support our freedom.

And those kinds of questions are going to be raised when we watch this because there is a very clear aggressor in this situation. Ukraine did not invade Russia. Russia invaded Ukraine. It's been an independent nation for over 30 years. They have chosen their own government, they elected them democratically. And now you have this very clear invasion. I think it would've very been different if -- if, you know, it had been that disputed area of in the Donbas. I think if he had left it to that area, it might have come down to some sort of very difficult struggled negotiation. But when he was blocked in that effort which came as a surprise to even as top generals, that he announced the independence of those nations, he decided to encircle essentially the whole country and start attacking them and putting people in situations that we haven't seen since World War II.

And you know, initially we thought, well, maybe, he's keeping the infrastructure strong. He's not doing that. Now what's happening in Kharkiv is he is destroying everything. And we are, the American people, we're not used to this, we're not used to seeing this kind of thing. A father kneeling over the body of a 6-year-old whose lost his legs in a bombing. It's almost as a war of voyeurs. And Americans are good people. Americans are not accustomed to just looking at this and saying, well. And I think it's one of the reasons why we talked about this last week that there is -- there was a poll that 48 percent of Americans were willing to accept even higher gas prices to get involved in the Ukraine. But this is too close and personal. This is too painful. And at some point, I think the American people are going to be angry that there isn't a better response on our part.",

There's been nothing done so far up to this point or indications even with the west helping the Ukrainians that he plans to turn back.

Like, if you agree to that, that actually makes the devastation less devastating, and therefore, not as urgent to surrender. So, he doesn't care about that. So, they talk about the no-fly zone, and our fear is you shoot down a Russian jet, that's war. But what the Ukrainian will tell you is it is already war, it's already World War III.

That's why energy independence is so important. But it's interesting to watch the White House talk about this. They keep saying they don't want to stop the imports of Russian oil because they don't want to hurt the American people. They're using this invasion as an excuse to pass the buck on the responsibility for gas prices which went up last year. They didn't just start going up. And they're going to continue going up as a result, again, of the Vita administration policies of the assaults on domestic drilling and gas inside this country. And the issue to what Jesse was saying is it's about virtue signaling, because we're not drilling here. They don't want to have oil and gas produced here, but they're still buying it. So, they're willing to buy it from Russia which were, as you said is not clean. They're willing to buy it from Iran. So, it's not like they're not using or buying oil. John Kerry has a lot of private jet travel he has to do to go around the world and advocate against climate change.

Putin's invasion of Ukraine taking the most terrifying turn yet after Russian forces took control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant during a middle of a attack on night. The facility was damaged but regulators are reporting that radiation levels appear to be normal. Putin now has control of one quarter of Ukraine's power supply and can pull the plug any time at once. And workers at the plant who are being held at gunpoint are warning that Russia could use it to blackmail all of Europe. To the east, the city of Kharkiv continues to be pounded by Russian shellings, and then in the north, Putin's convoy of tanks and armored vehicles inches closer to Ukraine's capital. Benjamin Hall is live in Kyiv, Ukraine with the latest. Benjamin?"

The north, the south, the east, the Russian forces are taking more territory. They've surrounded the city of Mariupol. They are moving on the city of Odessa. Kharkiv is being bombed to the ground, and as you say, Kyiv is being approached more gradually by the Russians. You know, what we have seen in this conflict, though, is the sheer number of videos that come out. We're able to track this conflict or what just has happened. And there are some incredible videos release almost daily on social media and elsewhere. take a look at this one for example."

Another school was hit today in the city of Zhytomyr, half of it left destroyed, 22 civilians killed in another bombing in Chernihiv. While south of Kyiv today at least a few children were killed in various strikes, some killed in their home, some killed in their cars. And all the while Russia is tightening the noose on the capital. The Russians defense ministry releasing this video overnight that shows tanks and armored vehicles now crossing into the Kyiv region, and they have been intense air campaigns just outside Kyiv. Speaking remotely today to rallies, to gathered -- people gathering in European countries. Zelenskyy urged supporters to keep speaking out and he held a minute of silence for those who had died."

The thud of artillery flashes on the horizon, a short gun battle early on, the sense is that Russian forces are moving towards the city and it's only a matter of time until they stop bombing more heavily or they move in. I can tell you that the streets right now they are empty. People are prepping, people are ready. The defenses are up. Russians have made it very clear that if they fight --encounter resistance they will crush it. Or they will encounter resistance. The people here are brave, they are motivated, and so, we will see that escalation no doubt in the coming days or week, perhaps. Jesse?"

We've seen it in Desert Storm, we've seen it a little but in Iraq in operation and during freedom, but that was when we had American photojournalists embedded with our guys, so it's a different perspective. Now, you are seeing large-scale conventional war from the side of defense. And it's getting more and more graphic.

How did the world standby stand by and allow all of these people to be killed? And those kinds of questions are going to be raised when we watch this because there is a very clear aggressor in this situation. Ukraine did not invade Russia. Russia invaded Ukraine. It's been an independent nation for over 30 years. They have chosen their own government, they elected them democratically. And now you have this very clear invasion. I think it would've very been different if -- if, you know, it had been that disputed area of in the Donbas. I think if he had left it to that area, it might have come down to some sort of very difficult struggled negotiation. But when he was blocked in that effort which came as a surprise to even as top generals, that he announced the independence of those nations, he decided to encircle essentially the whole country and start attacking them and putting people in situations that we haven't seen since World War II.

There is not a religious fight going on. Putin just made a decision I want to take over this country. And if it means killing innocent civilians and children, it doesn't matter to me. And you know, initially we thought, well, maybe, he's keeping the infrastructure strong. He's not doing that. Now what's happening in Kharkiv is he is destroying everything. And we are, the American people, we're not used to this, we're not used to seeing this kind of thing. A father kneeling over the body of a 6-year-old whose lost his legs in a bombing. It's almost as a war of voyeurs. And Americans are good people. Americans are not accustomed to just looking at this and saying, well. And I think it's one of the reasons why we talked about this last week that there is -- there was a poll that 48 percent of Americans were willing to accept even higher gas prices to get involved in the Ukraine. But this is too close and personal. This is too painful. And at some point, I think the American people are going to be angry that there isn't a better response on our part."

So the question is how long can the Ukrainian forces hold off Russia when it comes to what they want to do? And according to the French president Putin is going to continue to take Ukraine. There's been nothing done so far up to this point or indications even with the west helping the Ukrainians that he plans to turn back. Martha today interviewed John Kirby who was the Pentagon spokesperson, she asked him what the goal was for what the west is doing, and they said the goal is to get Putin to retreat.

Aleppo was completely destroyed, flattened. The photos from Syria. Hundreds of thousands of civilians dead as a result of this partnership with Bashir al-Assad. And so, given his behavior then and the fact that he didn't suffer much from the international community I'm not surprised that he thinks he can do it again."

And he said -- he said they need to get that humanitarian corridor agreed on so people can get out safely, but Putin doesn't care about that. He doesn't negotiate. Like, if you agree to that, that actually makes the devastation less devastating, and therefore, not as urgent to surrender. So, he doesn't care about that. So, they talk about the no-fly zone, and our fear is you shoot down a Russian jet, that's war. But what the Ukrainian will tell you is it is already war, it's already World War III. And if you don't establish a no-fly zone, then we're going to have a lot of dead people. We already have a lot of dead people. You are going to have unless you dare. I'm sorry.

We can't pretend to be their bodyguard and not agree to this. In fact, in many ways, we are complicit in this. Right? We engage -- we are using Ukraine to annoy Russia and Ukraine used us to protect them. So now we are in a situation where we are saying no to a no-fly zone, and we're sending Kamala there. These are not moves of person would make whose intent on winning a war. And I go back to the first thing I said which is that, who does Ukraine matter more to? Putin or the United States?

And they may be in an orphanage where there are dozens or hundreds of kids who need to be fed. But we're a week out from that. And when society breaks on very quickly when people can't get basic things like food and water. So, this humanitarian, this humanitarian path that they are trying to make up with the Russians, Putin hasn't shown that he's actually doing that. We heard that there was some kind of agreement, but we haven't seen really any movement on setting up that flow of humanitarian aid. So, we'll just have to see what happens. But it's amazing always how quickly things change. You know, people have to leave and make the decision overnight whether to leave their families. My husband is telling me a story today about their organization who is helping to get people out as well. And a man who is 59 years old came to the border with six kids and dropped them all off, and had to go back. And so, you know, there's millions of this same kind of stories."

And essentially, they are subcontracts who would have been working for the Russian government, providing the Russian with some deniability and some padding here. But they, according to the story, were preplaced in Kyiv and activated but there were Russians who don't support the war, so they leaked the information to the Ukrainian security services, and these two assassination plots were thwarted. The other involved a Chechen hit squad that were part of this Kadyrov's brigade, and the Kadyrov brigades are the elite unit named after Ramzan Kadyrov. And they were inserted into the country when the fighting was so bad at the Hostomel airport there. They came in during the chaos. But once again, there were Russian turncoats who tipped off the Ukrainians, apparently with very detailed information, and the Ukrainians were able to locate the assassins and kill them right there at the airport. That information came through the national security chief out here in Ukraine. So, a real spy stuff going on out here. Real (Inaudible) stuff playing out in real life."

When you start to see the casualty figures you can't really trust any of them. You saw the number of the casualties that came up from the Ukrainians was dramatically different than what came out from the Russians. You get a lot of stories and then you go to find video of the evidence or find something that will support these different stories that come out, and it's just not there. So, when you are in an environment like this, you have to double check everything. And the hope that you don't get bamboozled in the process."

And he was tight with because Putin liked the way he cooked, and he got folded into the inner circles here. So, he does a lot of odd jobs, and he is tied with right down to that internet research association. And he is tied into that Wagner Group. Of course, I can't provide too much information because they are shadowy organization, their whole -- their backbone of the organization is their secrecy."

I mean, even Putin's own people are leaking information to the Ukrainians. And you know, now, they are getting their social media shutdown, they've got this statewide propaganda going on about, you know, how they are militarizing and de-Nazifying Ukraine. Have you heard anything about that?"

Even with some of his closest advisors, you could --- you could have a bowling match set up between him and his closest advisors. He has to shout down the table and that's because he is fearful of COVID. They know that if they get swabbed that means that someone could get their DNA in custom design a poison that could just kill him.

And you know, there were 42 plots they think, probably more than that to try to kill Hitler during World War II, and none of them succeeded until he killed himself in a bunker in Berlin. So, Zelenskyy is obviously under so much daily pressure. What can you tell us about how he's sort of changing the way that he navigates? And I also read that, that one of the ways they could do it is to drop like a laser pin on him to try to figure out -- you know, to try to stick something on him physically so that they can find him."

      "speaker": "TOBIN",

But as far as the pressure that Zelenskyy is under on what he's doing, you keep in mind, while you have the Russian leaders are paranoid, and they won't sit next to their closest advisors, Zelenskyy is doing press conferences, and he is in the middle of all of this. And one thing that has happened out here, particularly in the West, he wasn't that popular and he wasn't that respected. This is a guy who was an actor who fell into this job. And even his political party is named after the political party from the TV series he was in. And a lot of people just thought that he wasn't up to the task. And he has risen to the occasion. Not only so the people who didn't like him in the western part of the country are now backing him. If you saw some of the scenes of this broadcast address you just did, the Wenceslas Square there in the Czech Republic is just packed with people who are now rallying behind the Zelenskyy.

And the depressing part about this is that there were no lawmakers or in the --- or in their parliamentary chambers that oppose the bill. And if -- I'm coming from the point of view that the key here is you have to persuade powerful Russians, not just the population but powerful Russians that Putin is not destroying Ukraine, but destroying Russia, and they have to save it. But when you see lawmakers in these chambers not opposing this bill, that's kind of depressing, no?"

So, if a reporter puts out something that government doesn't like, it's -- you could be looking to prison time, and therefore, you're going to have a controlled media. And I've been in these countries where the media is controlled, and usually the front page of the newspapers just ridiculous. It's praising whoever is in power at the time.

Well, yes, it would take some time, but you know how long it would take to have, as Elizabeth Warren has just adjusted, wind power and solar that are filling the need? That also would take quite a bit of time. So, maybe it's time for all of the above approach, which we've talked about for a very long time in this country, and allowing the resources that we have to try to make up that difference.

And they don't care if prices a little high. They don't care. I actually looked into how much we import, Judge. It's only 700,000 Russian barrels of oil a day. That's less than four percent of what we consume. It would be like a marginal effect. But it's moral. It's a symbolic move for us to do this. And we can bring in more oil from South America or for our African partners, we'd make up the difference, it wouldn't do anything. And riddle me this because this is something I don't understand. If global warming is something that warms all the globe, then what's the difference between Saudi oil and American oil? Both warming the globe, right? So we might as well get paid for it. We might have American -- we might as well have American jobs doing the warming, right, Joe? It's the same oil, and it's the same world. So we might as well benefit and keep it in America. The other thing is, you've been begging the Saudis to keep pumping so hard. Saudis hate Joe Biden because he called him out over the Khashoggi killing."

The reason why people have been advocating for American energy independence is because when you're independent, you don't have to worry about getting involved in wars that are thousands of miles away where your only interest is energy. That's why energy independence is so important. But it's interesting to watch the White House talk about this. They keep saying they don't want to stop the imports of Russian oil because they don't want to hurt the American people. They're using this invasion as an excuse to pass the buck on the responsibility for gas prices which went up last year. They didn't just start going up. And they're going to continue going up as a result, again, of the Vita administration policies of the assaults on domestic drilling and gas inside this country. And the issue to what Jesse was saying is it's about virtue signaling, because we're not drilling here. They don't want to have oil and gas produced here, but they're still buying it. So, they're willing to buy it from Russia which were, as you said is not clean. They're willing to buy it from Iran. So, it's not like they're not using or buying oil. John Kerry has a lot of private jet travel he has to do to go around the world and advocate against climate change. But they want to be able to say that, well, we are making sure that our emissions are down and that we are doing this when really they're just shoving it to a different country which doesn't have our best interests at heart."

As far as far as a planet goes, coal, fracking, fossil fuels, these are immoral things. These are crimes against the environment. And yet it's OK to buy the dirty oil from a war machine. So, it shows you that the moral stances of these people who had been telling us for decades how much better they were than us, us evil right- wingers in our pickup trucks and our gas-guzzling SUVs, they're actually the most immoral people because they were phonies, and they were liars. But there is an amazing -- Russia played us for the longest time. They love that we denigrated our energy prowess. They loved that we bought the idea that nuclear power was bad and that solar was good and that Greta was a hero, because that made us more reliant on Russian oil and now Iran's oil because we're sitting -- we were convinced, probably through the help of Russia, that we -- our fuel industry was bad.

There's this country called Mexico that is on the border of the United States. And there are millions of people illegally crossing into the United States every single year, 200,000 a month, many of them are violent criminals from all over the world, not just from South America, and that's bad.

But this is really a true virtue signal in the sense that it has no practical outcomes. If you actually thought that you could help the Ukrainians, you wouldn't send her, right? And you could also do no fly zone if you thought you could help. But we're not interested in helping them, or we wouldn't send her. I said at the beginning of the show. These are actions of a person who's not serious about winning a war. So, the sad thing about it is we send her as a virtue signal and all the virtue signals do is replace real action.
