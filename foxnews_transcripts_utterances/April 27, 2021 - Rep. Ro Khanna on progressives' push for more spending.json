More than 1.6 million signatures have been deemed valid to force the issue. That's about 100,000 more than state law requires and could set the stage for California's second recall election in less than two decades. Back in 2003, that groundswell made Arnold Schwarzenegger a governor. No telling what could happen this time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Caitlyn Jenner is interested.

So, one is short-range transmission through puffs of breathing and so- called respiratory jets, and also coughs, which can send larger droplets into the air. That kind of respiration leads to short-range risk that is effectively addressed by distancing, social distancing. And if you're outside, that can still be potentially a risk of transmission. On the other hand, what my work focuses on is...",

And those droplets are carried throughout the air, and can be, in fact, inhaled and potentially transmitting infection anywhere in a well-mixed space indoors. So the way to think about these two modes of transmission is the way we understand the risks from smoking. So, if you're in the presence of a smoking person, and that person breathes directly on you, that's the short- range respiratory jet. That kind of transmission is protected against by distancing, and is most serious when people are not wearing masks. On the other hand, we also know that, when the smoke breathed out by a smoker is carried away in the room, it becomes diluted, but it's still there. And that's what we call secondhand smoke. And so the way to think about aerosol or airborne transmission indoors is that there are infectious respiratory droplets that are hanging around in the air. And over time, the risk of transmission does increase. And what my work has done in our recent publication is to provide a quantitative assessment of the time that you can spend in a space, given factors such as the ventilation rate and the size of the space and the number of occupants.",

Now, it doesn't mean that we should be terrified of being in indoor spaces. But we have to, essentially, take advantage of the quantitative guideline that we propose here to assess whether a space really is safe or not. Now, thankfully, many spaces today, I believe, are relatively safe for transmission. And that's what our guideline would predict, while some others may not be. So, generally large, well-ventilated spaces without a high-occupant density are generally quite safe, especially when one is wearing masks, which is a very efficient way of lowering the transmission that we also quantify.

He's saying let's eliminate the step-up basis when you die. Right now, if I buy a million dollars of stock in Facebook, sell it for $10 million -- or hold on to it until I die, it becomes $10 million, then I give it to one of my kids, they don't pay capital gains tax on it. That's absurd. He wants to close that. He wants corporations to pay some tax, not zero percent.

All right, maybe they have made a mistake, or -- so the fact of the matter is, it's poor leadership. And we need accountability. And if this person is going to lie to our face, and smile the entire time, while killing the middle class, strangling the businesses, and putting our great workers on the couch to sit and watch TV and not know how they're going to get out of this mess, don't forget. It's like battered wife syndrome. You're the one that beat me up and took everything away from me. And now you're here to smile and give it all back to me, and I'm supposed to say thank you and what a great relationship I have with my governor? There has to be accountability -- excuse me -- and truth. It's funny. I was looking at the meaning of cherry blossoms that came to mind. And it brought me to the story of Washington, Honest Abe. We need -- we don't need another Hollywood in-crowd. We don't need the cool people running the state. We need people who have walked in our shoes. And we have a chance and an opportunity right now to pick Cinderella, to pick the person that isn't rich, and doesn't run with the cool crowd, but has walked in our shoes and is honest and is going to do everything they can to bring back the middle class, because there is no middle class here."

Schwarzenegger was the last one to do that. So, we will see if history repeats itself. Phil Wegmann of RealClearPolitics, Emily Brooks joining us of The Washington Examiner. Phil, if I can begin with you on whether the governor should be feeling the heat right now. Governor Newsom has picked up from his lows in the pandemic. It could be a contest. A majority of Californians say they like him. Whether that translates and keeps him in office in the fall, if it comes to this, what do you think?"

      "speaker": "PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS",
      "utterance": "He should certainly be concerned, because the lesson that we're learning from the pandemic is that it was a political pressure cooker. No longer were the decisions of politicians removed. Instead, their decisions were front and center when so many people were stuck at home. And what we just heard, those charges of hypocrisy, of the governor acting one way and then ordering other people to act another way, that resonates with people. The question now, though, is whether or not that populist rage can really feed a groundswell, grassroots effort that could topple someone who is sitting behind a political machine. Like you mentioned, Newsom is well- liked. He's powerful. And he certainly has a lot of resources at his disposal."

So, that's really important, I think, for those activists to, like you showed in the last segment, #neverforget. They're going to hammer -- have to hammer that home. And, as you mentioned, Newsom's ratings are up from his lows. And so they're really going to have to shoot down his approval numbers and his ratings if they want to have a real chance at this. But even if he does overcome this, it is an opportunity for Republicans to use Governor Newsom as an example that they can point to and other places across the country, if this does get some national interest and national coverage."

I mean, the national reopening going on, and now -- and, certainly, Emily touched on it -- the fact that you won't be required to wear masks anymore if you're outside and you have been vaccinated. I'm wondering if this is the kind of thing that could influence voters, if it indeed comes down to a recall vote in the fall."

There's a reason why that video went viral, because people were living in the moment. The question is whether or not that frustration turns to resentment and then eventually action. I can certainly see an instance where this is sort of a shot across the bow, where voters are registering their discontent with Newsom, but do they actually show up at the polls and vote him out? That's another question. And, again, he has a lot of things going in his favor, as the vaccine gets rolled out, as things get back to normal. Sort of the bad times recede from memory. I think that arguing that he screwed up as things are reopening and returning to normal, it's difficult, but, certainly, it's something that the governor cannot ignore."

      "utterance": "So, to address the issue of outdoor transmission, it's important to recognize that there are two basic modes of transmission of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, which are carried by droplets that contain the pathogen, the virus in this case. So, one is short-range transmission through puffs of breathing and so- called respiratory jets, and also coughs, which can send larger droplets into the air. That kind of respiration leads to short-range risk that is effectively addressed by distancing, social distancing. And if you're outside, that can still be potentially a risk of transmission. On the other hand, what my work focuses on is..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What about -- but what about indoors, then, Professor? I mean, what -- are their rules of thumb on that today? I mean, are we questioning this whole distancing thing? I mean, some were saying six feet isn't necessary now, three feet is good enough. What's the accurate answer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAZANT",
      "utterance": "Exactly. So, that's what I was just getting to, that the other type of transmission would be airborne transmission carried by so-called aerosol droplets, which are very small and the size of the human cell, about few microns or less. And those droplets are carried throughout the air, and can be, in fact, inhaled and potentially transmitting infection anywhere in a well-mixed space indoors. So the way to think about these two modes of transmission is the way we understand the risks from smoking. So, if you're in the presence of a smoking person, and that person breathes directly on you, that's the short- range respiratory jet. That kind of transmission is protected against by distancing, and is most serious when people are not wearing masks. On the other hand, we also know that, when the smoke breathed out by a smoker is carried away in the room, it becomes diluted, but it's still there. And that's what we call secondhand smoke. And so the way to think about aerosol or airborne transmission indoors is that there are infectious respiratory droplets that are hanging around in the air. And over time, the risk of transmission does increase. And what my work has done in our recent publication is to provide a quantitative assessment of the time that you can spend in a space, given factors such as the ventilation rate and the size of the space and the number of occupants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And what have you concluded, Doctor? I mean, what -- if there are some general rules of thumb that we should keep in mind and things that might -- we might want to avoid?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAZANT",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, I guess the number one thing to keep in mind is that distancing is not protecting you against airborne transmission. So, I think we all understand the benefits that we can get from being three feet or six feet apart, which would give even more protection against those short-range jets. But we have to keep in mind that anywhere in a room, there is a risk. Now, it doesn't mean that we should be terrified of being in indoor spaces. But we have to, essentially, take advantage of the quantitative guideline that we propose here to assess whether a space really is safe or not. Now, thankfully, many spaces today, I believe, are relatively safe for transmission. And that's what our guideline would predict, while some others may not be. So, generally large, well-ventilated spaces without a high-occupant density are generally quite safe, especially when one is wearing masks, which is a very efficient way of lowering the transmission that we also quantify. But we want to be careful about smaller, less ventilated spaces where we spend longer periods of time."

Now, the White House wants to pay for legislative initiatives by raising the top income tax rate and also increasing the capital gains tax. But when Wall Street got wind of that last week, they responded in a pretty unfavorable way, the markets. The proposal is still in the works.

This is truly the far left progressives have taken over this administration. And, sadly, and, frankly, I mean, fearfully, they're having their way. And this is not just idle talk. This is where they want to take this country, further into, debt massive tax increase. Remember, President Clinton, he cut capital gains tax rates in 1997 by 40 percent. Biden, he wants to double the rates on capital gains. That will discourage investing and savings. Neil, you always remember, if you tax something more, you get less of it."

We just proposed this in the last couple of days. And that is, we have got nearly $2 trillion of unspent funds from the COVID relief packages. This economy is roaring back. Vaccination levels are going up. We have got plenty of money out there, and that's already been allocated, that isn't even spent that we could redirect a small part of that for true infrastructure, infrastructure that the average man and woman on the street would say, yes, that's infrastructure.

There is -- we are awash in spending at the moment. We don't need to raise taxes, increase user fees.

They don't want to be in the health care business. That's why manufacturing is going offshore. It's why working-class wages have stagnated. So, I think it's going to free up small business and entrepreneurship. But the way we pay for it, Neil, is what President Biden is proposing, which is commonsense measures. Three specifics. He's saying let's eliminate the step-up basis when you die. Right now, if I buy a million dollars of stock in Facebook, sell it for $10 million -- or hold on to it until I die, it becomes $10 million, then I give it to one of my kids, they don't pay capital gains tax on it. That's absurd. He wants to close that. He wants corporations to pay some tax, not zero percent. And he wants for people who are over a million dollars -- making over a million dollars to equalize the capital gains and ordinary income tax rate. And you know who did that? President Reagan in 1986. So, these are commonsense proposals."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I guess what I'm asking, though, is that I see the standpoint on the part of you and many others in your party to come up with creative ways to raise money, to raise taxes. Not nearly so creative when it comes to just pairing all that money that's going out. Why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "Actually, we have proposed cuts. Our military budget is 53 percent of federal discretionary spending. And I have gone -- I even went on Laura Ingraham's show, and she said that we need to cut some of the bloated defense budget. Pulling out of Afghanistan, which has been bipartisan, that's going to save us money, we shouldn't have been deployed overseas. And I do think we need to make sure that money going out is effectively spent. And if Republicans want to work with us to make sure that's happening, I'm all for that. But the key is -- and, look, Larry Summers, who has warned about inflation, he said that we can spend up to $5 trillion -- that's Larry Summers -- if it's productive investment, if we're building our roads, our bridges, providing Internet to rural America, competing with China. Why aren't we talking about what China is spending? Look at what they're doing. We keep talking about the Chinese competitive threat. Look at what they're spending. Do we want to be left behind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, they don't run deficits, and they don't have debt, right? So, I guess what I'm asking you, Congressman, is, if this keeps going at this pace, we won't be able to afford this. With all the tax increases and everything else the president's proposed on the rich and those with $400,000 income and the capital gains thing and all that, for all of that, it is still little more than half the monies that are being appropriated to spend down the road. Is it fair to say, sir, that other people are going to have to start kicking in dough, not just the rich?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think so, because I think the productive investments are going to lead to an extraordinary amount of growth. And when you have a low interest rate, low inflation environment, and if you're investing in things that are going to grow the economy 3, 4, 5 percent, then that's going to expand the tax base and will allow us to pay down our debt. And so I guess it depends on, do you believe in the possibility of American economic growth? I believe in it. I believe that you can grow the economy, just like President Reagan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But you would have to have lot of growth. But you would have to have a lot of growth, right, Congressman? For it to pay for all of this spending, you would have to hope for something like an Internet boom that the Clinton administration enjoyed to get anything like that, right?"

    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",

I believe we can have 4 percent, 5 percent growth. And I guess -- I guess, if you don't believe that, if you believe in secular stagnation, and you don't think America is going to grow, then you would be more concerned. But I believe we're going to boom as a country."

We are less than four hours from a curfew kicking in at 8:00 p.m. here in Elizabeth City, which, after six nights of peaceful protests, may cause some clashes with the police, as we have seen in other cities when they enforce these curfews. And what they're likely going to be upset about was the Brown family attorneys today in a press conference releasing the results of an independent autopsy that showed Brown was shot five times, with the fatal shot being to the head. Lead attorney Ben Crump described that shot this way. Take a listen."

The private autopsy released by the family is important and I continue to pray for them during this difficult time. However, a private autopsy is just one piece of the puzzle. \"The independent investigation being performed by the SBI\" -- that's the State Bureau of Investigation -- \"is crucial. And the interviews, forensics and other evidence they gather will help ensure that justice is accomplished.\" Meanwhile, last night, the protests were demanding, of course, Wooten release that video. We may get that eventually tomorrow. But it comes as FOX News' new poll shows that only 33 percent of Americans favor reducing funding for police, as opposed to moving into another area; 62 percent favor -- oppose that -- excuse me -- 33 percent favor, 62 percent oppose. And, Neil, the big question is whether or not we will all see that video. Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., a hearing to see if a judge will sign off, after the sheriff filed a motion yesterday to get it out to the public -- Neil."

Want to bring you up to date on this development in the Persian Gulf right now, where three Iranian fast boats were approaching U.S. Naval vessels. It got pretty messy, got pretty heated.

      "speaker": "JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, we're getting some new details about an incident that occurred late last night in the North Arabian Sea in the Persian Gulf. There were two U.S. vessels, a Navy vessel, the USS Firebolt, and a Coast Guard patrol boat, that were approached by three Iranian Revolutionary Guard navy boats. They're small gunboats. They were armed. And they started getting within 68 yards of the U.S. vessels. The U.S. vessels tried to try to issue a warning, bridge-to-bridge radio warning, as well as through loudspeakers. Eventually, the U.S. vessel the Firebolt had to fire warning shots. That is when the Iranian boats disappeared. But, again, this was a tense moment. It's something that hasn't happened in the Persian Gulf, with Iranian fast boats approaching U.S. vessels, for the past three years -- back to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Jennifer, I want to continue pursuing this, because this is a big deal here. Now, we are looking like we're going to be reengaging in those nuclear talks with Iran. Surely, it must be cognizant of that backdrop for an action like this. So it makes you wonder who is sort of firing the orders on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's very clear that there are certain forces in the region, as well as within the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, that probably do not want negotiations to start again for the -- with regards to Iran's nuclear program. And so you're seeing the Iranian Revolutionary Guard flexing its muscles. They don't like diplomats like Mohammad Zarif talking to the U.S. and other European negotiators. And so you're seeing a tension play out within Iran between the Revolutionary Guard Corps, who are trying to assert itself and provoke the U.S. military. This was a tense moment just last night. And, again, we haven't seen something like this in the past three years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I am wondering as well, then, what our response was then. It looks like we were taken aback by this. What did we do specifically? What are we promising since?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, right now, you saw these -- this naval vessel, the USS Firebolt, show extreme -- very professional behavior, fired the warning shots. And that's when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval vessels sped off. This used to be something that happened quite frequently, and they -- they're really more of an annoyance, a testing for the U.S. -- the Fifth Fleet, which is based out in Bahrain. There was a Coast Guard vessel with the USS Firebolt this time. But, again, the U.S. Navy, very professional, fired the warning shots, and the Iranians bolted, if you will."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I did want to get into very quickly, if I could, Jennifer, these charges against John Kerry, the former secretary of state, as a private citizen, was talking, lobbying with the Iranian higher-ups, some even said sharing secrets, Israeli secrets. Do we know anything about that? He's denied it all, but what do we know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, he's denied it. And, remember, former Secretary of State John Kerry had a relationship with Mohammad Zarif back when they did negotiate the nuclear accord."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "So, that relationship proceeded. But John Kerry denies that he revealed any secrets. Those Israeli airstrikes in Syria had been in open press reports. If we remember back to that time period, Israel was targeting inside Syria, and what -- and it had been reported from -- through the Israeli press that they had done. So, Kerry's denying it. But, again, all of this is serving as a backup drop. Israel and certain elements of Iran do not want the nuclear talks to begin again. They do not believe -- the government of Israel doesn't believe that those talks will go anywhere."
