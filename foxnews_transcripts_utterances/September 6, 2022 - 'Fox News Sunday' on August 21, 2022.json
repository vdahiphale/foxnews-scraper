I think they're starting to realize that we are really out of this pandemic. We're moving forward as a country. Local control and local decisions are best made by parents and families. And so, are we going to have COVID surges coming? Of course, we are. But we have those tools now. We have the vaccine. We have therapeutics. We have all these tools in our tool box now.

You cannot come back out and say something totally different down the road because most importantly, we don't want to have the CDC -- people have no trust in the CDC. We don't want that, but unfortunately that's -- that's where we are today. As a governor, I was on those calls with the CDC director. We're on the calls with the White House. We'd hear one thing on the phone and something totally different would happen the next week, mass confusion. So, as governors, during the height of the pandemic, we really had to buckle down and do what's best for our citizens and make our decisions. We kind of listened to what they said. Okay, I hear you, but this is what we're seeing on the ground and we had to make decisions for our citizens. I think, overall, governors did a very, very good job, at least in the red states. I can't speak for some of those blue states with all the excessive lockdowns because, again, they just kept doing whatever the White House and the CDC was telling them one week and then shifting the next week, eroding trust with what should be a really responsive branch of government.",

And we understand that nationally, after what's happened over the past couple years. In New Hampshire, we're different. We really heart (ph) -- if you may -- on that local control. We work collaboratively. We don't fight it. You know, we put more dollars in public education for students than ever before. And we passed school choice, right? And we're creating more opportunities for kids in public schools to get credentialed in a -- you know, a work force type environment that they want to enter into. We're just not doing things traditionally. And when you support that local aspect, you inspire creativity, you let teachers have some -- have some say working with those parents, local control is really the answer. Any time the government gets overly involved in education, it normally doesn't go well. And so, we take that kind of push back approach. We believe in parents and teachers. Teachers now want to be here. We're the only state in New England that's actually growing in population. Businesses are flooding in. And so, you know, we've really focused on the individuals, individual towns, individual schools. That allows I think kind of rising tide floats all boats here in New Hampshire. And that's why -- look, we have the strongest economy in the country. We're -- we -- in the first quarter of 2022, we were the only state with the positive GDP. So, everything is driving forward in a positive direction. We don't get caught up in the overly political aspects of things. You know, Glenn Youngkin had it right. Parents matter, right? And teachers matter. They all matter. And they have to work collaboratively. We've been able to foster that here. And we're proud of the fact that we've been able to actually increase the number of teachers over the past couple of years.",

You get them into a job. You go through the credentialing process. There are states out there where if you want to be a teacher, it literally really takes to be credentialed, even if you've been one before, right? Because they have their whole process and rigmarole. So, streamlining the regulatory and permitting and certification process is whether it's teachers or manufacturers, that's an opportunity that every state has. We're doing it here. We're streamlining our whole thing. I think our reciprocity we have with places like Massachusetts and Maine, and Vermont, makes it very easy for folks to come over the border, which is one of the reasons why we're growing. So, I love the concept. The country has workforce shortages. Let's stop making -- allowing government get in the way of getting these people on the floors, in these classrooms, whatever they have to do to give them a job, and get kids or get the product out.

We've seen national discussion that when you elect the wrong individual, it makes it much harder to win in November, right? You have to have good candidates, quality candidates at the end of the day, whether you're running for a planning board, you're running for governor, U.S. Senate or president, you've got to get quality candidates that can cross the line. Winning in a primary means nothing. It means nothing. You can't govern if you don't win in November. And that's all that matters. And I focus on winners. And I want to best candidates that can win. I want the candidates that have the best shot at beating Maggie Hassan, to make our lives a little easier. And so, that's why, you know, I'm focusing on other candidates, frankly, because I don't want to happen to New Hampshire what we've already seen happen in other states where that gap becomes just too big. You're seeing it in Pennsylvania, unfortunately, in Georgia. I still think those Republican candidates can win. I think they're good candidates. But they're having a much harder time of it than they, frankly, should have in what should be a wipeout year.

This article goes on quoting here to say: There is no indication that Biden's other efforts like publicly shaming oil and gas companies over their record profits, calling an emergency meeting with CEOs and threatening to pull unused drilling permits have had any effect on price or production, according to industry experts. So national gas prices, as we said, below $4 nationally on average for the first time since March.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, that pulled millions of barrels off of the global market. Since oil is traded globally, we have to make up for that lost amount of fuel.

He wants to reshore manufacturing. It's not just in electric vehicles. This Inflation Reduction Act provides credit to businesses, to incentivize them to reshore in America. I'm the former governor of Michigan. The notion of creating and enhancing our manufacturing base, our manufacturing backbone is huge. It will be in solar panels. It will be in wind turbines.

And as they tried to figure things out, they made some mistakes. But you know what? Their job was made far more difficult because of President Trump, who said this thing was going to be gone in two weeks. He said it was like the common cold. He downplayed it. He attacked the science. He attacked the CDC. He attacked the NIH and Dr. Fauci. You know, he politicized mask-wearing and social distancing. So it became a political game. And I think that political game made it more difficult for anybody who was trying to deal with a historic crisis, a pandemic, in our nation at that moment. I think the CDC can do a better job.

Meantime, the White House just wants to sell their legislative wins and contrast themselves with Republicans. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Politico, quoting here: \"The choice just couldn't be any clearer,\" and says Democrats stood up to big pharma, to big oil, to big corporations, to the gun lobby. Is that a strong enough case, given the fact that we are in this crippling inflation? We've got high gas prices. NBC is reporting they could go even higher in the weeks and months to come. What do you think, Jessica? JESSICA TARLOV, HOST, \"THE FIVE\": It seems like it is a strong enough case for the American people. For the first time since November, the 538 averages and the RealClearPolitics averages have Democrats inched ahead of Republicans in terms of who is favored to control the House after November. We're also favored to keep the Senate. Mitch McConnell admitted this a couple of days ago. Stopped by a reporter and said that it wasn't looking good for Republicans. A lot of that has to do with very poor selection of candidates in states like Arizona and Georgia, what's going on in Ohio, potentially in Wisconsin with Mandela Barnes, making big strides against Ron Johnson, leading in the last two polls there. So, yes, the American people are hearing the president and administration loud and clear about these legislative accomplishments. And they certainly mean a lot to them. And, yes, inflation is still bad. It's over 8 percent. But it is coming down. Gas prices, as Secretary Granholm pointed out, are under $4 on average. Hope that they will get back down to 3. The American people seem clear that the Republicans have not proven to them that they deserve to take control in November thus far, but 80 days to go, or 79 days to go.",

This is why people -- you know, people got tired of it when he was president. And I think it then extends, when you think about the attacks on law enforcement, this talk coming from the right of defund the FBI? That's not helpful.

      "utterance": "Sir, I want to start with the CDC external review out this week finding deficiencies in their COVID-19 response. They admitted they have at times put out confusing guidance, to say the least. Now they're planning an overhaul to become a more rapid response public health agency. You've been a governor navigating this pandemic. Is that enough for you? Do you think with this they can rebuild public trust?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Did we really need a taxpayer-funded external review to determine that the CDC is all over the place? I mean, for the last two years, they say one thing, they do another. They tell us one thing privately, they do another. These guys have been constantly backtracking. So I guess the only good take away here is they're acknowledging it. I think they're starting to realize that we are really out of this pandemic. We're moving forward as a country. Local control and local decisions are best made by parents and families. And so, are we going to have COVID surges coming? Of course, we are. But we have those tools now. We have the vaccine. We have therapeutics. We have all these tools in our tool box now. So, I guess it's great they're finally acknowledging it. But it's something the rest of America has acknowledged for the last 18 months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And the reason I talk about public trust, sir, is because it's only a few months ago that the CDC director also came out and said, listen, when we said to follow the science, we never said the science was exact. And my response would be, well, you kind of did say the science was exact and those who failed to comply were all listed as, at least from the left, were all listed as public health threats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Look, when officials come out from the national government and talk about science, there's an implied understanding -- as the guy that went to MIT and, you know, studied science and engineering -- when you say the word \"science\", you're saying data. You're saying we know what's happening. We understand it and here's the response that we need. You cannot come back out and say something totally different down the road because most importantly, we don't want to have the CDC -- people have no trust in the CDC. We don't want that, but unfortunately that's -- that's where we are today. As a governor, I was on those calls with the CDC director. We're on the calls with the White House. We'd hear one thing on the phone and something totally different would happen the next week, mass confusion. So, as governors, during the height of the pandemic, we really had to buckle down and do what's best for our citizens and make our decisions. We kind of listened to what they said. Okay, I hear you, but this is what we're seeing on the ground and we had to make decisions for our citizens. I think, overall, governors did a very, very good job, at least in the red states. I can't speak for some of those blue states with all the excessive lockdowns because, again, they just kept doing whatever the White House and the CDC was telling them one week and then shifting the next week, eroding trust with what should be a really responsive branch of government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and you talked about children earlier. The CDC is also out with new COVID guidelines for schools, just as kids head back to the classrooms. They no longer recommend routine testing for grades K-12 unless, of course, community transmission is high. Do you support that change, Governor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, locals -- locals and schools and parents have to make the decisions for themselves. I live in New Hampshire. We're a live free or die state. We believe in local control. We believe in schools making those decisions for themselves, not having the federal or even the state government come down and push certain answers on to them and certain protocols on to them. So, especially where we are now, knowing we have all these tools in the toolbox, knowing that folks are working collaboratively with their school districts, collaboratively with parents to understand what these issues are -- yeah, that is -- local control is definitely the right approach."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And the other major back to school story this week is the big teacher shortage in the U.S. nationally. We're talking about 280,000 countrywide fewer teachers than there were before the pandemic. But it's interesting because in New Hampshire, in your state, you have actually renewed more education credentials this year. So what exactly is driving the trend nationally and what are you doing different in New Hampshire to have different results, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Well, nationally, whether it's teachers, nurses, there's a couple professions here that have just absolutely burned out. And we understand that nationally, after what's happened over the past couple years. In New Hampshire, we're different. We really heart (ph) -- if you may -- on that local control. We work collaboratively. We don't fight it. You know, we put more dollars in public education for students than ever before. And we passed school choice, right? And we're creating more opportunities for kids in public schools to get credentialed in a -- you know, a work force type environment that they want to enter into. We're just not doing things traditionally. And when you support that local aspect, you inspire creativity, you let teachers have some -- have some say working with those parents, local control is really the answer. Any time the government gets overly involved in education, it normally doesn't go well. And so, we take that kind of push back approach. We believe in parents and teachers. Teachers now want to be here. We're the only state in New England that's actually growing in population. Businesses are flooding in. And so, you know, we've really focused on the individuals, individual towns, individual schools. That allows I think kind of rising tide floats all boats here in New Hampshire. And that's why -- look, we have the strongest economy in the country. We're -- we -- in the first quarter of 2022, we were the only state with the positive GDP. So, everything is driving forward in a positive direction. We don't get caught up in the overly political aspects of things. You know, Glenn Youngkin had it right. Parents matter, right? And teachers matter. They all matter. And they have to work collaboratively. We've been able to foster that here. And we're proud of the fact that we've been able to actually increase the number of teachers over the past couple of years."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Interesting you used the phrase \"creating opportunity\". I want to get your take. What do you make of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' proposal to recruit military veterans and first responders without teaching degrees to help fill those vacancies down in Florida?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Look, I love the aspect -- the idea of focusing on military, focusing on veterans, focusing on folks with real world experience. You know, you get them into those classrooms. You get them into a job. You go through the credentialing process. There are states out there where if you want to be a teacher, it literally really takes to be credentialed, even if you've been one before, right? Because they have their whole process and rigmarole. So, streamlining the regulatory and permitting and certification process is whether it's teachers or manufacturers, that's an opportunity that every state has. We're doing it here. We're streamlining our whole thing. I think our reciprocity we have with places like Massachusetts and Maine, and Vermont, makes it very easy for folks to come over the border, which is one of the reasons why we're growing. So, I love the concept. The country has workforce shortages. Let's stop making -- allowing government get in the way of getting these people on the floors, in these classrooms, whatever they have to do to give them a job, and get kids or get the product out. And that's what it's all about. It's not about the system. It's about the kids."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I want to change gears here to the midterms, to New Hampshire politics. Incumbent Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan is up for reelection, the GOP primary weeks away. Right now, polling has retired General Don Bolduc leading. You said this week that Bolduc is a conspiracy theorist who really threatens your party's chances at winning back the seat. Are you concerned? Is there a worry in your party that GOP could be missing out on a golden opportunity here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Well, Senator Hassan's going to lose in November. There's no doubt about that. She has spent $25 million. Her approval rating hasn't moved. I hope she spends $100 million of the Democrats' money because it's going to go up in flames here. You know, we have seen other races across the country. We've seen national discussion that when you elect the wrong individual, it makes it much harder to win in November, right? You have to have good candidates, quality candidates at the end of the day, whether you're running for a planning board, you're running for governor, U.S. Senate or president, you've got to get quality candidates that can cross the line. Winning in a primary means nothing. It means nothing. You can't govern if you don't win in November. And that's all that matters. And I focus on winners. And I want to best candidates that can win. I want the candidates that have the best shot at beating Maggie Hassan, to make our lives a little easier. And so, that's why, you know, I'm focusing on other candidates, frankly, because I don't want to happen to New Hampshire what we've already seen happen in other states where that gap becomes just too big. You're seeing it in Pennsylvania, unfortunately, in Georgia. I still think those Republican candidates can win. I think they're good candidates. But they're having a much harder time of it than they, frankly, should have in what should be a wipeout year."

We've got to start focusing on closing this deal, making sure we cross the finish line with good candidates, winning back the Senate. I think we're going to get the House, but the Senate, instead of being a guaranteed 54th, New Hampshire could be that 51st vote now. And I think it's going to be. But we really got to make sure we close the deal. The other issue is, you've got to -- how we campaign here is a little different. You got to look people in the eye. The running joke in New Hampshire is, hey, you're going to vote for President Trump? Well, I don't know. I have only met him twice, right?

      "speaker": "SUNUNU",

The fact that when you are going to go into a former president's house that clearly Biden and Garland, they had no strategy, no anticipation about saying we're going to take unprecedented action. So we better have an unprecedented plan for disclosure. And the fact that we're weeks in now, they're not showing any cards. They're not showing anything. The lack of transparency, it's infuriating. And that is where they have absolutely blown it and that's where they've lost the trust of the American people because it just looks political. They didn't strike -- I get this whole thing that, well, you don't want to disclose things if it's an active investigation. That should have been thought of before. If they didn't anticipate this type of response from the American people -- well, they're morons. They really are. They're absolute fools, because you cannot walk into a former president's home, raid his home like that and then say, we'll get back to you later. Not acceptable to the American people. So I think Vice President Mike Pence, Mike Pence, he's -- by the way, great guy, has done a -- did a phenomenal job as vice president and he's absolutely right. We shouldn't be talking about defunding police and FBI. We're Republicans. We support law enforcement every single time. But the strategy at the top has been a disaster and they have to own that."

Given the issues with refinery capacity and the war in Ukraine, can you give us, Secretary, any more certainly that prices will keep falling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRANHOLM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. As you know, gasoline comes from oil. Oil is traded on a global market. And so, we are at the whim, if you will, of what happens globally. However, this president has moved in dramatic ways to increase supply by releasing a million barrels a day from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as well as calling on our domestic producers, as well as international producers. We will be at record amounts of production next year. All of that is to say our Energy Information Administration has projected that by the fourth quarter, gas prices will be around $3.87 on average. Today, they're about 3.90 -- excuse me, $3.78. Today, they're at $3.90. They have fallen every day of this summer. We're hopeful that will continue. But if China opens up significantly after COVID, there will be a more pressure on demand. More pressure on demand means upward pressure on prices. So we're watching what happens globally. But we are doing everything possible to try to stabilize supply and demand to try to keep those prices coming down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. We see -- at the bottom of the screen, it says prices falling below $4. And I think it's worth noting that in a lot of places around this country, like in California, gas is right near $6 a gallon. So, different places, different situations."

      "utterance": "There is no indication that Biden's other efforts like publicly shaming oil and gas companies over their record profits, calling an emergency meeting with CEOs and threatening to pull unused drilling permits have had any effect on price or production, according to industry experts. So national gas prices, as we said, below $4 nationally on average for the first time since March. But the Treasury Department said last month, the releases from the Strategic Oil Reserves only lower gas by anywhere from $0.17 to $0.42 a gallon. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRANHOLM",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the prices have dropped, as you said, more than $1. They are now at $3.90. They were over $5. So, clearly, there has been an impact on increased production. President has done two things. The release of a million barrels a day is the biggest tool at our disposal. This is all about supply and demand. When Russia invaded Ukraine, that pulled millions of barrels off of the global market. Since oil is traded globally, we have to make up for that lost amount of fuel. And that's why the president has called for this increase in releasing and increase in production. And as I say, we'll be at record production, 12.7 million barrels per day, by next year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I want to move on to the Inflation Reduction Act signed this week. It includes tax credits for people who buy electric vehicles. But as you know, one of the critiques here with these credits is that the prices are high, right? And the supply is limited. What is the practicality? Because it seems like there's a disconnect. What's the practicality for everyday Americans in this kind of benefit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRANHOLM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, yeah. Great question. There's two -- two implications here. One is, for example, if you want to buy a used electric vehicle, you can get $4,000 off at the dealership today. If you want to buy a new electric vehicle, there is a $7,500 credit for those that are assembled in America. So, today, there are 21 models that are assembled in America. But additional restrictions will kick in starting in January, requiring domestic contents. Meaning that some -- the materials, the supplies for those vehicles, will also have to be built in America. Why is this important? Because the president has said that we need to manufacture stuff in America, that we can't rely upon countries who don't share our values for the batteries, for example, for electric vehicles, which contain critical minerals, critical materials. He wants to reshore manufacturing. It's not just in electric vehicles. This Inflation Reduction Act provides credit to businesses, to incentivize them to reshore in America. I'm the former governor of Michigan. The notion of creating and enhancing our manufacturing base, our manufacturing backbone is huge. It will be in solar panels. It will be in wind turbines. It will be in transmission. It will be in electric vehicles and the batteries for those electric vehicles. A whole supply chain and ecosystem, energy ecosystem, built up in the United States because of the incentives in this Inflation Reduction Act."

      "speaker": "GRANHOLM",
      "utterance": "Well, number one, for your home -- yes, there are significant incentives in this bill, which is great to reduce people's energy costs on a monthly basis. So if you are low income, you can get your home entirely weatherized through the expansion from the bipartisan infrastructure law, significant expansion. You don't have to pay for anything. If you want heat pumps, insulation, new windows, that is covered. If you are moderate income, today you can get 30 percent off the price of solar panels. Those solar panels can be financed so you don't have to have the big outlay at the front. And when they're financed, they're financed in a way that reduces your energy bill even though you have solar panels. With this 30 percent off, it's a significant incentive. Same thing with -- if you don't qualify for the weatherization program, you will be able to, starting next year, get rebates on the appliances and equipment that will help you reduce your monthly energy bill by up to 30 percent. This is all about reducing costs for people."

That's another second bill that will follow in September. And -- and the Inflation Reduction Act also provides incentives to lower the time and the cost and the wait time for permitting. So that was just given to us. So we want to accelerate this push to clean electricity. And the reason why we want it to be clean, in addition to the climate, is because solar and wind are cheaper in most places across the world, but definitely in the U.S. than other forms..."

And if you don't have -- at night time, we don't have the battery power to store it. You have to use it or you lose it. And so it's unreliable in states like Texas, they found out. And that's a problem is..."

      "utterance": "OK. Texas is the largest producer of both wind and solar, or one and two. They are extremely important to adding clean energy to our grid. With respect to the intermittency, you say they're unreliable. They are intermittent because it doesn't always -- the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow. But the battery technology that stores that, that is also incentivized in this Inflation Reduction Act. The technology is there. We just need to make sure that it's implemented. So the great thing is when you combine solar or wind with battery technology, that becomes like baseload power that is reliable, which is very exciting. Other forms of clean energy are also incentivized, like nuclear power, like hydroelectric power, like geothermal power. All of those are also incentivized in the Inflation Reduction Act, which will make us as a nation energy independent, which will make us -- allow us to get to our goals of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 and net zero carbon pollution, which causes climate change, by 2050."

Finally, I know this is not your agency, but as a former governor, I wanted to get your take. Your reaction to the CDC this week kind of coming out with this mea culpa over how they handled the pandemic. Governors across the country followed along with the CDC day-by-day guidance, often following the mask mandates, right, the school closures. It impacted every American. And many are really still confused. So if you can put your governor's hat back on very quickly for us, is this explanation enough for the CDC?"

And it's time now for our Sunday group: former Utah Congressman and FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz; Democratic strategist and co-host of \"The Five,\" Jessica Tarlov; and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams. Welcome to you all. Jason, to you first. The CDC this week admitted that some of their COVID guidance was, quoting here, \"confusing and overwhelming.\" So they're reorganizing and promising more plain language. I mean, my question to you is how should Americans feel about this because you could not disagree with the CDC, Jason, or you were banned from social media, you were called a public health threat, you had to comply?"

Look, until the agency actually has a sweeping change at the top, that they change management and put out some new faces, I think this administration will continue to struggle. And it's sad, Trace, because we need to Centers for Disease Control when there truly is something dramatic going on to have the confidence of the American people. They lost that trust. They had it. They lost it. And they deserve to be fired. They shouldn't be in this place."

      "utterance": "Trace, I think the review is warranted. The CDC needs to do a better job of messaging. But anybody who takes delight in their problems is playing just brassy politics here. The CDC was doing their best to find answers to a novel virus. This was an unprecedented virus. No one had answers early. The scientists were doing science. They were trying to figure things out. And as they tried to figure things out, they made some mistakes. But you know what? Their job was made far more difficult because of President Trump, who said this thing was going to be gone in two weeks. He said it was like the common cold. He downplayed it. He attacked the science. He attacked the CDC. He attacked the NIH and Dr. Fauci. You know, he politicized mask-wearing and social distancing. So it became a political game. And I think that political game made it more difficult for anybody who was trying to deal with a historic crisis, a pandemic, in our nation at that moment. I think the CDC can do a better job. But let's not take pleasure in their problem. Their problem is our problem because we're going to have future medical issues to deal with and we want them to perform in a better way."

I think what they're saying is, is there was dissent. There was other opinions out there. And those opinions were shut down. And the CDC, we know now, was wrong. On many occasions they were wrong. But if you had a differing opinion and a different point of view, even well-known doctors, they were shut down and they were villainized. And I guess that's what..."

      "speaker": "I want to move on, Jessica. Meantime, the White House just wants to sell their legislative wins and contrast themselves with Republicans. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Politico, quoting here",
      "utterance": "\"The choice just couldn't be any clearer,\" and says Democrats stood up to big pharma, to big oil, to big corporations, to the gun lobby. Is that a strong enough case, given the fact that we are in this crippling inflation? We've got high gas prices. NBC is reporting they could go even higher in the weeks and months to come. What do you think, Jessica? JESSICA TARLOV, HOST, \"THE FIVE\": It seems like it is a strong enough case for the American people. For the first time since November, the 538 averages and the RealClearPolitics averages have Democrats inched ahead of Republicans in terms of who is favored to control the House after November. We're also favored to keep the Senate. Mitch McConnell admitted this a couple of days ago. Stopped by a reporter and said that it wasn't looking good for Republicans. A lot of that has to do with very poor selection of candidates in states like Arizona and Georgia, what's going on in Ohio, potentially in Wisconsin with Mandela Barnes, making big strides against Ron Johnson, leading in the last two polls there. So, yes, the American people are hearing the president and administration loud and clear about these legislative accomplishments. And they certainly mean a lot to them. And, yes, inflation is still bad. It's over 8 percent. But it is coming down. Gas prices, as Secretary Granholm pointed out, are under $4 on average. Hope that they will get back down to 3. The American people seem clear that the Republicans have not proven to them that they deserve to take control in November thus far, but 80 days to go, or 79 days to go."

Did all of Biden's good news get lost, as we see yet another headline about former President Trump. Right now we're waiting to see what the redacted affidavit says about why the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago. What's the impact in your estimation, Juan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, to your point, Trace, I think the search warrant definitely overshadowed Biden's big week. If you need any proof that Biden didn't know about it, I guess that's it. But the larger point is that in the short term the attention on President Trump, the affidavit, the search warrant, even the judge's decisions, you know, I think the short term may benefit because all the narrative and media attention is on Trump. But in the long term, I think that people, you know, seeing the chaos, the ever- changing Trump explanations for why he kept documents that were classified or even just presidential government documents in his home in Mar-a-Lago, people think that's, you know, chaotic. This is why people -- you know, people got tired of it when he was president. And I think it then extends, when you think about the attacks on law enforcement, this talk coming from the right of defund the FBI? That's not helpful. That doesn't help the Republicans with moderate voters in any way. So I think in the long term this could be more damaging. But in the short term, you're right. I mean, it definitely distracts from what was major accomplishments in lowering prescription drug prices, you know, doing more in terms of trying to help the American people move forward."

We're not going to get information and yet the -- the Justice Department gets the chance, maybe they're leaking, maybe they're not, but they're controlling the narrative.

His lawyers have done nothing in court even though it has been available to them. There have been defenders of President Trump who are even questioning the legal strategy here and whether his team is up to the challenge.

I mean, the balance of power is going to come down to a few races and potentially just a few thousand votes here or there. I think when voters focus on the issues, I think when they focus on what's the reality of the Inflation Reduction Act and that there isn't actually inflation reduction in there, it's the Green New Deal disguised as something else, I think people are going to be irate. And they're going to vote about what's going on with inflation, energy, immigration, what's going on with the crime in their cities. And the Democrats, I don't think, have an answer to all of that. They can spend $1.5 billion to put trees in urban areas in the latest bill but that ain't going to solve the American people's problems."

We thought this was going to be a red wave year, people voting against the party in power, the Democrats, because there's a lot of discontent in the country. And the red wave at this point looks like a red drip or a red ripple. And the reason, reflected in Florida and the races that you were just talking about with Jason, is that more and more people are thinking, you know what? We see the benefits now coming, the results coming, the legislative progress coming from the Biden administration. We see -- have a sense that things are somewhat chaotic. You know, you think about the abortion decision coming from a Republican majority of justices on the court. You look at the decrease in gas prices, inflation, and the like. Meanwhile, you have Senator McConnell and Senator Scott, Rick Scott of Florida playing the blame game and shifting money, you know, putting money into Ohio, you know, a state that people thought was pretty confident to hold for the Republicans.

And people turned out on that basis. The election was a referendum on that. And we should add that Liz Cheney isn't, you know, your average never-Trumper. She's the vice chair of the January 6th Committee. So these are extenuating circumstances. In terms of her chances to win the presidency, obviously I don't think that that's going to be happening. And unfortunately I think that if she did run or someone like an Andrew Yang with his new party, for instance, that's more of a coalition idea, are just going to shave off votes from Democrats, which I'm not in favor of. But Donald Trump is obviously incredibly important still to the party. I do believe that what's going on with January 6th and the search of Mar-a- Lago is going to hurt him though. And I'm glad that he's not announcing before the midterms. I think that that would throw, you know, a whole other spanner in the works there. But he's important.
