But you also have the moral hazard. You took out the loan, you should have to pay for it. I do think this is where innovation makes the most sense in two ways, one if you look at Purdue University, where former Governor Mitch Daniels is the President there. He's figured out a way to work with employers in the area that want to hire good people. So, they put him in the pipeline. OK, what you want to hire Emily. She's going to graduate in two years. You're going to put forward 60 percent of her tuition for the next two years, great. You signed a contract. Emily you had to go work there for two years. That might be a good relationship going forward. And then there's also the other thing is companies that are willing to pay for your student loan. Again, type job market. How do you want to attract employees? Are you willing to take on their student loan?",

So, he's diagnosed last month because they felt this little troublesome growth and it turned out it was a soft tissue tumor. Blue was taken in by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals where he's already as you can see making some big strides, but he's waiting to find his forever home. So, you can check our Facebook page. We'll have more on that. And also, in the spirit of recovery and giving back, I wanted to mention Mercy Ships. That's an organization of course I talk about it a lot.

One of the reasons Trump was elected is because of Obama-Biden.  You know that whole system didn't work for the forgotten men and women of this country. And that's why Trump came in to shake things up. If you look at -- Biden has been here for 30 years. And now he's going to come around and say, oh, yeah, Trump broke everything in two. I mean, Biden gave us NAFTA. Biden gave us China and the WTO. Biden gave us an economy that wasn't working for people in manufacturing jobs. So I don't think that's going to stick."

He didn't apologize for the crime bill, didn't really apologize for Anita Hill. The touching, he didn't apologize for that. Reparations -- I'm bringing that up. Medicare for all, that won't work.

We learned today that I think the focus of this campaign is gonna be the economy and also immigration. And in that county, specifically, there's a heavy manufacturing presence, and it's also really rural. And so his China and tariffs emphasis will likely really resonate especially with those people with which MAGA resonated in 2016 who felt forgotten.

So this poll is very well. I wouldn't say just for Democrats. Like, people like fairness, equality, things like that. But as a conservative, Republicans would say, well, wait. Well, why is the government going to know what I'm paying anybody anyway? So she would set up a commission. Like, I'm not for the government getting into everybody's business on this.  Now the question would be like as woman continue to do better in law schools, in medical schools, et cetera, would the same be true if the reverse happened?

Because if you're bringing ratings, you're bringing advertising, I, to me, I always thought you're growing to get paid. I don't know if it was Katie Couric, or Matt Lauer, the one that's the heavyweight gets paid regardless of gender. Right now they say women get 80 cents on the dollar. Black women get 69 cents on the dollar. Latinos get 62 cents on the dollar. I'd like to see that gap narrow. But I don't know how you find out because these salaries are secret, number one.

Other companies started the say audit. There was a similar company, they actually found out they were paying women more than the men, so then they have to increase those salaries.

Usually, the government creates the problem and then they have to come in and solve it. Also, the press, all these journalists, they're up to their ears in credit card debt and they've been saying it's not a crisis at the border, but we have a President crisis, please.

So, if you make 50,000, you probably take it on 32,000 and then you're paying that much. It's hard to pay for rent, utilities, phone. So maybe it's an impossible equation.

If that's the decision is the fact that it is put in place from pensions and from the bankrupt debacles that every state engages in, the recent tuition is so high is because it is accounting for the pensions of the employees and it's a totally desperate situation. It's not because the value of the education is such and I think what the situation illustrates to me is A, capitalism works. This is a self-made billionaire who is choosing what to do with his 4 billion. He's choosing to extend $40 million in that way in a charitable endeavor and charges those graduates with doing the same with basically saying here you too encompass tenacity and then give back to your community. And if the government were to do it by the way then that's our money. So, for me, I'm like he can do what he wants. That's amazing.

I do think this is where innovation makes the most sense in two ways, one if you look at Purdue University, where former Governor Mitch Daniels is the President there. He's figured out a way to work with employers in the area that want to hire good people. So, they put him in the pipeline. OK, what you want to hire Emily. She's going to graduate in two years. You're going to put forward 60 percent of her tuition for the next two years, great. You signed a contract. Emily you had to go work there for two years. That might be a good relationship going forward. And then there's also the other thing is companies that are willing to pay for your student loan. Again, type job market.

      "utterance": "Time now for One More Thing. Listen up Massachusetts, a 3-year-old former police dog in your state is looking for a loving new home after losing one of his legs to cancer. He forced his retirement from the force. His name is Blue. He's a former canine bloodhound. He was a prize member of the Billerica Police Department for over two years. So, he's diagnosed last month because they felt this little troublesome growth and it turned out it was a soft tissue tumor. Blue was taken in by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals where he's already as you can see making some big strides, but he's waiting to find his forever home. So, you can check our Facebook page. We'll have more on that. And also, in the spirit of recovery and giving back, I wanted to mention Mercy Ships. That's an organization of course I talk about it a lot. They are looking for some volunteers and if you want a life-changing experience, they need all sorts of people, go to their website. mercyships.org and in media relations, they need a captain, they're looking for engineers as well as nursing staff. Jesse?"

      "utterance": "All right, grab your hat Auntie Em. Another tornado's coming folks. It's peak tornado season in the Midwest. So, take a look will you at this video. That video was done by AccuWeather storm chaser Reed Timmer. He shot the storm in Cook County, Nebraska Saturday. Since Friday at least 38 tornadoes have been reported in Kansas, Nebraska and Texas, Saturday. 11 tornadoes alone. Severe weather remains a threat for at least 48 million according to the National Weather Service. By the way, the Mississippi River has been over flood stage for 131 days a record. And Reed Timmer just so you know he was not hurt despite being unable to see his hand as the tornado swallowed him up. That intense weather reminds me of a quote from The Wizard of Oz. We're not in Kansas anymore."

If you want to see if you like the series The FOX Nation series What Made America Great, I'm bringing it to the stage, it's going to be in Bonita, Springs; Orlando, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama. So, I'm able to take what we did on Fox Nation the 10 and then also have a chance to talk about George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson Tripoli Pirates, Andrew Jackson miracle of New Orleans and the soon to be published if I'm done within the next two and a half weeks. Sam Houston and the Alamo Avengers and I get a chance to interact with everyone, so it's probably the most fun I'll ever have."

It's launching during the Power Tour and it restores the classic cars left behind by those service members and first responders killed in action. So, stay tuned, because I'm going to be burning rubber for a great cause. We'll have drag racing. We're going through five different states. It'll be a really great time."
