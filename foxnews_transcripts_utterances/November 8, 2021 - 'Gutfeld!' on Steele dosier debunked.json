Please write down your choice on the back of a cereal box and mail it to Joe Scarborough care of Bellevue Hospital. Now, the new indictments coming out from Special Counsel John Durham are even crazier. By the way, what is with this picture? Is this -- is this the only picture ever taken of John Durham? Could he look any more like a German U-boat commander. The scary thing is that's his sixth grade class picture. And why isn't he playing the lead in the life and times of Wilford Brimley. Talk about cocoon, you could wrap yourself in that stash. Sometimes I thought about it. And if you turn his head upside down, doesn't he look familiar? All right. Enough at his expense. So the indictment offers lots of new evidence revealing this steals key source involved a shady guy named Igor. Igor made false statements to the FBI about his role in supplying the gossipy smears to steal. Steal was that former British spy who worked for Fusion GPS, he's like 007 if that stood for his I.Q. So was this the ticking time bomb? We were promised by every blue checker on Twitter from 2016 to 2020? Well, it was indeed a bombshell except it went boom boom all over them.

Yet, as Igor confesses it was all based on booze fueled hearsay from friends, which is not bad research. That's how I found out that Bigfoot had impregnated the Loch Ness monster to give birth to Carrot Top. That's all of my research. But then his real source, which was another Democratic hack, a guy who's only connected to the Kremlin is the bottle of Russian dressing in the fridge. My wife has more of a connection to Moscow. It's the poster of a shirtless Putin above our bed. In other words, this whole thing was a hoax. A malicious deception like Kat's extensions. And much like all the other hoaxes, we've heard. The fine people lie, the injecting bleach, Covington, Kavanaugh, CRT doesn't exist but white supremacy does. Well, feel like I just wrote an outline for a new Fox nation series hosted by Diamond and Silk. But this dossier smear was designed to sway an election claiming Trump was under Moscow's control because of the extorted power of blackmail. So is the media admitting to their huge error now? Of course not. The story is too huge to admit it being false. And that's why the hugest story on earth must vanish. Because it's not simply the media admitting to being wrong, it's admitting to being fundamentally deluded for over four years. And if there's any guiding principle to today's legacy journalism, that's it.",

Please write down your choice on the back of a cereal box and mail it to Joe Scarborough care of Bellevue Hospital. Now, the new indictments coming out from Special Counsel John Durham are even crazier. By the way, what is with this picture? Is this -- is this the only picture ever taken of John Durham? Could he look any more like a German U-boat commander. The scary thing is that's his sixth grade class picture. And why isn't he playing the lead in the life and times of Wilford Brimley. Talk about cocoon, you could wrap yourself in that stash. Sometimes I thought about it. And if you turn his head upside down, doesn't he look familiar? All right. Enough at his expense. So the indictment offers lots of new evidence revealing this steals key source involved a shady guy named Igor. Igor made false statements to the FBI about his role in supplying the gossipy smears to steal. Steal was that former British spy who worked for Fusion GPS, he's like 007 if that stood for his I.Q. So was this the ticking time bomb? We were promised by every blue checker on Twitter from 2016 to 2020? Well, it was indeed a bombshell except it went boom boom all over them.

Yet, as Igor confesses it was all based on booze fueled hearsay from friends, which is not bad research. That's how I found out that Bigfoot had impregnated the Loch Ness monster to give birth to Carrot Top. That's all of my research. But then his real source, which was another Democratic hack, a guy who's only connected to the Kremlin is the bottle of Russian dressing in the fridge. My wife has more of a connection to Moscow. It's the poster of a shirtless Putin above our bed. In other words, this whole thing was a hoax. A malicious deception like Kat's extensions. And much like all the other hoaxes, we've heard. The fine people lie, the injecting bleach, Covington, Kavanaugh, CRT doesn't exist but white supremacy does. Well, feel like I just wrote an outline for a new Fox nation series hosted by Diamond and Silk. But this dossier smear was designed to sway an election claiming Trump was under Moscow's control because of the extorted power of blackmail. So is the media admitting to their huge error now? Of course not. The story is too huge to admit it being false. And that's why the hugest story on earth must vanish. Because it's not simply the media admitting to being wrong, it's admitting to being fundamentally deluded for over four years. And if there's any guiding principle to today's legacy journalism, that's it."

Tonight's episode, the wokey-pokey - - yes, it's the woke's only deflection to ignore the Virginia election. First up, New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd warns Dems that the losses will keep coming if they keep embracing wokeness while blaming the party for violating the pledge to be cool, calm and reassuring following President Trump. But some Dems aren't listening. Texas Lieutenant Governor Candidate Matthew Dowd declared Sunday that Jesus would be accused of being woke if he were around today, which I have to say seems hard to prove. But remember, unlike the woke mob, Jesus was always for forgiveness. So, leave it to the only sensible Democrat to sum things up. Tulsi Gabbard recently spoke to the shadowy figure known as \"HANNITY.\""
