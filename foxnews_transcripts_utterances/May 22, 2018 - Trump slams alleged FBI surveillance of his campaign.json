Instead, baristas, people making far less money than the consultants, will be forced to ask other patrons if someone's behavior bothers them before taking action.

Show some guts. Go over to Russian and ask them what's going on, or use your contacts to find out what they have to say. Instead, you're going up to these ancillary people on the Trump campaign, and nobody says they're major players, and trying to find out what somebody might have whispered to them in a drunken conversation.

I don't blame him for finding out Carter Page, Cloves and Caputo, what was happening with these guys and the names that came out. Why wouldn't you be curious about that?

There was no damage done to President Trump's campaign. In fact, I mean, there's some people who are arguing that because they were conducting counterintelligence operations, as opposed to a criminal investigation, they were actually trying to protect and try to act as a buffer to keep the Russian influence out of all the campaign, including the Trump campaign. But I think what you're seeing now in response to your question, Dana, is an effort by the president, and I think it's unprecedented to sort of weaponized an investigation into the investigation into him."

So let's take the Yanny, which is the Trump collusion story, it's been going on for 18 months. We haven't found a damn thing. Then you look at the Laurel of collusion, FBI, Hillary, Democrats, the British spy, one informant, maybe two informants inserted in the campaign. If you compare these two sides, you've got one where there's a meeting with a woman about the Magnitsky Act, that's something like that, right? Oh, that's Earth shattering. Meanwhile, you've got a dossier paid for by Hillary. You've got an informant, maybe two, placed as a favor. You have the press playing it down. You have the dossier contents leaked. If we start comparing these things, one is making a hell a lot more sense as collusion than the other."

You will never get to the bottom of it as long as there's a -- it is this type of operation. We've got to go back to the 9/11 commission to get answers.

Now, Starbucks, realizing they just sent an open invite to the nation's homeless, now says sleeping, drug or alcohol use will not be tolerated. So how will this work? Well, like panicky responses, the consequences won't be borne by the execs. The CEO won't be on the front lines. He'll be too busy monitoring his company's Twitter feed. Instead, baristas, people making far less money than the consultants, will be forced to ask other patrons if someone's behavior bothers them before taking action. So this whole thing is going to end up looking like a rerun from \"COPS.\" And it puts pressure on employees and later the police will be blamed by both the unruly patrons and social justice warriors now present at these overpriced coffee temples. As you know, 8,000-plus locations will shut next Tuesday for unconscious bias training. I call it a 'woke-uccino.' Unconscious bias training. You see the trick there? If this is unconscious, how can you deny your bias? It's automatic and invisible, so you can't know you're a bigot. Only in today's PC's America could a coffeeshop decide that it's the moral conscience of the nation. So Starbucks, keep the new $7 Virtue Signal Vente. We drink coffee to be awake, not woke."

You can say you're listening to your spouse while you're watching a game, but you're actually switching. It's imperceptible. But you're actually switching, and so you're actually missing out on important things. And this is actually pretty deadly.
