Well, he's here to blow the lid on Biden's plans and explain how Trump has aided previously underserved communities in a way that Democrats never have. But first. Punishing your kids. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Today's New York Times published a poll. Now of course take it with a grain of salt. That shows among other things a huge gender gap in the 2020 race. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While President Trump, it says is leading Biden among men by six points, he supposedly trails among women voters by a staggering 23 points. Now if the poll is anywhere near accurate, the president will have a hard time closing that gap with women, but he could narrow it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The unions own masks are off. As we see just how corrupt they are in the case of the Fairfax County school system in Virginia it's one of the wealthiest suburbs in America. The teacher's union there in a letter to community members made it clear that they don't want kids to return to school. Get this, until next August. They're demanding that the school board and the superintendent draw and hold the line by keeping public schools virtual for the remainder of the 2021 school year. This would of course no longer be school but institutionalized child abuse. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, my hope is that school officials obviously see how radical and damaging this would be to children.

Now, years ago, the Obama administration implemented what's called the affirmative, the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule under the guise of desegregating the suburbs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course, the real goal wasn't racial justice, but concentrating power and control. The rule allowed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to abolish single family zoning to promote high density developments in residential areas. In essence, the suburbs would have become social engineering playgrounds for D.C. bureaucrats and coastal elites. Thankfully, Trump repealed this rule back in July, but now the Left is backing an even more radical plan. It was a bill put forward by Senator Cory Booker to push low income housing developments into the suburbs. To keep states from rejecting this policy, Booker's bill would hold 12 billion dollars of highway funding hostage. This would be a federal takeover of local zoning laws, in essence. And Biden, he fully supports it. If Booker's bill became law, the suburb that you scrimped and saved to buy a home in will be turned into an easement for high rises and apartment complexes. Your property values will go down while the crime rate in your neighborhood could very well go up. Now, the real goal here isn't desegregation. The suburbs already are already desegregated. In fact, under a Trump, black homeownership skyrocketed from 41.7 percent to 46.3 percent by the end of March. Now, for Hispanics, it shot up from 44 percent in December 2016 to 48.9 percent at the end of first quarter 2020. Joining me now is HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson.

Well, he's here to blow the lid on Biden's plans and explain how Trump has aided previously underserved communities in a way that Democrats never have. But first. Punishing your kids. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Today's New York Times published a poll. Now of course take it with a grain of salt. That shows among other things a huge gender gap in the 2020 race. While President Trump, it says is leading Biden among men by six points, he supposedly trails among women voters by a staggering 23 points.

Well, they're afraid that their kids are going to go to school and they're going to get sick or they're going to bring home sickness back to their own communities and back to their own homes. But what any honest adult knows, well what do they know that virtual learning is a train wreck for almost every kid out there, especially for those who are poor. But my business handlers, they don't care about the kids. Instead they keep concerning themselves with what their political allies think. The teacher's unions, they need to keep them happy. So, while they demand that five-year-old wear masks. The unions own masks are off. As we see just how corrupt they are in the case of the Fairfax County school system in Virginia it's one of the wealthiest suburbs in America. The teacher's union there in a letter to community members made it clear that they don't want kids to return to school. Get this, until next August. They're demanding that the school board and the superintendent draw and hold the line by keeping public schools virtual for the remainder of the 2021 school year. This would of course no longer be school but institutionalized child abuse. Now, my hope is that school officials obviously see how radical and damaging this would be to children. But given who sits on the board my expectations are quite low that after all these are the same geniuses who instead of coming up with a reopening plan wasted the summer with efforts like this."

The metric for safe reopening should be 14 days of zero community spread, zero community spread. Not only is that impossible, an impossible metric to meet, it's illogical and unnecessary. And perhaps the biggest blow to the pro-closure crowd is The New York Times latest expose on how the experts were totally wrong about the New York City public schools becoming COVID breeding grounds. Yesterday, the Times reported that out of 16,348 staff members and students tested randomly by the school system in the first week, there were only 28 positives, 20 staff and eight students. And when officials put mobile testing units at schools near Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods that have had new outbreaks only four positive case turned up out of more than 3300 tests.

Inequality and the rush to open school doors with high background transmission rates places unsafe pressure on low income communities and our most under-resourced public schools. Now, this is seriously misguided, but do not think that a return to normal under Joe Biden will end any of this insanity.

And what he or she learns online about America, it's going to be pure Left-wing propaganda, courtesy, of course, of the 1619 project. So, under President Biden, this scenario might be great for Black Lives Matter and of course, the NEA, but it'll be horrendous in every other way. So, how could any parent, especially any mom, support this? The social isolation that comes with in-home learning is reason enough to abandon this immediately. If teachers, otherwise healthy people don't feel comfortable coming back into the classroom or they should go into another profession. They're just as essential as grocery store workers, for instance, and grocery store workers can't just simply abandon in person work because they feel unsafe. Night-after-night, we've shown you that the only people who benefit under a President Biden will be his big donors and other political cronies. Everyone else will be asked to work harder for less, and our children's lives will be upended for absolutely no good reason. I think women were naturally protective of our children, and that's just the way we are, and for this reason alone, female voters should drop their old hang-ups about Trump. He's not the heartless or mean force in this race. He's the opposite. He wants your sons and daughters in school and learning, and he wants you to be free to work, if you'd like, for your family.

A lot of government workers, lawyers, lobbyists, big money in Fairfax County. But there are a lot of immigrant families too, in the public schools. They're all working, so they're all working.

The meanest thing of all, Amber, is to see a child in front of a screen, in a room for six and seven hours a day. That is the meanest, most heartless thing of - I'm going to say that to every day till the election, moms wake up across America. Amber, thank you for joining us tonight and best of luck. Now, since early May, the ANGLE has been on the forefront of bringing you facts and data that support school reopenings. And for our trouble, we were ridiculed. We were vilified by the so-called experts and their media lackeys. But making this a political issue and not a scientific one, it was the medical establishment that ended up doing enormous harm to the reputations of their themselves. And, of course, they eroded decades of goodwill and trust. So, the question is, will they ever be able to get it back? Joining me now is Dr. Harvey Risch, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, and Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology in Washington, D.C. Dr. Oskoui, there's so many other issues beyond schools where the medical establishment has been wrong. But I want to start with you a particular comment that you found very jarring. Watch."

We've been hearing this from our so-called experts who have quoted poorer models, models where they can't even show how the data has reached to fearmonger the American public. The reality is there's nothing to suggest. It's in fact, quite the converse. There are two studies quoted by NPR just a few hours ago that show that clearly death rates from those getting infected by COVID are much, much lower. And we know why. It's called viral attenuation. Bueller's Ratch (ph) we've talked about this for months. So, we're seeing the virus weakening. We're seeing younger people get it. But this is viral attenuation.

Now they're suggesting that what physicians are getting better at helping patients survive this illness.

That medication and others hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin, combined with other medications, is essentially almost completely effective in reducing risks of hospitalization and mortality when it's used in the first - within the first five days. That is the answer to how we can open the society to reopen the society. That is the answer for dealing with school openings. That's the answer for everything opening."

And then you have, as Dr. Risch wrote about in his Washington Examiner piece, you have all these former FDA officials, Gotlieb and Kessler and McClellan, coming out in an op ed trashing Trump for hurting the FDA.

Vitamin D and zinc, the data there is irrefutable, not nearly as controversial as, say, masks or social distancing or lockdowns.

Ireland, people must limit movement and stay out of each other's homes. And the Netherlands only allows a maximum of three people in your home per day.

But let's stop looking at case rates, let's look at death rates. Ireland has minuscule death rates and has had a very stable, very low death rate for months. Same is true for Scotland. In England, it's mostly confined to London. We need to start looking at what Farr (ph) always taught us from 1820, look at death rates. The viruses attenuating.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, the Left wants you to believe that what President Trump just said there was racist, but of course, they say that to distract from their own nefarious goals, because if Biden is elected, the suburbs as we know them will be changed dramatically. To understand how we have to first back up a little bit. Now, years ago, the Obama administration implemented what's called the affirmative, the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule under the guise of desegregating the suburbs. Of course, the real goal wasn't racial justice, but concentrating power and control. The rule allowed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to abolish single family zoning to promote high density developments in residential areas. In essence, the suburbs would have become social engineering playgrounds for D.C. bureaucrats and coastal elites. Thankfully, Trump repealed this rule back in July, but now the Left is backing an even more radical plan. It was a bill put forward by Senator Cory Booker to push low income housing developments into the suburbs. To keep states from rejecting this policy, Booker's bill would hold 12 billion dollars of highway funding hostage. This would be a federal takeover of local zoning laws, in essence. And Biden, he fully supports it. If Booker's bill became law, the suburb that you scrimped and saved to buy a home in will be turned into an easement for high rises and apartment complexes. Your property values will go down while the crime rate in your neighborhood could very well go up. Now, the real goal here isn't desegregation. The suburbs already are already desegregated. In fact, under a Trump, black homeownership skyrocketed from 41.7 percent to 46.3 percent by the end of March. Now, for Hispanics, it shot up from 44 percent in December 2016 to 48.9 percent at the end of first quarter 2020. Joining me now is HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson. Now, Dr. Carson, the Left is cloaking this in the language of racial equality, but isn't this about control in the end?"

      "speaker": "DR. BEN CARSON, HUD SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it really is, and the Left brings everything back to in identity politics, but the fact of the matter is what the president is talking about here is local control, federalism. And I get to visit all kinds of communities all over the country all the time. And there are beautiful mixed income, mixed use complexes all over the place. But it is under local control. People have an opportunity to discuss it, decide where they want to put things. And that's the way the United States of America was designed. Also, the previous administration had a system in place that encourage people to move to what they call areas of opportunity. And a lot of the money followed them. Instead, this administration says, let's bring the opportunity to the people. That was the whole concept behind the opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly well. And we want people to be able to have choice. They can stay where they are. They can move, but let the people be the ones who make the decisions. And that doesn't mean that we're backing off on any kind of civil rights. We have a very strong record in civil rights."

Maybe you want to live in a single family. Then the next month you find out that the single-family house next to you is smashed and abolished to put up a five-story building because your community is worried about losing federal highway dollars. I mean, that's extortion."

It's the reason that it's a destination place for people all over the world right now, and people form caravans trying to get in here.

We have some photos. I believe this is Minneapolis -- it is Seattle. OK. So there's a single family home on this screen, and then you see a construction project under way. And it's multiple family unit houses. There's nothing wrong with having a multiple unit home, but in a neighborhood that was zoned for single family housing. People have to understand, Dr. Carson, this isn't going to be happening in the tony neighborhoods of Georgetown or Bel Air. No, no, it's not going to happen there. It's going to happen in places like Howard County outside of the Washington, D.C. area, or maybe in Alexandria, or suburbs farther out. It's not going to happen in the elite suburbs where all of the rich people live."

The Senator Ron Johnson's committee issued a report which is available on online for free, 87 pages, that covers the tip of the iceberg, which is much bigger than this computer. It includes Ukraine, but it also includes Russia. It includes Romania. It includes Kazakhstan. It includes the biggest of all, China. And by the way, the report that just came out that Facebook actually has Chinese communist experts on censorship working in an office in Seattle to run their censorship program should be chilling to every single American.

They are about suppressing information damaging to the left, and only exposing information damaging to the other side. And this is why they have to cover up the story.

No, he turned it in, and it was then turned into the FBI.

      "utterance": "It's time, I believe, that Twitter hold him accountable to the same terms and conditions, the same rules of the road that every other user is subject to. The leading propagators of false information come from the top. It's coming from Donald Trump and some of the leading conservative voices that echo him."

      "utterance": "Isn't it so ironic that when these platforms were first developed, they seemed to be exhilarating platforms that would liberate people to communicate with each other, engage in free and robust debate. And some of that rhetoric still remains, but the truth of it is they have now become terrifying instruments of suppression. Wouldn't it be ironic if Facebook and Twitter become the ways in which our liberties become extinct? Orwell in \"1984\" when he spoke of Big Brother, he spoke about the state, what he called the inner part. But he also spoke about the outer part, which is those collaborators with the totalitarian state that make the totalitarianism spread into every nook and cranny of society. And I'm afraid much of our media, including the digital media, are now accessories of tyranny."

      "utterance": "They are not so worried that Joe Biden is on the take from China because they are on the take from China. So ultimately it becomes a collaborative enterprise in which the Democratic candidate is just part of a larger racket in which not only he, but lots of people in the think tanks, in the institution, the digital media are also making money."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Rationality hasn't quite embraced the new left, and we see that in the latest craze from young liberal women. Instead of making a cogent point, they've pulled out their cameras to do a little something different. Warning -- if you have dogs or other susceptible animals in the room, please remove them now."
