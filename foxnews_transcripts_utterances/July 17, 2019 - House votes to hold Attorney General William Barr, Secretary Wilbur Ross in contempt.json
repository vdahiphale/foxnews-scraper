JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Sure. He's certainly relishing it. It's dividing the opposition, which is always good for the incumbent. But Nancy Pelosi is in a dilemma here. She has moderates in her caucus and they don't want to be back home campaigning on this next year. She doesn't think it will help Democrats next year in the election, so she's trying to hold that off. But she has this progressive wing that wants to go there, and that's her dilemma right now. But all of these subpoenas and contempt citations, this is ankle biting on the part of Democrats. They won't really pull the trigger here with impeachment, at least not yet. And this is what they're doing in the meantime.

      "utterance": "So you were mentoring impeachment. The effort to bring up articles of impeachment today failed in the House. The president reacting to that on Twitter, as he often does, just moments ago. \"The United States House of Representatives has just overwhelmingly voted to kill the resolution on impeachment, 332-95-1. This is perhaps the most ridiculous and time- consuming project I've ever had to work on. Impeachment of your president who has let the greatest economic boom in history of our country, the best jobs numbers, biggest tax reduction, rebuilt military, and much more is now over. They should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States again.\" Jason, he seems to be relishing this kind of fight that has developed. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Sure. He's certainly relishing it. It's dividing the opposition, which is always good for the incumbent. But Nancy Pelosi is in a dilemma here. She has moderates in her caucus and they don't want to be back home campaigning on this next year. She doesn't think it will help Democrats next year in the election, so she's trying to hold that off. But she has this progressive wing that wants to go there, and that's her dilemma right now. But all of these subpoenas and contempt citations, this is ankle biting on the part of Democrats. They won't really pull the trigger here with impeachment, at least not yet. And this is what they're doing in the meantime. When Republicans controlled the House, they cited Eric Holder, and it had absolutely no impact on Eric Holder."

And the reason I say that is a large part of the country, Bret, including most Republicans, no longer find the mainstream media or cultural and political elites credible. And so when they all unanimously condemn a Trump tweet for being racist, a lot of people say that's not true, last week you were saying Nancy Pelosi was racist. Beto O'Rourke said he was racist a few weeks ago. Everyone is racist now. And so they are going to start looking at the actual issue involved, which is this conflict between Trump and the squad. And the more that the squad is out there as the mascot of the Democratic Party, the more the Democratic Party is in trouble."

It's nonsense. He was watching television. He was responding to something on television. What has happened since is this scramble to rationalize them and put a political strategy together. What often happens is the Democrats help them in that effort, and I think that's partly what happened here. But what we've seen over the last few days, again, is how just divided this House Democratic conference is. The sniping on background from some of these numbers, the moderate members, very few will go on the record because they're quite fearful of the huge Twitter followings with AOC, but the amount of backbiting is just incredible."

And Trump got in the way of that. And that's why I think this tweet brought them together, and therefore that's what made it a political misstep, regardless of whether you think it was racist or not."

Everything Darius makes is donated to shelters across the U.S. and overseas, and he's very successful so far. Those animals look good. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
