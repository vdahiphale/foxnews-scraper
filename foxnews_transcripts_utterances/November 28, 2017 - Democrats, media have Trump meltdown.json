This is part of his strategy and his tactic in the way that he communicate and tries to negotiate as a businessman, a nontraditional politician with the other side. And he's trying to push them a little bit, expose them, call them out in the hopes that some of that public pressure will bring them closer towards what he wants, ideal coming to fruition. I don't know if it's going to work because they're old-school politicians, he's old-school businessman. So it's a little bit two different worlds.

What he's basically saying, here's a metaphor, you're playing golf and your buddy slices it into the woods and you say nice shot, Tiger. What you're saying is that Tiger is a superior golfer and you're not Tiger Woods. With Pocahontas is basically saying, Liz Warren, you're no Pocahontas. You pretended to be a Native American, but you're not a Native American. These are Native Americans. You're an imposter. It would be like watching Chris Cuomo -- the media will understand, Chris Cuomo on CNN and watch him babble incoherently and you just go, good job, Cronkite. That's not an insult, that's not an insult to Cronkite. It's a gift because he's revered. The same way Pocahontas is. The media, they're being disingenuous by saying that this is a smear. It's actually the opposite of a smear because it's pointing out that she is nothing like the person. And to say that it's a smear, you're being actually really dishonest. It's a lie."

Everybody assumed Hillary was going to be president, so things like, I believe, Uranium One, or the fake dossier, even the unmasking. Potentially the Harvey Weinstein revelations may not have even seen the light of day. These things -- and even Donna Brazile's revelations about the rigging. This all came out now as Donald Trump is president. The Obama administration has a history of cracking down on whistle-blowers. You have these ATF officials with fast and the furious, they were gagged. The Benghazi military contractors, they had to sign nondisclosure agreements. We've seen people at the IRS retire early. The V.A. guy who blew the whistle on that scandal, he was harassed. He was made to do, you know, ridiculous little work in the corner office and punished for blowing the whistle there. And we all know how the Obama administration treated the press. James Rosen, who had his emails looked at and was accused of being some sort of co-conspirator. So, you know, I don't like any of this.

Then he gets involved in a situation that's thoroughly political, which is the overblown attention to Hillary Clinton's emails, never leaked, never hacked, nothing to them. She is the ultimate authority as secretary of state on what is to be classified for the secretary of state's -- oh, from the secretary of state's office. He comes in and says after the fact and essentially saying, well, I'm revealing them now and I see that there is something here, and it's reportedly about drones and the like, and about methods, as you heard him say in the tape about methods and sources. This could have been even above top-secret. This is after the fact. This is his view after the fact. It's not the same view held by other people. So now he comes forward and says, hey, guess what, people in the congress said to me, hey, they're going to be shooting at you. Yeah, geez, guess what, this is politics.

It cost them the election by thinking that way. It exposes the chief problem of the Democrats. They were in pants suit denial. They couldn't come to grips the fact that Hillary's incompetent entitlement and arrogance led them to this spot where they have an incredibly flawed candidate who broke the law. If she had gone to jail, or she's been arrested, or whatever, something would have happened, you probably would have had a Biden-Bernie ticket, it would be called the grumpy-old men ticket, and they probably would have won.

Laura Bush did an interview I think last month saying that she thought she was exceedingly gracious and lovely. What I see when I watch her is that -- we're showing pictures in here with children. I didn't know we're going to do that, but I'm glad we are, because it seems like that is when she has the most genuine, happy moments. And she brings such light into their lives. Just like other first ladies have done before her. So I wonder. I don't think that Vanity Fair made up these quotes. I think that they probably have somebody on background willing to say them. But if you're going to do this to a first lady, you should have the guts to say it on the record, and they don't."

But that story isn't about what she was. The story is about how she is. And she's kind of amazing. I mean, what kind of person, like I'm joking about being first lady, but let's say I'm married, my wife moved to Russia and she became the leader of Russia. And I had to speak Russian before 50 million people. That's what she did here. There's, like -- this woman was mocked and ridiculed by feminists, because she was a glamour model. Well, this glamour model stood up between 30 to 50 million American people and in her second or third language, she spoke to them. And that is -- I mean, nobody, no columnist for any glamour -- for Glamour or for Cosmo, any feminist blogger. You couldn't do that and - - you couldn't utter one sentence to save your life, and this woman went and did it. She had no plans for this. She didn't expect this to happen, and she went ahead and did it. So it's not about who she was with the trepidation. It's what she became, and she was brave, even though she was terrified."

When she was over in China, the youth of China, they idolize her. And I think she's a very classy and striking and elegant and graceful fashion icon and woman that a lot of people look up to. And the president relies on her counsel. He trusts her. She trusts him. And she's an immigrant who knows five languages. And for Vanity Fair -- we should call them Vanity Unfair -- to attack her and put so much negativity. Greg liked that one. Into something like this just to sell these magazines is so wrong.

And many times, it was because they were lacking a father figure or a role model or some kind of parental supervision in the home to be a positive and driving force. And what I saw was young people oftentimes, especially in troubled areas in inner cities, ending up gravitating towards gangs and using those as sort of a surrogacy for the lack of parental and father figure in the home."

That if you look at this, black people, black men 12 times as likely as white men to be in jail for drugs. I think blacks about 14 percent of the population, 45 percent of the jail population in terms of drug crimes."

Maybe you weren't good enough. So he seems very fair and balanced. And you said that the conservative media is seizing on this."

They're not going to highlight it. So I think both sides are at work here. Now, I would say Denzel Washington..."

There's bipartisan agreement on getting there. Just not with the attorney general."

And it's not -- it's not blacks who are upset about talking about it. It's white liberals. If you say marriage is better for families, you don't get attacked by blacks. You get attacked by white female feminists. They're the ones that say, like, \"You don't need to have a family. You don't need to have a husband and a wife, or a husband and husband. You don't need that.\" So No. 1, you can't talk about that. You cannot wrestle communities away from -- from the liberal stranglehold and those regulations that they have there. So you can't have an honest dialogue around liberal failings of cities. You have to start talking about -- you can no longer demonize law enforcement. You have to turn law enforcement into a career for minorities, the way what happened in New York City, in which the majority is the minority. And in order to do that, you have to start rethinking, what can you -- who can you hire if they have a police record? You have to start looking at the drug laws and make it easier for people to become police officers."
