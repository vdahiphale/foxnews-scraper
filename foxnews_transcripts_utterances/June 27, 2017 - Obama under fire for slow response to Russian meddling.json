And I assume that they are doing that for business reasons, which I don't know if that is actually working for them, but also because there was this preconceived idea. And what he says in the video is that what he thought was more important was climate change, OK. So there is also another -- they were having an internal fight over what was more important. And you could imagine there's plenty of people in the newsroom which all thought climate change was a lot more important, and the head guys were like, actually, it's not rating it all. Let's go back to the thing that was rating. I can understand that. On the Anthony Scaramucci thing, and I sent you a note about this, he was so classy and gracious when CNN apologized and he was like that's good, we can move on. Then the reporters actually get fired and I'm interested to find out their side of the story. You know one of them, Eric Lichtblau, he's a very formidable adversary as a reporter when it comes to covering the government. He was the one that broke the news about KSM being held and George W. Bush had to come out with that and the \"New York Times\" ran that even though we asked them not to. But I think that they are trying to cover stories too quickly and to meet a preconceived notion and there's no need to. There's plenty of time.

That's the question many are asking about President Obama after \"The Five\"'s bombshell report last night about how back in October, Mr. Obama said it was basically impossible to rig the presidential election. Obama said this despite learning in August that Russia was in the midst of a sophisticated cyber campaign aimed at influencing the election. According to FOX News, President Obama did not mention the Russian meddling once between the time then-candidate Trump accepted the Republican nomination in Election Day. The question now is whether Mr. Obama owes the country and explanation for his silence. And just in case anybody missed it last night, here is what President Obama said about rigging an election.

Which is how do you protect the elections going forward like in 2020 or even 2018 or 2020.

So, he made -- these are all really big mistakes. And it's hilarious that the more that you dig into this Russia story, it becomes the Democrats story, not a Republican story, and it makes President Obama into the world's worst renter.

And May of 2016, they were already actively involved in unmasking officials and trying to find any proof of collusion, obtaining FISA warrants within the Trump administration -- the campaign rather at the time, trying to see if anybody was colluding with the Russians.

Just imagine if President Obama at the time went to the America people and said that the Russians have rigged our election and we've got to stop it, and I'm going to have a full-fledged investigation. Folks like yourself would have said, oh, they are tipping the scale for Hillary Clinton, they are blaming this on Donald Trump. So the President had to make a calculated decision. Do we do everything we can behind the scenes to stop this, including addressing Putin directly at the G7, or do we go out to the American people, possibly because don't forget, Republican controlled House and the Republican controlled Senate have our FBI director subpoenaed, have James Clapper subpoenaed and engaged literally interfering the election by endless hearings."

See you can't even touch anything. I mean, Schumer a.k.a. clown face, says that it's rotten at the core. What is at the core of this bill? Choice. So here's the difficulty we have to understand. We are comparing something mandatory, ObamaCare, to something that is optional, which is this new thing. It's like comparing a prison cell to a bedroom. One is mandatory, one you can leave. You can leave your bedroom, you can't leave a prison cell, you can leave the new bill, you can't leave ObamaCare. So instead of treating these options as the same, because you can't compare a prison cell to a bedroom, why don't you make the cell more like a bedroom and introduce competition and choice.

You know, it's like CNN, the Russia story, it's like a kid staring at a pot of water on the stove having no idea that the burner is off. It's not getting any hotter. But now I know why. It's because they had to keep matching the narrative. They created a story to match the narrative for the purposes of ratings. They were treating the story like professional wrestling. They had villains and heroes and they were following a path towards a climax, except that the climax never comes. That's why they keep rolling the stuff out. And keep going on and on and on. I'll tell you what. We do fixate on stories at FOX, but it's not for ratings. It's because we give a damn. I mean, we talked about Benghazi every single day and it wasn't for ratings, that's for sure. But it's because we cared. And this is why your camera persona, on this table, and your beliefs in the green room should be the same. Because sooner or later you're going to get found out.

Remember when they covered the plane, the missing plane for like, I don't know, however long that was? And I assume that they are doing that for business reasons, which I don't know if that is actually working for them, but also because there was this preconceived idea. And what he says in the video is that what he thought was more important was climate change, OK. So there is also another -- they were having an internal fight over what was more important. And you could imagine there's plenty of people in the newsroom which all thought climate change was a lot more important, and the head guys were like, actually, it's not rating it all. Let's go back to the thing that was rating. I can understand that. On the Anthony Scaramucci thing, and I sent you a note about this, he was so classy and gracious when CNN apologized and he was like that's good, we can move on. Then the reporters actually get fired and I'm interested to find out their side of the story. You know one of them, Eric Lichtblau, he's a very formidable adversary as a reporter when it comes to covering the government. He was the one that broke the news about KSM being held and George W. Bush had to come out with that and the \"New York Times\" ran that even though we asked them not to. But I think that they are trying to cover stories too quickly and to meet a preconceived notion and there's no need to. There's plenty of time. There's plenty of viewers, but to go with a one source story when you have four reporters on it, that seems to me to be way out of bounds."

I think the video is a big black eye for CNN no matter how hard they try to spin it. But the core of the video is what everybody already knew, that CNN is biased against Trump, wants him to leave office, and they are pushing at the Russia story for ratings and cash. Now, if a Fox News producer was caught in a video sting saying that the company wants Obama impeached and they're pushing a bogus story about the president's birth certificate just for ratings, and the CEO is on board with it that would be national news.
