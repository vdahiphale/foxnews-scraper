And for the first time there is like no war in the western hemisphere and he is pushing an ideology, ironically that crushes economic expansion and inevitably results in violence and war. Because when people want to achieve, you have to -- if you want an equality of outcomes you have to crush them. I mean, he is making a case for socialism during the greatest economic time in history. That's like going to a healthy village in the middle ages and say, and extolling the virtues of the plague. It is absolute -- it makes no sense. So, it's wrong. It's actually morally wrong."

Notice how he caps the number for his estate tax at $3.5 million where he is worth about $1.5 million. Interesting. He has changed his stump speech from millionaires and billionaires to just billionaires. But he is preaching something -- you know, he is saying he wants to re-do the new deal. That FDR had a good vision for the country. But if you actually look at the results for that for the past 50 years, we spent $21 trillion, which was supposed to bring people out of poverty. It has not. But capitalism has. Capitalism has not only brought people out of poverty in America but all over the world throughout the past half a century. And that is what we should be focused on. Not taking from others and saying that every single thing is a right. And one more thing. He keeps saying that this isn't about real socialism. He doesn't want to take over every kind of industry. In order to provide economic rights and healthcare rights and every right that he listed in his speech, you have to take over industries and force them to provide it because that's the only way that you can deliver on those promises."

He was also talking about taking over not only healthcare but entire sectors like banking. And he really hasn't changed that much. The thing about Bernie Sanders you try to press him he is actually very good at weaseling out of answering some of these critical questions. Define socialism, because they are constantly changing the term and the definition. And he says, well, it's Democratic socialism. So, there is a qualification there. But that's still socialism and Katie is absolutely right. It is a taking. It is a government taking and the idea that the government owes me this. The government can't just provide it. The government has to take it from somewhere else. And I think people are going to be shocked when they realize they're the ones who are being taken from."

Trump wasn't the one that threw $500 million at Solyndra. Trump is actually jawboning a lot of these big corporations to keep production here instead of offshoring it overseas. He is jawboning like Lockheed Martin to keep the price down on the jets. Wall Street donated more to Hillary than they did to Donald Trump. He is constantly going after billionaires like Bezos and what's his name George Soros?

What raises prices if you go to any socialist country and you can't find a loaf of bread and if you find one it's $47.50. Competition."

Let's question what she actually got right, very, very little of it. She sat there when Lawrence O'Donnell who is on after her said that maybe President Trump responded to Syria and that the Syrians launched a chemical weapons attack to distract away from the Russia issue. I mean, that's a pretty serious conspiratorial charge to make. And this is all about the double standard, right? Conservative media, conservatives are never allowed to ask the questions. Whenever they get a question at the White House press briefing or during a press conference they are berated by the press as not real journalists capable of asking questions.

You what he did, he Googled great commencement speeches and then he gotten into that. Well, you know maybe if I just put him - and next time just quote people.
