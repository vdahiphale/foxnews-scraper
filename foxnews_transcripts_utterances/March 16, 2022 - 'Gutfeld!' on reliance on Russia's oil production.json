Now, in this point, the objective would obviously be to stop the Russians. But the not our war thing still very much applies. I've heard more and more about a no-fly zone.

So, like, none of it makes sense.

A statement from Ukraine's foreign ministry says many people are buried in the rubble, but there's no word immediately on casualty. Satellite imagery from Maxar space technology shows the word, children, written in large white letters in Russian in front and behind the theatre. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine says he is heartbroken by what the Russians are doing to the people of his country. That statement coming after the theatre attack. And Russian forces have reportedly taken hundreds hostage at a nearby hospital. They're now using it as a firing position. It's the same hospital where a maternity ward was damaged last week. One doctor there says he's near the breaking point after treating the injured and dying children. In central Kyiv, a 12-storey apartment building erupted in flames after being hit by shrapnel. People in the capital city have been huddling in their homes and shelters during a 35-hour curfew that's ending this morning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy getting a standing ovation as he went before the U.S. Congress, once again pleading for help from America and for the U.S. and NATO to create a no fly zone."

      "utterance": "Well, hello there. Welcome back. For the good news. Our very own Benjamin Hall is out of Ukraine and I hear is in good spirits after being seriously injured. We're all very relieved to finally hear some good news. And finally, Ben and I have something in common. We both suffer. He's in a hospital with strangers. And I have my mother in law living with me. Relax freaks, it's a joke. Now, the last time I talked to him, we plan to get drunk when he's back in NYC, and I'm holding him to it. Mainly because he has a British accent, a perfect hairline, and a charming demeanor. I'm just going to tell everyone he's in one direction, and hope I get the leftovers. It's disgusting. So, as we are on the brink of World War, what are the media geniuses obsessing over? Well, did you see The Atlantic magazines take on Ukraine? The headline \"On top of everything else, nuclear war would be a climate problem.\" Yes, that's the priority. A country gets vaporized, but it's also one degree warmer for the shell shock survivors. And God help them. If you're a radioactive zombie, you might forget to sort your recycling on trash day. Or worse, the fallout would cover the co-exist sticker on your Prius. Try applying that logic elsewhere. Sure, you might get terminal cancer, but imagine what that does to your tennis elbow. But if only it was the media that was this myopic, the House Dems want Biden to declare a national climate emergency. And why not? Climate emergency is the left's second favorite freak out, when blaming everything on racism wants to take the night off. And the goal, to ban oil drilling on federal lands. It's more proof the left are in lockstep with what Putin wants. For us to be dependent on other countries like his for energy. Personally, I think all this green talk is Russian propaganda. That's right, lefties. It's you who are Putin puppets, not me. Speaking of, Putin actually claims he now wants reparations for Alaska. And I say, why not? How about 40 acres, and Joy Behar. Now, the Dems are also calling to end fossil fuel subsidies. I'm for that if by fossil fuels, they mean the five bottles of Ensure that Joe drinks a day. Of course, how does that help the average American? Well, it doesn't, and that's the point. It's part of the ideology of punishment, which is not just the name of my favorite club downtown. I have my own whip locker. But it's also how the left views policy. They don't mind high gas prices, they want them to punish us for being greedy capitalists. If I sound like AOC right now, that's the point too. Our energy policies are being shaped by someone who should be making banana daiquiris at Applebee's. This also is why they denied the crime wave and let violent thugs off scot free, to punish us for 400 years of oppression. Apparently, elderly Asian women must have owned slaves too. They also lauded riots as protest. That's punishment for your uncaring economic system. Let us have free stuff or die. And of course, you should wear masks indefinitely, they say, because you deserve it. Not about safety, it's about punishment. Otherwise, they'd wear masks to with their award shows and gala events. But really, it's because they can't stand to see a smile, hear you speak or know that you're breathing freely without their permission. It's the new ideology, morphing politics into morality becoming a new religion, in which there's no forgiveness, only confession, followed by penance. Bless me father, for I have sinned. I just filled my Ford F-150 with unleaded. OK, son. Your pennants, say five hail Gretas and retrofit your house with solar panels. And since everything the left wants is based on punishing you, it's OK if it helps our adversaries. Let's take Russia who duped Europe into depending on their energy by funding rabid environmental groups. As we start to shun Russian oil, we're now finding out that they actually funded green groups that crapped on non-Russian fuels. They were using disinformation within green groups to steer countries away from fracking and shale gas in favor of their imported Russian gas. It's the equivalent of shutting down rehab clinics to addicts would go back to their old ways. That all make so much sense now, doesn't it? Of course, you need to be a sucker to get sucked We had leaders who took -- that came out in a weird way. But we had leaders who took environmental advice from a brat like Greta Thunberg and a president who dreamed of sniffing her hair. That's because the ideology of punishment means punishing our industry by bolstering there's because we are the oppressor. So, now, it did see President blames Putin for rising prices, when it was him and his stupid party all along. Fact is it takes months to affect oil and gas prices. What we're seeing now is the direct result of Joe Biden's anti industry policies from the moment he first soiled the Oval Office carpets. Sadly, Russia and China knew what an easy mark our virtue signaling White House was. They were happily playing chess, while our bozos got lost in the ice cream slopes of Candy land."

Now, in this point, the objective would obviously be to stop the Russians. But the not our war thing still very much applies. I've heard more and more about a no-fly zone.

In fact, this week, as Boris Johnson is going around in the Middle East, persuading all these charming regimes to pump more oil, they are filling in the two sites in the U.K., which they explored for fracking and filling them with cement. So, like, none of it makes sense. It only happened because the Russians helped to terrify us through the green lobby, that fracking was this incredibly dangerous thing that would cause earthquakes and tsunamis, rather than as most of the time a rumble that's no bigger than an average freight lorry."
