Like Joe Biden talking about corn pop. I could go on forever. Collusion, obstruction, Kavanaugh, Covington, Julie freaking Swetnick, Michael freaking Avenatti, CNN slobbered all over that litigating lollipop. Remember the imminent slaughter of the Kurds or Trump golfing when he was really in Afghanistan visiting the troops? How about Russians putting bounties on U.S. troops under Trump or that non-stop (BLEEP) about tax returns? How about when the phony bombshell book anonymous was falsely claimed to have been penned by a senior Trump official? Then you find out it was a nobody. Remember the media's mockery of rising crime after calling riots mostly peaceful? Those same people who defended looting are now psyched that a granny was sentenced for entering the Capitol building. And now they claim it's the Republicans, not the Democrats who wanted to fund the police. How rich. The media has made so many mistakes, it actually helps them because like Kat's ex's, it's impossible to keep track of all of them. Now when I slam the media people say, but Greg, you are the media. Damn right. I've been doing this for 30 years. I've been all over men's mags, women's mags, political journals, nudism, advocacy. That's how I met Dr. Drew. But I was the odd man out.

It was more disgusting than watching a snuff film. So, I've heard. The process is built on gathering eyeballs, not info to make a profit, you need a narrative so you cover only certain facts in a way that supports the preconceived view of reality. A story that doesn't have a villain does not rate. A story that doesn't unfold like a movie plot holds no interest for the reporter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A story that doesn't make the reporter feel important. Well, like the first draft of a Jesse Watters book, it always gets rewritten and rewritten and rewritten. The media is a story making machine, so it's inherently false. The narratives are decided before the story is written. Obama is good Trump is bad. Sit on the kids in cages photos from the Obama administration report on them as though they were Trump's fault. Never correct the record. Their narrative always Trump's truth. And now reporters must rely on the unstable crazies on Twitter for content. That's the thrust behind wokeism and canceled culture. The Twitter hive is the only thing keeping the media outrage machine afloat. Can you imagine getting ideas from a platform where the anonymous mob rules? It maintains fat salaries for executives in legacy media but imagine today being a young reporter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All you do is write about tweets from losers. Local news is dead. Your story is judged on clicks. So, like a tick on a dog's nuts. It has to drop blood to survive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Guess that's what happens when schools teach junk like Critical Race Theory instead of old-fashioned skills like fighting zombies, killing hookers, and throwing coins at turtles. The poll found that players improved in time management, hand-eye coordination and getting to redoes into their mouths without using their hands. Said the steady sponsor, \"Whether it's critical thinking problem solving or communication, we all have something to gain from gaming, the results show that one of the biggest benefits of gaming is collaborating with other players.\" Now, I don't know about you, but I'm 100 percent certain this study was not paid for by a videogame company, not by that quote. So, thank you, video gamers for keeping your community on the path to self-improvement. Enjoy that microwave pizza, you earned it. Doc, this is it. I think that there is something true to this.

Think about that the wealthiest nation by far got creamed by places like Finland. Finland who just started getting the news a few months ago. So, will our media learn from this humiliating result? No. They buried it like Stelter's treadmill under six months of dirty laundry. Now I bashed the media a lot outside of nude jazzercise. It's my favorite thing to do in front of an open window. See, the media is almost wrong on everything but like a middle school soccer game. They don't like to keep score. But I do. Of course there's the Wuhan lab lie, both the media and big tech bury that claiming even mentioning it was more racist than Sarah Silverman, Justin Trudeau and Ralph Northam in blackface singing mammy. There's the I.G. report showing how the media lied about the Secret Service clearing Lafayette Park so Trump could have a photo op with the Bible. CNN ran with that B.S. especially this guy."

I haven't seen a prediction that wrong since I expected that cold sore to go away. There's the media embracing Jussie Smollett. A story with more holes than a golf course full of pool tables. And that's one of many instances where the media played up hate crimes only to bury them later when they turn out to be false. You also remember all the final nail in the coffin stories about Trump? Arrest is imminent, they would cry and then like the inside of Joy Reid's head, nothing."

    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "What a delusion. You remember when the media joined together prior to a national election to disappear the Hunter Biden story to help their side win? And then when it was safe and Biden had won, the story just magically reemerged. It's all about timing. As even Time Magazine brazenly admitted that the media activist had big tech had joined forces in manipulating narratives and turmoil to sway an election. Crap. Like Joe Biden talking about corn pop. I could go on forever. Collusion, obstruction, Kavanaugh, Covington, Julie freaking Swetnick, Michael freaking Avenatti, CNN slobbered all over that litigating lollipop. Remember the imminent slaughter of the Kurds or Trump golfing when he was really in Afghanistan visiting the troops? How about Russians putting bounties on U.S. troops under Trump or that non-stop (BLEEP) about tax returns? How about when the phony bombshell book anonymous was falsely claimed to have been penned by a senior Trump official? Then you find out it was a nobody. Remember the media's mockery of rising crime after calling riots mostly peaceful? Those same people who defended looting are now psyched that a granny was sentenced for entering the Capitol building. And now they claim it's the Republicans, not the Democrats who wanted to fund the police. How rich. The media has made so many mistakes, it actually helps them because like Kat's ex's, it's impossible to keep track of all of them. Now when I slam the media people say, but Greg, you are the media. Damn right. I've been doing this for 30 years. I've been all over men's mags, women's mags, political journals, nudism, advocacy. That's how I met Dr. Drew. But I was the odd man out. A gorgeous square peg and an ugly stupid hole. But that meant I could watch the proverbial sausage being made. It was more disgusting than watching a snuff film. So, I've heard. The process is built on gathering eyeballs, not info to make a profit, you need a narrative so you cover only certain facts in a way that supports the preconceived view of reality. A story that doesn't have a villain does not rate. A story that doesn't unfold like a movie plot holds no interest for the reporter. A story that doesn't make the reporter feel important. Well, like the first draft of a Jesse Watters book, it always gets rewritten and rewritten and rewritten. The media is a story making machine, so it's inherently false. The narratives are decided before the story is written. Obama is good Trump is bad. Sit on the kids in cages photos from the Obama administration report on them as though they were Trump's fault. Never correct the record. Their narrative always Trump's truth. And now reporters must rely on the unstable crazies on Twitter for content. That's the thrust behind wokeism and canceled culture. The Twitter hive is the only thing keeping the media outrage machine afloat. Can you imagine getting ideas from a platform where the anonymous mob rules? It maintains fat salaries for executives in legacy media but imagine today being a young reporter. All you do is write about tweets from losers. Local news is dead. Your story is judged on clicks. So, like a tick on a dog's nuts. It has to drop blood to survive."

It is vital we understand and solve those unique challenges so that we can provide space domain awareness and security. And so simple terms. It's like when you're at a resort. If you want the best lounge chair on the beach, you got to get there first. There is going to be space pirates and our military needs to be ready.

If we had and we had said this is our moon, who would have fought us over it? No one's going to fight over the moon. It's like it's China or USSR that I'm going to, oh, no, no, no, because no one's -- no one's going to think I'm going to have a bunch and we're not going to kill over the moon.

So, while weed growers want high customers, the government wants high taxes.

The poll found that players improved in time management, hand-eye coordination and getting to redoes into their mouths without using their hands.

Turned out that wasn't so bad, but I think this study is a lot based to."

So, he is a five star general on Halo, but when he steps out of the house, he's assistant to the assistant at Subway. That guy tends to have a problem with relating with what's going on. So, it just depends on and I go back to this, guns, knives, video games, cars, it's not them, it's the individual who's doing it. And you can have a responsible guy who can raise his kids play video games, pay his bills, get on a plane, go to work. And then you have a moron who's literally there 45 hours a day playing nothing but game and does nothing else."

And then you can sell them for like a different price, but then like sometimes they go down. So, then I was getting on Reddit and going to A.C. Turnips Reddit and looking for prices. And then my husband came in to talk to me and I just gotten into this island. I was like, I can't talk right now I'm selling my turnips, and then he was upset but I don't even care, I kept playing. He came out at three in the morning I was still playing the game. And I said look at this restaurant that I made and he said Catherine who eats there? So, I don't play anymore."

Apparently, they're making a comeback with retailers selling over 200 styles and designers Saint Laurent even offering pair for $850. Meanwhile, and slightly less crazy news police say an Iowa man called in a bomb threat to a local McDonald's because they didn't give him any sauce for his Chicken McNuggets. He was arrested and charged with a felony which is almost as bad as having to eat a Chicken McNugget without any sauce. But you know, it's like my granddad used to say, give a man a fish you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you can bang his wife while he's out fishing."
