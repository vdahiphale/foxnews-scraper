Trump offered a clear, succinct difference yesterday. People say he ruined the party. Others say he saved it. It could be both. The Republicans have now become a new party, one for the ignored, the working classes, the opposite of the elites. Time to embrace that as the Dems become no different from its colluders on CNN, those well-dressed dopes controlled by the woke. So, Jesse, thank God for Trump.

      "sentences": "We could talk all hour about that speech but I'll just say two things. One thing he said that really struck me, he said the Republican Party is the party of love. And that's something that Rush Limbaugh talked about when he said what defines a conservative. A conservative is a conservative because they have such deep love for the American people. Love for the country, love for the Constitution and all of the great leaders that made our proud history so great. So, when you love something, you put that thing first. And that's all America first is all about, putting the American people first, not global institutions, not other countries, not isms or multinational corporations. It's the average guy. And through trade, wage and immigration policy, he created a middle-class boom that helped everyone, all races, creeds and colors. And that's why it's so sad to see Joe Biden rejoin bad deals and tear up good ones just because he hates Trump and his supporters so much. And it's devastating to watch and it makes me sad because I'm such an emotional person. The other thing is this, Greg, and you touched on the vaccine stuff. History is going to, I believe, at least my history will show that Donald Trump saved millions of life and millions of jobs. Joe Biden wouldn't have ban travel from China. He would've kept the economy shut down longer and he never would've launched Warp Speed at record time. So, he would've cost millions more lives and millions more jobs. So, Donald Trump ordered 200 million doses of the vaccine. OK? Half of them have been distributed right now. And 75 million of them have been administered. So, not a single dose has been injected into an American on March 1st ordered by Joe Biden. All of these doses so far as of today have been distributed through the military, Trump's plan, and administered through the states, Trump's plan. Joe Biden is following Trump's plan and the trajectory of the injections is just a steady rise. He hasn't super charge it. So, I want Peter Doocy to ask Jen Psaki for acknowledgment of that and a thank you.",

And so, I think that they realized that, you know, they are kind of living on borrowed time and I think that's one of the reasons they are in such a hurry to try to get as much done as they possibly can. Cancel culture I think is a part of that. Do you remember when President Trump in the 2016 election said that political correctness was ruing our country. He got a huge applause line. Right?

Now one thing he did not do yesterday. Not say he is going to start a third party. There was speculation about that. And I think that his, basically, description of the Biden team, his critique was pretty effective. And if Republicans can figure out a way to unify behind that, I think the Biden team would realize that they've got a tiger by its tail with all these problems coming to the forefront. They are just focused so much on getting $1.9 trillion in relief, well, relief passed before March 14th, and then they'll try to worry about the other things but you can already see the cracks in the foundation of the Democratic unity are absolutely happening.

You know, CPAC is the Conservative Political Action Conference, it's the place where conservatives go every year to get involved to figure out how they can make a difference when it comes to forwarding conservative values. And I thought when President Trump talked about fighting against the left and focusing the energy on that, that's important. But also, he talked about the power that Republicans do have on the states to go after big tech, to work on things like censorship at the local level. And then of course he talked about 2022 and 2024. So, he gave people there kind of an assignment to go out and fight against left, -- remain focused on the things that they are doing to not let them rewrite the history of the Trump administration, of the Republican Party.

And I think I heard -- overheard you say in the green room it was the greatest speech you ever heard. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it sure was, it sure was like \"Nick at Nite.\" It was like a rerun. I have heard that speech before, you know. That speech obviously turns on a lot of people. I will say that for it. I mean, but the big news out of it, to me was, that he still says he won the election and is continuing to promote that fiction even though we know it's so damaging to the country. We saw the violence on the capitol at the Capitol Hill. And you know, and he continues to damage the Republican Party. And he says now, here's a list of people in the Republican Party to go after, the people who told the truth about not only the election but what happened on January 6th. So, I think he is promoting again, you know, more division not only in the country but in the party. And I think that's really difficult because, you know, obviously people in the country are worried about more violence coming. That's why we still have the fencing around the capitol and all of that. But I think people inside the Republican Party are also looking to try to find a way to go forward to build the party going forward. And again, it's just so difficult when everything focuses just on one personality. His comments about Biden I found intriguing because it seemed to me to be so revealing, Greg. It seems to me like he's jealous. It seems to me like he's jealous about the idea that Biden is having success. The COVID infection rate, the death rate is going down. He is jealous about the idea that the vaccines are getting out. He's jealous about the idea that somehow, you know, the rescue package it's already now passed the House, it looks like it's on its way through the Senate successfully by the end of this week. And I think he is just jealous. I mean, it's like it's coming out of his ears.",

But I think what we see today and you mentioned this at the top, is Biden meeting with the Mexican president, Obrador.

But the DHS secretary today said that he wanted people to come, just not right now. So, he said specifically it's not that we don't want people to come, we just want to wait until we have time to process all of them which is an open invitation for a mass increase in asylum fraud. And it's exactly what you're going to see here. You had the prior administration put into place the remaining Mexico policy. And they worked with local government so people who actually apply for asylum who qualified can apply in their home countries because it's the first step rather than making this long journey. The other thing that we are seeing here that nobody is talking about, when you see the number that they are predicting for 13,000 in May, for example. How many times over is that going to happen? Those kids are going to be here. The Biden administration is not going to pay with taxpayer money to transfer them to family members who were already in the country living here, most of them illegally. And then in 20 years from now, 15 years from now we are going to have this population of people who came here through this process which is going to set up another immigration catastrophe and crisis because you have now a whole another generation of, quote, \"DREAMers\" or other people who then they want to make legal citizens. And so, this is about asylum fraud and the Department of Homeland Security is headed by a guy who today invited this problem while claiming there is no crisis going on. And it's one of their making in the past few months. One quick thing. Biden also, the DHS secretary today lowered expectations, saying that the Trump administration gutted everything and that's why things are bad. They are just saving themselves so that when things get worse, they can blame that on the previous administration.",

Suddenly it's as if after the election in November, 13,000 pairs of parents just disappeared? Where did they go? Where did the parents go?

Cuomo has to get better excuses. Number one excuse was I was just kidding. I use that in middle school when I was trying to get out of being grounded. The other excuse was there was a misunderstanding. OK, so a 63-year-old man is alone in his office with a 25-year-old woman and he says, do you ever think about sleeping with older men? How do you misunderstand that? What other way is there for you to interpret that kind of comment?

He needed to be the good guy to contrast against Trump the bad guy during the pandemic. They don't need that contrast anymore, so Cuomo is disposable.

Trump showed other Republicans that you've got to fight fire with fire. And you know that it worked because suddenly he became an existential threat. That's what happens when you expose the media. Trump offered a clear, succinct difference yesterday. People say he ruined the party. Others say he saved it. It could be both. The Republicans have now become a new party, one for the ignored, the working classes, the opposite of the elites. Time to embrace that as the Dems become no different from its colluders on CNN, those well-dressed dopes controlled by the woke. So, Jesse, thank God for Trump.

      "utterance": "We could talk all hour about that speech but I'll just say two things. One thing he said that really struck me, he said the Republican Party is the party of love. And that's something that Rush Limbaugh talked about when he said what defines a conservative. A conservative is a conservative because they have such deep love for the American people. Love for the country, love for the Constitution and all of the great leaders that made our proud history so great. So, when you love something, you put that thing first. And that's all America first is all about, putting the American people first, not global institutions, not other countries, not isms or multinational corporations. It's the average guy. And through trade, wage and immigration policy, he created a middle-class boom that helped everyone, all races, creeds and colors. And that's why it's so sad to see Joe Biden rejoin bad deals and tear up good ones just because he hates Trump and his supporters so much. And it's devastating to watch and it makes me sad because I'm such an emotional person. The other thing is this, Greg, and you touched on the vaccine stuff. History is going to, I believe, at least my history will show that Donald Trump saved millions of life and millions of jobs. Joe Biden wouldn't have ban travel from China. He would've kept the economy shut down longer and he never would've launched Warp Speed at record time. So, he would've cost millions more lives and millions more jobs. So, Donald Trump ordered 200 million doses of the vaccine. OK? Half of them have been distributed right now. And 75 million of them have been administered. So, not a single dose has been injected into an American on March 1st ordered by Joe Biden. All of these doses so far as of today have been distributed through the military, Trump's plan, and administered through the states, Trump's plan. Joe Biden is following Trump's plan and the trajectory of the injections is just a steady rise. He hasn't super charge it. So, I want Peter Doocy to ask Jen Psaki for acknowledgment of that and a thank you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, I mean, look, I think that the Democrats realize that the general election went their way for the presidency but across the board almost everywhere you look in America that wasn't the case. Some state legislatures, the congressional offices obviously and some of the Senate races. And so, I think that they realized that, you know, they are kind of living on borrowed time and I think that's one of the reasons they are in such a hurry to try to get as much done as they possibly can. Cancel culture I think is a part of that. Do you remember when President Trump in the 2016 election said that political correctness was ruing our country. He got a huge applause line. Right? People are feeling that."

Now one thing he did not do yesterday. Not say he is going to start a third party. There was speculation about that. And I think that his, basically, description of the Biden team, his critique was pretty effective. And if Republicans can figure out a way to unify behind that, I think the Biden team would realize that they've got a tiger by its tail with all these problems coming to the forefront. They are just focused so much on getting $1.9 trillion in relief, well, relief passed before March 14th, and then they'll try to worry about the other things but you can already see the cracks in the foundation of the Democratic unity are absolutely happening. And whether President Trump runs again, who knows. We haven't seen this since Grover Cleveland gave it a shot. I mean, but, you know, history can repeat itself."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

    {

      "utterance": "I'm so sorry. You know, CPAC is the Conservative Political Action Conference, it's the place where conservatives go every year to get involved to figure out how they can make a difference when it comes to forwarding conservative values. And I thought when President Trump talked about fighting against the left and focusing the energy on that, that's important. But also, he talked about the power that Republicans do have on the states to go after big tech, to work on things like censorship at the local level. And then of course he talked about 2022 and 2024. So, he gave people there kind of an assignment to go out and fight against left, -- remain focused on the things that they are doing to not let them rewrite the history of the Trump administration, of the Republican Party. And also, to fight these things in the places where they do have some leverage against these Democrats in their states."

      "utterance": "Yes. Juan, I know you are up all night Saturday like it was the day before Christmas, knowing that Donald Trump was going to speak. You are just so excited. And I think I heard -- overheard you say in the green room it was the greatest speech you ever heard. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it sure was, it sure was like \"Nick at Nite.\" It was like a rerun. I have heard that speech before, you know. That speech obviously turns on a lot of people. I will say that for it. I mean, but the big news out of it, to me was, that he still says he won the election and is continuing to promote that fiction even though we know it's so damaging to the country. We saw the violence on the capitol at the Capitol Hill. And you know, and he continues to damage the Republican Party. And he says now, here's a list of people in the Republican Party to go after, the people who told the truth about not only the election but what happened on January 6th. So, I think he is promoting again, you know, more division not only in the country but in the party. And I think that's really difficult because, you know, obviously people in the country are worried about more violence coming. That's why we still have the fencing around the capitol and all of that. But I think people inside the Republican Party are also looking to try to find a way to go forward to build the party going forward. And again, it's just so difficult when everything focuses just on one personality. His comments about Biden I found intriguing because it seemed to me to be so revealing, Greg. It seems to me like he's jealous. It seems to me like he's jealous about the idea that Biden is having success. The COVID infection rate, the death rate is going down. He is jealous about the idea that the vaccines are getting out. He's jealous about the idea that somehow, you know, the rescue package it's already now passed the House, it looks like it's on its way through the Senate successfully by the end of this week. And I think he is just jealous. I mean, it's like it's coming out of his ears."

Can we process them effectively, Jesse? So, I think the numbers can get somewhat confusing. But I take what the homeland security secretary said. Right now, he feels that it's manageable. Obviously, you can -- you can come back and say to him in a few weeks if that's not the case, that he wasn't telling the truth. But I think what we see today and you mentioned this at the top, is Biden meeting with the Mexican president, Obrador. And you know, I think he is seeking help from Mexico, from his other allies in Latin America. Because I think it's inevitable, we are going to see a spike in real immigrants forcing in, not just crossing but forcing in in the springtime of this year. I think that's one of the things that we're going to see. So, he needs help and it's not just from some of these countries down in Latin America. I think he needs help from Congress. You know, you think about it, Obama, increased in arrest, increase in deportations. We still saw spikes. You think about Trump, you know, the fictional wall, the deportations, the separating the families. And we still saw spikes and the like."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, first, if the wall -- the border wall is fictional, then I don't know why Joe Biden ordered it to stop being built and why you have a number of people who were working construction on that wall saying that they are no longer building the wall that does exist. But the DHS secretary today said that he wanted people to come, just not right now. So, he said specifically it's not that we don't want people to come, we just want to wait until we have time to process all of them which is an open invitation for a mass increase in asylum fraud. And it's exactly what you're going to see here. You had the prior administration put into place the remaining Mexico policy. And they worked with local government so people who actually apply for asylum who qualified can apply in their home countries because it's the first step rather than making this long journey. The other thing that we are seeing here that nobody is talking about, when you see the number that they are predicting for 13,000 in May, for example. How many times over is that going to happen? Those kids are going to be here. The Biden administration is not going to pay with taxpayer money to transfer them to family members who were already in the country living here, most of them illegally. And then in 20 years from now, 15 years from now we are going to have this population of people who came here through this process which is going to set up another immigration catastrophe and crisis because you have now a whole another generation of, quote, \"DREAMers\" or other people who then they want to make legal citizens. And so, this is about asylum fraud and the Department of Homeland Security is headed by a guy who today invited this problem while claiming there is no crisis going on. And it's one of their making in the past few months. One quick thing. Biden also, the DHS secretary today lowered expectations, saying that the Trump administration gutted everything and that's why things are bad. They are just saving themselves so that when things get worse, they can blame that on the previous administration."

But if Biden loses control of this border issue, like when Mayorkas says it's a challenge and we are managing it, like they better hope that they can do that, because if they can't then any hopes of a bipartisan immigration reform bill will be out the window. So, if they really want to try to get that done or anything else done, they've got to figure out a way to deal with the immediate issue at hand."

So, they actually insult their own competence by claiming this is their definition of success. Whereas, Republicans are like, we've got to stop this. And only a Democrat would condemn a wall at a border but then appreciate one surrounding the capitol. I think that's a bit backwards. Also, the secret word obviously in all of this is the word unaccompanied. OK? So, can we finally stop with the lie about separating kids from their parents when you're talking about 13,000 unaccompanied kids, teens, whatever you call them, unaccompanied. Suddenly it's as if after the election in November, 13,000 pairs of parents just disappeared? Where did they go? Where did the parents go? Could it be that they really weren't there to begin within and that we were being fed a heavily, heavily lopsided story by the media that favored the Dems and didn't favor Trump. I would say so. And what does it say about Mexico then if 13,000 of your young people want to get the hell out."

So, it's not often that you're right, Juan. So, I think everybody on the show should just acknowledge it and make that point. But the fact that there is now a lawyer who is defending Governor Cuomo from these harassment allegations, it's the same defense attorney for Woody Allen, makes me think there's going to be several more women because you don't hire Woody Allen's defense attorney if it's just a small thing. Cuomo has to get better excuses. Number one excuse was I was just kidding. I use that in middle school when I was trying to get out of being grounded. The other excuse was there was a misunderstanding. OK, so a 63-year-old man is alone in his office with a 25-year-old woman and he says, do you ever think about sleeping with older men? How do you misunderstand that? What other way is there for you to interpret that kind of comment? But to the media, Juan --- everybody on this show knew Cuomo wasn't a good governor, but the media had created the story arc for the governor. He needed to be the good guy to contrast against Trump the bad guy during the pandemic. They don't need that contrast anymore, so Cuomo is disposable. And to Greg's point, this whole sex scandal takes the heat off the nursing homes so they can run for cover on that. I do want to praise Hillary --"

With all due respect, I just don't think it works for him, with all due respect. Now, I want to make a pre-rebuttal to Juan's argument. Juan is going to say that we need to keep schools open, but we need -- but we have to open them safely. Now, Juan, can you name one school that's opened unsafely? Because I don't think you can name one school district in the country that's opened unsafely. Six of the top 10 largest school districts in America have been open for several months, and those are in Texas, and Florida. Now, they got the same amount of money as the other big districts, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Vegas, so why aren't they open safely and the others closed? It's because the teacher's unions in the blue states aren't following the science, they're following the money."

They'll go up to I think it's a grade eight. And so, we're seeing progress being made. And, by the way, the big teacher's unions, they represent them nationwide red state and blue state. I think the key point for me is as we're seeing this progress as the number of cases go down, so per CDC, you're seeing places now adopt hybrid instruction. So, when you say open, you have to say some kids go to school every other week, some kids go into classrooms that they have the partitions and the ventilators. It's a whole lot going on.
