You hear nothing, part of the problem with the media is what they don't report. And that is coming you cannot prove that. But then we see with Donald Trump, the opposite. And this is the perfect juxtaposition that we needed the coverage of Barack Obama to see and the extreme difference when it comes to Donald Trump proving that in fact yes, to the adversarial position is not new, it is not just for this year, it has been exposed. I would argue that it started with Walter Cronkite and the nature of his coverage of the Vietnam War, and there was no other alternative, of course Fox News did not exist, there is no talk radio, there is none of that to show that, but I think this has been the media's nature. I think it has done damage to the country for several generations, and just like the stock market, Donald Trump wakes up and is exposing an important dynamic, and we can do, proven and shown to the American people, we have a responsibility to look for other sources.

Here's a better one, are they going to run against their appeal of the individual mandate and say, \"No, we think that you should be forced to buy again next year overpriced really health insurance that nobody wants?\" I mean, they have yet to put on the table a substantive platform outside of the identity politics agenda that is going to resonate in places like Pennsylvania and the panhandle of Florida. I think this blue wave is a fiction. I could be proven wrong, but I doubt that it is going to happen."

Frankly, the best asset that the Democrats now have are the Republican s and their lack of popularity, because sadly Dan is right. There is not a centrist inclusive democratic agenda, and I say to my friends and colleagues in the Democratic Party, \"You need one on growth, on infrastructure, and it didn't necessarily involve the Republican s as well.\" The individual Democrats running David to your question are out raising the Republicans. I think there have been 35 Republican retirements, the fund- raising numbers for the party committees, I believe are, running parallel with, if not in some instances ahead of the Republicans. And if the Democrats stay 11 points ahead, there's one thing I know for sure, they will raise all of the money that they need as they did in 2016.

They are angry, they are going to show up and we have seen relatively high turnout, astronomical turnout in Alabama. For Republican s to ignore that is political suicide but having said that, the media is doing itself no favors by constantly providing a foil and a foil and a reason to be angry for Republican voters. There is a litany of fake news, false charges against the President constantly, bad reporting, there's a special counsel investigation, and I do not mean to highlight anger too much, but it is a real human emotion and a real motivator and Republicans are angry too. And until this stops this witch hunt against the President, I think that the special counsel and the media, and their zero credibility, and their collapsing credibility, I think it is doing the sitting President a great favor and is going to be a great motivator in this midterm elections to get people out."

Though I must confess, the FBI and the DOJ do have issues that have to be investigated, but Bob Mueller is a man of unquestionable integrity. His investigation has ways to go, Water Gate I think took three or four years; this is still, I think, four or five months into the process. More time, more energy has to be committed.

He was never going to fire Mueller. Mueller is tightening up this investigation, it's coming to a close, and it's time for Democrats to step back, accept the fact that Russia-Trump collusion was always based on little more than rumors and the newspapers.

And that is not fair to the great men and women risking their lives every day. We have wise men, we have Strzok we have Page, and by the way, Strzok and being HR, he should be fired. We have now James Baker allegations. We have all of these things. So, the Intelligence Committee, they have to take it upon themselves.

The FBI stands for integrity, that is their motto and that is what we have completely lost here. When you are an FBI agent, regardless of who it is, it should not be about politics. and clearly, they have demonstrated, these people that we have laid out have demonstrated such an extreme bias, but potentially criminal action by changing, Strzok was involved in talking to Comey about changing the language so Hillary Clinton would not be criminally charged.

This needs to be looked into and Devin Nunes says, \"It's time you guys investigate yourselves.\" I disagree; they cannot investigate themselves fairly and objectively.

He is the man at the top, and I'm hoping that General Sessions has come in and has somebody investigating all of them. We hear now that he is resigning, McCabe is going to resign. .McCabe should be fired if these allegations are true or he is not getting his pension. He is going to resign in 2018.

If you truly care about the fair administration of justice, you do not cover that up. and to those that argue -- well, he removed them, so it is okay.

We see that from the media. We see all of it. And you do not even need the numbers to know that all you have to do is read \"The New York Times\" and \"the Washington Post\" and some of the other press and watch some of the other cable networks to realize how bias, Jimmy Carter said the worst media any President has received. The media is supposed to begin our system adversarial or challenging in the sense of transparency, but this media is much worse. They are running their own narratives. Not adversarial, it is oppositional. It is decided that it is arm in arm with the opposition of the Democratic Party to this President and if they do it in terms that are so incredible, as you just ran some of them, thug, and racist, whatever you want to call him. All of the things that you hear regularly, the President of the United States being called which are unprecedented, and people say that he is unprecedented in his hostility, than they have certainly deserved it."

This is what is so valuable about Donald Trump. We see the positive and the love for Barack Obama, but now what we have seen of course normally, then you hear nothing about the Republicans. You hear nothing, part of the problem with the media is what they don't report. And that is coming you cannot prove that. But then we see with Donald Trump, the opposite. And this is the perfect juxtaposition that we needed the coverage of Barack Obama to see and the extreme difference when it comes to Donald Trump proving that in fact yes, to the adversarial position is not new, it is not just for this year, it has been exposed. I would argue that it started with Walter Cronkite and the nature of his coverage of the Vietnam War, and there was no other alternative, of course Fox News did not exist, there is no talk radio, there is none of that to show that, but I think this has been the media's nature. I think it has done damage to the country for several generations, and just like the stock market, Donald Trump wakes up and is exposing an important dynamic, and we can do, proven and shown to the American people, we have a responsibility to look for other sources. We know to trust our instincts more. The value of the variety of opinions which you now can only get on Fox News and to make sure this is what continues.

Some say often, maybe we should sleep a little more in the early morning, but not only is it the way around the media, but is it helping? Is the media competing with the media they can't control?"

      "utterance": "The word of the day is control, because the media, the liberal media is unable to control President Trump. So he is able to get around the media, because the media, just like you said will not report on what Americans need to know about. What is really unfortunate is that you have so many lies and misinformation that is out there that is not supposed to be biased, but they are, and people have a tough time knowing what the actual truth is. We do this for a living, I am showing what is true or not true before going on TV or radio, I do not want to make a fool of myself. Hard working Americans raising their families, they want to know what is going on in our country and sadly, the liberal media is really doing a disservice to Americans."

Because it is one thing for the press to say, he should not have been elected, you should not be voting for him, he is terrible, get rid of him. That is bad enough, that we have not had, but we also now have this where this thing where truth is not told. The facts, we have narrative from the liberal mainstream media, but we do not have facts. For example, they cover up, the word is cover up. They purposely dropped a steel curtain around Washington as it relates to the scandals. Whether the scandals in Obama's administration and those that we now see in the FBI in the stores, whether it is uranium one, whether it is a dossier, facts that they do not say, there narratives are if you raise questions about the Mueller investigation, you are anti-American and trying to destroy American institution. But they will not give the people the facts where they can then make a judgment."

Coming up, President Trump putting the Chinese on notice, this after a report surface that they were illegally selling oil to North Korea. We are going to break down the mounting global tension surrounding North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Don't go away."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity,\" President Trump is calling China out over its actions in North Korea and this morning on twitter he wrote this \"caught red-handed, very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen.\" Also in an interview later with \"The New York Times\" that we talked about earlier, President Trump said he is disappointed and hinted that his patients may end soon with China. President Trump's comments follow the release of recent U.S. satellite images published in a South Korean newspaper that appeared to show ships from China and North Korea illegally trading oil. China today denied any wrongdoing and says it has insistently followed all U.N. resolutions against the rogue nation. Joining us now, author of the new book \"Direct Fire\" retired General Tony Tata, and radio talk show host Larry Elder, gentlemen good to see you, Larry great to see you again. General let me go right to you on this, when you look at the satellite imagery and you look at the release of that information on what the President said, for years I have said there is a simmering pot, China keeps fueling, bubbling, never boiling over, but the Trump doctrine, where we now? In a more dangerous spot? Do we see an opening? What about China?"

      "speaker": "TONY TATA, BRIGADIER GENERAL (RETIRED)",
      "utterance": "You are exactly right, we are in a dangerous spot, China loves having the North Korea stick in our eye as does Russia, but I think what we are seeing is a persistent constant application of inner agency elements of national power where you have department of defense, department of treasury, department of state, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., all applying the elements of power, diplomatic information, military and economic against North Korea, and now today with the leak, the release of these pictures, we have started an information war for lack of a better term against China, because when you think about in Chinese culture in particular, the concept of face where China has voted three times now to have sanctions against North Korea, and now the country is seeing is not following those sanctions. President Xi has lost face, President Trump knows this. This was a very deliberate move that was part of an information campaign and is a warning to China to stop and get with the program. You owe us one now. This is what I see happening right now, David."

      "utterance": "Larry, to add to that and the point of information and faced as the general puts it. Some other things not talked about. North Korea now has actual internet reaching more and more people. They have an active black market. This means we can get information into North Korea were the leadership certainly does not want it to be. Face, North Korea information. Are we breaking down the walls? Are we showing this for what it really is?"

      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYSNDICATE HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I hope so. We have had a mess for a very long time, Republican and Democratic Presidents. Under Bill Clinton, he sends Jimmy Carter, the former President over to negotiate an end to the North Korea nuclear program. And then they double overlapping and continued to take the concessions, but continue to develop weapons. They are getting better and better at developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, and at some point maybe develop one that could hit any part of the 48 states. This is very, very dangerous and Donald Trump has recognized that. The North Koreans that went to school on Libya recall that when we invaded Iraq in 2003, he was so scared that he turned over his nuclear program and now they are under lock and key in Tennessee, but for reasons that escape me, the Obama administration joined with the British to bomb Libya and get Kaddafi out of power, it would've been a different decision if he remained WMB power holder. That is what the North Korea is looking at and believe me that is what the Iranians are looking at, that is a very dangerous situation, and President Trump in my opinion is realistically trying to do something about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "General, and they are just mention part of my next point, because North Korea, China, and Iran have a dangerous connection. Back in the mid- 2000s it was China that facilitated the transit of materials between Iran and North Korea. They have a co-development program in their missile program, we see that clearly, Iran is present, advancing their aspirations in the Middle East. By building a co-development program with North Korea. So those three elements together, China has investments in the Middle East and they work and Iran, how does the President navigate that to try on burns, or frankly, that triad?"

    {
      "speaker": "TATA",
      "utterance": "It is a three dimensional chess, David, if you recall North Korea or Iran or two of the three original members of the excess of evil that George W. Bush talked about as a major security threat to the United States, now we are partnering with Israel to counter the Iranian power in the region. We are doing that in priority to counter the nuclear program to make sure that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, if you recall the 1994 Clinton- parry nuke deal with North Korea has led us to where we are now, and Obama's nuke deal is very much like that deal, we can look 20 years ahead and see where we might be with Iran, and secondly you have Hezbollah and Hamas and working very closely with our allies in Israel, and perhaps Jordan as well, and Saudi Arabia, but we are going to begin to take efforts underway to counter Hezbollah and Hamas in a way, I can remember when I was in the '90s, we were able to follow the outlines of weapons and money all the way back to Tehran, they have been a state sponsor of terror for decades now, and the Iranian nuclear deal is the craziest thing that I've ever seen, I'm so glad that President Trump has the foresight to undo that and block that and work with our allies in the region."

    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "Well, it does, but the bottom line is simple, once a country becomes a nuclear power like a rogue states, like North Korea, your options are very, very narrow. You are left with a military option, because it appears that China is not going to abide by the sanction, they've been cheating for a long time. Donald Trump just outed them. They were cheating during the Obama administration as well, but it is in their best interest to have the rogue nation poking at us, they do not want it to collapse, because they will have a refugee problem. Once you allow a country to become a nuclear power."
