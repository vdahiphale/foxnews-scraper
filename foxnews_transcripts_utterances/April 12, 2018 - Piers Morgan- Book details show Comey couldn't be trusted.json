He compared the president to a mob boss. We know it's Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano. I called Comey out on what he did and I talked about what real mob bosses are like, and we reminded them about Al Capone and Lucky Luciano and John Gotti. Then I used the former director's criminalization of political differences, now known as the Comey standard, to call out the misdeeds and frankly the crimes of a few champions of the left wing in this country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's start with Hillary Clinton. We know she committed felonies with her email server, and we know she obstructed justice. Robert Mueller, this great reputation, what, he's locked up innocent people in cases he's been involved in. He staffed his Russia investigation with Trump-hating Democratic donors, including his so-called 'New York Times,' as they call him and describe them, legal pit bull Andrew Weissmann. This man's track record is atrocious, as we have explained. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Jim Comey, of course, grossly mishandled the Clinton email investigation. We will learn more when the I.G. report finally comes out and Comey also linked potentially classified documents that resulted in the appointment of his BFF Robert Mueller as the special counsel. OK, well, that's privileged information, government documents we are talking about. One of the reason the media's coverage of last night's monologue was so completely unhinged is because President Trump issued a tweet prompting people to watch last night's show. He has done this occasionally, and I'm very thankful, by the way. I had no idea that the president was planning to tweet. I'm glad he did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There was no coordinated effort. I start my monologue at like 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning and we keep building it all day. I have the text timelines to show when I brought up this idea from the time I read what Comey had said. But it didn't stop 'The Washington Post' accusing me of being a shadow White House press secretary, which is funny, and colluding with the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } OK, they have lost their minds. This is complete and total fake news B.S. And the best part is, if they actually wanted to know the truth, maybe they could have picked up a telephone to call me or call Fox. You know, do some actual journalism. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I spend my free hours when I am not on air calling people all the time, so I can be the most informed person that I can possibly be. As I said many times, journalism in this country is dead. It is buried and has been since, what, 2007. So, instead of reporting facts, these so-called news outlets, they just literally push their own political narrative, all while hiding behind this, you know, feigned moral outrage, this moral facade, and calling themselves journalism -- journalists. So, while the media and the mainstream media gets mad at an -- I'm an opinion journalist host. By the way, frankly, we broke more news on this program that they have broken in a year and a half. They just echo the same talking points every night. And they are totally happy to forget about all the former FBI Director Comey's misdeeds, including leaking potentially classified privileged notes to the press to set up a special counsel, his potential weaponization of the FISA court system, the special treatment he gave Hillary Clinton, who we know committed felonies during that email investigation. You know, he wrote the letter exonerating Clinton in May before he interviewed her in July and 17 other key witnesses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And remember, when Comey lied about this very subject in front of Congress while under oath, he lied about it.

The media is back in love with James Comey and the montage that you just saw is just another piece of evidence proving facts do not matter to these people on the left, only ideology. And speaking of James Comey, and his impending salacious media blitz that the media is hysterical about, 'The New York Post' reporting one of the so-called major nuggets in his new book is that Donald Trump allegedly asked the former FBI director to investigate this infamous, completely untrue, unverified Ritz-Carlton Moscow hookers urinating in a bed story by Michael Steele, the foreign national guy that was paid to get Russian propaganda to manipulate the American voters. So, why would a sitting president want to go to an FBI director? I hope you can dispel this. If, in fact, he thought it was true? Because the president is saying that's just so not true. Can you find out that it's not true? And can you report that it's not true? Wouldn't you want to do the same?

Former Federal Election Commission chairman, his name is Bradley Smith, he's a Republican appointed by President Clinton, is throwing cold water on the notion that Michael Cohen could or should be charged with a crime in connection to this whole Stormy Daniels payment. He wrote the following: When you stretch the law to, quote, get a political opponent, it's rarely possible to return the law to its original shape. As someone who was never part of the Trump campaign but instead a longtime employee of the Trump Organization, Smith is arguing that Cohen's payment is a perfectly legitimate business move, and that any attempt to connect it to an in-kind contribution is an extreme stretch. It doesn't fit. But, of course, we have discussed many times in this program, Mueller and his pitbull Andrew Weissmann, they are no strangers to stretching the law in order to squeeze a suspect. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Earlier today, President Trump held a routine meeting with Mueller's boss, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. This comes after Rosenstein finally, after being threatened with contempt of Congress, again, he doesn't want to give anything up that's been subpoenaed and requested by Congress, and an impeachment, well, finally, he allowed Chairman Devin Nunes and Chairman Gowdy to see the document that started the FBI so-called Trump-Russia collusion investigation. We're going to have more on that later in the show. But, first, we do have some good news to bring you about the president. I guarantee you nobody else in the media will talk about it. And earlier today, the president actually in a speech in the Rose Garden was highlighting something the media will never talk about -- it's not Russia and it's not Stormy -- his accomplishments that are improving the lives of the American people, the forgotten men and women that voted in November of 2016. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The first hit is got to be at the Syrian SA, 300 SA, 400 air defense sites. That air base south of Latakia's seaport in Syria's Altheas air base near Palmyra because you have to take out those air defenses to make multiple strikes possible. Second, you hit the Bassel al-Assad civil military airport and the Aleppo airport because those are the primary air links to the outside world. You take out the fuel farms, the towers, the resettlements, the helium fixed wing aircraft assets that Assad has been using to deliver those chemical weapons and that will stop it. So if you take out and if you have to mind the Latakian, Baniyas Mediterranean seaports, take out the piers between handling equipments and road links. Because you are punishing him for using these weapons. He can get replacements in if that's gone.

Now they are moving to staff about his private life with alleged allegations involving women going back more than 10, 15 years. Two things about this, Sean, I don't think people care about Donald Trump's sex life.

Welcome to 'Hannity' tonight. All right. The media's anti-Trump echo chamber, they are literally spiraling completely out of control. It's become so bad. You've got some of these abusively biased, so-called, wannabe journalists. They are absolutely losing it from last night's opening monologue, all because I dared to use, oh, Jim Comey's standard in order to criticize some of the left's favorite champions, including the Clintons, Robert Mueller, and Jim Comey himself. Since the media is having a really hard time understanding some very simple, basic, fundamental concepts and principles, we will help them tonight follow the bouncing ball in just a few minutes. Also tonight, we will correct the record on some of the fake news that 'The Washington Post' and others are spreading about yours truly and we will reveal now which mobster, murderer Jim Comey was actually comparing your president to. Be prepared to be outraged. Every fair-minded American is going to see through this. And also tonight, new developments on Mueller's never ending witch hunt. One former FEC chairman is now coming to the defense of Michael Cohen, the president's personal attorney. And we'll bring you something the mainstream media is all too happy to ignore -- the president's accomplishments. When do they ever talk about that in the media? All right. Sit tight.

Show us the evidence, Mr. Mueller, or you can disband your team of merry Trump-hating, big Democratic donating sycophants that, of course, have questionable ethics, especially Andrew Weissmann. By the way, there's no evidence of collusion so far. The mainstream media is now beginning to go off the rails for that one reason. Remember, why would we be talking about Stormy and Karen McDougal and all this other garbage if they had evidence of collusion? You may remember last night, after Jim Comey -- remember, he compared the president of the United States to a mob boss. Well, I used this ridiculous, sensational, political, I called what it was, the Comey standard, to highlight some of the crimes and misdeeds that were committed by the Clintons, the way the investigation is being handled by Mueller and even Comey himself has issues. Take a look."

Now, I guess since Comey, if he is going to use the sweeping analogy, I've decided tonight we're going to use the Comey standard, I call it, and make some comparisons of our own."

And I also issued a tweet last night during the show to try to help some of these idiots in the abusively biased news media actually understand my monologue which they weren't understanding. So fake news, please, I'm trying to help you follow the bouncing ball. I said this is the Comey standard, and I'm sure that you are upset that the former FBI director literally, he was commenting and comparing a sitting president to the mob -- you know, murders, drug dealers, involved in extortion, loan-sharking, prostitution. And, by the way, breaking tonight, now we have more details. ABC News is reporting that the actual mobster that Comey was comparing the president who was none other than Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, an infamous hit man, if you don't know, responsible for 19 murders. That's the FBI director comparing the president of the United States to and other felonies of course. Despite my very clear analogy, you have to really try hard not to get it, about Comey's ridiculous comparison. This still caused many in the mainstream media to become completely and totally unglued, even emotional. These people are frankly, they are so dumb. They really are.

Or maybe you can ask your good friend, Mr. Mueller, why would he hire someone like Andrew Weissmann? Liberal Joe, you're just dumb. Nothing to really say to you. Not to be outdone, the print media also chiming in. This includes 'The Washington Post.' They called me quote 'conspiratorial.' I guess they haven't been watching MSNBC and CNN fake news for a year and a half. These so-called journalists, did they even watch last night's monologue or were they just too dumb to follow a simple analogy? Either way, as I said on Twitter during the show last night, let's help them follow the bouncing ball, so even they can get it. I'll talk slowly so the mainstream media understands. Comey was the director of the FBI. He compared the president to a mob boss. We know it's Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano. I called Comey out on what he did and I talked about what real mob bosses are like, and we reminded them about Al Capone and Lucky Luciano and John Gotti. Then I used the former director's criminalization of political differences, now known as the Comey standard, to call out the misdeeds and frankly the crimes of a few champions of the left wing in this country. Let's start with Hillary Clinton. We know she committed felonies with her email server, and we know she obstructed justice. Robert Mueller, this great reputation, what, he's locked up innocent people in cases he's been involved in. He staffed his Russia investigation with Trump-hating Democratic donors, including his so-called 'New York Times,' as they call him and describe them, legal pit bull Andrew Weissmann. This man's track record is atrocious, as we have explained. And Jim Comey, of course, grossly mishandled the Clinton email investigation. We will learn more when the I.G. report finally comes out and Comey also linked potentially classified documents that resulted in the appointment of his BFF Robert Mueller as the special counsel. OK, well, that's privileged information, government documents we are talking about. One of the reason the media's coverage of last night's monologue was so completely unhinged is because President Trump issued a tweet prompting people to watch last night's show. He has done this occasionally, and I'm very thankful, by the way. I had no idea that the president was planning to tweet. I'm glad he did. There was no coordinated effort. I start my monologue at like 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning and we keep building it all day. I have the text timelines to show when I brought up this idea from the time I read what Comey had said. But it didn't stop 'The Washington Post' accusing me of being a shadow White House press secretary, which is funny, and colluding with the president. OK, they have lost their minds. This is complete and total fake news B.S. And the best part is, if they actually wanted to know the truth, maybe they could have picked up a telephone to call me or call Fox. You know, do some actual journalism. I spend my free hours when I am not on air calling people all the time, so I can be the most informed person that I can possibly be. As I said many times, journalism in this country is dead. It is buried and has been since, what, 2007. So, instead of reporting facts, these so-called news outlets, they just literally push their own political narrative, all while hiding behind this, you know, feigned moral outrage, this moral facade, and calling themselves journalism -- journalists. So, while the media and the mainstream media gets mad at an -- I'm an opinion journalist host. By the way, frankly, we broke more news on this program that they have broken in a year and a half. They just echo the same talking points every night. And they are totally happy to forget about all the former FBI Director Comey's misdeeds, including leaking potentially classified privileged notes to the press to set up a special counsel, his potential weaponization of the FISA court system, the special treatment he gave Hillary Clinton, who we know committed felonies during that email investigation. You know, he wrote the letter exonerating Clinton in May before he interviewed her in July and 17 other key witnesses. And remember, when Comey lied about this very subject in front of Congress while under oath, he lied about it. We have him in his own words, and we have the videotape. As Warner Wolf says, let's go to the videotape. REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R—TEXAS: Director, did you make the decision not to recommend criminal charges relating to classified information before or after Hillary Clinton was interviewed by the FBI on July the 2nd?"

The media is back in love with James Comey and the montage that you just saw is just another piece of evidence proving facts do not matter to these people on the left, only ideology. And speaking of James Comey, and his impending salacious media blitz that the media is hysterical about, 'The New York Post' reporting one of the so-called major nuggets in his new book is that Donald Trump allegedly asked the former FBI director to investigate this infamous, completely untrue, unverified Ritz-Carlton Moscow hookers urinating in a bed story by Michael Steele, the foreign national guy that was paid to get Russian propaganda to manipulate the American voters. So, why would a sitting president want to go to an FBI director? I hope you can dispel this. If, in fact, he thought it was true? Because the president is saying that's just so not true. Can you find out that it's not true? And can you report that it's not true? Wouldn't you want to do the same? We'll have much more on that later tonight. We turn to some other developments, including those surrounding Robert Mueller's overreaching witch hunt. Former Federal Election Commission chairman, his name is Bradley Smith, he's a Republican appointed by President Clinton, is throwing cold water on the notion that Michael Cohen could or should be charged with a crime in connection to this whole Stormy Daniels payment."

As someone who was never part of the Trump campaign but instead a longtime employee of the Trump Organization, Smith is arguing that Cohen's payment is a perfectly legitimate business move, and that any attempt to connect it to an in-kind contribution is an extreme stretch. It doesn't fit. But, of course, we have discussed many times in this program, Mueller and his pitbull Andrew Weissmann, they are no strangers to stretching the law in order to squeeze a suspect. Earlier today, President Trump held a routine meeting with Mueller's boss, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. This comes after Rosenstein finally, after being threatened with contempt of Congress, again, he doesn't want to give anything up that's been subpoenaed and requested by Congress, and an impeachment, well, finally, he allowed Chairman Devin Nunes and Chairman Gowdy to see the document that started the FBI so-called Trump-Russia collusion investigation. We're going to have more on that later in the show. But, first, we do have some good news to bring you about the president. I guarantee you nobody else in the media will talk about it. And earlier today, the president actually in a speech in the Rose Garden was highlighting something the media will never talk about -- it's not Russia and it's not Stormy -- his accomplishments that are improving the lives of the American people, the forgotten men and women that voted in November of 2016."

They thought James Comey was the worst person imaginable. Now that he's written this incredible fiction where he's basically breaking his arm patting himself on the back, you would think he was the next Mother Teresa. What changed? Changed was that James Comey, now he has turned on Donald Trump and that has the media all in just a complete froth because they are excited about that.

'He just rolled on unprompted, explaining why it couldn't possibly be true, ending by saying he was thinking of asking me to investigate the allegations to prove it was a lie. I said it was up to him.'"

Dr. Gorka, I'll start with, OK, if lies were paid for, we didn't know probably at the time, if lies were told about you, wouldn't you, you are talking to the FBI director and it's a fake, phony dossier to manipulate the minds of the American people, and it's full of lies that you know aren't true.

The president want -- he knew it wasn't true because we know it's true because it was a Russian information operation paid for by Hillary, and he wants to have his director of the FBI proved to the world, not just his wife, as you would want, that it isn't true.

Now you see this guy, I think he has legal issues -- tell me if I'm wrong - - leaking privileged information, leaking it to somebody for the purpose of getting a special counsel appointed. Did he lie to Trump in January 2017 when he said that the dossier was salacious and unverified or when they were presenting it to a FISA court judge in a FISA application to spy on an American, as the Grassley-Graham memo says, as the bulk of information as Andrew Weissmann said, no dossier, no FISA warrant request or application?

A French frigate with 60 cruise missiles on board has been deployed. British submarines are moving into position. The carrier USS Harry Truman departed Norfolk yesterday accompanied by U.S. warships. This, as Defense Secretary James Mattis said today he believes chemical weapons were used in Syria and he called that inexcusable.

Following the incident widely believed to be a chemical attack, the only remaining militia, Jaysh al-Islam, or the army of Islam, surrendered its weapons. The Russians there said to be military police but they are there ahead of the fact-finding team from the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons.

Not just ours and everybody knows. What we would have to do in the sequence that we have to do and it's on that map that I sent you. The first hit is got to be at the Syrian SA, 300 SA, 400 air defense sites. That air base south of Latakia's seaport in Syria's Altheas air base near Palmyra because you have to take out those air defenses to make multiple strikes possible. Second, you hit the Bassel al-Assad civil military airport and the Aleppo airport because those are the primary air links to the outside world. You take out the fuel farms, the towers, the resettlements, the helium fixed wing aircraft assets that Assad has been using to deliver those chemical weapons and that will stop it. So if you take out and if you have to mind the Latakian, Baniyas Mediterranean seaports, take out the piers between handling equipments and road links. Because you are punishing him for using these weapons. He can get replacements in if that's gone. The Russian ships, as you point out, did sortie from their base of Tartus but the pipelines and tanker trucks lined up outside those -- that base are fair game."

So for good measure, create a runway to out track military airfield which is hit last April just to make sure he can't use it again. We didn't crater it, all we do was take out the stuff on the top.

Obviously, OK, Colonel North, you want to know if Russia is lying, they are moving their lips. The bigger question here is there is no -- there is no confirmation. They are not letting outsiders in to determine what's happened here. And they are trying to say it actually didn't happen and if it did happen it's the rebels that did it.

Our administration is being very deliberate over the past couple days. They are carefully choosing some of the sites. I'm sure the ones Colonel North mentioned. We're doing aerial reconnaissance and other intelligence collection so that we can determine with some degree of certainty who is there are and what sort of equipment is there. And then we are delivering a strong message. The president did it, you know, in his way by Twitter, including that way and other means as well. That we are serious about striking. And so the Russians know were coming. Look, it's international law. We have a duty to protect, something that the Clinton administration didn't do in Rwanda.

I mean, this wouldn't -- this wouldn't happen in many other countries. You wouldn't be allowed to do this. Peddling all sorts of lurid and ridiculous details to the world. It makes me think this. Donald Trump fired him because he didn't trust him. He was right, wasn't he? When you read this stuff pouring out of his books, Donald Trump was absolutely right not to trust James Comey. And in relation to the wider Mueller probe, I just think what's happening here is that they tried to get the proof on Russian collusion. They wanted to prove the world that Donald Trump collaborated with the Russians to fix the election. That's why he won. No other reason. Has to be that. And so far, they have singularly failed to establish that. So now they are moving the goal posts. Now they are moving to staff about his private life with alleged allegations involving women going back more than 10, 15 years. Two things about this, Sean, I don't think people care about Donald Trump's sex life. I don't think it's on the same scale of misdemeanor even if it happens to what we saw happen with Democratic President Bill Clinton, who let's just remind ourselves had sex relations with a young intern in the Oval Office while he was president. But certainly, I don't think the voters care. I don't think people are out they are going, wow, can you believe Donald Trump may have had a few flings 10 or 15 years ago? So, to me, they are now going after him purely to embarrass him, purely to try and diminish him, to degrade him as president.

One, the intent to fire Mueller, not that he fired him. That he had a thought. It's like OK, we are going to punish his thought. The second one is, did he craft a statement about the meeting in Trump tower or have anything to say? Did he talk of pardoning witnesses? The power of pardon, as you know, Piers, is absolute for U.S. president. Now, fourth, pressuring Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself. He didn't have time because Jeff Sessions didn't tell him he was recusing himself, and he recused himself the day after he was confirmed. So, I'm listening. This is what represents news.

He starves them, he beats them, he tortures them, he poisons them, he kills them. The reason we had an American student who was tortured and later died after being held in terrible captivity for nearly two years because he took a poster off the wall.
