Records indicate that Nikolas Cruz was suspended from middle school multiple times a week, but despite his behavior, expelling him was against school policy. A middle school teacher gave this assessment quoting, I feel strongly that Nicholas is a danger to the students and faculty at this school. I do not feel that he understands the difference between his violent video games and reality.

And despite threatening students bringing dead animals to school, using racial slurs and claiming he was suicidal, Cruz was never arrested or recommended for mental health evaluations. Pollock who refers to Cruz only by his court case number writes \"18-1958 was never going to be a model citizen but it truly took a village to raise him into a school shooter. I can't even say he killed my daughter.

But a lot of things have changed since that day. We have gone from that rush of patriotism to these recent numbers. The number of people who say that they are \"extremely proud to be American\" is at its lowest level since that time. And one member of Congress -- just one individual member was widely criticized for reducing what happened on September 11th to the day that \"some people did something.\" Today, Nicholas Harris Jr. was one of many who spoke about their loved ones who were killed that day. He lost his mother Francis in the September 11th attacks, and he responded directly with his t-shirt and his words to Congresswoman Omar. NICHOLAS HARRIS, SON OF 9/11 VICTIM: Some people did something. On that day, 19 Islamic terrorists, members of al-Qaeda, killed over 3,000 people and caused billions and dollars of economic damage. Is that clear? That's what some people did. Got that now? We are here today, Congresswoman, to tell you and the Squad, just who did what to whom. Show respect in honoring them, please."

Karl Rove was right by President Bush's side on that day in 2001. He's joined tonight by Congressman Dan Crenshaw, who was in high school on September 11th. But in who that is -- in whom the desire to become a Navy SEAL deepened and took root in him on that day. He went on to serve in both of the wars that followed. Gentlemen, thank you very much. It's great to have both of you with us tonight. Karl, when you look at that dramatic contrast in those numbers of patriotism, and you know, I can't watch that video of President Bush on the mound without getting that chill. It makes -- you know, the hair stand up on my arms when I watch that still today, 18 years later. Where are we headed based on all of this?"

Since we're carrying 40 pounds of weight on him, Secret Service didn't want him to go out there and do that, and then, he threw the strike. When he came back to the Owner's Box, he walked in the door with -- I have to admit a little bit of a swagger and said, I gave him the heat. Now, now, that it wasn't a -- that was an extraordinary moment. And we've drifted away from it. And the only way we're going to come back to it is to stop beating ourselves up as a country and find a way to reach across the partisan, and regional, and other dividing lines in our country, and recognize that people with whom we disagree are not our enemies, but our fellow countrymen. And find a way to restore some level of civility to our political and civic discourse in this country. Social media has not helped that process, the increasing lack of trust and the media has not helped that process. But ultimately, it's going to be solved by two things, leadership that calls upon the better angels of our natures that James Mattis have said. And the ordinary good common sense in the American people reasserting itself."

It -- you know, years ago, it didn't matter what side of the aisle are you on, you were still proud of your country. And that started the change over time. You know, and I think, as Americans, too many people have started to see the imperfections of America and our imperfections in foreign policy as a sign that America is inherently bad, in the -- you should no longer be proud of your country. And I fundamentally disagree with that notion. It -- we should not need a 9/11 to bring us together. We shouldn't need the anniversary to bring us together. We should still be proud of our country, were the greatest country that has ever lived, we are responsible for the most prosperity and human good that has ever been created.

This is Chris Pratt, the famous actor in a t-shirt that says, \"Don't tread on me.\" He was slammed by some on social media, which you mentioned, which I think is behind a lot of the evils that tear us apart these days, unfortunately, for just wearing that t-shirt. Then, you've got the -- you know, Nike Betsy Ross flag sneaker, which had to be pulled instantly because it had an American flag on the back of it that Colin Kaepernick, believed was racist and oppressive. I mean, Karl, it's a very -- it's a very uphill battle. And I'm not sure where the leadership comes from that you're talking about that begins to make a difference in this kind of environment."

There is an element in our country that really does want to run down America. That really does say things like somebody who did something, and the symbol of our American independence is a symbol of racism. And what we need to do is, to be -- is to express pride in America and its role in the world. I happen to be at a conference recently, a very diverse group. Small business people, health care professionals, hospital people, insurance people, and I got a question that allowed me to sort of opine about one area in which were criticized, climate. Where I said, America is the only major industrialized country in the world that's reducing the absolute level of greenhouse gas emissions. And I have to admit, I got carried away and said, \"I'm sick and tired of people running down our country when our country is providing such an example of leadership, and the crowd went wild. Now, that wasn't my oratory, that's the fundamental sense that's in the heart of most Americans, our country is a great country and we need to stand up for him."

It is -- it is an understanding that we have certain ideas in our founding that brought us together. That this idea that all men are created equal. This idea that government is there to protect your inalienable rights. OK? And that's what makes us American. It is not different colors of skin, it is the red white and blue. It is things like the national anthem, it is things like the Pledge of Allegiance. It is our American flag. Those are the symbols and ideas that bring us together.

And it's important for people who care about our country to acknowledge where the government is erring and to urge the government to correct itself. And when you have an institution that has enormous powers and, in fact, has been given even more power since 9/11, it's very important not just for our privacy in our civil liberties, but for our security that, that organization is operating effectively. And not using those powers in a way that undermine the strength of our democratic government which is the voice of the people that the ability to protest our government, the ability to organize and associate in a way that is free from government interference. And the FBI has renewed this theory of terrorist radicalization that suggests that those First Amendment activities speech, belief, association, are actually indicators of future violence. So, they have the ability now because of the way their guidelines have been lowered to go after and investigate people and use very intrusive tools against people they have no objective basis for believing they've done anything wrong.

We're a very safe country, and that's one of the things that we have to understand, and empowering these agencies to have a role in our democratic processes. And usually, when I talk about these issues, I worry about marginalized communities. Communities that don't have a lot of power, who are trying to just get their essential civil rights. But here we have a case where during the presidential election, the FBI was investigating both candidate's campaigns and had an ability to influence the election of our president. And, of course, in the aftermath of that had the ability to undermine certain things the administration wanted to do. So, do we really want to have an institution that, that can do that kind of thing based on no actual evidence of wrongdoing? We need to have stronger guidelines to make sure that the FBI is focused specifically on fighting illegal activity rather than policing belief."

      "utterance": "And Martha, let's begin with Andrew Pollock's conclusion which is that social justice policies crafted to address bigotry and inequity have kept police from arresting and disciplining kids especially disturbed kids. And Pollack lays out a compelling narrative to support his claim saying Broward County Schools knew full well that Nikolas Cruz was obsessed with guns and murder, and they knew years before he opened fire on his fellow classmates. In fact, in middle school, classmates say Cruz's torture and killing of animals became a source of pride. One student remembers Cruz offering to show videos of him skinning animals. Records indicate that Nikolas Cruz was suspended from middle school multiple times a week, but despite his behavior, expelling him was against school policy. A middle school teacher gave this assessment quoting, I feel strongly that Nicholas is a danger to the students and faculty at this school. I do not feel that he understands the difference between his violent video games and reality. And the middle school vice-principal once e-mail teachers to inform them that if Cruz \"needs to leave the class to use the restroom, go to the clinic or any other reason, please notify the front office and wait for a security escort.\" Cruz was eventually sent to a school for children with severe behavioral problems and yet inexplicably the district moved him to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. And despite threatening students bringing dead animals to school, using racial slurs and claiming he was suicidal, Cruz was never arrested or recommended for mental health evaluations. Pollock who refers to Cruz only by his court case number writes \"18-1958 was never going to be a model citizen but it truly took a village to raise him into a school shooter. I can't even say he killed my daughter. They killed my daughter.\" Pollack goes on to say, he thought getting answers about why the school massacre happened would help him come to terms with his daughter's death. It didn't. But he hopes it will \"keep your kids safe.\" Martha?"

So instead of you know giving the kids more rights and putting him in a different school, they had the mainstream him and that's a big problem. It's not just going on in Broward, Martha, that's the problem. They mainstream these type of kids who were sick where they should be taken care of but not on the backs of the environment -- endangering the environment of kids that just want to go and learn.

That would be having Secretary of State Mike Pompeo serve as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. Presidents Nixon and Ford both had Henry Kissinger served in the dual headed role. Now one former senior Trump administration official says, based on how the national security policy process works right now, this would be an optimal solution. Another source tonight though says, it's unlikely Pompeo would do both jobs. President Trump still zeroed in on this issue. In the Oval Office earlier today, he said his policy differences with Bolton went much deeper than this past weekend's cancelled meeting with the Taliban.

And, there's been a fair amount of disruption in terms of national security. Not so much the policies but the development on those policies and the personalities involved in doing that. The president now clearly is no longer a journeyman in foreign policy and national security. He's in the job. He knows where he wants America to go, and I think he wants us smooth sailing ship around him. He wants to minimize the disruptions. And that's probably at the heart of this thing. You know I gave advice once to the administration on something very similar to that. I said listen, national security and foreign policy is not like domestic policy. When you make decision it's very difficult to reverse it and has consequences, the stakes are very high. Therefore, pick people who know and have expertise and knowledge you may not have. But also, and I said, Martha, pick people you like because the stress is significant. You're going to spend a lot of time around them and you like someone who has knowledge to help you, the working relationship is so much better. Here I think we had policy disagreements as well as personality conflicts and I think both people, the president and John Bolton came to the same conclusion he probably needs to get somebody else."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I guess one of the biggest questions here going forward, general, is what does it mean for policy? The president has expressed an interest in discussions with Rouhani. Secretary of State Pompeo said that it's possible. He said sure. You know, it's possible that they could sit down even later this month at the end of September when they are at the U.N. What does it indicate to you about the direction that the president wants to go with all of these big issues, dialogue lifting sanctions that of in the like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all there's absolutely no doubt. Anybody who spends any time whatsoever with this president knows that he is driving foreign policy and national security decision-making and policymaking in this country. Unequivocally so. That being the case, he's also somewhat unconventional in the degree that he wants to exercise personal diplomacy particularly with our adversaries. He trusts his own instincts and judgments about that. And he wants to try that, even though others have failed at doing just that. And that's not going to change. So, I think what we have to help the president do is structure that as best as possible to try to put in place the necessary staff work that's required to set the president up for success in those kinds of meetings. But they are going to continue. I don't believe the nation has the least bit of risk talking to Rouhani or another one of our adversaries, frankly because the president is going in with a firm position --"

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, before I let you go, you know, there's a line of thinking that the Wall Street Journal wrote about it today that said that the country is less safe with John Bolton not in the room. You know, that he was a voice -- obviously he's a hard line, and his thoughts added to the mix was keeping us safer. What do you say to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "I don't buy that. I don't think the national security adviser by himself is making the country necessarily less safe or stronger. I think it's a collection of that team that we have obviously a very confident military, we have a strong Central Intelligence Agency. I believe we have one of the best chief diplomats in Secretary Pompeo that we've had in years. So that's a strong team around the president. And the president himself now has three years of experience under his belt. You put that together, and that's what's keeping America safe. No one person by themselves is doing that. So, that's some hand-wringing I believe in terms of what took place here. And I agree with a lot of the policies that John Bolton had. Let me just declare that. But nonetheless in of himself, I don't believe for a fact that America is any less safe. And I don't think John would believe that either."

More than ten years later she became the first woman to come forward and tell her story about what he was actually doing in the examining room. She unlocked Pandora's Box on one of the most egregious sexual abuse scandals in the history of this country, paving the way for more than 150 other survivors to come forward.

And because she was having severe pain in her wrist and back, she was hopeful that Nassar would see her. She also realized it might be a long wait. Instead, two weeks later she got in. And as the nurse walked her down the hallway toward the exam room, she remembers almost squealing with excitement at seeing photos of the magnificent seven, the 96 women's gold medal team. And yet, during her first appointment with Nassar, Rachel Denhollander says she was sexually abused and her mom was in the room. But because Nassar was so skilled her mother didn't notice. Denhollander says she remembers thinking, quote, \"there's no way that someone hasn't described to Michigan State or USA Gymnastics what Larry is doing. If there's any questions about his treatment, surely someone would do something.\" But Denhollander also says she learned that if you can't prove it, don't speak up. Believing it would cost her everything. Eventually she was the first of more than 150 to speak up, and here she is giving her victim impact statement at Nassar sentencing. Watch."

There was like a cover over, and he's doing this pelvic manipulation which your mom had heard from another friend was actually a procedure to release lower back pain. And so, it's all very thinly discussed. But you pointed out to me in a prior discussion that it's often that way with child abuse?"

But the reality is that one in four women and one in six boys will be abused as children, and the average age of abuse is between five and eight years old. And so, what we need to understand is all these dynamics that makes us look at a child disclosure abuse and saying, that's not possible. Those are the very dynamics that are keeping that abuser in power. Those are the very dynamics that kept those victims silent and we need to start living in the reality of the epidemic of childhood sexual abuse that we are dealing with and learning how to respond better because otherwise we're just going to continue seeing the numbers grow."

What do you hope this book will achieve in terms of starting to give them self-worth and hopefully the ability to say something if something not right is happening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DENHOLLANDER",
      "utterance": "Yes. One of the things that communicates to my daughters and little girls is that they are worth everything. They are worth the cost of speaking up. They are worth the cost of doing the right thing. But what I hope just as much is that it really influences the community discussion that we have around abuse. And just even our ideas of core values. You know, the things that I had to wrestle with as an abuse survivor, what is my identity, where does my worth come from, and how do I make decisions, what is my matrix for decision-making? Those are all things that we have to wrestle with regardless of our background, regardless of the issues that we are facing. And so, I hope with the memoir is not just to educate on abuse but really to educate on how we make our decisions and where a value comes from and get down to those intrinsic questions that we all have to ask ourselves."

I mean I think that the book, you know, the adult book \"What is a Girl Worth\" is a real eye-opener because it shows you just how easily someone you love could be in the situation and I think it's very eye-opening, as I said. And \"How Much is a Little Girl Worth\" is a beautiful book as well, that I know is aimed at your daughters and other little girls as well.

All Democrats, if they win, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton always did that same thing, they straddle the issue. But they should be scared legitimately. She's going to tax wealth, she's going to tax the transactions, capital gains, she's going to break up the banks.

And everyone has to do it in their own way of course but the New York Times put is out there. This tweaked. Let's put it up on the screen. And it says, \"I just -- it says, 18 years have passed since airplanes took aim and brought down the World Trade Center.

It goes up to the Fort Hood is workplace violence. It goes back to Benghazi it was triggered by a video. And what Omar said was that some people did some things. The left and especially the media try to sanitize terrorism from Islam because they think it's going to cause Islamophobia. They think it's unfair to Islam and it's going to cause more Muslims to radicalized.
