It wasn't back then. And just because you don't like a tactic, that doesn't make it torture. Of course, you could discuss the merits of such choices with pundits on TV rather than doing her job. She'd probably be paid more. But instead, she took the risk and responsibility, so we didn't have to. She responded not just to the worst attack on our country since Pearl Harbor, but to a world-ending threat. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sure, it's easy to say, but we're better than that, from a shiny newsroom.

So here's a question for Haspel's critics\" Imagine being in a situation where your family is in danger and a terrorist is withholding key information that could save them. Would you still consider \"enhanced interrogation\" sadism? With everything that's considered \"mean\" be off the table?
