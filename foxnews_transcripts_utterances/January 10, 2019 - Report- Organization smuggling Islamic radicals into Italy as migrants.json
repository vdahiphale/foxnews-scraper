And what Jim Acosta found there will shock you. Not a single illegal alien was anywhere near that wall. There was no tent city. There were no predatory gang members or coyotes, MS-13, not there, there was no sad, suffering Caravan. Everything was just fine, or as Jim Acosta, so memorably, put it, the area around that steel barrier was pretty tranquil. See? That's what you get when you build walls, America, tranquility. And that's the last thing we need more of in this country, more peaceful bucolic scenes like that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Wait.

By contrast though, there was one fascinating and highly relevant story about immigration this week, and it didn't even mention borders or walls. It's from an upcoming edition of 60 Minutes on CBS. In the piece, a researcher called Kai-Fu Lee describes what's about to happen to this country's labor market, thanks to the growth of artificial intelligence.

But it's the remaining low-skilled jobs that are most likely to disappear, professional driving, for example, taxis, trucks, delivery vehicles. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } 5 million Americans now do that for a living, and support their families on those wages. Self-driving cars could put them all out of work very soon. And not just them, store clerks, waiters, cooks, they're in imminent danger too. Just about any repetitive job is at risk of going away. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Automation is accelerating. This is real. It's going to have a nearly unimaginable effect on what Americans do for a living, and on American society itself. Our country's low-skilled workers already live in a pretty precarious spot. Their wages and their benefits have stagnated for decades. In fact, millions of them aren't really workers at all but, instead, get by on disability payments or other government programs. Some don't even survive. They're overdosing and committing suicide at steadily higher rates, as you know. But in the next few years, if anything, things will get even worse. Some of the last remaining options for these workers are going to vanish, and there's nothing obviously waiting to replace those jobs. This is happening. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, what is Washington doing about it? Well, nothing, but not just nothing, worse than that. Our policymakers are exacerbating the problem, making it far more painful and harder to solve. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At the very moment that millions of American jobs are about to vanish, their top priority, literally, the top priority here, is importing millions of new low-skilled workers. Both parties want that. It's insanity. Now, to be clear, as we've been before, we are not attacking illegal immigrants. They're doing exactly what we would do if we lived in Honduras. We'd try to come here. That's understandable. What is baffling, what is impossible to understand, is that our policymakers haven't thought any of this through, and they don't care to. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Questions like what are all these people going to do for a living 10 years from now, when the jobs they expect to fill are gone. And, most pressingly, what about our own people? How does this help them, as they stare down the barrel of economic irrelevance in the digital age? Thanks to technology, their labor, middle-class labor is worse -- worth less than it ever has been. And as a result of that, our middle class has less power and less economic security. Mass immigration makes them even weaker. It's simple economics, supply and demand. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The one thing they do have, and here's what Washington should pay close attention, is the vote. This is still a democracy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And if our policymakers keep pushing Americans with lunatic economic policies like this, you're going to start to see voters vote for some very radical candidates, very radical, and that's guaranteed. This is exactly how revolutions start. Wise leaders would already know that. Political Commentator David Paul Kuhn has thought deeply about this subject for many years, and he joins us tonight.

And the main one was we ought to know who's actually in our country, and what they're doing here, particularly, if they're from somewhere else. The 9/11 hijackers boarded their planes using their real names, but they routinely used fraudulent identities and fake documents in the lead-up to the attack. And that's why, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, passed something called the Real ID Act. That was a decade ago, and it was still possible then to say that dangerous people ought to be kept out of America, and those with no legal right to be here ought to be made to leave. Now, that former consensus is hate speech and, instead, it's our country's obligation, they're telling us, to let tens of millions of people we know nothing about settle here. And if they use fake documents to get here or work here, that's not a big deal. And if it bothers you, it's your problem, shut up. Meanwhile, in 2016, an IRS report found that more than a million Americans had their Social Security's numbers stolen by illegal aliens, and were never even informed of that fact by their government.

But we're not. Why would we be? If alien life exists, it's far more likely we'll hear from it before we see it. Now, a telescope in Canada reports picking up a strange powerful signal from far far away. What is it exactly? Brett Larson has been looking into it for us. He's Morning Anchor for Fox News Headlines 24/7 on SiriusXM, and he joins us tonight with more. Hey, Brett. BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: Hey Tucker, yes, this is definitely one of those \"What!\" kind of stories. This is something called a fast radio burst. It was detected multiple times. And it has many scientists saying, \"We need more data.\" So, a couple things can be a fast radio burst. It could be a neutron star with a strong magnetic field, two neutron stars colliding, a Black Hole, perhaps, and yes, could actually be an alien. The latest discovery comes almost by chance from something called CHIME. It's the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. And get this, the system wasn't even completely set up when they discovered the bursts. Now, the fast radio bursts found are from a galaxy very, very far away, 1.5 billion light-years, to be exact. And it is just the second time that a repeat of a fast radio burst has been detected. And the object, CHIME found, produced actually six different bursts. Ars Technica reports that of the dozens of fast radio bursts identified, only one other has produced multiple bursts, and this is actually kind of significant. More and more scientists are looking into the skies with more precise instruments to find these signals, and they don't last for very long. This isn't something you're going to hear. This is like a fraction of a second. And it shows up on a graph. Now, some astronomers have considered the idea that these bursts could be from intelligent life elsewhere. And with more scientists searching for them, we will likely find out more about them and find more of them. I -- I think it's alien. I'm going to -- I'm going to go out on a limb and say, I think -- I think it's alien, and I think it's fascinating that we -- you point a radio receiver to the sky, and we pick up radio signals, now, granted there are scientific explanations for it, but--",

He is the second man in 18 months to die inside Buck's West Hollywood home. In July 2017, 26-year old Gemmel Moore, a Black male escort overdosed on methamphetamine. There wasn't enough evidence to charge Ed Buck. But in a journal entry, Moore wrote, \"I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was very painful. But after all the troubles, I became addicted.\" Gemmel Moore's family has released a statement saying, \"If a young White man was found dead in a wealthy Black man's apartment with syringes and drugs all around, that Black man would have been handcuffed and taken directly to jail.\" And now, a 28-year old Black male claims he barely escaped death inside Buck's apartment. Jermaine Gagnon tells the DailyMail that Buck flew him from Minnesota to L.A., and injected him with methamphetamine, \"I was so scared. I felt death walked into my soul. I called my mother. I said I feel like he's going to kill me.\" Police are investigating the death of Timothy Dean, now re-investigating the death of Gemmel Moore.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The government shutdown continues at this hour as the debate over a Border wall enters its fourth contentious week. Neither side in this has shown any sign of willingness to compromise. This remains a stalemate as of now, the very definition of it, or at least that's what it seems like from the outside. In fact, this debate is over. We're not getting a barrier along our Southern border. We can't, not now, not ever. That possibility was permanently destroyed today by a fact-seeking missile of truth launched by one of our country's premier cable news outlets. In a single devastating act of journalism, CNN killed the wall, took their biggest guns to do it. The network dispatched its Chief White House Correspondent/Moral Philosopher/Renaissance Poet, Jim Acosta, to the U.S.- Mexico border, specifically to the town of McAllen, Texas. Once on the ground in McAllen, Acosta wasted no time in proving once and for all that walls don't work. Watch the stand-up that changed history."

There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas area. No sign of the national emergency that the President has been talking about. As a matter of fact, it's pretty tranquil down here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "You see that? Take that you nativist bigot freaks, you creepy wall obsessives. Jim Acosta just spanked you. He was there, not in some cushy air-conditioned studio in Washington with the rest of the Talking Heads, but in the field, on the scene, doing the kind of hard-boiled shoe-leather reporting that has made Jim Acosta a household name. Acosta went right to the wall itself, the very wall he finds immoral, and has often argued against at press conferences. And what Jim Acosta found there will shock you. Not a single illegal alien was anywhere near that wall. There was no tent city. There were no predatory gang members or coyotes, MS-13, not there, there was no sad, suffering Caravan. Everything was just fine, or as Jim Acosta, so memorably, put it, the area around that steel barrier was pretty tranquil. See? That's what you get when you build walls, America, tranquility. And that's the last thing we need more of in this country, more peaceful bucolic scenes like that. Wait. That can't really have been CNN's point, could it? Now, it's getting confusing. We'll have to call Jim Acosta once he gets back from his latest mission and clear this up. In the meantime, though, we just wanted to give you some idea of how stupid and buffoonish the wall coverage has been recently, in case you missed it. By contrast though, there was one fascinating and highly relevant story about immigration this week, and it didn't even mention borders or walls. It's from an upcoming edition of 60 Minutes on CBS. In the piece, a researcher called Kai-Fu Lee describes what's about to happen to this country's labor market, thanks to the growth of artificial intelligence. Watch this."

      "utterance": "AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs, not just for blue-collar work but a lot of the white-collar work. A lot of things will become automated. We'll have automated stores, automated restaurants and, altogether, in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of jobs in the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "40 percent of the world's jobs, approaching half. As Lee warns in this segment, all jobs are at risk, high-end, attorneys, for example. But it's the remaining low-skilled jobs that are most likely to disappear, professional driving, for example, taxis, trucks, delivery vehicles. 5 million Americans now do that for a living, and support their families on those wages. Self-driving cars could put them all out of work very soon. And not just them, store clerks, waiters, cooks, they're in imminent danger too. Just about any repetitive job is at risk of going away. Automation is accelerating. This is real. It's going to have a nearly unimaginable effect on what Americans do for a living, and on American society itself. Our country's low-skilled workers already live in a pretty precarious spot. Their wages and their benefits have stagnated for decades. In fact, millions of them aren't really workers at all but, instead, get by on disability payments or other government programs. Some don't even survive. They're overdosing and committing suicide at steadily higher rates, as you know. But in the next few years, if anything, things will get even worse. Some of the last remaining options for these workers are going to vanish, and there's nothing obviously waiting to replace those jobs. This is happening. So, what is Washington doing about it? Well, nothing, but not just nothing, worse than that. Our policymakers are exacerbating the problem, making it far more painful and harder to solve. At the very moment that millions of American jobs are about to vanish, their top priority, literally, the top priority here, is importing millions of new low-skilled workers. Both parties want that. It's insanity. Now, to be clear, as we've been before, we are not attacking illegal immigrants. They're doing exactly what we would do if we lived in Honduras. We'd try to come here. That's understandable. What is baffling, what is impossible to understand, is that our policymakers haven't thought any of this through, and they don't care to. Questions like what are all these people going to do for a living 10 years from now, when the jobs they expect to fill are gone. And, most pressingly, what about our own people? How does this help them, as they stare down the barrel of economic irrelevance in the digital age? Thanks to technology, their labor, middle-class labor is worse -- worth less than it ever has been. And as a result of that, our middle class has less power and less economic security. Mass immigration makes them even weaker. It's simple economics, supply and demand. The one thing they do have, and here's what Washington should pay close attention, is the vote. This is still a democracy. And if our policymakers keep pushing Americans with lunatic economic policies like this, you're going to start to see voters vote for some very radical candidates, very radical, and that's guaranteed. This is exactly how revolutions start. Wise leaders would already know that. Political Commentator David Paul Kuhn has thought deeply about this subject for many years, and he joins us tonight.

If you double that, that is the low end of what experts estimate will be the upheaval caused by artificial intelligence, AI. So, the political consequences are manifest. And it's not just this expert on 60 Minutes. It's -- it's really a norm now to expect that it could go as high as 47, 50 percent especially in a developed country like the United States or nor -- or in Northern Europe."

If you increase the supply of low-skilled labor and you -- you have -- you increase the demand for -- for good blue-collar jobs, the problem is there's a -- is a fewer blue -- good blue-collar jobs already for the American working class. Another way to think about this, we've -- we've paid more attention, with the advent of Donald Trump, we've paid more attention to the White working class in America belatedly. A way to think about this, even if you're not particularly sympathetic to their plight they're -- they're like the canary in the coal mine. In other words, as you just alluded, it's going to start -- what's happened -- what's happened to them and Black blue-collar workers as well, is going to hit the educated workforce, the white-collar employment that CNN say, big law, right? So, in big law, huge portion of big law, especially, at the -- or in the early years, is doc review, document review. That's -- that's already been hit by AI, and that's only begun. Physicians may be more threatened than nurses, because a lot of physicians simply read symptoms and offer a diagnosis. That's certainly going to be automated."

Back in reality, meanwhile, there are some lessons we learned from 9/11, in case you don't recall. And the main one was we ought to know who's actually in our country, and what they're doing here, particularly, if they're from somewhere else. The 9/11 hijackers boarded their planes using their real names, but they routinely used fraudulent identities and fake documents in the lead-up to the attack. And that's why, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, passed something called the Real ID Act. That was a decade ago, and it was still possible then to say that dangerous people ought to be kept out of America, and those with no legal right to be here ought to be made to leave. Now, that former consensus is hate speech and, instead, it's our country's obligation, they're telling us, to let tens of millions of people we know nothing about settle here. And if they use fake documents to get here or work here, that's not a big deal. And if it bothers you, it's your problem, shut up. Meanwhile, in 2016, an IRS report found that more than a million Americans had their Social Security's numbers stolen by illegal aliens, and were never even informed of that fact by their government.

But we're not. Why would we be? If alien life exists, it's far more likely we'll hear from it before we see it. Now, a telescope in Canada reports picking up a strange powerful signal from far far away. What is it exactly? Brett Larson has been looking into it for us. He's Morning Anchor for Fox News Headlines 24/7 on SiriusXM, and he joins us tonight with more. Hey, Brett. BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: Hey Tucker, yes, this is definitely one of those \"What!\" kind of stories. This is something called a fast radio burst. It was detected multiple times. And it has many scientists saying, \"We need more data.\" So, a couple things can be a fast radio burst. It could be a neutron star with a strong magnetic field, two neutron stars colliding, a Black Hole, perhaps, and yes, could actually be an alien. The latest discovery comes almost by chance from something called CHIME. It's the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. And get this, the system wasn't even completely set up when they discovered the bursts. Now, the fast radio bursts found are from a galaxy very, very far away, 1.5 billion light-years, to be exact. And it is just the second time that a repeat of a fast radio burst has been detected. And the object, CHIME found, produced actually six different bursts. Ars Technica reports that of the dozens of fast radio bursts identified, only one other has produced multiple bursts, and this is actually kind of significant. More and more scientists are looking into the skies with more precise instruments to find these signals, and they don't last for very long. This isn't something you're going to hear. This is like a fraction of a second. And it shows up on a graph. Now, some astronomers have considered the idea that these bursts could be from intelligent life elsewhere. And with more scientists searching for them, we will likely find out more about them and find more of them. I -- I think it's alien. I'm going to -- I'm going to go out on a limb and say, I think -- I think it's alien, and I think it's fascinating that we -- you point a radio receiver to the sky, and we pick up radio signals, now, granted there are scientific explanations for it, but--"

And again, that's also a very cool thing that we -- we caught it. We can now hear the -- the signature that it makes when it -- when these things happen in the skies above us, in the galaxies literally beyond the Milky Way.

He is the second man in 18 months to die inside Buck's West Hollywood home. In July 2017, 26-year old Gemmel Moore, a Black male escort overdosed on methamphetamine. There wasn't enough evidence to charge Ed Buck. But in a journal entry, Moore wrote, \"I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was very painful. But after all the troubles, I became addicted.\" Gemmel Moore's family has released a statement saying, \"If a young White man was found dead in a wealthy Black man's apartment with syringes and drugs all around, that Black man would have been handcuffed and taken directly to jail.\" And now, a 28-year old Black male claims he barely escaped death inside Buck's apartment. Jermaine Gagnon tells the DailyMail that Buck flew him from Minnesota to L.A., and injected him with methamphetamine, \"I was so scared. I felt death walked into my soul. I called my mother. I said I feel like he's going to kill me.\" Police are investigating the death of Timothy Dean, now re-investigating the death of Gemmel Moore. Democratic politicians are starting to give back his donations, Tucker."
