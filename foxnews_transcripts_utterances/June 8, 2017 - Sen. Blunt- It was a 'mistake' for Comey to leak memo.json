It's a mistake I want to clarify for our viewers a little later. And it concerns a statement by the DNC chair, Tom Perez. I'm quoting here, Senator, because I have taken the I-leap here, the impeachment word leap. He said that: \"Comey's testimony just gave us the clearest and most damning evidence yet that President Trump lied to the American people and is likely under investigation for obstruction of justice, a serious and disturbing charge.\" I took the leap to say that would be an impeachable offense. But that was my interpretation.

And, of course, if you're the president and you know that the FBI has been investigating this since 2015, and you have been told three times in 90 days that you're not part of the investigation, you would have to logically wonder why that piece of information couldn't come out.",

There's another New York Times story that, apparently, in the middle of March, he's telling one of his friends who later tells it to The New York Times that he doesn't any have real respect for the president or the administration. That is his view of honest, whatever he said he would be. That's probably-- honest loyalty I think was the term he used. That didn't sound either of those to me. But my real question, this is a guy who has every reason, with a great career in public service, to be a stand-up guy. Why would you go through a back channel, rather than just take responsibility? And another thing I wondered about, Neil, if his concern was, well, if the president really does have tapes, I need to get my story out there. If the president really does have tapes, sounded like to me he said his story would be on those tapes, if that was the case."

      "utterance": "Well, he was open to that. If the president has them, go ahead and release them. But let me add you again. It's a mistake I want to clarify for our viewers a little later. And it concerns a statement by the DNC chair, Tom Perez."

    {
      "speaker": "I'm quoting here, Senator, because I have taken the I-leap here, the impeachment word leap. He said that",
      "utterance": "\"Comey's testimony just gave us the clearest and most damning evidence yet that President Trump lied to the American people and is likely under investigation for obstruction of justice, a serious and disturbing charge.\" I took the leap to say that would be an impeachable offense. But that was my interpretation. And that's not what he said. But, having said that, others have said that this does wreak of obstruction of justice, which would warrant impeachment proceedings. Are you in that camp?"

    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, I didn't know until yesterday -- and we heard again today -- that three different times Director Comey told the president that he wasn't the subject of an investigation. And the president never asked on any of those three occasions. These are all occasions where the director on his own decides to add that to another conversation. And, of course, if you're the president and you know that the FBI has been investigating this since 2015, and you have been told three times in 90 days that you're not part of the investigation, you would have to logically wonder why that piece of information couldn't come out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Is anything that you were hearing or anything you heard today, does any of it sound like obstruction of justice to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, Director Comey didn't say that. You know, presidents are often accused of this. President Obama in 2015 when he said, well, Mrs. Clinton really didn't intend to do anything bad, criticized by unnamed sources at the Justice Department. He then says the same thing again and goes a little further in 2016. That was supposedly obstruction of justice. The president-elect right before that January 6 meeting had said he didn't think that Secretary Clinton should be investigated any further. Was that obstruction of justice? Probably, none of it was that. And I don't think Mr. Comey said today that he thought it was either."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so where is this going, Senator?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, again, I think the committee, led by Mark Warner and Richard Burr, showed today that we have the capacity to deal with these difficult issues. I have said repeatedly that we ought to look at everything a reasonable person should look at, talk to everybody a reasonable person should talk to. And I think, if we do that, we will come to a conclusion that is largely bipartisan, based on the facts. And I think we're a long way, both in private and a little bit now in public, of establishing what those facts might be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, real quickly, your colleague Senator Lindsey had said, look, there's no way that former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is the chief counsel here, would have even allowed Comey to testify today if there was any hint or he was looking into obstruction of justice. I'm paraphrasing a little bit. But do you agree with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, I wouldn't know, wouldn't know what Mr. Mueller or Mr. Comey, either one, would think about that. But we didn't hear that today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I guess he's saying, he would have to sort of get a heads-up, and Mueller would have presumably said not a good idea, and he would have..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, and Mr. Comey hadn't been gone from the FBI that long."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "And he repeated again today that they were not investigating the president the day he left."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK. Senator, thank you very, very much."
