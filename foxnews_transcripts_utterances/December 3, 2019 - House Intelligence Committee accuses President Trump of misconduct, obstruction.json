      "utterance": "There better be. I mean, I think we might have gone into this process thinking how many Republicans the president would lose. That's no longer the question. Now the question is how many Democrats will Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff lose? Because as we've seen in this report, there's nothing new. And one thing that I think has harmed the Democrats case with both Mueller and the Ukraine is that there's a lack of an actual, of a crime, of something that people can viscerally understand; say, a break-in at a hotel. Say, a video record of perjury that everyone can see. And both Mueller and Ukraine, you're reaching for larger questions of abuse of office, inappropriate behavior, and I think that makes it harder to make the case for impeachment."

      "utterance": "But they say it's made. They say they need to speed it up because they're concerned that he's going to do it again. Those are the words of Adam Schiff. But you could wait. You could fight the court battles. You could try to get Mick Mulvaney and Secretary Pompeo, and others to testify. Rudy Giuliani. But they're not choosing to do that."

      "utterance": "I think that's been one of the most mystifying parts of all this, especially with Ambassador John Bolton. They didn't even subpoena him. He would be, possibly, the most important witness in all of this. They didn't even subpoena him. Adam Schiff said he did not want to get into a game of rope-a-dope with him. But there are clear issues of privilege between what a national security advisor says to a president inside the White House. It's the kind of thing that, if the House is going to subpoena the national security advisor, it's probably going to go to court and a judge will have to decide. And the House didn't even try."

      "utterance": "I've heard -- and this may be reaching, but it is interesting to see Adam Schiff continue to bring Mick Mulvaney, for them to play during the hearing the videotape of Mick Mulvaney at the press conference where the acting White House chief of staff said, \"Get over it.\" He mentioned it again today. If it goes to the Senate trial and Justice, Chief Justice John Roberts is presiding, the Senate makes the rules. But in order to make the rules, all Democrats would need to do is convince four Republicans to switch over and say -- and compel Mulvaney to testify or someone to testify. And Justice Roberts can make a decision, and they would have a majority to compel that. Is this what they're trying to do, is to get the testimony not through the courts but in the Senate trial?"

It doesn't look particularly helpful right now. They would like to not test that theory; they would like to get it done and over with. Schiff also said, though, and the report says that the investigation is not over. It's continuing. It sounds like they would refuse to talk to Mulvaney, if Mulvaney or Bolton suddenly became available."

      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "If you open it up to Mueller, then you're going to lose more moderate Democrats when it comes to the separate articles of impeachment. I think you may find moderate Democrats voting against the article for abuse of power, but for the article for obstruction where there's clear evidence that there's been no document production, for example. The larger question is, though, where do Democrats go from here? They had their shot to change public opinion and to persuade the country that it was time to remove President Trump from office, from office, and they failed. And the reason they failed is that the small number of voters who are persuadable, they just don't care."
