Capitol Hill bracing for an impeachment battle in the Senate while Democrats facing growing criticism for how they have handled the process up to now. Earlier today, impeachment articles were presented and read aloud by the Democratic managers, and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts swore in senators as jurors. Now, those are all formalities. Then there is the little partisan battle. Nancy Pelosi and her impeachment managers being blasted by Republicans for handing out souvenir impeachment pens during what was supposed to be a somber ceremony yesterday. And Adam Schiff is under fire for dumping documents from Rudy Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, after the House wrapped its investigations. The GOP senators, they're pushing back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

His kids shouldn't go to jail or anything. They should be forced to watch Morning Joe every single day as punishment. Look, we know the ending to this story. Yet, we have to cover this non-stop, the constant scenes of people walking as if this is an achievement that they can walk into an open space without collapsing. So that is a big deal. But one thing I noticed is that these people are working, right? And we are fine, which means that all of these politicians that are walking around creating this phoney, pomp and circumstance are totally unnecessary to the smooth running of a country. All you really need is Trump. Trump's on his own getting the stuff done. You have all these other idiots wandering around, trying to look serious. And the more serious they look, the more comical they become. The beauty of this is they are going to lose, right. But we are going to let them go through this and let them work it all out. But these clowns like Nadler and Schiff, they are not in control. So when they start talking about witnesses, no witnesses.

She said she's and somber. And she's wisecracking, smiling, and handing out souvenirs. She is so see-through. Abuse of power, it's not like the president spied on an opposing presidential campaign. Obstruction, it's not like he bleached 30,000 emails under subpoena. I mean, what do you have? Nancy said she cares so much about national security, when in her career has she been tough on the Russians, the Chinese, the terrorists? She wants the border to be like a sieve. This is about protecting the Constitution, really, Nancy? The First Amendment, the Second Amendment, Due process, speedy trial? Which one is it, Nancy? Election integrity, really, OK, then pass a voter ID laws. Or is she just trying to pay back Trump for zeroing in on the Biden family shenanigans. That's that is what this is all about. I mean, Hillary paid for foreign interference in the election to the tune of $9 million for a fake dossier. And then the GAO comes out and says tsk, tsk. Trump broke a rule by delaying aid. GAO said Obama broke a rule with the Bergdahl trade, said George W. Bush broke a rule. Maybe Joe Biden broke a rule when he delayed the aid unless Ukraine fired the prosecutor who was investigating his son. It happens in every administration. It's no big deal. Trump was just kicking the tires on an administration that was new and rife with corruption. And he got the money out under the wire. And the Ukrainians didn't even have to do anything. Lastly, this guy, Lev Parnas, whatever his name is, this guy is like the Michael Avenatti. You know, at the last second they are throwing out gang rate claims all of a sudden. You are supposed to take this guy seriously. He says he never even spoken to Donald Trump. He just paid Rudy Giuliani to make money off of his name. He said Devin Nunes went to Vienna and met with the prosecutor about Joe Biden. He's never been to Vienna. And now CNN is getting sued for reporting that Lev lied. Lev said he was speaking to the Ukrainian foreign minister about all this. The Ukrainian foreign minister went on CNN yesterday and said I never met the guy.

Now, Lev Parnas has firsthand knowledge that the president lied, that he had direct knowledge that, in fact, there was a quid pro quo of what Gordon Sunderland, the ambassador said, was a clear effort to use U.S. money as leverage against the Ukraine, money that have been approved by Congress to get dirt on Joe Biden.

Earlier today, impeachment articles were presented and read aloud by the Democratic managers, and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts swore in senators as jurors. Now, those are all formalities. Then there is the little partisan battle. Nancy Pelosi and her impeachment managers being blasted by Republicans for handing out souvenir impeachment pens during what was supposed to be a somber ceremony yesterday. And Adam Schiff is under fire for dumping documents from Rudy Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, after the House wrapped its investigations. The GOP senators, they're pushing back."

Wasn't he the one that kissed his ass at the start of this whole thing and pleaded to have him on? We need to put his kids and his family on trial. Anyway, I'm kidding. His kids shouldn't go to jail or anything. They should be forced to watch Morning Joe every single day as punishment. Look, we know the ending to this story. Yet, we have to cover this non-stop, the constant scenes of people walking as if this is an achievement that they can walk into an open space without collapsing. So that is a big deal. But one thing I noticed is that these people are working, right? And we are fine, which means that all of these politicians that are walking around creating this phoney, pomp and circumstance are totally unnecessary to the smooth running of a country. All you really need is Trump. Trump's on his own getting the stuff done. You have all these other idiots wandering around, trying to look serious. And the more serious they look, the more comical they become. The beauty of this is they are going to lose, right. But we are going to let them go through this and let them work it all out. But these clowns like Nadler and Schiff, they are not in control. So when they start talking about witnesses, no witnesses. They want you to believe that the TV witnesses, the people that are on Maddow, are actually hearing witnesses. No, those are TV witnesses. Those are for the ratings to get the people to watch the shows, but they are not real witnesses, so they won't be there."

They had some runner run it over to the secretary of the Senate on a Saturday. It wasn't carried lives. No one slow-mowed the walking, and they didn't -- also treated the way Nancy treated it. She said she's and somber. And she's wisecracking, smiling, and handing out souvenirs. She is so see-through. Abuse of power, it's not like the president spied on an opposing presidential campaign. Obstruction, it's not like he bleached 30,000 emails under subpoena. I mean, what do you have? Nancy said she cares so much about national security, when in her career has she been tough on the Russians, the Chinese, the terrorists? She wants the border to be like a sieve. This is about protecting the Constitution, really, Nancy? The First Amendment, the Second Amendment, Due process, speedy trial? Which one is it, Nancy? Election integrity, really, OK, then pass a voter ID laws. Or is she just trying to pay back Trump for zeroing in on the Biden family shenanigans. That's that is what this is all about. I mean, Hillary paid for foreign interference in the election to the tune of $9 million for a fake dossier. And then the GAO comes out and says tsk, tsk. Trump broke a rule by delaying aid. GAO said Obama broke a rule with the Bergdahl trade, said George W. Bush broke a rule. Maybe Joe Biden broke a rule when he delayed the aid unless Ukraine fired the prosecutor who was investigating his son. It happens in every administration. It's no big deal. Trump was just kicking the tires on an administration that was new and rife with corruption. And he got the money out under the wire. And the Ukrainians didn't even have to do anything. Lastly, this guy, Lev Parnas, whatever his name is, this guy is like the Michael Avenatti. You know, at the last second they are throwing out gang rate claims all of a sudden. You are supposed to take this guy seriously. He says he never even spoken to Donald Trump. He just paid Rudy Giuliani to make money off of his name. He said Devin Nunes went to Vienna and met with the prosecutor about Joe Biden. He's never been to Vienna. And now CNN is getting sued for reporting that Lev lied. Lev said he was speaking to the Ukrainian foreign minister about all this. The Ukrainian foreign minister went on CNN yesterday and said I never met the guy. Don't trust a word he says."

And what you had was people being told they can't testify, John Bolton being the prime example, Dana, who have direct, firsthand knowledge of what took place. And so if we're all curious, if we all want to know exactly what happened, and the president says it was a perfect call. Why not let people with firsthand knowledge come and say something? Now, Lev Parnas has firsthand knowledge that the president lied, that he had direct knowledge that, in fact, there was a quid pro quo of what Gordon Sunderland, the ambassador said, was a clear effort to use U.S. money as leverage against the Ukraine, money that have been approved by Congress to get dirt on Joe Biden. So, you know, it doesn't seem as if there is much doubt about the specific crime. There are simply people who say, well, it's not worthy of impeachment. But I also want to take this opportunity, because I don't often do this, to pay tribute to Greg Gutfeld, because who would guess that Mitchell McConnell would be following -- by the way, marching, like you know they marched.

Without original thinkers like Yang or Tulsi, those on stage seemed bored by their own words. Biden disappeared into the podium as Tom Steyer stared at you like a glazed stalker on the subway. It seemed a group unprepared to face Trump. In fact, if you were some space alien and saw two screens, one with the debate and the other with a Trump rally, you would think these debates were beamed from different planets.

It actually really isn't the Democrats that are at fault. They're out of power, right? Democrats are out of power so they want to get back in power, they'll do anything. But it's the media who are always in power. They always control the stories, they always push the narratives. And every time they are dead wrong, and we've never known how dead wrong they were in the past until recently. Now we understand how much is fake. And we saw this with Kavanaugh, and we saw this with Covington, and with Avenatti and collusion that this is on the media. They're a bunch of a medic lemmings that copy each other in order to be cool. They're like every dumb teenager that falls for somebody bad and then they try to forget about it, but you can't forget you got to hold them to it. It's the same thing with impeachment.
