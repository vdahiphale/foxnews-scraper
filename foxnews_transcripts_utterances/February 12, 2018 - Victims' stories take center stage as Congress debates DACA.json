      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. Welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. It is great to be back in D.C., although New Orleans was fun. We have so many huge stories to cover from the capital to California. We will be on them. Byron York has new information that the Obama DOJ might have overruled the FBI when they reportedly told Congress that Michael Flynn did not lie under oath. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And CNN has a crush on the sister of the North Korean dictator, isn't that nice? And they're not alone. We are going to analyze why this is happening. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, Democrats banking on the 'Me Too' Trump card. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The past few days have convinced me more than ever that the Democrats and their American media are feverishly attempting to use the #metoo moment for Trump's undoing. Now that the Democrats have extracted this massive increase in domestic spending in the budget bill, they have essentially given up on the idea of working with the Republicans to actually improve the country and solve some problems. Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin have come to the conclusion that that the only way to beat Trump is to avoid debates on his policies, which let's face it, for the most part are showing signs are working. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, what they are instead doing is resorting to full on dehumanization and guilt by association. And sadly, it was obvious, almost from the start that the #metoo movement would become more about politics than justice. You think about it. Justice requires more than an accusation and a denial. It involves probable cause, the rules of evidence, no hearsay allowed, and the cross-examination of witness, for instance. You know, this antiqued notion of innocent until proven guilty. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, of course, in some cases, the evidence is overwhelming. You think about Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, they come to mind, and they are discussing even criminal behavior, was well known by the glitterati for decades. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But after the two went off to rehab and the 'me too' thing really ramped up, let's face it, the folks pushing the movement really moved on to their real target, Donald J. Trump.",

The Democrats know this is a magic bullet for them. If they turn the women's vote, by just a few percentage points, it can mean the difference in the midterms and in 2020. But I want to be clear, this is by all means not a lost cause. That is not what I'm saying, contrary to what MSNBC and CNN would have you believe. Most women want greater economic opportunities. They want safe streets. They want solid public schools for their kids, and they want health care that covers the big stuff. I think that is for most of us. And the president is doing more on all of those fronts than I think the past two presidents combined and he needs to sell this directly to the voters, including women voters, directly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But tone matters, especially with women, it is not just what you say, but how you say it. And sometimes, it is also what you fail to say. That can be just as important as what you do say. So, if he comes on too strong, or to defensively, in tweets or on off-the- cuff exchange with reporters, he could set himself back and he could confirm the unfair caricature of the left promotes 24/7. And that could mean disastrous results. And that's the ANGLE. All right, we are going to have a lot more to say about that, about the ANGLE coming up later in the show, but we have to begin with a remarkable new development, indicating that the Justice Department may have overruled the FBI in the Michael Flynn case. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are joined by the reporter who broke the story just tonight, 'Washington Examiner's ' Byron York, and by his fellow Fox News contributor, Kim Strassel of 'The Wall Street Journal.' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Byron, let's start with you.

We have so many huge stories to cover from the capital to California. We will be on them. Byron York has new information that the Obama DOJ might have overruled the FBI when they reportedly told Congress that Michael Flynn did not lie under oath. And CNN has a crush on the sister of the North Korean dictator, isn't that nice? And they're not alone. We are going to analyze why this is happening. But first, Democrats banking on the 'Me Too' Trump card. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. The past few days have convinced me more than ever that the Democrats and their American media are feverishly attempting to use the #metoo moment for Trump's undoing. Now that the Democrats have extracted this massive increase in domestic spending in the budget bill, they have essentially given up on the idea of working with the Republicans to actually improve the country and solve some problems. Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin have come to the conclusion that that the only way to beat Trump is to avoid debates on his policies, which let's face it, for the most part are showing signs are working. So, what they are instead doing is resorting to full on dehumanization and guilt by association. And sadly, it was obvious, almost from the start that the #metoo movement would become more about politics than justice. You think about it. Justice requires more than an accusation and a denial. It involves probable cause, the rules of evidence, no hearsay allowed, and the cross-examination of witness, for instance. You know, this antiqued notion of innocent until proven guilty. Now, of course, in some cases, the evidence is overwhelming. You think about Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, they come to mind, and they are discussing even criminal behavior, was well known by the glitterati for decades. But after the two went off to rehab and the 'me too' thing really ramped up, let's face it, the folks pushing the movement really moved on to their real target, Donald J. Trump."

And ditto for Congress, you know, they didn't begin their soul-searching moments until reports emerged of a secret House slush fund that was used to pay settlements to those who were accused of wrongdoing, politicians and staff. By the way, while we are on that, Congressman John Conyers, who was forced into retirement over harassment allegations, he was an old lech for years and everybody knew that. So, I ask you, if these Democrats cared so much about women, especially vulnerable young women, why didn't any of them speak out? We all know why. Now, this is really good. Even a Supreme Court justice seems to be hopping on the 'Me Too ' bandwagon, citing a toxic testosterone filled atmosphere for Hillary's election loss."

Look at, Gillibrand has fully weaponize -- fully weaponized the #metoo moment with the intention of driving the female vote in the midterms, and ultimately, sweeping herself right into the oval office. And while we all condemn actual abuse and harassment and all of its forms, regardless of where it occurs, the last time that I checked, jobs, the economy, health care, education were still the top issues for voters including women. Nonetheless, let's face it, a shift may be underway especially among younger voters. Ted Cruz said over the weekend that the left would crawl over broken glass to vote in the midterms. Thinking about it, he is probably right. And if Gillibrand has her way, most of those with cuts on their hands and knees are going to be women. The left is really busy marshaling their allies, their resources, across the cultural and political spectrum to make the president toxic to women. And ultimately drive him from office and the president has already seen some erosion and his female support. The Democrats know this is a magic bullet for them. If they turn the women's vote, by just a few percentage points, it can mean the difference in the midterms and in 2020. But I want to be clear, this is by all means not a lost cause. That is not what I'm saying, contrary to what MSNBC and CNN would have you believe. Most women want greater economic opportunities. They want safe streets. They want solid public schools for their kids, and they want health care that covers the big stuff. I think that is for most of us. And the president is doing more on all of those fronts than I think the past two presidents combined and he needs to sell this directly to the voters, including women voters, directly. But tone matters, especially with women, it is not just what you say, but how you say it. And sometimes, it is also what you fail to say. That can be just as important as what you do say. So, if he comes on too strong, or to defensively, in tweets or on off-the- cuff exchange with reporters, he could set himself back and he could confirm the unfair caricature of the left promotes 24/7. And that could mean disastrous results. And that's the ANGLE. All right, we are going to have a lot more to say about that, about the ANGLE coming up later in the show, but we have to begin with a remarkable new development, indicating that the Justice Department may have overruled the FBI in the Michael Flynn case. We are joined by the reporter who broke the story just tonight, 'Washington Examiner's ' Byron York, and by his fellow Fox News contributor, Kim Strassel of 'The Wall Street Journal.' Byron, let's start with you. I had heard rumblings about this last year, that Mike Flynn did not lie in the questioning by the FBI. Remind us of how this all went down. It was very unusual how he came to be interviewed."

That's what happens when you are about to become the national security advisor. He has a couple of conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, and these were wiretapped because we wiretapped the Russian ambassador, which is perfectly reasonable. They talked about sanctions, and somehow, the Obama Justice Department became very concerned about this. They convinced themselves that this may be a violation of the Logan Act. You have probably told your viewers about Logan Act. It's 200 years old, never successfully prosecuted, they did try to charge to people in the 19th Century, but it didn't work. So, on this basis, this pretense, they go to interview Michael Flynn in January 24th, fourth day on the job in the White House, right? And what I learned --"

      "speaker": "KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, COLUMNIST, WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "When you look at Mike Flynn, you basically have two options for why he would have done this. One theory out there is that maybe Mueller had something worse on him, and this was his way of getting out. The better theory, which has been out there is that his son was also under investigation, and curiouser and curiouser that the headlines came out that his son was no longer going to be under investigation right about the time that Flynn accepted this plea deal. So, the thought was that he was helping out his son, but look, for people out there who have worries about the Mueller probe and how legitimate it is, and whether or not it has other ambitions, this is ground zero for them. Because you end up taking the partisan accusations of a very partisan acting attorney general, trying to gin up a charge on an act that's 200 years old could never be enforceable in law, and manages as a result of this to drum a guy not only out of his job, but ultimately land him with a felony charge."

We find out today in this new Graham memo that she sent an email to herself. We have a full screen of it on inauguration day saying the following. 'President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the intelligence and law enforcement communities by the book. The president stressed that he is not asking about initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement needs to proceed as normally would by the book.' That is about to the January 5th meeting.

Let's go back to Susan Rice, remember, she has links to the Flynn issue as well, and that she was involved in unmasking him, and then ultimately of course that was illegally leaked to the press, his name. But look, on this particular email, it reminds me of the story back in 2003, Jay Rockefeller, the Senate Democrat on the Intelligence Committee was briefed on wireless wiretapping, he did not say anything about it at the time, but he wrote himself a letter and stuck it in a desk drawer. And then later when there was controversy, he wielded it out. He was like I never thought this was a good idea to begin with. I think what we have here -- yes, Susan Rice is putting down I want everyone to know that this is exactly what happened in this meeting. Just in case it turns out that someone starts asking later."

During the trial last month, the defendant said he wished he had killed more police officers, if you can believe that. Against this backdrop, the Senate began debate today on immigration reform. But Democrats don't appear interested in making a deal for the so-called DREAMers. Remember, they rejected President Trump's offer to give amnesty to 1.8 million illegal immigrants and now they seem intent on pounding Republicans as anti-immigrants. To discuss, I am joined by Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar and Republican Congressman Todd Rokita. We will also get perspective from Pam Davis Owen in Reno, Nevado. Her nephew, (inaudible) County detective, Michael Davis, was one of the two officers murdered by Bracamontes. Pam, thank you so much for making the trip and talking to us tonight. I think it is really important in this conversation that we keep American citizens, who have had a direct horrible impact from uncontrolled borders in this conversation because they rarely get attention that they deserve. So, thank you for joining us.

Something else, I don't know, that is something that we have to work on, but you've got to understand that whatever we do changing the DREAMers legalization, people like myself that to live at the border, we don't just come in and come to border, spend a few hours, and we think we know this because if you look at the crime rate here at the border using the FBI statistics, the crime rate here, let's say Laredo, my hometown, or just the crime rate along the border is lower than the national crime rate. In fact, the most dangerous thing of me being near the border, let me finish. The most dangerous thing that I have here at the border is when I leave to go to work in Washington, D.C.

Here's the deal is at some point maybe we'll talk about health care, jobs, the economy, entrepreneurship, all the science training we're supposed to do, STEM training for women, but I don't think Democrats want those debates. I don't think think -- they want to talk about Me Too, Me Too, Me Too, Me Too much sometimes. And you guys are great. I love having you on. And the media have discovered the breakout star of the Winter Olympics. Is it the luge? Is it the bobsledder? Well, pay no attention to the fact but she is a member of one of the world's bloodiest dictatorships, straight ahead."

CNN, for example, assured us that Kim Yo-jong would be favored to win the gold if diplomatic dance were a medal event. Forget the atrocities Kim inflicts on his own people. That doesn't matter. For reaction let's bring in Gordon Chang, author of 'Nuclear Showdown, North Korea Takes on the World,' and Michael Fuchs from the Center for American Progress. Mike, let's start with you. I thought that was odd of CNN to focus on her diplomatic dance given what we know about what they have done to their own people. I don't know. You don't want to go to the Hitler comparison."

I think a lot of people unfortunately fells into it, and what it really did is it obscured the incredibly important high-level diplomacy that was going on or frankly was not going on I think when it came to the U.S. unfortunately during this high-level engagement."

      "utterance": "No, he should not have shaken his hand, which is what a lot of people wanted. He could have nodded at her just to acknowledge her presence. But, you know, by and large, I think the vice president had a strategy, and that was essentially to ignore the North Koreans, not to legitimize them. The one big complaint I have about the media is that they didn't cover the vice president when he went to the Cheonan memorial to honor the 46 sailors that North Korea killed in 2010. They did not cover when he met the North Korean escapees, and they didn't say very much that the vice president brought father of Otto Warmbier to the opening ceremonies. Those things should also have been covered."

      "speaker": "FUCHS",
      "utterance": "No, I agree with that. But to Gordon's point, a year ago the Trump administration unveiled its strategy on North Korea which was maximum pressure, maximum engagement. I agree that Vice President Pence did a great job when he was there with the maximum pressure side of things. But unfortunately he left out the engagement part of it. And I think the biggest danger there was taking away from this trip what looks to be a growing divide between the United States and South Korea, which is an important alliance that's necessary for dealing with --"

It was unbelievable. I attended the Krewe of Bacchus, their parade, 50th anniversary rendezvous, watching more than 30 floats and marching bands coming into the convention center at New Orleans yesterday. It was unbelievable, late last night. It's one of those serial experiences you really have to see to believe.

Mardi Gras krewes host balls, parades, and undertake philanthropic works throughout the year. But this particular krewe was founded up by a group of JAG lawyers from New Orleans. Rico Alvendia was one of them."

And as you see, rain or shine, they are rolling. A little ran could not stop this krewe. Many of the riders have seen combat in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. For some of these vets, this is not just a parade, but an experience of joy and healing. Fred Bermaster (ph) and Bill Trow (ph) served in Vietnam together, but it was the Legion of Mars that reunited them after more than 45 years and changed them for the better."

And so my wife thought that it would be a good idea for me, personally, to join a group that was catering to vets. And it has. It has been a blessing. It has kind of brought me out of my shell and gave me an opportunity to meet folks. And I feel a lot more comfortable being around veterans."

Tommy, you are so in trouble, you are so outnumbered three to one. Oh, no. Look at her, she is priceless. Can't wait to meet her. Enjoy those girls, Tommy. And that's all the time we have tonight.
