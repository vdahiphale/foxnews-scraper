Security Council today voting to approve a new round of sanctions, a fourth round of sanctions against Iran, specifically targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The vote was 12-2, Lebanon abstaining, and Brazil and Turkey voting no. In response, Iran's president Ahmadinejad said he does not recognize the sanctions and, \"For us they are annoying flies, like a used tissue.\" And here is the response from Republicans or at least one of them on Capitol Hill, Senator Jon Kyl, who said, \"The divided vote of the security council displays to Iran the world is not united in dealing with its illicit conduct. We are, in fact, in a far worse position than we were 18 months ago when the president started his diplomacy of appeasement and apology. It's clear the president's policy has failed.\" That is where we begin with the panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Erin Billings, deputy editor of Roll Call, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.

The sanctions are totally watered down by Russia and China to be almost meaningless. To achieve even this it took 16 months of administration labor ending up and producing a mouse. And last, the three sanctions resolution that the Bush administration had without apology and without concessions were approved unanimously. And this one received 12 of the 15 with an opposition by allies Turkey and Brazil and as you said, an abstention from Lebanon. So if anything, it's a clear demonstration of the collapse of the international effort to the extent that it ever existed. Under this administration's policy as a Senator Kyl said of appeasement and apology. The president of Iran is exactly right that this is a flea, it's meaningless.

Here is their sort of sophisticated defense of this. We know it's weak and we know it's watered down, but the way the Europeans work you have to get a U.N. Security Council resolution first. Then we can build on this with stronger sanctions, both unilateral on the part of the U.S. the congressional law, and also joint EU/U.S. sanctions which could allegedly target financial institutions and do damage. Most people I talk to who know about this don't think even if we got to that in three or six months that those would do enough damage by any means to really slow down the Iranian nuclear program. But it's their justification. Don't look at the details of the U.N. sanctions. The fact of the U.N. sanctions will legitimize going further they say on the part of the EU. But I agree with Charles, unfortunately. We are 16 months closer to Iran having nuclear weapons and Iran is less isolated than it was before. That is what really galls me. For 16 months, the administration not having progress on sanctions patting itself on the back and saying they're much more isolated. But every time you turn on the TV, Ahmadinejad is with Putin or the leaders of Brazil and Turkey or visiting China or he is throwing his weight around throughout the Middle East. Indeed, the Washington Post has a front page story, saying they're, a, good at evading sanctions, and, b, Iran is less isolated than it was.",

      "utterance": "This resolution will put in place the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government, and it sends an unmistakable message about the international community's commitment to stopping the spread of nuclea r weapons. These sanctions do not close the door on diplomacy. Iran continues to have the opportunity to take a different and better path. BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: The U.N. Security Council today voting to approve a new round of sanctions, a fourth round of sanctions against Iran, specifically targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The vote was 12-2, Lebanon abstaining, and Brazil and Turkey voting no. In response, Iran's president Ahmadinejad said he does not recognize the sanctions and, \"For us they are annoying flies, like a used tissue.\" And here is the response from Republicans or at least one of them on Capitol Hill, Senator Jon Kyl, who said, \"The divided vote of the security council displays to Iran the world is not united in dealing with its illicit conduct. We are, in fact, in a far worse position than we were 18 months ago when the president started his diplomacy of appeasement and apology. It's clear the president's policy has failed.\" That is where we begin with the panel, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, Erin Billings, deputy editor of Roll Call, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.

This is an unmistakable messages about the fecklessness of the U.S. and the international community which in and of itself is a fiction anyway. The sanctions are totally watered down by Russia and China to be almost meaningless. To achieve even this it took 16 months of administration labor ending up and producing a mouse. And last, the three sanctions resolution that the Bush administration had without apology and without concessions were approved unanimously. And this one received 12 of the 15 with an opposition by allies Turkey and Brazil and as you said, an abstention from Lebanon. So if anything, it's a clear demonstration of the collapse of the international effort to the extent that it ever existed. Under this administration's policy as a Senator Kyl said of appeasement and apology. The president of Iran is exactly right that this is a flea, it's meaningless. And everybody in the administration I think knows that."

Security Council to get these sanctions in place. Steny Hoyer, the majority leader, Democrat of Maryland today said they are going to try to move forward on this, the week of June 21st. So even hawk Democrats on Capitol Hill today said this is great, but we need to do more. Republicans are pushing for it as well. Even though the Obama administration's claiming victory and the Democrats are backing them up, they want more. They don't think that these are the crippling sanctions that the Obama administration promised 16, 18 months ago."

      "utterance": "If you talk to people privately from the Obama administration, which I occasionally do, when I haven't said anything too harsh on this show for a week or two, then they will talk for a minute. Here is their sort of sophisticated defense of this. We know it's weak and we know it's watered down, but the way the Europeans work you have to get a U.N. Security Council resolution first. Then we can build on this with stronger sanctions, both unilateral on the part of the U.S. the congressional law, and also joint EU/U.S. sanctions which could allegedly target financial institutions and do damage. Most people I talk to who know about this don't think even if we got to that in three or six months that those would do enough damage by any means to really slow down the Iranian nuclear program. But it's their justification. Don't look at the details of the U.N. sanctions. The fact of the U.N. sanctions will legitimize going further they say on the part of the EU. But I agree with Charles, unfortunately. We are 16 months closer to Iran having nuclear weapons and Iran is less isolated than it was before. That is what really galls me. For 16 months, the administration not having progress on sanctions patting itself on the back and saying they're much more isolated. But every time you turn on the TV, Ahmadinejad is with Putin or the leaders of Brazil and Turkey or visiting China or he is throwing his weight around throughout the Middle East. Indeed, the Washington Post has a front page story, saying they're, a, good at evading sanctions, and, b, Iran is less isolated than it was."

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "We passed it on the issue of sanctions. Perhaps military attack might succeed, but sanctions, even if they are strong and serious are not going to have an effect. Even if you imagine we went back five years, the Iranians were never -- this regime was never going to be deterred to achieve its ultimate objective, which is hegemony in the region, the power with nukes that it sought for 1,000 years in the Arab world for what, a mess of porridge, a few economic sanctions? There was no chance in the first place. The only effect it might have had is during the quasi-revolution last year if we applied sanctions and weakened the regime suddenly and quickly, economically, it might have been toppled. But that was an opportunity that came and went."

      "speaker": "KRISTOL",
      "utterance": "I guess it suggests that the problem is that people's lives in Gaza are difficult. They're difficult in some degree but that's because Hamas rules Gaza. The deeper problem, to go back to Iran, letting Iran succeed in the last several years has had disastrous effects, not just because Iran is going to get nuclear weapons probably unless military force is used, but the incentives it's created for everyone else in the region, the lesson it taught. In Turkey, there are debate between Islamists who like Iranians and others. And if you debate internally with the Turkish military and others and they say you can't go down that road and compete with the Iranians to be radical, you will annoy the U.S. and pay a big price. Everyone looks around and says are you kidding? This is the path to success and glory in the Middle East. And so we have created a dynamic in which the radicals are getting stronger in the Middle East."

The other thing I will say is this is going to, I really want to see what happens from here on out. Obviously, Blanche Lincoln won her runoff in Arkansas. I think she has a tough road ahead.
