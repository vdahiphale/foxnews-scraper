      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Antifa went on the attack in Portland, Oregon yesterday. One of the victims who was bashed by them joins us just a head with an account of what happened. But first tonight, it's been a bewildering couple of months for Bill Barr. Imagine you're Bill Barr. Barr first served as Attorney General in the George H.W. Bush administration. That was 1991. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez it just turned two years old at the time. That's how long ago it was. Then this February, purely by process of elimination, basically as he was the one guy could get confirmed, Barr became Attorney General of the United States once again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Mueller investigation was nearly over when he got the job. Barr probably didn't expect to becoming a major figure in the Russia story because he had nothing to do with it. As far as we know, Barr never met with secret agents in Prague. He never texted Vladimir Putin on his Blackberry. He never managed a Macedonian content forum. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If Barr betrayed this country for a sack of rubles or a case of vodka, nobody has ever proved it. But it doesn't matter. The Russia story cannot die. CNN, \"The Washington Post,\" the Democratic Party, many others have too much invested in that story. The fact it's been proven to be untrue is irrelevant to them. Bill Barr is a handy way to keep Russia in the news. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Watch today's talking point in action. Somewhere in the basement of the Democratic National Committee, some messaging consultant has decided that credibility is the most effective line of attack.

So what is the point of continuing with the story? GLENN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDING EDITOR, \"THE INTERCEPT\": And the point is everything that you just said, namely that for three years, it's almost been three years. It started in mid-2016. The Democrats have put all their eggs in one basket, which is that they've insisted the central theme of the Trump presidency is that he was a Russian agent who collaborated with the Kremlin in the election, and they all agreed that Robert Mueller was going to be empowered to get to the bottom of this and we were all going to accept whatever it was that Mueller found. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what Mueller found was that the entire conspiracy theory was a hoax, that there's no evidence to establish that it's true, and they led their flock to believe for so long and profited greatly from it. Cable networks that did it saw massive increases in their ratings. Newspapers that did it saw huge subscription increases. They made tons of money exploiting people like con artists, and now it's kind of like the leader of an apocalyptic Doomsday cold, who keeps promising the world is going to end on a certain date and then the day comes and the world still goes. And so you need to keep giving people reasons to follow you and to believe and we are now descended from Trump is a Russian agent. He is controlled by the Kremlin. He conspired with the Russians to people eating fried chicken, because they say that Bill Barr waited three weeks before releasing the entire Mueller report that he himself gave to the public. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So I accepted his offer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He flew me to London where he paid a five-star hotel and my flights. And he said, \"Before I meet with you, I need you to meet my assistant.\" And he put this assistant in an e-mail chain along with me. And I saw her name was Azra Turk. I recognize it as Turkish, which was a bit suspicious right away because my policy positions throughout my entire career were very hostile to Turkey. So when I noticed the Turkish name, I didn't understand why she'd be involved. But anyways, I went and I met with her and she was very suggestive as you can understand, younger, you know, very flirtatious and I right away understood that this wasn't a Cambridge assistant. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And you know, she barely spoke English. She was very flirty, and was trying to do two things; one, to extract information about my professional connections in the Middle East; and two, to see if I had any information that she could potentially extract for me about Trump and Russia, which of course is nonsense. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so anyways after I meet with her, she is then introduced to me again the next day with Stefan Halper where she goes from this suggestive young lady to now pouring us coffee and Stefan Halper is very belligerent. I explained it in my book, how belligerent he is, how he invited me to basically castigate me about my policy positions. And of course, Azra Turk then took me to dinner, and was just basically trying to extract information. I was very suspicious. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, you know, from that moment, I knew there was something wrong and I was laughing about it. But now, of course, \"The New York Times\" reported that she was some sort of agent, but I don't think she was FBI think she was CIA.",

So clearly, when \"The New York Times\" suggested in their reporting today that the British were told of this operation, I believe the British actually were actively spying on me as well.

They are breaking into more servers in this country than Russia ever thought of and they're getting stronger every single year. Which brings us to Joe Biden. He is the front runner on the Democratic side. His position is, \"don't worry.\" At a recent rally, Biden said this of China quote, \"They're not bad guys. They're not competition for us.\" Biden has been pro-China for a long time. In 2011, he wrote an op-ed arguing that China getting stronger is not a threat to the United States. Kind of interesting. Why would he say something like that so demonstrably untrue? Maybe he's a Chinese spy. No, we're not going to make that allegation, we're just going to make the point that he's dead wrong.

One of the victims who was bashed by them joins us just a head with an account of what happened. But first tonight, it's been a bewildering couple of months for Bill Barr. Imagine you're Bill Barr. Barr first served as Attorney General in the George H.W. Bush administration. That was 1991. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez it just turned two years old at the time. That's how long ago it was. Then this February, purely by process of elimination, basically as he was the one guy could get confirmed, Barr became Attorney General of the United States once again. The Mueller investigation was nearly over when he got the job. Barr probably didn't expect to becoming a major figure in the Russia story because he had nothing to do with it. As far as we know, Barr never met with secret agents in Prague. He never texted Vladimir Putin on his Blackberry. He never managed a Macedonian content forum. If Barr betrayed this country for a sack of rubles or a case of vodka, nobody has ever proved it. But it doesn't matter. The Russia story cannot die. CNN, \"The Washington Post,\" the Democratic Party, many others have too much invested in that story. The fact it's been proven to be untrue is irrelevant to them. Bill Barr is a handy way to keep Russia in the news. Watch today's talking point in action. Somewhere in the basement of the Democratic National Committee, some messaging consultant has decided that credibility is the most effective line of attack. Watch."

We're happy to have him for the first time in the studio tonight. Glenn, thanks very much for coming on. So if you think about it for a second, it's a little strange that this is continuing since you know the Mueller report is out, the President likely not going to be impeached on the basis of anything the Mueller report found. So what is the point of continuing with the story? GLENN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDING EDITOR, \"THE INTERCEPT\": And the point is everything that you just said, namely that for three years, it's almost been three years. It started in mid-2016. The Democrats have put all their eggs in one basket, which is that they've insisted the central theme of the Trump presidency is that he was a Russian agent who collaborated with the Kremlin in the election, and they all agreed that Robert Mueller was going to be empowered to get to the bottom of this and we were all going to accept whatever it was that Mueller found. And what Mueller found was that the entire conspiracy theory was a hoax, that there's no evidence to establish that it's true, and they led their flock to believe for so long and profited greatly from it. Cable networks that did it saw massive increases in their ratings. Newspapers that did it saw huge subscription increases. They made tons of money exploiting people like con artists, and now it's kind of like the leader of an apocalyptic Doomsday cold, who keeps promising the world is going to end on a certain date and then the day comes and the world still goes. And so you need to keep giving people reasons to follow you and to believe and we are now descended from Trump is a Russian agent. He is controlled by the Kremlin. He conspired with the Russians to people eating fried chicken, because they say that Bill Barr waited three weeks before releasing the entire Mueller report that he himself gave to the public."

How are the vast invasive powers of the FBI, NSA and CIA used to spy and infiltrate a campaign and spy on American citizens in the name of a conspiracy?

A new \"New York Times\" story reveals that the existence of a previously unknown informant was used to spy in the Trump campaign. A woman who went by the alias \"Azra Turk\" was sent to meet with campaign aide George Papadopoulos and tried to extract information from him. George Papadopoulos has a new book out called \"Deep State Target: How I Got Caught in the Crosshairs of the Plot to Bring Down President Trump.\" Probably the most accurate title of a book in a long time.

      "speaker": "PAPADOPOULOS",
      "utterance": "Sure, that's a great question. And I received an unsolicited e-mail in September of 2016, from a man named Stefan Halper, who was suggesting that he wanted to pay me $3,000.00 to write a report on energy security questions that I was a recognized expert on at the time in Israel, Turkey and Cyprus, and I looked him up. I'd never heard of him before. I just saw that he had worked in four U.S. administrations, and he was a professor at Cambridge. So I accepted his offer. He flew me to London where he paid a five-star hotel and my flights. And he said, \"Before I meet with you, I need you to meet my assistant.\" And he put this assistant in an e-mail chain along with me. And I saw her name was Azra Turk. I recognize it as Turkish, which was a bit suspicious right away because my policy positions throughout my entire career were very hostile to Turkey. So when I noticed the Turkish name, I didn't understand why she'd be involved. But anyways, I went and I met with her and she was very suggestive as you can understand, younger, you know, very flirtatious and I right away understood that this wasn't a Cambridge assistant. And you know, she barely spoke English. She was very flirty, and was trying to do two things; one, to extract information about my professional connections in the Middle East; and two, to see if I had any information that she could potentially extract for me about Trump and Russia, which of course is nonsense. And so anyways after I meet with her, she is then introduced to me again the next day with Stefan Halper where she goes from this suggestive young lady to now pouring us coffee and Stefan Halper is very belligerent. I explained it in my book, how belligerent he is, how he invited me to basically castigate me about my policy positions. And of course, Azra Turk then took me to dinner, and was just basically trying to extract information. I was very suspicious. And, you know, from that moment, I knew there was something wrong and I was laughing about it. But now, of course, \"The New York Times\" reported that she was some sort of agent, but I don't think she was FBI think she was CIA."

    {
      "speaker": "PAPADOPOULOS",
      "utterance": "That's absolutely what happened and I and I want to make something very clear here. I don't think President Trump was tweeting about U.K. interference out of the blue for no reason last week, because let me explain why. The day I met with Stefan Halper and Azra Turk in London, I was invited by the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with them at their offices, including with Tobias Ellwood, who was a number two at the time under Boris Johnson. So clearly, when \"The New York Times\" suggested in their reporting today that the British were told of this operation, I believe the British actually were actively spying on me as well. And I think part of what President Trump was tweeting last week about the British spying was about this involvement and this operation in London. So I guess we have a lot more to find out."

And you're seeing this where the media feels sort of empowered to smear people, including, in this case, a child who had come out to Washington, DC for the March for Life, and they did this over the course of days. They said false things about this boy and his school that were demonstrably untrue. And right now, there's not a lot of accountability for this.

I mean, you just -- in the earlier part of the show, we're talking about this Russia collusion hoax that went on for years and caused real damage to the country, including in our foreign policy, administration of government, and you're not even having people take accountability for that.

And then I was punched in the abdomen, both times were by different masked individuals. I immediately alerted the Portland Police officer who was standing yards away, and he let me know that if they stepped in to intervene that that would be an escalation and that that could incite the crowd. So he was going to do -- that he couldn't do anything. And if I wanted to, I could file a police report later. Later on the day, there was a brawl/riot outside the Cider Riot bar in in Portland. And it was there that I was singled out and targeted by a masked individual who sprayed me nearly point blank in the face with bare mace and blinded me. Fortunately, a woman who I have no idea who she is, but she led me across the street because I was -- I could not see and I was only there as a journalist and I was harassed and attacked all day.

They're not competition for us.\" Biden has been pro-China for a long time. In 2011, he wrote an op-ed arguing that China getting stronger is not a threat to the United States. Kind of interesting. Why would he say something like that so demonstrably untrue? Maybe he's a Chinese spy. No, we're not going to make that allegation, we're just going to make the point that he's dead wrong. Because he is. Well, Hillary Clinton is not running for President, not once again, but she is still in the news. She was on MSNBC last night and she says she is mad, because she is not in the White House, and therefore, this country is lurching toward tyranny."

Probably because there was so much projection as there always is going on. At one point Hillary said that President Trump is obsessed with her. \"He is not living in my head,\" she insisted, \"I'm living in his.\" She is not living in most people's heads in this country. A new poll from Rasmussen finds that only 42 percent of Americans think the country would have been better off had Hillary won, 48 percent disagree. Author and columnist, Mark Steyn is on the fence on that question. He joins us tonight to deliver his verdict -- Mark Steyn."

      "utterance": "Well, I was on the fence, Tucker. She lost because she was a stinking candidate. But look, it isn't funny anymore. I mean, basically, this is the woman who is more responsible than anyone for the totally pointless and discreditable Russian investigation that destroyed your first guest's life -- Papadopoulos. We had all this talk in November 2016, about how, oh, you know, America is the only country that has the peaceful transfer of power, which I always find a little odd because I can't remember the last time I saw a Belgian or Danish Prime Minister hanging from a lamppost. But the fact is that the more people who said it, the more it became conditional because it was her refusal to lose gracefully, that in fact enabled this last disgusting two years in which the losing party's men on the inside have conducted an investigation into the duly elected president. It's quite disgraceful. She is quite disgraceful. And to listen to your friend, Richard Goodstein. I like Richard, but for him laughing at what happened to -- Papadopoulos landed at Washington and the FBI agents seized him and put him in shackles -- shackles -- for doing nothing. And that's all on Hillary because she didn't know how to lose, because Clinton's shouldn't lose."
