That he was emotionally locked up and conflicted, and he wasn't really able to really love or to speak to people or even to do his best work work, and that he went into therapy, and for three years of therapy. It's helped him a lot. And I think he credits that, in part, with being him -- allowing him to be emotionally open to falling in love. And so that's great. And the second thing that interests me as a black American is that he says he thinks the press has been treating his fiancee with racial overtones, because she is half white, half black. And that some of it's just insensitive, he said, and sexism. So I don't think he thinks the press has been very fair to her. She's three years older than he has.

That he was emotionally locked up and conflicted, and he wasn't really able to really love or to speak to people or even to do his best work work, and that he went into therapy, and for three years of therapy. It's helped him a lot. And I think he credits that, in part, with being him -- allowing him to be emotionally open to falling in love. And so that's great. And the second thing that interests me as a black American is that he says he thinks the press has been treating his fiancee with racial overtones, because she is half white, half black. And that some of it's just insensitive, he said, and sexism. So I don't think he thinks the press has been very fair to her. She's three years older than he has. I'm surprised they're not picking on that."

Today there's about 100, one of which is a guy named Kerry Kirren (ph) in Ontario. And he calls himself the lonely salesman. You can still get -- you can get digital subscriptions, but teachers and librarians have been telling parents that it's good for children to have the actual book. And this year, the world encyclopedia 2017 edition is only $899. It's usually $1,099. What a deal."

She was accompanied by some acclaimed musicians during the performances. Frederic Yanni (ph) on harmonica and Chris Bhodi (ph) on trumpet and special guest David Foster. Take a listen."

And then all of a sudden, you're at the top of the hill. You can see the end. You know it's coming. Because there's less time ahead of you than there is behind, and it speeds up. And it's really bad. There's no upside to that downside. So why do I have a zit? Zits are not for old people. I have a giant zit on my neck. If I'm going to be dying of old age, and I'm getting wrinkles, there has to be a trade. Nobody over 50 should be getting zits. I don't know why I'm getting pimples."

And there, we have two couples who are getting married next June and July. That's Rafi and Morgan. And Nick and Marissa. Marissa is my niece.
