Older black voters like me, we have pretty much made up our minds who we are voting for and we have a choice between Trump and Biden, it looks like. Whereas younger voters, getting them out to vote is going to be tough here. That's why Biden was on Charlamagne show in the first place.

I mean, usually we have in the media this idea that when it comes to ending unborn human's life, that's a decision between a mother and her doctor. But somehow, this is a decision not between Trump and his doctor, but between Trump and everyone in the media. And I think there's been some misinformation in play, too. Whether or not this is a good idea for Trump to be taking or other people to be taking this Hydroxychloroquine, this is very common treatment not just as a prophylactic for malaria, but it's used daily in treatment for lupus and arthritis. And I think some people were trying to present it as if it's a very dangerous drug. Instead of, you know, yes, you need a doctor to prescribe it. But it's not dangerous. It's used widely across the world. And also that saying it was dangerous has made it so that people are saying it's harder to do clinical trials on this because people have so politicized the use of this drug. And that's not good for anybody. It's a public health threat if they can't do proper clinical trials on whether this is a good treatment or not for people who are suffering from Coronavirus."

His own medical authorities say that. Is this a worthwhile thing for the press to cover? Yes, because I'm old school, Howie. If the president does it, it's news. If the president says it, it's news.

And any ad you see on TV that talks about any kind of medical product has to have all of that side effects may include yada, yada, yada. Now, the president when he gets up and says he's taking something, it's almost like a celebrity endorser. He's got a lot folks out there that really look up to him. They look to him for an example, and so my hope would be that he continues to communicate that there are potential side effects, and this is not something you should take because Trump is taking it.

You've seen a lot of people at the state level taking action to be able to reopen churches or allow churches to reopen if they feel it's necessary. You have governors saying that you can open up Walmart's or Costco's or even tattoo parlors, but they are still prohibiting churches. And that's what happened in Minnesota where the Lutheran Church, Missouri's Dis-favoring religious groups compared to other groups is unconstitutional, particularly in light of what the First Amendment says about our freedom to worship. It's the very first thing mentioned in the Bill of Rights. And I don't think that we have gotten as much attention on this as it should have. And I do think that reflects to some extent less religiosity in the press core than is apparent in the rest of the population."

And the reaction by many, many journalists was he doesn't have the authority to do that under federal law, and, you know, brings up what happened a few weeks ago where first he said that he would tell the states what to do and then he said, no, I will defer to the governors, but not on this issue it now turns out."

Get culture war energy into what is essentially a public health problem. My church is closed. I'm longing to go back and see my people. But a lot of them are over 60. And it's an open question whether it makes sense to put us inside a sanctuary before we know that the rate of infection in a population has gotten down to a level where we don't put people in danger when we put them in large groups. That's the question, not freedom of worship. But whether making people, assuring people that it's OK to be in groups of 100, 150, 200, singing and speaking and praying, makes a lot of sense when we are still, in a widespread way, giving each other this infection."

If you're allowing other people to gather in groups of larger than 10, if you're allowing other places to open like tattoo parlors or stores or whatnot, but you're not allowing churches to make that decision for themselves. That's where it's a constitutional problem. And it -- being allowed to reopen doesn't mean that churches aren't going to continue to recommend that they're at-risk populations stay at home or do other things like so many churches across the country have done throughout this entire situation."

Kristen, what Ray said was very similar to comments by Jeff Mason of Reuters who told Kayleigh McEnany he thought her comments about the reaction of the room were unfair. He said I go to church. I'm dying to go to church. The question is whether it's safe. Do you think there's any effort here to kind of paint the press as being anti-religion?"

    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly. I mean, I think that's -- the point that the press secretary was trying to make. I'm glad there was pushback, because I don't think it's fair to say that the entire press core is a certain way in the same way that any time you are generalizing to an entire group. I do think that often times topics like religion are not covered well by the media, in part because if you've got a lot of folks based in big cities D.C. or New York, they're just not interacting as often with folks who may live in the American heartland. And you've seen that sort of crop up in problems of coverage over the last couple of years or so. But I don't think that it's fair to suggest that nobody in the media wants churches to be reopened. I think Mollie's point about churches should be treated the same way that we treat a Walmart, the same way that we treat anything else that's essential. Meaning, if you're going to be opened, you have to be open and be safe. I think seems to be a good direction to go."

I think it's a proxy for a bigger debate about whether it's time to reopen or about whether the economy should continue to be shut down. There is a huge partisan divide on that issue and media being -- tending to be on the left are on the side that wants to sort of keep the shutdown going. And I think that's why they are so obsessed with the mask. I don't actually understand their obsession with it."
    },

Tonight, they put another yet whistleblower, disgruntled employee who supports Dems, fabricates stories, and spews lies. And then, there was this. The whole whistleblower racket needs to be looked at very closely. It's causing great injustice and harm. Mollie, Rick Bright who had just testified before House committee was in the news. Why would the president denounce 60 Minutes for interviewing the guy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, first off, President Trump is wrong when he says that the media haven't covered problems with this particular whistleblower or his testimony or his changing story. The reason why we know there are problems with whistleblower is because it has been covered in the media. And so he's wrong to say that. And there's a different issue about whether the media have been responsible with how they've whistleblowers, whether they have applied the scrutiny that they should to anybody who is making any allegation. And you can see where that causes damage. You saw where the previous whistleblower issue that that was a media-led frenzy that led to impeachment. And it was very -- there was a lot of reason to have problem with it. And it's pretty obviously that there's an attempt to do this again. And it would be good for the media to apply more scrutiny than they have to this and all allegations that are made against anyone."

I mean, you mentioned later in the show you're going to talking about that front page in The New York Times. Today, they list a thousand names of those who have died from the Coronavirus, which is just one percent of those who have died in the United States. Not one of those needed to happen. This was something that -- it never should have made its way to the shores, nothing about this is positive, nothing this is uplifting, and it is not a badge of honor to have these many Americans having passed away."

You're going to have more cases. And a high percentage of those cases are completely asymptomatic. And that is one of the things that I think the media need to do a better job with doing. There is a certain amount of risk associated with getting Coronavirus. And you don't want to have a media that makes it sounds like it is 5, 10, 20, or even 100 times riskier than it is. We need to have accurate understanding of who gets this, who is at risk, who is not at risk, or who is at a lower amount of risk. And that's something that we are not getting in a media environment that is really all about hype and less about just factual basis of understanding things. Further, I just want to say the U.S. is not at the top when it comes to deaths per capita. In fact, there are many countries that are ahead of the United States when it comes to deaths per capita."

I think the problem and it's been widely reported that the problem is that it started too late at scale. But yes, we are doing a lot of tests right now. And the raw number, I mean, we are the third largest population among all the nations of the world. So it's not the raw number you should be paying attention to. It's the per million population rate that you should be paying attention to. And that's rate of rising."

You study this for a living. The president later backed off his no funding threat. But the press says there's no evidence of significant fraud in voting by mail. And it may not be true that voting by mail helps Democrats over Republicans, your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "So to that second point, does it help Democrats or Republicans more. There's actually evidence that it doesn't help one party or the other more. You've had instances where, for instance, in that recent pickup election for Republicans really picked up that seat in California, an awful lot of ballots cast by mail, more of them I believe were cast by Republicans than by Democrats. So there's plenty of study and there's mail-in balloting helped Republicans or Democrats. It's never shown that there's a bias one way or another. On the voter front piece, there have been instances of voter fraud linked to mail-in balloting. However, the most high-profile example was in North Carolina. It was a Republican strategist who was trying to go around and do this ballot harvesting and was collecting ballots and handing them improperly. Where some of them had been tampered with, so it happens but it's very infrequent. And it's not something that's just combined to Democrats during it. Again, that most prominent case was a Republican doing it. So I think Republicans should not be pushed back on this in the way that they are."

Now, president also tweeted this week that Fox News should fire its quote, \"fake pollster.\" Never had a good Fox poll, the widely respected Fox survey is giving Joe Biden an eight-point lead over President Trump. But a Quinnipiac survey gives Biden an 11-point lead. The president prefers to tout the CNBC, which gives Biden just a three point lead. I got about half a minute. Why such a wide range in these recent polls?"

So they have different assumptions about who they are focusing on. But you also just have any type of poll you're doing. Again, it's a statistical probabilistic exercise. The danger for the president in pushing, say, the CNBC poll this week is that the next month the CNBC poll might be the worst poll for him. So you can't really pick and choose.

So I think the irony is that the media is portraying him, as you said, as some type of lucky (ph), but actually what he is uncovering is identifying existing corruption, rooting it out, and maintaining the commitment to that impartiality. I think the most important thing actually is the fact -- you showed it, his comments after when he said our concern over potential criminality is focused on others.

    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do. I think this was more than a gaffe. I think the media is getting him a pass not only with that but the fact that it sort of displace the notion that the entire Democratic Party has just for this entire time which is taking for granted communities of color, taking for granted people's votes just because the fit into a certain box that the party puts them into. I think as well the evidence is the fact that after those comments, when he talked about the NAACP's endorsement, that was profoundly rejected by the existing president and CEO Derrick Johnson who said, we are a nonpartisan organization, we don't endorse candidates at any level, and the media has also sort of refused to cover that, as well."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I have been covering Joe Biden off and on since the late 80s, since his first attempt to run for president. This is not the first time he has made a racial gaffe. But quite seriously, this time, I think this could damage him, particularly with younger black voters. Older black voters like me, we have pretty much made up our minds who we are voting for and we have a choice between Trump and Biden, it looks like. Whereas younger voters, getting them out to vote is going to be tough here. That's why Biden was on Charlamagne show in the first place. That has got a predominantly younger, more millennial-type viewership. He goes and commits this gaffe, which looks like he's taking black voters for granted, just as Emily said. This is the kind of thing that he does not need right now. So, I would be concerned in his campaign about getting just, you know, getting young voters excited."

The president on a tweet storm last night re-tweeted a guy who did the following: posted mockery of Hillary Clinton, calling her a skank, accused Nancy Pelosi of wearing dentures, and mocked Stacey Abrams weight. Does this deserve coverage or have of all of us in the media just become a nerd to these kinds of presidential insults on Twitter? Emily first."

But anyway, this is the kind of thing that reminds me of the good- old days when you didn't have presidents who call people names on Twitter or any place else. But what was done is done. We expect that the president was going to lash back when he feels not only frustrated about the campaign but also frustrated about his inability to hold rallies, so he has these one-man rallies on Twitter late at night.

      "utterance": "Lauer's denunciation followed a takedown piece by New York Times columnist Ben Smith, who says Farrow's work \"reveals the weakness of a kind of resistance journalism that has thrived in the age of Donald Trump, that when it comes to damaging reporting about public figures most disliked by the loudest voices, the old rules of fairness and open-mindedness can be seen more like impediments than essential journalistic imperatives.\" Joining us now from New York, Kat Timpf, co-host of the Fox's \"Greg Gutfeld Show.\" So, when Ben Smith says Ronan Farrow was a resistance journalist, meaning uses a double standard when going after politically unpopular targets, let's say maybe Donald Trump, does he have a point? KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, CO-HOST AT \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\": It's interesting, right, because he certainly does have a point, but it's also true that no matter what, if you're a journalist, you're also a human being, which means you're always going to be coming to any story with your own preconceived notions about things, your own bias, and that's always, always, always going to be the case. It seems that with Ronan Farrow, there were some things that maybe he missed in fact-checking. But Ben Smith is a human too, right? So, he was coming to his reporting on Ronan Farrow with his own biases, as well. So I think that this is bigger than just Ronan Farrow and it is a good reminder to all of us as readers that these aren't robots that are writing these stories, these are humans just like us, and that they have their own bias. We do, too, as readers, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right, it's an important debate. Now, putting aside the other allegations against Lauer, he says in his piece that he betrayed the trust of many people. Lauer says that he talked to four people at NBC and gave the names and phone numbers to media, which verified this, who were never contacted by Farrow and say that what his book says about their conversations with Brooke Nevils never happened, what she described as a consensual affair. For example, in one case, she went crying, according to the book, to a guy in a control room about the supposed assault, in Lauer's dressing room. The control guy says it didn't happen. So, did Lauer make a good case on this particular allegation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think that the case by Ben Smith would be better than the case from Lauer because I read Matt Lauer's entire piece. My name takeaway was, wow, how could he possibly think that we wanted even one word from this guy, let alone 5,000 words, he's more of a narcissist than I thought. But the same point was made by Ben Smith about, for example, that producer was not contacted when that could have been like something that would have been pretty easy to do. Now, Ronan Farrow said that he did fact check in other ways, but I don't -- I couldn't find if he said anywhere how or what gave details, I did not see those. So, again, it's a case that's better made by Ben Smith than Matt Lauer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. In his book, there are no quotes, even unnamed quotes, blind quotes from the people he says -- where he describes his conversations. Now, here is Farrow's response. It was brief. It was on Twitter. He says Matt Lauer is just wrong, catch and kill is thoroughly reported and fact checked, including with Matt Lauer himself. His publisher, Little, Brown backs him up. I reached out to Matt Lauer yesterday. He told me that he was stunned that Ronan Farrow, on the day since the piece posted, has not done a single interview or responded to a single specific point that Lauer raised. I think that's interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "It is very interesting, especially because when you look at Ronan's reporting, you can't deny that what he's done, if you go back to Weinstein and that story, these are positive outcomes that came from this reporting. But I think that also makes it more difficult because you're not going to see people out there saying you know what, he wasn't fair to Harvey Weinstein, because I don't think people really care. Weinstein is not a good guy, and Matt Lauer, as well. He's admitted that he's done a lot of things that are wrong and also sort of feel bad for him because all of his mistakes and he's, you know, still sitting on a pretty decent pile of money. So these aren't really good victims. So, I think that could make it easier to, you know, I don't know if I want to say get away with, because I'm not sure that that's what Ronan Farrow was trying to do, because again, with the human mind, I think these things can happen subconsciously all the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's just keep it brief at this point. So, Lauer is entitled to defend himself, in my view. He can defend himself against an allegation as serious as rape. We shouldn't put him in Harvey Weinstein category. One of the things that Lauer said is that Ronan Farrow -- look, Ronan Farrow did incredible reporting on Harvey Weinstein. He was followed by private detectives. But at the same time, he clashed with NBC, which eventually pushed him out, didn't do the story for NBC. So Lauer says, well, how can Ronan Farrow possibly be objective on anything that happened at NBC?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I would say that he can't. I would say there are few people who have that complicated and contentious really of a relationship with NBC. So, the claims or things he was suggesting in terms of conspiracy, those are pretty extreme. But again, it is up to us his readers to say -- to not just believe everything at face value that we read that was written by a human and say, OK, where can this be coming, from what lens is Ronan Farrow looking at this through, rather than just blindly believing everything we read all the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. My understanding is that Lauer plans to remain silent until this New York Times story came out and there was this question about what he can tell as a consensual affair and it did become consensual. Finally, Ben Smith writes that the son of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow delivers narratives that are irresistibly cinematic but don't always include the complicating facts and details.

The president, who claims only occasionally pick at Morning Joe, has been tweeting about an unfounded conspiracy theory from 19 years ago. That is when 28-year-old Lori Klausutis, an aide in Scarborough's Florida congressional office, died suddenly. Medical examiner ruled that irregular heartbeat caused her to fall and hit her head and there was no suggestion of foul play.
