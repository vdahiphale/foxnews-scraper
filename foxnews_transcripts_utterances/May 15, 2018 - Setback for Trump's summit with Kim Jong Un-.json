      "utterance": "That's right. But I think if that is one deal, it's a very important one. And I was concerned about the walking back. But actually, if you look at the increased scrutiny given to deals right across the spectrum, not just this big one but all throughout the range of technology deals with the Chinese, I think overall the stance towards China is way tougher than it was before, and I think that needs to continue. But to get this delicate process on and keeping it on the road, you may need to give the odd concession here and now."

      "utterance": "That's why Pompeo was out there. This is a lot of spinning plates for the new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. We will see what happens. Time will tell whether the Singapore summit stays on schedule. If it does, June 12th is a momentous day in history, actually. June 12th, 1987, was the day that President Ronald Reagan deliver that now iconic phrase, \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" Five months after that, Mikhail Gorbachev traveled to D.C. for a summit in Washington, and two years later that wall would come down. I have a new book out today, \"Three Days in Moscow, Ronald Reagan and the Fall of the Soviet Empire.\" It details the three days around the last summit between Reagan and Gorbachev in Moscow and Reagan's speech to Moscow State University students. The Moscow summit was the final of four summits, Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington, and Moscow, and that led to a major treaty between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on intermediate nuclear weapons, eventually leading to the end of the cold war. I recently spoke with Reagan secretary of state George Shultz about those summits and how Reagan and Gorbachev really hit it off from the start, talking for hours."
