That would generate a significant amount of revenue. And there are others in the business space, some deductions that are popular with some constituencies, but might be able to be scaled back. I think we're going to be looking at everything on the able to start with. Obviously, there are some deductions that are very important. Home mortgage interest, for example, is something, charitable giving. But I think, beyond that, there are others out there that we might be able to find some room to help offset some of the costs of what we're going to do. And then, as you said, we're going to get some additional growth. This is not a static economy. When you change policy, you change behavior out there, and people start investing and taking realizations and paying more taxes. So, growth is a big part of how you get there in terms of revenue."

A lot of people look at that say maybe that's something we have broader agreement on than we do on the individual rates and tax cuts for the wealthy, et cetera, that-- would you be open, as some of your Democratic colleagues have said, for a corporate tax cut, handle that separately, including what you want to do for small businesses and the like?"

We're driving businesses and jobs overseas. If we want to make America an attractive place to do business, we have got to get the corporate rate down. What we try to do is, through quicker cost recovery..."

So, those are two changes I think have to be made. What we do beyond that is an open question. But I'm interested in doing anything that will generate greater growth in the economy, because that solves so many problems. That gets higher wages, better-paying jobs and obviously generates more government revenue at the same time."

      "utterance": "I think that's, at this point, pretty hyperbolic. We just don't know. I think, right now, what we want to find out are the facts. And James Comey has been invited up here to Capitol Hill by the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify in both an open and a closed setting. And I think we need to get the information, follow the facts where they lead, but not jump to any conclusions. There's an awful lot of statements being made out there right now that just are not grounded in fact. And I think we need to get the facts first."

I know some of the names have been bandied about, but I hope we get somebody good, somebody who is qualified, somebody who has integrity, and somebody who will be independent. I think that's what the president needs right now. And if he can do that, I think we can get a lot of these -- some of these issues behind us."
