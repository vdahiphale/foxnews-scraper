But in 2015, the Obama administration nixed the idea of changing names. The Army's top spokesman at the time, General Malcolm Frost, saying these historic names represent individuals not causes or ideologies. It should be noted that the naming occurred in the spirit of reconciliation, not division. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to go farther, demanding the removal of 11 Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol. But Pelosi has had no comment on what her father, Thomas D'Alesandro, did back in 1948. As mayor of Baltimore, D'Alesandro oversaw the dedication of statues of Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, saying with our nation beset by subversive groups and propaganda, which seeks to destroy our national unity, we can look for inspiration to the lives of Lee and Jackson to remind us to be resolute and determined in preserving our sacred institutions."

The U.S. government has already spent trillions on COVID relief, adding to a federal debt that now exceeds the size of the entire U.S. economy. Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the federal budget deficit was about $1.9 trillion in the first eight months of fiscal year 2020 -- $1.2 trillion more than at the same time last year. And estimates from the Manhattan Institute claimed that added costs and declining revenues stemming from COVID-19. The red bar in this chart will produce a 2020 budget deficit of $4.2 trillion."

You heard the mayor talking there. How long will this go on? The president says he wants to bring it to an end. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, and I think we have Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Byron, let me start with you. The president saying this can't go on, but the mayor doesn't seem like it's an urgent matter. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": No, the mayor thinks it can go on. This is an outrageous situation, but I think what's really interesting about it is the president realizes that this is a problem, but the mayor of the city and the governor of the state don't seem to have any problem with it. The police chief does, by the way. We played earlier a quote of her saying that it's lead to longer police response times, which is going to end badly in some situation. So it's an extraordinary situation. I think a lot of Americans would be on President Trump's side, but, as we also learned during the coronavirus, lockdowns, these are decisions that governors and local leaders make. It is really not the president's decision what goes on in this autonomous zone in Seattle."

And ultimately I think when it comes to whether the federal government can step in and use active duty military, we saw the side the Pentagon came down on with that, with Defense Secretary Esper saying it's not something that he's particularly comfortable except as a matter of last resort. I do think that this is probably a situation at the moment that is a bit unique to Seattle. We haven't seen this popping up in any other cases. And I think for the most part I think people seem to understand that even if this moment where we are debating the role of law enforcement, I think most people understand that you have to find a way to coexist. I don't think we're going to end up in a lot of situations where the police are going to be abandoning cities, or even that a lot of people are going to be wanting police to abandon cities."

He has had a brutal week from James Mattis to General Milley's apology for the Lafayette Square incident, to the polling that we've seen, to his tweet about the Buffalo protester, this has been a really, really rough week for President Trump. I'm sure he'd like to talk nothing more than about these protesters taking over a major chunk of Seattle."

There's the Lafayette Square matter itself, and I do think the president certainly had the right to do what he did going to basically inspect the situation after protesters had set fire to a historic church not far away. The fact that the protesters were peaceful does not mean that they can block the entire city and the way of the president. On the other hand, on the participation of General Milley, I can certainly understand his concerns about that, and it would've been better if he wasn't there. So I think the president was probably right to say, well, that's fine if they feel that way."

In 2015 after white supremacist Dylann Roof slaughtered black worshipers at South Carolina church, the Pentagon was pressed to remove the names of Confederate generals from its facilities. The Army wouldn't budge. \"These historic names represent individuals, not causes or ideologies. It should be noted that the naming occurred in the spirit of reconciliation, not division.\" That is from the Brigadier General, the Army's spokesperson at the time. Julie, it does seem different, the push seems greater now. Do you sense that this is going to lead to bigger changes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PACE",
      "utterance": "I think certainly there's a desire among a really broad spectrum of people of all political parties and affiliations to reexamine this right now, and to just ask the question, is this the right thing? Is this the right way to recognize our history? I don't like anybody is talking about wiping away that history, but is it the right way to be recognizing that history? The president, of course, has come down and said he does not want to take that step. And he, though, increasingly is an outlier. The Pentagon, again, another example of where the Pentagon does seem to be on the different side here with top military leaders, saying they are at least open to having this discussion."

In fact, they were named in a spirit of provocation. And I think it's far beyond time to have those buildings renamed. I think you would hope that we would do this in the spirit of deliberation and conversation. I suspect that that's probably not the way that this will unfold."

We're back with the panel. Byron, what about this move by the Republicans, hurt North Carolina in the business area?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Certainly, it will. It will be a much scaled-down convention, or Republican presence in Charlotte as they do some of their business there. The idea of moving this is pretty audacious. It's June 12 and this thing is going to happen in late August. Parties plan these things for years. On the other hand, as far as the virus is concerned, the country is much more open today than it was a month ago, and this is more than two months away. So hopefully the Republicans will be able to stage an event there without there being a danger to participants."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PACE",
      "utterance": "Look, I think certainly, from a public health standpoint, any time you have people coming into a big group, no matter what purpose they are coming for, there's going to be some level of risk. I think that's fairly obvious at this point. One thing we have had public health officials telling us about the rallies, but particularly a convention that does make it a bit different is a convention in particular, the idea is you take people from all over the country and you bring them into one concentrated place, then they leave and they go back all around the country. And so the potential for a spread not just in one community but really broadly is certainly higher when you add that kind of dynamic with so much travel involved in it."

    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, I think if you look at what's happened over the past several months, to the extent that people are paying attention to politics, they're paying attention to a set of issues that is playing on Joe Biden's home turf, if you will. So it's not surprising. I think you combine that with, I think, unsteady leadership from the president in the midst of the coronavirus, with the briefings that I think turned off some people, and then I think several missteps over the past several weeks, it's not surprising that is lagging. Joe Biden hasn't been very present on the campaign trail, as the Trump campaign has pointed out. I think when he is, it will give Donald Trump and his campaign want to punch back out."
