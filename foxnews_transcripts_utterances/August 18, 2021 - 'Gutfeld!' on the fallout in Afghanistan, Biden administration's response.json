That's like a new and improved kidney stone. I don't see much room for an upgrade. Still, their spokesman held a news conference to say that the insurgents would honor women's rights. Of course, according to the delightful rules of Sharia law. That's like Andrew Cuomo saying, I will from now on respect women's rights, as long as they're hot, and I can still grab their asses. Meanwhile, Taliban fighters executed a woman for not wearing a burqa. So what's new and improved exactly? They didn't torture her first or kill her entire family. I guess that's progress. So yes, thank God, we're back on the world stage. Too bad our play opened and closed on the same night. But at least the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. sent the barbaric thugs a strongly worded letter.",

Yes, there's one thing we've learned about the Taliban they really respect a stern note with a fancy typeface. Meanwhile, on Twitter, both of their official spokesman have unverified accounts, which seems unfair to them. Hell even Kilmeade has a blue checkmark. It's funny, the Taliban on Twitter. That's like Fred Flintstone operating an iPhone. It's like a Neanderthal playing Call of Duty 2. It's like Joe Biden wearing pants. A regime that champions a return to the Dark Ages tweets about pressers from their smartphones. I wonder who their service provider is and does the goat porn cost extra? Does for me. I'd imagine the Taliban is a little miffed that you can retweet but you can't be head. And where's the emoji for Death to America anyway? You think Twitter management cares? Former President Trump is still banned from the platform among other Republicans. But so far, the Taliban remains. Maybe Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey just likes the cut of their beards. Can you tell which one is which I get? Yet Twitter allows this this information to remain.",

Of course, unless it's Afghan women and people who think like Trump. If those words were any more empty, they'd be Hunter Biden's medicine cabinet. And as for keeping us safe, you could have fooled me Twitter, the last thing someone sees before Chrissy Teigen ruins their lives or their names trending on your vacuous vomit engine. If you still think that social the social media titans have your best interests at heart, you probably think Ben and Jerry's is in your heart's best interest too. At least the Taliban doesn't pretend to be neutral. Meanwhile, the media says White House officials are troubled on how to get everyone safely out of Afghanistan, which makes sense after the bots pull out. Do you trust any of these bozos to pull anything off besides Biden's compression socks? Meanwhile, Joe disappears for days at a time like he's campaigning again. He hides under more lids than Oscar the Grouch. He spends more time in a bunker than Eva Braun. Fact is you can't expect a successful evacuation without a threat of destruction if you stop this. Have we made that clear? No, because we're the bad guy. Remember, our military bras were too busy pondering critical race theory and diversity brochures then organizing an orderly exit. If the real problems are white racism how can we tell the Taliban what to do? We lost our moral authority to a group who has the term oppressor in their job description. If only these guys had Trump 2024 decals on their RPGs and be so much easier. And so Joe Biden became a lame duck presidency in record time. My apologies to ducks everywhere. But it's hard to be surprised. This guy has gotten more things wrong than Brian Stelter watching Jeopardy. For the great unifier, he's got an unbelievable talent of breaking things into pieces. He shouldn't be running a country, he should be demolishing kitchens on this old house. We watched our southern border dissolve while being told we must fix central America's problems. We see law enforcement in tatters as crime rages. We watch our energy policy implode as gas prices soar. But to be fair, he has helped Russia and OPEC, I'll give him that. And no wonder the media, the Dems and the academic institutions all work together to get this guy elected. And boy, are they quiet now? Thank God, they all agreed to bury that Hunter Biden laptop. That story is still harder to find than a Don Lemon viewer. And now like an aging avocado that looked fine on the outside this presidency turned out to be gray and rotten on the inside. So what's next? GOP Senator John Kennedy sums it up.",

Lindsay Bull was about to feed the reptile when it bit her hand, like one of Joe Biden's dogs attacking the Secret Service. Is that true? But a hero bystander named Donnie Wiseman fearlessly jumped into the tank and onto the gators back, pinning it down for two minutes until Bull was finally able to free her hand. He said once things were under control, he went outside to smoke a cigarette. The gator also smoked a cigarette because the experience was so satisfying. Lindsay Bull underwent hand surgery but is expected to make a full recovery. Kat, thoughts, alligator. Best birthday party -- children's birthday party ever. Am I right?",

That's like a new and improved kidney stone. I don't see much room for an upgrade. Still, their spokesman held a news conference to say that the insurgents would honor women's rights. Of course, according to the delightful rules of Sharia law. That's like Andrew Cuomo saying, I will from now on respect women's rights, as long as they're hot, and I can still grab their asses. Meanwhile, Taliban fighters executed a woman for not wearing a burqa. So what's new and improved exactly? They didn't torture her first or kill her entire family. I guess that's progress. So yes, thank God, we're back on the world stage. Too bad our play opened and closed on the same night. But at least the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. sent the barbaric thugs a strongly worded letter."

Yes, there's one thing we've learned about the Taliban they really respect a stern note with a fancy typeface. Meanwhile, on Twitter, both of their official spokesman have unverified accounts, which seems unfair to them. Hell even Kilmeade has a blue checkmark. It's funny, the Taliban on Twitter. That's like Fred Flintstone operating an iPhone. It's like a Neanderthal playing Call of Duty 2. It's like Joe Biden wearing pants. A regime that champions a return to the Dark Ages tweets about pressers from their smartphones. I wonder who their service provider is and does the goat porn cost extra? Does for me. I'd imagine the Taliban is a little miffed that you can retweet but you can't be head. And where's the emoji for Death to America anyway? You think Twitter management cares? Former President Trump is still banned from the platform among other Republicans. But so far, the Taliban remains. Maybe Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey just likes the cut of their beards. Can you tell which one is which I get? Yet Twitter allows this this information to remain."

      "utterance": "Yes, that didn't happen. So when asked about this contradiction in treatment, Twitter said their top priority is keeping people safe. Of course, unless it's Afghan women and people who think like Trump. If those words were any more empty, they'd be Hunter Biden's medicine cabinet. And as for keeping us safe, you could have fooled me Twitter, the last thing someone sees before Chrissy Teigen ruins their lives or their names trending on your vacuous vomit engine. If you still think that social the social media titans have your best interests at heart, you probably think Ben and Jerry's is in your heart's best interest too. At least the Taliban doesn't pretend to be neutral. Meanwhile, the media says White House officials are troubled on how to get everyone safely out of Afghanistan, which makes sense after the bots pull out. Do you trust any of these bozos to pull anything off besides Biden's compression socks? Meanwhile, Joe disappears for days at a time like he's campaigning again. He hides under more lids than Oscar the Grouch. He spends more time in a bunker than Eva Braun. Fact is you can't expect a successful evacuation without a threat of destruction if you stop this. Have we made that clear? No, because we're the bad guy. Remember, our military bras were too busy pondering critical race theory and diversity brochures then organizing an orderly exit. If the real problems are white racism how can we tell the Taliban what to do? We lost our moral authority to a group who has the term oppressor in their job description. If only these guys had Trump 2024 decals on their RPGs and be so much easier. And so Joe Biden became a lame duck presidency in record time. My apologies to ducks everywhere. But it's hard to be surprised. This guy has gotten more things wrong than Brian Stelter watching Jeopardy. For the great unifier, he's got an unbelievable talent of breaking things into pieces. He shouldn't be running a country, he should be demolishing kitchens on this old house. We watched our southern border dissolve while being told we must fix central America's problems. We see law enforcement in tatters as crime rages. We watch our energy policy implode as gas prices soar. But to be fair, he has helped Russia and OPEC, I'll give him that. And no wonder the media, the Dems and the academic institutions all work together to get this guy elected. And boy, are they quiet now? Thank God, they all agreed to bury that Hunter Biden laptop. That story is still harder to find than a Don Lemon viewer. And now like an aging avocado that looked fine on the outside this presidency turned out to be gray and rotten on the inside. So what's next? GOP Senator John Kennedy sums it up."

For example, just getting middle class Americans hooked on entitlements, hooked on the government that's more power and control for the idiots like Biden. Also the energy policy, again, we're begging countries that hate us to pump more oil, which means that our policy here to destroy our energy economy is just like a recruitment effort for the Greta Thunberg fan club here.

I don't need to hear your Ted Cruz, three snowflakes landed in Texas. You jumped out the country and blamed it on your daughter. So I don't want -- I don't want advice on you on how to -- how to get people to leave a place or whatever. Afghanistan, the men -- we just don't belong there. Our ideologies, it's centuries of the way they are. And every time we come in, we make things -- we put band aids, we make things better for a little while. But as soon as we leave, they go right back to where it is and then the bloodshed happens. When President Trump pulled -- when he pulled troops out of -- everyone was like he's a war criminal because we left our allies to get slaughtered and et cetera, et cetera. Doesn't matter what America does. If they don't believe in what we're doing, if they don't buy into it, there wasn't a huge fight from Afghanistan army. They literally will start pointing where the tanks and stuff are as soon as we pull back. So, this is ugly but let's get some solutions. I want to hear some great solutions that people can get behind and at the same time support our troops. Because yes, we can bash the President. It's easy. He literally -- every time he talks you got something new to make a joke about but the -- and you made a great point. We're also -- when we're trashing, we're trashing our troops.

Lindsay Bull was about to feed the reptile when it bit her hand, like one of Joe Biden's dogs attacking the Secret Service. Is that true? But a hero bystander named Donnie Wiseman fearlessly jumped into the tank and onto the gators back, pinning it down for two minutes until Bull was finally able to free her hand. He said once things were under control, he went outside to smoke a cigarette. The gator also smoked a cigarette because the experience was so satisfying.
