So for example, if you look at D.C., Los Angeles, and New York, overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton while she was popular there but the rest of America which makes up most of America looks at that and says wait a second, they are mocking the fact that the government saved you, not God. So they are hitting you on religion. They are hitting you on the fact that you question the efficiency of government which is a philosophy that you people voted for or against but they are missing the point. They have a chance to salute the people of Texas, and dare I say America, who have gotten their boats, their speed boats, their air boats and come down to help for no money for people they don't know. And they have been more effective than the government. So to be funny, it's got to be based on fact. It has flat out inaccurate. It's like I am going to cold clock you for no reason.",

As you can see behind me, we are in front of highway 90 which is currently closed because it's inside the 1.5-mile evacuation radius. Sheriffs vehicles blocking anyone getting on or off it, as if getting around wasn't difficult enough, because of all the road closures and flooding. Now this major highway is closed. And as you were discussing, there's a lot of conflicting information right now beginning last night when there were two reports of explosions at this Arkema plant. And then today, we wake up to hear county officials and an executive from the chemical plant saying it wasn't an explosion. It was a chemical reaction. Basically what's happening, the Arkema executive said that they have nine containers of these organic compounds that are highly flammable and that they anticipated Harvey hitting their property last week, so they closed shop. They brought in backup generators and those failed. Then they brought in another system and that failed. So right now, one of the nine containers basically combusted, it caused a fire and it released with their calling irritants into the air. And we are trying to determine just how dangerous these irritants might be. And the sheriff today got in front of a camera and says well, basically it's similar to standing by a campfire and breathing and smoke. Then as we just heard from an executive at Arkema and he said well, it's an irritant and we are just not sure about how toxic it is. And then a short while ago, Tom Bossert, the Homeland Security Advisor at the White House briefing, said well, if you are near those black plumes, that would be really dangerous. Take a listen to his explanation."

You know, one of our MMJs has been our roaming area, he says that a couple hundred people definitely evacuated but county officials can't place a figure on how many people evacuated. But police went door-to-door here and then a lot of people heated their warnings. We've kind of been planted on the outside of this radius. Obviously we have not been able to get inside there, so we can't really talk to people directly inside the radius.

People coming from all over, working together on this, and it's been gratifying to see it.

And secure the border and then come up with immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform. This will take immigration off the table. You take immigration off the table, Hispanics look a lot like Republicans. This is very dangerous territory for Democrats. It's going to be interesting. If this comes up for a vote at one point during this presidency, will Democrats give this win to Donald Trump? Where will they go?"
