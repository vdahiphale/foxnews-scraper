So I'm begging the governor to call the legislature back in session and do two things.

That is the simple fix. If you do that, you're probably going to see Loeffler and Perdue from a lot of fraud. As for what happened to Trump, keep fighting Mr. President. Make your case in court. And just fight as hard as you can to improve the system. My beef is not with Governor Kemp. He seems like a decent fellow. But what he is not doing, in my view, is proactively facing a system.

All you need in Georgia is for one person to verify a signature every signature on mail-in ballots should be verified in a bipartisan way. So I'm begging the governor to call the legislature back in session and do two things. Make sure that when it comes to verifying signatures on mail-in ballots that is done by bipartisan not a single individual in a county office that may have an agenda that's partisan. That is the simple fix. If you do that, you're probably going to see Loeffler and Perdue from a lot of fraud. As for what happened to Trump, keep fighting Mr. President. Make your case in court. And just fight as hard as you can to improve the system. My beef is not with Governor Kemp. He seems like a decent fellow. But what he is not doing, in my view, is proactively facing a system. We know that the mail-in voting system in Georgia needs to be reformed. And we've got days to fix it, not months."

He said that he felt that some mistakes were made in terms of the readiness to have lawyers in all of these venues and making sure that you had all these representations.

What I'm begging Georgia to do - I am the Senate Judiciary Chairman, I am not a Federal Judge to Trump legal team, you're making all these claims, you've got to prove it. Doing a video is not proof. You need to take these claims into a court of law and get relief. As to the legislative body in Georgia, you need to change your law. I can't change Georgia law. So we need to change the law so that the senate races are not stolen from us. The best way to make sure that Trump legacy stay's in place as to win Georgia. If you want to protect this family from another round of Mueller investigation's, we need to win Georgia. If you want to make sure that crazy people like the one nominated for the OMB Director never gets a job, make sure we win in Georgia. A lot is at stake.

But in Fulton County where Biden got 80 percent of the vote, I think they had 11 signatures rejected. In the database they are using, this consent decree entered into by the Secretary of State with Stacey Abrams, they end her lawsuit in Georgia has really put us behind the eight ball. Change the consent decree so that you are verifying signatures before the ballot application was actually made and make sure that every signature is validated by a bipartisan group. We have a bipartisan group counting ballots. We have a bipartisan group checking you and when you vote in person. In Georgia, a single person has the final say, they waive it all through.

They got all these drop boxes by Walmart where people drop in mail-in ballots. I am telling you right now, if you audited the envelopes, the signature on them, that you will find if you had a bipartisan group or machine doing it, a higher rejection rate then actually occurred in the election. But we've got a new election coming. Now we've got nobody to blame but ourselves, if we sit on our ass and continue to allow the system to exist. So - like the governor, he's a find fellow, but he needs to change the law before it is too late so we don't get cheated out of these two senate seats."

The Statehouse in Georgia can change state election law in Georgia, I can't. Federal Judges can get relief, I can't. Go to court with a case that makes sense, change the law where you can to require bipartisan signature verification.

But, right now, there's another hearing going on in Michigan. People watch these things at night and they hear this, you know people who seem very well intentioned say in Michigan, one woman that I watched last night talking about how she was told that there was a discrepancy over a ballot. It had two people signed on it. Joe Biden and a green candidate and like, oh, just put that in Biden's category. And she said that she was strong armed over and over on this.

I mean, bring it up. We have a redundant paper ballot systems so that we can go back and recount and recheck. I mean you know, where these ballots are, let's check it. But I think once we looked into things and really investigated, we also have to be able to say that the rule of law has prevailed. And I think what we are seeing right now is that really great people in Michigan, Republican local leaders and clerks, stood up and they certify their election. They stood by their work and they are still having folks come in over their heads trying to pressure them. So I give them a lot of credit. If you have a credible allegation, put up or shut up."

Something is better than nothing. So it's been a bipartisan group of us that have been working with the senators to try to get this done. And we heard today, some movement, right. There is been some calls between Mnuchin and Pelosi. Pelosi said she is willing to use that deal as the basis of negotiations, that's good. It wouldn't better in October, but it's good to do it now.

They say there is no nefarious big batch for Biden. Just votes they insist that are being counted properly as the law requires. Those spikes that the President says are suspicious. Well, they did come up in the key State of Pennsylvania during that hearing last week. You may remember the Republican sponsored gathering on the election in Gettysburg. Well, at that hearing one person started those mysterious huge spikes in the vote tally in that key state, hundreds of thousands of ballots recorded all at the same time and how that could possibly not be OK.

The anomalies of loading and uploading those votes, so that big spike that occurs there is a prime indicator of fraudulent voting."

In fact, one Pennsylvania election official tells me \"the ballots are opened and scanned and then uploaded, tens of thousands at a time\" it will cause about looks like spike, but if you have been countering them for many hours before that, they are aggregating uploads from various counties. It's like saying we uploaded 75,000 ballots in 5 minutes. We counted in 5 minutes, that's not true. We have been counting them for hours. The Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar notes that the state 67 counties did start counting the votes at 7:00 a.m. on Election Day morning, so that means that they had a 13 hour head start before the polls even closed, in order to count those votes \"a large number of votes would be reported in a short time frame\". Waldren attempted depict as a \"prime indicator of fraudulent voting\", indicates either a woeful ignorance of election administration basics, earn intentionally false statement and intended to mislead the public.

They say you just can't simply get hundreds of thousands of fake ballots or signs ballots somehow into the system. I asked Wanda Murren who is the Communications Director for the Secretary of State in Pennsylvania about this very claim and she answered this way. Saying \"there is obviously no end to the conspiracy theories that can be fabricated\". The \"witnesses who will step up to make false claims\" and they are \"experts that can be found to lend some pseudo-credibility to this claims. But in the court, in one case after another, no one has been able to produce and shred of evidence of fraud continuing to repeat these falsehoods only harms our democracy.

As you heard from Dr. Hahn, the commissioner of the FDA, we really scrutinize the data very carefully to guarantee to the American public that this is a safe and efficacious vaccine. I think if we did any less, we would add to the already existing hesitancy on the part of many people to take the vaccine because they are concerned about safety, or they are concerned that we went to quickly. So, it's almost the damned if you do, and damned if you don't. Because if you go quickly, and if you do it superficially, people are not going to want to get vaccinated. We have the gold standard of a regulatory approach with the FDA. The U.K. did not do it as carefully, they got a couple of days ahead. I don't think that makes much difference.

The sooner we do that, the better. If you look at the incremental increases and the vaccinations that will occur from late December through January, February, March, you'll get most of the people in the high-priority group. As we get towards the end of March, the beginning of April, it will be more of the general population.

And I have been saying for a considerable period of time that we should have a default position getting the children back to school or keeping them in school. So, there is no difference there. And when you say locked down, you got to be careful. There are mitigation things that you do that the wearing of masks, keeping distances, avoiding congregate settings, that isn't really locking down. It's doing some fundamental basic public health measures that is certainly short of locking down.

And one of the things we pride ourselves in as it were is that the individual states can do things depending on what their own evaluation has. Which is a good thing in many respects. And when you look at some of the states, they have such an extraordinary degree of community spread, that you know that when you do that, temporarily, not permanently, temporarily, you can turn the curve around. For those who get concerned about that -- look at the numbers. There have been over 2,000 people died yesterday. They were 99,000 people with COVID- 19 in the hospital. There are between 100 and 200,000 new infections each day. And there are 270,000 deaths. That's serious stuff. So, when someone wants to temporarily close down a bar, that's not a bad thing to do. What I think we should do is make sure we subsidize and support the restaurant owners and the bar owners so that they don't suffer because of the public health measures. But don't get those things confused, it does help when you shutdown things that are clearly deceiving of the virus."

Now some people call it fraud, I call it fraud. But Democrats are calling it gaming maybe. Maybe somebody else won't. But the system is gamed. Why?

And it should've been a choice election. If this was a choice between Trump and Joe Biden, every poll we may have chosen, and every data science says Trump wins. And I think that it's hard to win when you know you have a referendum against a silent killer like a virus. And I think this came down to COVID.

What I'd like to do is get in a place where I can help Republicans across the country make their campaigns easier to run, more automated. Maybe sit on the backside instead of being on the front side. And really using that knowledge of being a campaign manager literally for five years of my life, the longest six years really. That's all I did all day is campaign.

And if he wants to call me, I will tell him know what those tweaks are. If he doesn't call me, I wish him the best of luck. I think he's the best thing for this country and I'll be MAGA for life."

We're watching this situation as developing in Staten Island, New York, where the crowd is growing as a protest outside a restaurant who defied the COVID-19 orders is growing by the hour. We're going to take you on the ground to see what's going on there in the middle of all that, next. And we'll get reaction to that and more from Mike Rowe."

They are outside of Mac's Public House, a bar on Staten Island. Last night, the owner Mac was arrested. He was taken away in handcuffs for defying Governor Cuomo's COVID-19 restrictions that ban indoor dining. Here now, Mike Wrote, host of The Way I Heard It podcast, also a popular TV producer of course and founder of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation. Mike, good to have you here tonight. Thanks for being here."

And this bar owner is saying you know, I need my livelihood, I need to let people in the door. He was arrested last night. Now the group is gathering out there. What do you think about what's going on with all this?"

      "utterance": "I've got a nice house, and a nice neighborhood, a lot of my friends out here are to the left of center. And something amazing is going on right now. And you know, I think what's happening in Staten Island is sort of indicative of the old expression, you know, you can forgive people for being wrong or even for being stupid, but hypocrisy is a hard thing to get over. And it seems like, to me, even out here in this little bubble, everywhere we look -- you know, that bit with Governor Newsom having dinner at the French laundry. That's not a small thing. And it's impacting people. People who would normally not say anything about it or shake their head and say geez, what is going on. When Nancy Pelosi gets her hair blown out after closing salons, that's bad optics. And when Gavin Newsom goes to have a meal in a place after telling people not to go have a meal in a place, that's bad."

People in -- I'm not telling you anything new, but people are leaving and they are not just leaving because of the unintended consequences of policies that don't suit them from a business or economic standpoint. They are leaving because something feels fundamentally wrong. And the level of hypocrisy is ranked, and its stinks to high heaven."

The owner of Mac's bar is going to be on with Tucker Carlson tonight. I just want to mention that. You know, this migration, people moving around the country, I mean, that's something that you've encouraged all along, Mike. You know, don't, you know, go ahead, pick up your stakes and go where there's a better opportunity and perhaps a better work environment, right?"

      "speaker": "ROWE",
