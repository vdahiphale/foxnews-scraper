That is a 5- year-old boy reportedly abandoned by two smugglers near El Paso, Texas, just screaming in the middle of the night. Neil, we don't know which country he came from, but the woman who reportedly left him there told a reporter that his parents were already in the U.S. Now, Texas Representative Tony Gonzales, he was here today.

The final pieces to put their majority together fell apart -- fell together, I should say, in the last hour or so. And that final piece was an Israeli Arab party, Ra'am, or the United Arab List. The leader of that party, Mansour Abbas, signed the agreement with Yair Lapid to form that unity government. And this will be the first time in history that an Arab party has served in the government with an Israeli prime minister. And that speaks to the strange bedfellows that make up this anti-Netanyahu coalition. The presumptive prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is an ultra- nationalist from the Yamina Party. That name translates literally to the right. He's got a history of being very unsympathetic to all things Arab and Palestinian issues. The coalition is made up of right-wing centrists, leftists and now Arabs. About the only thing that they have in common is they want Netanyahu out. The way the deals were struck, Bennett will start as prime minister, then swap with Yair Lapid. Now that the agreement has been presented to the outgoing Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, the new government gets presented to the Knesset on Monday for a Wednesday vote. So there still could be some vulnerability to the coalition, particularly with reports that one member of the Yamina Party has some gripes and might vote against, therefore jeopardizing the majority that have right now. But, for the moment, the opposition to Benjamin Netanyahu has the majority they need to form a new government, therefore ousting, if they can pull it all together, Israel's longest-serving prime minister -- Neil.",

We're already getting the latest from Greeley, Colorado, as JBS, one of the world's biggest meat producers, is indicating it's trying to get everything back online, but about a fifth of its meat capacity has essentially been wiped out. The big question is whether you're going to see that show up in your grocery, well, meat section. What if I told you they already are seeing it? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" The hack attack that has a lot of folks wondering, what the heck is going on? Now a big meat producer not too long after a big pipeline maker, and at the same day we're learning that a big boat concern is also affected. So people who wanted to go to and from places like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard for a while today were having trouble, and all because the system was hacked. What to make of a situation that is going from bad to worse and already coming up as a possible subject, maybe the main subject, when President Biden meets with Vladimir Putin later this month. All right, let's get right to it with Alicia Acuna on JBS, the company that experienced this hack attack, and how it's trying to come back right now. She's in Greeley, Colorado -- to you."

The USDA says there is no indication of a meat shortage.

      "utterance": "Alicia, thank you very, very much, Alicia Acuna on all of them. Here's what we know ahead of my next guest, that Russia might have been behind it through an entity called REvil. If that rings a bell, it's been involved. This is a Russian entity -- entity, I should say. We just don't know the details to which it might have had Russian support. The indications are at this point that it's anyone's guess. But the Russians are getting very, very good at this, as the number of hack attacks on the United States have been steadily increasing and compromising our grid. And that's a big worry with my next guest, Texas Congressman Pat Fallon, who joins us right now. Congressman, so much we don't know. Can you share what at least you know, how widespread this was, how much Vladimir Putin knew, how much Russia could have been involved? What do you know?"
    },

      "speaker": "REP. PAT FALLON (R-TX)",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, thanks for having me on. And this is just so critically important. And, unfortunately, when we pay off these cyber-terrorists, we're going to get more of them. And we -- according to the FBI, with the Colonial Pipeline attack, it was based in Russia. And I think -- personally, I think Putin is looking the other way and he's acting like -- much like Queen Elizabeth did 500 years ago with the privateers raiding Spanish armada. They were raiding the Spanish gold ships. This is something -- he's harboring them. And we need to have consequences, not only for the hackers, but for the Russian government as well, if indeed they are in cahoots with them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FALLON",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, I was shocked. When the Colonial Pipeline attack hit, I asked my staff, what are the penalties if -- it's very hard to catch these people, because it is a cyberattack, and they're largely international and Russia. If we got our hands on them, what penalties are they going to be facing? And, believe it or not, first of all, critical infrastructure wasn't even really defined well in statute. So, we needed to do that. But, also, penalties of a year in prison for a Russian criminal, in federal U.S. prison, is no deterrent whatsoever. So we wanted to beef up -- we want to define exactly what the critical infrastructure meant, so we could actually try these folks and get a conviction, and then up the penalties, 30 years to life, instead of just a year in prison, and then also have sanctions for governments that allow this to happen and facilitate it."

The president, when asked about this after his COVID update, about Russia's involvement, what we know, what we don't know, when he was asked about whether Putin is testing him, he said outright no. If Vladimir Putin is behind this or aware of this, do you think he is testing President Biden?"

      "speaker": "FALLON",
      "utterance": "Neil, I absolutely think, yes, he is. And that's what we -- this leadership, something this critical, when we're talking about national security, our economic security, our health security, this is leadership that should come from the White House. We're a single member of Congress. And I filed H.R.3388 specifically because we saw the threat that this presented two weeks ago, and nothing has been done. This should be a bipartisan effort to pass this legislation forthwith."

He always is in conservative attire, so as not to draw attention to himself."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Because whatever we get to learn about JBS and how widespread this was, and we have heard them talk about one-fifth of the meat production that was compromised, by that, I would just say just disappearing, the meat capacity disappearing. And, of course, it reappears online afterwards, but it does raise questions and prices, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT SHELLADY, AG OPTIMUS",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. I mean, as I stare at the screens in front of me today, Neil, we have got the cattle prices up around 2.5 percent today on the futures exchange. So, yes, there's going to be that natural knee-jerk reaction. We will get through this. But we're going to see a little bit of hoarding. We're going to see a lot of the same things we saw with the Colonial Pipeline issue. But that's the issue, right? I said back then, and I will say it again today, this will happen again. And I can't imagine what that meeting is going to be like with Biden and Putin. He will say, hey, I'm going to have to ask you to stop -- stop doing this. And if you don't, I'm going to have to ask you again. I mean, I don't know where we're going to get our teeth all of a sudden. But we have got an issue where this could be a lot bigger. Think about this, Neil. I'm worried about cattle and lean hogs today, yes. And we're going to see -- and you have had a great report all day over on the other channel with Jeff Flock doing inflation and what's happening to restaurants. Things are going through the roof. And this absolutely does not help it. But wait until this bleeds over until -- into our financial industry. Maybe they shut down the settlement system, or maybe they shut down air traffic control. I mean, why are we debating what is infrastructure? Babysitting and day care? No, it's this. These are the things that we need to make sure. Now, he's two or three weeks later going to get a task force together to study this thing. We need to have all hands on deck, because this is -- they're attacking us. We're the largest, most successful economy in the world. And this is happening out of Russia. So whether or not he's going to get his team in line or make them stop, he absolutely -- Putin can make them stop. So, my worry is this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's affecting -- to your point, Scott, and, to your point, it's affecting a lot more than just us. China, of course, depends on beef, largely from us, and largely in this particular case from JBS, which also ships a lot of that beef to Australia, from which it gets even more meat. And I'm just wondering. The fact that these issues are coming up again and again, whether they're all linked to Russia or not, they're getting to be more commonplace. News today, we learned that, not too long ago, the MTA, Mass Transit Authority, was hacked. We're getting word today, of course, the steam line authority -- the Steamship Authority of Massachusetts, responsible for a lot of those boats that go back and forth between Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, Hyannis, a host of them, also hit by that. It affected sailings that were going out today, people had to only pay in cash, so the credit system wasn't compromised there. But, again, this little more than a couple of weeks after the Colonial Pipeline Nightmare. What the heck is going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHELLADY",
      "utterance": "And to your point, Neil, you're exactly right. This is the issue, is that we're restarting a $28 trillion, $29 trillion economy. No one's ever seen that happen before. So, we're kind of like in this stage of like a Saint Bernard, puppy dog, right? And we don't know what's around the corner. And there's going to be some unintended consequences of shutting this economy down. But, right now, it's very vulnerable, very vulnerable. You have seen what's happened to prices and so-called inflation or supply chain issues. But, right now that Saint Bernard puppy dog does not need to get hit by a car. And this is what that threat could be like, because, right now, this economy is just finding its feet. And to have these attacks, first of all, on energy, now on food -- I mean, fuel and food, and maybe -- what's next? Finance? I mean, think about the apps here, because that's what I'm worried about. They go for ATM system, you can't take cash out. Now, I'm not trying to get everybody scared here. But you have to realize how immense this issue could possibly be if we don't put a stop to it now."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, no, you're right to raise a sense of urgency. Scott Shellady, thank you very, very much. So, this is becoming an economic issue, certainly in terms of higher prices and all the rest. Shows the vulnerability of our grid and what have you, but, more importantly, it does show that it could become a military issue. And doesn't Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin know it, the former undersecretary of defense, former Delta Force commander, bestselling author? General, always good to have you. If this did, in fact, emanate from Russia, and you are Joe Biden, and you're meeting with Vladimir Putin in a couple of weeks, what you do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LT. GEN. JERRY BOYKIN (RET.), U.S. ARMY",
      "utterance": "I think I'd canceled the meeting, unless I was ready to go in and state to him that we know that the SVR was responsible for this attack and several others, and we're not going to tolerate it anymore. Look, Neil, we have sent mixed messages to Putin. First of all, these criminal elements work for the intel services of Russia. I agree with your previous two guests. This was sanctioned by the Kremlin. And make no mistake about that. Be honest with the people. But I tell you, unless Joe Biden is ready to go in there and really get tough with Putin, all we're going to see out of this is an encouragement to Putin, because I think, as your previous guest said, this is another test of his leadership. And, right now, it does not appear that he's passing this test."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOYKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's entirely possible. Look, I think the Russians, as well as the Chinese, are looking at us now, saying, we have got you right where we want you. And that is because of the internal turmoil that we have had. It's because of the economic situation that we're in. They're wise enough to know that we can't keep printing money without a collapse at some point. So I think they see us in a vulnerable position. And I think that, as a result of that, the Russians certainly are going through a series of these things, each one be -- getting maybe progressively worse, because stop and think about it. You're now into our food chain. And we saw what a devastating thing the gas was. In fact, I spent most of my time in Washington, and I couldn't find gasoline in Washington without sending in an over-an-hour line to get fuel. So, this is a bad situation. But Putin -- make no mistake. Putin is behind this."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "General, if that were indeed the case, and you talk about nefarious means, he ended up hurting China, with whom he has been cozying up of late, because China depends on a lot of beef and a lot of beef from this very, very source, including the United States in general. So, he might have stung himself. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOYKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's -- I think that's possible. But, look, this whole relationship between Russia and China, I think, is a very fragile relationship. And I think that it's all directed towards the common enemy, and that's the United States. But I don't think that they are particularly good friends. I agree. This could have impacted China. It may impact their economy, as a matter of fact, because of the rising beef prices. But I don't think it's a strong relationship by any means."

And officials within the Biden administration are acting like a government that believes climate change is one of the four biggest crises facing the country right now, along with COVID and the economy and racial justice issues, because the Interior Department has suspended leases drilling oil - - drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge. Listen to this from them. The department is notifying lessees that it is suspending oil and gas leases in the Arctic Refuge, pending the review to determine whether the leases should be reaffirmed, voided or subject to additional mitigation members -- measures. Well, that's got Lisa Murkowski, who was just here a few days ago praising the president for letting cruise ships resume for the short tourist season in Alaska, very upset."

What do you make of the president's move?"

      "utterance": "No surprise. No surprise. But it doesn't -- it's illogical. It's irrational. It doesn't make any sense. The whole idea that you're going to stop climate change by shutting down leases in the Arctic in Alaska, it's just going to push this opportunity overseas. And that's what this -- I'm being serious, Neil. That's what this administration seems to be all about, is canceling opportunity, canceling oil leases in the Arctic, canceling offshore oil leases It's going to drive the cost up. I mean, oil is, what, $70 a barrel now. And it's going to push these opportunities overseas, and it's going to push them into places that don't have the environmental protections that the United States has and Alaska has. So, no matter how we look at it, when we actually sit down and we have these discussions, no matter how we look at it. It's a lose-lose-lose across the board, not just for Alaska, not just for this country, for some of these environmentally sensitive areas across the globe that don't have the protections. It makes zero sense."

I mean, the president seemed to make clear as a candidate that he wanted to undo what the president was doing, President Trump at the time, especially since, I believe, in Donald Trump's case, he was doing this in the waning days, officially the last day, of his administration. What do you make of that?"

      "speaker": "DUNLEAVY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not a surprise, but, nonetheless, it still doesn't make any sense. It doesn't -- it doesn't strengthen America, it doesn't help Alaska, and it doesn't stop climate change, because, again, these -- the Russians, the Chinese, the Saudis, the Iranians, they are laughing all the way to the bank. They're taking advantage of these opportunities that we're handing them. We're actually handing them opportunities. And so, in the short long run -- in the long run, Neil, this is going to be detrimental to this country. It's certainly could be detrimental to Alaska, and it's probably going to cost -- it's going to cost more at the pump here in the near future. So, across the board, it doesn't make any sense. Not unexpected, but it makes no sense."

And it's now really picking up steam under this administration. So, we're getting a cruise ship -- a cruise ship season back, but it's going to be very short. It's going to happen in July and August. Our cruise ship season usually ends in September because of weather and climate, obviously."

We have had some of the best response to the virus and the vaccinations than just about any other place on the planet. And we protect our environment better than just about any other place on the planet. So, all we're asking for, Neil, across the board, whether it's cruise ships, whether it's oil and gas, whether it's timber, whether it's mining, give Alaska an opportunity. We will show the world that we can do it better than anyone else, and we can protect the environment and create opportunities for our people. But, right now, it feels like it's a full-court press by this administration against our state."

It's -- and we get folks coming from all over the world, the Lower 48. We love to have people coming to Alaska. We haven't run into anyone that's ever said they had a bad trip to Alaska, because it's spectacular. But we're in a competitive world right now. We're in a competitive world with other states, with people wanting to get out. And so we certainly have to come out and highlight what Alaska has to offer. And, again, we're going to try and take advantage of every opportunity we can to assist our economy, but, at the same time, share it with the rest of the country and possibly the rest of the world, if we can get other countries to get vaccinated and get folks over here. So, we're going to keep working at improving our economy. But, again, all we're asking for, Neil, is that the federal government not intervene to hurt us. If they could just kind of stay out of the way, we will develop this economy, including our resources, to the highest standards."

That would be unlawful. What they're saying is, you have got two options. You can work for us. And if you work for us, you know, we require things like gloves, masks. Now we require vaccinations. If you want to do that, then come join us. If not, you have another option. See you later. There's other jobs out there."

And there's a 1905 Supreme Court case, Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, which gives public entities -- forget about private for a second, who have greater rights -- but even public entities can require vaccinations for the benefit of public health. So, certainly, a private organization, whether it be a hospital, a bar, any type of private company can require this under the law. It's their right. They're not violating any statute. They're not violating any law related to disabilities, because there's no protected class involved."

And if you don't like it, listen, if they said only those people of certain color, or only men or only women, now you're talking about some type of discrimination of a protected class.

That is a 5- year-old boy reportedly abandoned by two smugglers near El Paso, Texas, just screaming in the middle of the night. Neil, we don't know which country he came from, but the woman who reportedly left him there told a reporter that his parents were already in the U.S. Now, Texas Representative Tony Gonzales, he was here today.

Those are the Trump era policies which forced asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases were being heard. And, Neil, we're just now getting horrific details about Border Patrol agents and Mexican authorities near Yuma, Arizona. They were able to rescue a woman, a Mexican woman who was in the process of being raped, Neil. She'd been shot, and she was bleeding from her -- from a head injury, apparently. They were able to stop it while it was happening and arrest the suspect. But that is the kind of thing that people are warning about on the ground, these Border Patrol agents.

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, one of those opposition leaders, Yair Lapid of Yesh Atid Party, reported to Israel's president that he has the majority he needs, the desire to form a new government, therefore removing from office Benjamin Netanyahu. The final pieces to put their majority together fell apart -- fell together, I should say, in the last hour or so. And that final piece was an Israeli Arab party, Ra'am, or the United Arab List. The leader of that party, Mansour Abbas, signed the agreement with Yair Lapid to form that unity government. And this will be the first time in history that an Arab party has served in the government with an Israeli prime minister. And that speaks to the strange bedfellows that make up this anti-Netanyahu coalition. The presumptive prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is an ultra- nationalist from the Yamina Party. That name translates literally to the right. He's got a history of being very unsympathetic to all things Arab and Palestinian issues. The coalition is made up of right-wing centrists, leftists and now Arabs. About the only thing that they have in common is they want Netanyahu out. The way the deals were struck, Bennett will start as prime minister, then swap with Yair Lapid. Now that the agreement has been presented to the outgoing Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, the new government gets presented to the Knesset on Monday for a Wednesday vote. So there still could be some vulnerability to the coalition, particularly with reports that one member of the Yamina Party has some gripes and might vote against, therefore jeopardizing the majority that have right now. But, for the moment, the opposition to Benjamin Netanyahu has the majority they need to form a new government, therefore ousting, if they can pull it all together, Israel's longest-serving prime minister -- Neil."

So I think that as long as -- people are going to keep spending. Especially, a lot of people have extra money in their pockets with stimulus and things like that. But the chain is completely broken.

I think that, for some people, especially when maybe they have less money in their pocket, when -- if this stimulus train kind of stops, I think that that could be a factor. And then just for the restaurants being able to stay open, really, really tough, up against post-pandemic, up against these high prices, and up against labor shortages all across the chain. It's not a good situation."
