He is out with a great article which is entitled a non-alarmist reading of the Mueller-Russia indictment. In the piece, York makes some very key points, namely, that Russians started all of this in 2014. Donald Trump wasn't running. The focus was on damaging Hillary Clinton, remember, because everyone thought she was going to win. All of you in the media, you were laughing at the idea of Donald Trump running. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Byron York also cites figures from the Senate Intelligence Committee that in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, the Russians only spent $3,000 on Facebook ads. Also, the indictment is very vague about how much these Russian trolls spent on social media ads, it only says they spent, quote, thousands every month. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That number is small when you compare it to the combined $2.4 billion that the Clinton and Trump campaign spent during the election, mostly Clinton.

His name is Rob Goldman. He's the vice president of advertising at Facebook. He set the record straight on Twitter over the weekend, writing, quote: The majority of the Russian ads spent happened after the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn't align with the main media narrative of Trump and the election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And he goes on, quote, the main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions like freedom of speech, social media against us it is stoke fear and hatred amongst Americans. It is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation. Even Facebook is throwing cold water on the media's fake news narrative about Mueller's indictment. Let's get back to Obama's failure to stop this Russian interference. Congressman Devin Nunes back in 2014, he raised a red flag that, yes, Vladimir Putin needed to be watched closely. But Obama didn't seem to care, and even two weeks before the election, he's lecturing Trump, stop whining, it could never happen here. Remember, as NBC News pointed out, Obama didn't do more to combat Russia, he thought Hillary was a shoo-in.

We have been telling you on this program how Vladimir Putin had Russian operatives inside America, right here on our soil, and how they were involved in a sophisticated plot. It started in 2009. It had a main objective to get a foothold in America's uranium market. We actually had an FBI informant. We now know his name, Douglas Campbell. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we've been telling you about this guy. This guy now has testified before three congressional committees and literally, he was uncovering at the time in 2009 and '10 that Putin and his operatives were involved in bribery and kickbacks and money laundering and racketeering and extortion, all while corrupt Uranium One deal that was all being approved 18 months later. He couldn't understand why they didn't take intelligence. And that gave Russia a hostile foreign actor, control of 20 percent of America's uranium? Who would be this stupid to do this? Well, apparently, Obama and Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder and then at the time, the FBI Director Robert Mueller. And, by the way, Mueller when are you going to answer questions about this? America, already, we don't have enough uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. Why would we give 20 percent to a hostile nation Russia and a hostile actor Putin? It never made sense, it doesn't make sense. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And here we are years later and the media the Democrats, they are shocked. They're just flabbergasted that Russia would ever even dare to try to influence our election even though as I just explained, they were easily able to be involved in bribery, extortion, kickbacks, money laundering and secure 20 percent of America's uranium. Why would they stop? They already know we're being stupid. Plus, has the left forgotten what President Obama tried to do to Israel? Oh, influencing elections is wrong? Tell that to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, America's closest ally in the Middle East. Remember the congressional investigation found that back in 2014, an Israeli political group used $300,000 taxpayer dollars, the Obama State Department in a grant to create a political apparatus to try and defeat our closest ally in the Middle East, the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. And it doesn't stop there. The U.S., if it's so wrong, we've been involved in influencing elections that dates back to places like Italy, Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua and those are just a few examples. And take a look at what the former CIA Director James Woolsey told Laura Ingraham about the U.S. and how we interfere in foreign elections.

I believe in covert operations, plausible deniability, I believe in at all. Thank God we have good people in the CIA, the intelligence community, FBI, and others, military that are doing this every day. But it's beyond naive to think that this wouldn't happen to us especially given Russia's success with Uranium One back in 2009 and `10. And another, by the way, is, you know, acting surprised by the Russian election meddling, all these people in the media, they're either flat-out lying to you or they're just totally ignorant, you pick. Either the Obama administration was not prepared for Russian trying to interfere in our election or his administration made a choice to ignore the threat? Probably the latter, probably because they thought Hillary was going to win. It's that simple. And that's why President Obama tonight, if you really care about this, owes you the American people an explanation. Also breaking at this hour, now that Robert Mueller is indicted the 13 Russian nationals, very serious legal questions of being raised about Hillary Clinton, about the DNC, about the law firm Perkins Coie, about Fusion GPS, and about that former British spy Christopher Steele. Think about this -- look at this headline from the website law and crime. Quote: does Mueller indictment mean Clinton campaign can be indicted for Christopher Steele? Wait a minute, is there a double standard? The article makes some fascinating legal points. For example, Robert Mueller indicted the Russian trolls in part for failing to register as foreign agents and for not reporting their activities to the Federal Elections Commission. OK, if that's the legal standard that Robert Mueller is set up, fine. Then the special counsel should also be looking into Hillary Clinton, the DNC, Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie and Christopher Steele. And here's why, Steele is a foreign citizen, a former British spy. He was paid by Fusion GPS through that law firm Perkins Coie, the law firm tied to the Clinton campaign and the DNC. We've not seen anything to suggest that Steele was a registered foreign agent that he reported to the FCC that he was being compensated. OK, if that's all true given that information, well, that would mean the Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie, the DNC, the Clinton campaign and Christopher Steele should all be in serious legal jeopardy.

That was the whole point, to use lies to manipulate you the American people. We also know now that was also used by the FBI to get that FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and in an election year in opposition party candidate. That is the only evidence we have after over a year going on a year and a half of Russian collusion in 2016 that we know exists.

Secondly, uranium want absolutely strategic level. It's hard to imagine something larger than a sale of 20 percent of our uranium, when we have laws on the book right now Sean that say America must be a self-reliant on uranium.

They talk about the Russian spend about $100,000 on Facebook ads that compares to $81 million that the Clinton and Trump campaign spent on Facebook ads. They talked about how just 44 percent of those ad impressions, when they are up on the screen somewhere, 44 percent of those were from before the election. 56 percent were after the election when they obviously had no chance of influencing the election, and the amount of money that the Russian spent in some key states, because as you know in that the indictment, talked about how the Russians became sophisticated and learn what purple states were. They were directing their efforts in the state of Pennsylvania. According to Facebook, they spent $300. In Michigan, they spent $823, and in Wisconsin, $1,079. The problem was, all but $54 of that was before the primary. Not in the general election. All of that is testimony that we had for congress that is really relevant to this indictment.",

The only concrete evidence of collusion with Russia that we have is Hillary Clinton and are bought and paid for dossier that's filled with Russian lies, Russian government lies and propaganda and salacious details that were never verified. She used that, bought that to influence an election. So just like he always does, President Trump, he's fighting back and he's fighting back on Twitter to react to Mueller's indictment of these 13 Russian nationals for the 2016 election meddling."

Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I did not know. Robert Mueller's indictment clearly lays out that this Russian attempt to influence the election, it started in 2014 under Obama's watch and he was warned and he did nothing to stop it. In fact, by the way, go back to 2012, during a presidential debate. Remember Barack Obama mocking Mitt Romney for saying Russia still posed a very serious foreign policy threat. Mitt Romney was right. Obama was wrong, and, of course, the media ignored all the key facts and findings in the Mueller indictment.

Democrats, the media have been playing right into Putin's hands by creating chaos and political discord just what they wanted, and frankly, it's working better than Russia could have ever dreamed up. That is what this Russian effort was all about -- causing chaos political unrest in this country. 'The Washington Examiner's' Byron York, he'll join us later tonight. He is out with a great article which is entitled a non-alarmist reading of the Mueller-Russia indictment. In the piece, York makes some very key points, namely, that Russians started all of this in 2014. Donald Trump wasn't running. The focus was on damaging Hillary Clinton, remember, because everyone thought she was going to win. All of you in the media, you were laughing at the idea of Donald Trump running. Byron York also cites figures from the Senate Intelligence Committee that in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, the Russians only spent $3,000 on Facebook ads. Also, the indictment is very vague about how much these Russian trolls spent on social media ads, it only says they spent, quote, thousands every month. That number is small when you compare it to the combined $2.4 billion that the Clinton and Trump campaign spent during the election, mostly Clinton. That's not that much money. Also, tonight, a Facebook executive he's sounding off about the Russia investigation. His name is Rob Goldman. He's the vice president of advertising at Facebook."

      "speaker": "He set the record straight on Twitter over the weekend, writing, quote",
      "utterance": "The majority of the Russian ads spent happened after the election. We shared that fact, but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn't align with the main media narrative of Trump and the election. And he goes on, quote, the main goal of the Russian propaganda and misinformation effort is to divide America by using our institutions like freedom of speech, social media against us it is stoke fear and hatred amongst Americans. It is working incredibly well. We are quite divided as a nation. Even Facebook is throwing cold water on the media's fake news narrative about Mueller's indictment. Let's get back to Obama's failure to stop this Russian interference. Congressman Devin Nunes back in 2014, he raised a red flag that, yes, Vladimir Putin needed to be watched closely. But Obama didn't seem to care, and even two weeks before the election, he's lecturing Trump, stop whining, it could never happen here. Remember, as NBC News pointed out, Obama didn't do more to combat Russia, he thought Hillary was a shoo-in. Why interrupt this? And what's even more disturbing is that there were even earlier warning signs from Russia. We have been telling you on this program how Vladimir Putin had Russian operatives inside America, right here on our soil, and how they were involved in a sophisticated plot. It started in 2009. It had a main objective to get a foothold in America's uranium market. We actually had an FBI informant. We now know his name, Douglas Campbell. And we've been telling you about this guy. This guy now has testified before three congressional committees and literally, he was uncovering at the time in 2009 and '10 that Putin and his operatives were involved in bribery and kickbacks and money laundering and racketeering and extortion, all while corrupt Uranium One deal that was all being approved 18 months later. He couldn't understand why they didn't take intelligence. And that gave Russia a hostile foreign actor, control of 20 percent of America's uranium? Who would be this stupid to do this? Well, apparently, Obama and Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder and then at the time, the FBI Director Robert Mueller. And, by the way, Mueller when are you going to answer questions about this? America, already, we don't have enough uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. Why would we give 20 percent to a hostile nation Russia and a hostile actor Putin? It never made sense, it doesn't make sense. And here we are years later and the media the Democrats, they are shocked. They're just flabbergasted that Russia would ever even dare to try to influence our election even though as I just explained, they were easily able to be involved in bribery, extortion, kickbacks, money laundering and secure 20 percent of America's uranium. Why would they stop? They already know we're being stupid. Plus, has the left forgotten what President Obama tried to do to Israel? Oh, influencing elections is wrong? Tell that to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, America's closest ally in the Middle East. Remember the congressional investigation found that back in 2014, an Israeli political group used $300,000 taxpayer dollars, the Obama State Department in a grant to create a political apparatus to try and defeat our closest ally in the Middle East, the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. And it doesn't stop there. The U.S., if it's so wrong, we've been involved in influencing elections that dates back to places like Italy, Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Nicaragua and those are just a few examples. And take a look at what the former CIA Director James Woolsey told Laura Ingraham about the U.S. and how we interfere in foreign elections. Take a look."

And another, by the way, is, you know, acting surprised by the Russian election meddling, all these people in the media, they're either flat-out lying to you or they're just totally ignorant, you pick. Either the Obama administration was not prepared for Russian trying to interfere in our election or his administration made a choice to ignore the threat?

For example, Robert Mueller indicted the Russian trolls in part for failing to register as foreign agents and for not reporting their activities to the Federal Elections Commission. OK, if that's the legal standard that Robert Mueller is set up, fine. Then the special counsel should also be looking into Hillary Clinton, the DNC, Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie and Christopher Steele. And here's why, Steele is a foreign citizen, a former British spy. He was paid by Fusion GPS through that law firm Perkins Coie, the law firm tied to the Clinton campaign and the DNC. We've not seen anything to suggest that Steele was a registered foreign agent that he reported to the FCC that he was being compensated. OK, if that's all true given that information, well, that would mean the Fusion GPS, Perkins Coie, the DNC, the Clinton campaign and Christopher Steele should all be in serious legal jeopardy. At a very minimum, Mueller should be investigating them, or is there a double standard, Mr. Mueller? There's already been a complaint filed with the FEC against the Clinton campaign and the DNC, accusing them of violating campaign finance laws for failing to disclose the up to $12 million that was shelled out to fund the dossier, and we know that the dossier was used to influence the election. That was the whole point, to use lies to manipulate you the American people. We also know now that was also used by the FBI to get that FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and in an election year in opposition party candidate. That is the only evidence we have after over a year going on a year and a half of Russian collusion in 2016 that we know exists.

Two, Andrew Weissmann was reprimanded in the past quite extensively in one case in 1997 by a judge for withholding exculpatory evidence. But if we look at Andrew Weissmann, he also attended allegedly, Hillary Clinton's party on election night, he was also very supported of Sally Yates who basically stated that she wasn't going to follow through with President Trump's orders.

      "utterance": "Absolutely Sean. Everybody's talking about the 13 indictments. Byron just wrote a very good piece about it, but the real story that we have to get to the bottom of are the leaks out of the White House. There are 27 criminal referrals. The DOJ are looking into the leaks, including the leak of the phone conversation between Mike Flynn and the Russian ambassador. Serious national security investigations. Secondly, uranium want absolutely strategic level. It's hard to imagine something larger than a sale of 20 percent of our uranium, when we have laws on the book right now Sean that say America must be a self-reliant on uranium. We must not import it from anybody else and Hillary Clinton approved the sale of uranium as her husband got half a million dollars speaking fee. It's just the tip of the iceberg. These things take time. Rest assured, justice will be done."

I had to get you to cut and paste it to send it to me. Every time I click on it, that smoking thing comes up again and again. It drives me nuts. I want you to go through this. If you really look at the Mueller indictment the way you are looking at it, it's not what people think is it?"

      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "I think you need to look at this indictment in conjunction with the testimony of Facebook and other social media executives on Capitol Hill a few months ago. There's a lot of stuff that they talked about that was not in the indictment. What they basically talk about the sum of the scale of this Russian operation. They talk about the Russian spend about $100,000 on Facebook ads that compares to $81 million that the Clinton and Trump campaign spent on Facebook ads. They talked about how just 44 percent of those ad impressions, when they are up on the screen somewhere, 44 percent of those were from before the election. 56 percent were after the election when they obviously had no chance of influencing the election, and the amount of money that the Russian spent in some key states, because as you know in that the indictment, talked about how the Russians became sophisticated and learn what purple states were. They were directing their efforts in the state of Pennsylvania. According to Facebook, they spent $300. In Michigan, they spent $823, and in Wisconsin, $1,079. The problem was, all but $54 of that was before the primary. Not in the general election. All of that is testimony that we had for congress that is really relevant to this indictment."

Let go back to you, Sebastian, because this is now, what goes to the heart of this for me? Everybody is so sanctimoniously and in their pompous arrogance talks about this Russian influence. Ok. We can't talk about Russian influence and ignore uranium one. We can talk about Russian influence and ignore the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian government dossier, can we."

The opposition research filed that Hillary and the DNC paid more than $12 million for one file was used to illegally obtain a surveillance warrant against an American national during a Presidential campaign. That is the enormity. It makes Watergate pale by comparison. It's a massive scandal."

As a matter of fact, I think tomorrow we will see how the intelligence committee asking for more information from a variety of current and former officials about, what do they know about this dossier? When did they first hear about it? When did they first learned that it was supported and bankrolled by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC?

Obama is the primary person being protected, because all of this spying and all of this collusion to destroy Trump happened with his knowledge and probably encouragement.

And also President Clinton takes a trip over to Kazakhstan as the deal for Kazaks uranium takes place for a guy who later donates by the way a large smock of her proceeds to the Clinton foundation. The hypocrisy on this thing is fascinating. We know the source of the dossier with the Russians and the Clinton campaign. Nobody's bothered by that at all, yet in this case of fairy tale like Russian collusion with a Trump team, nobody can show you who the colluders are or collusion happened in all this memo."

That doesn't seem fishy to you? Doesn't not seem fishy to you that all the people involved in that deal, and Canada, all these other people that they were throwing money at the Clinton foundation and they needed Hillary to sign off on that deal that gave uranium 120 percent of our control took Putin?"
