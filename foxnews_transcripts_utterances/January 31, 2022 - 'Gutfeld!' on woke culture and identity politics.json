      "sentences": "You're just a little bit hangover from the last 24 hours of drinking. Yes. Clap away, you psychopaths. I need all the help I can get. Happy Monday, everyone. So glad to be back after a glorious weekend. So today let's talk about heroes, people who risked their lives for others, people who put your needs before theirs. In our ab- obsessed fitness conscious world. We forget about this man. The man with the beard gut, the individual who took on the burden of girth, so that we might marvel at its worth when we're at the beach or with letters written on it at a freezing football game or even better in the mirror over your bed. It's impressive that men and women can achieve such unfettered size, it almost defies biology. Meanwhile, instead we applaud those who have six pack abs even though with the right genes and a week of Kat's cooking. Anyone can do that. And yet gargantuan guts go unnoticed until now. Yes, thank God finally it's here. A beer gut emoji has arrived to Apple phone -- iPhones with its latest voluntary update. This new emoji comes in five different skin tones. So someone with a massive beer gut can be any shade that he, she or they want. Budweiser and pancakes do not discriminate. Like Bill Hemmer's hot tub, it's totally inclusive. Now I'm aware this is a small step for beer guts. But what's next? Maybe one day he or she can be on the Supreme Court, if he identifies at least as a black woman of color first, which should happen. I mean, if a woman with a penis can swim against a woman without a penis, that a white man without a vagina could be on the Supreme Courts provided he identifies as a black woman with a vagina or without. I am confused. But let me finish. Of course, our racist country would probably flip out. Did you see the latest ABC News poll? As you know, our unifier in chief said he only nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court. The guy works like a bottle of white out in reverse. But 76 percent of Americans would prefer him to consider all possible nominees, instead of say limiting his search to only seven percent of the population. So wait, Americans want all possible nominees? You mean like Asians, Mexicans, Indians? Please. We're talking about the Supreme Court here, not a food court. And we know what all possible nominees is code for. Old white guys. And certainly not black lesbians with a beer gut like me. Now emojipedia the company who created the beer gut emoji says the new figure may be used by transmen, non-binary people or women with short hair. Which is all good news for my softball team. But it's true, all of those people can get their own beer gut, that's science according to the researchers at Old Milwaukee. It's not like saying a guy can get pregnant. That would be nuts. Or should I say nut less? And how crazy would it be to make an emoji for that? And pretend that it's a common everyday thing? It would be silly. I mean, I see beer guts wherever I go. But I never actually see a pregnant man. Unless it's the media pointing their cameras at one pregnant man. Sometimes I wonder how many so-called pregnant men there are on the planet. Are there enough on the globe to fill up one Lamaze class? Isn't it funny how no one ever bothers to count that sort of thing? Is it really a thing? Is it too hard to count? Or is it that they probably not like the answer? Because then you wouldn't be able to justify the emoji but that's OK with the media. You know what's not OK? The OK sign seen here.",

See originally Herbie Husker is making an OK gesture. And as reported in the media some, yes the mysterious some, we never know who have linked this symbol to white supremacy. Yes, this symbol as seen here. And here and here and here and here. Yes. Look at all these racists proclaiming white supremacy. Who's ever in charge of vetting members for the Klan is obviously doing a horrible job. But it doesn't matter. The cartoon mascot created back in the 1970s was changed to Herbie making a number one sign. I guess that's pleasing primatologist all over the country. But it's so racist. Don't they know what the number one sign means? It means quite literally supremacy because there's only one number one and who's doing it? Herbie who was as white as Gwen's Stefany taking a milk bath. But he's got the only mascot to come under fire this week.",

We just didn't even want to be associated with portraying anything that somebody might think, you know, that it means white power.\" Well, hey, I got a better idea for your mascot. Why not have him holding his testicles in a mayonnaise jar? So there you go. It doesn't matter if the smear is real. It's only if someone out there might think it's racist and who cares who that someone is? It could be Jussie Smollett. You know, if it is MAGA attackers were making that gesture when they hate crime to him. And so the morons in Nebraska athletics think it's OK to see the OK sign is racist then I can see the pregnant man emoji as a beer gut. Because that's what I think I'm seeing, right?

The sign reads: If you or someone you know are affected by a free speech event on campus, here are some resources. Among the 17 options, the Office of Equal Opportunity Multicultural Counseling, the Vice President of Inclusive Excellence and the Victims Assistant Hotline. I'd point out that those resources sound redundant, but then they create another resource to deal with that. It's also sad that they need treatment for a free speech event. I thought our country was a free speech event. Colorado State gave us this statement reading in part, \"CSU is committed to free speech as both a legal protection and a foundation of the robust debate that is core to higher education. We also recognize the power of speech to impact people deeply. The sign is a list of some of the many resources available to our students.

      "utterance": "You're just a little bit hangover from the last 24 hours of drinking. Yes. Clap away, you psychopaths. I need all the help I can get. Happy Monday, everyone. So glad to be back after a glorious weekend. So today let's talk about heroes, people who risked their lives for others, people who put your needs before theirs. In our ab- obsessed fitness conscious world. We forget about this man. The man with the beard gut, the individual who took on the burden of girth, so that we might marvel at its worth when we're at the beach or with letters written on it at a freezing football game or even better in the mirror over your bed. It's impressive that men and women can achieve such unfettered size, it almost defies biology. Meanwhile, instead we applaud those who have six pack abs even though with the right genes and a week of Kat's cooking. Anyone can do that. And yet gargantuan guts go unnoticed until now. Yes, thank God finally it's here. A beer gut emoji has arrived to Apple phone -- iPhones with its latest voluntary update. This new emoji comes in five different skin tones. So someone with a massive beer gut can be any shade that he, she or they want. Budweiser and pancakes do not discriminate. Like Bill Hemmer's hot tub, it's totally inclusive. Now I'm aware this is a small step for beer guts. But what's next? Maybe one day he or she can be on the Supreme Court, if he identifies at least as a black woman of color first, which should happen. I mean, if a woman with a penis can swim against a woman without a penis, that a white man without a vagina could be on the Supreme Courts provided he identifies as a black woman with a vagina or without. I am confused. But let me finish. Of course, our racist country would probably flip out. Did you see the latest ABC News poll? As you know, our unifier in chief said he only nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court. The guy works like a bottle of white out in reverse. But 76 percent of Americans would prefer him to consider all possible nominees, instead of say limiting his search to only seven percent of the population. So wait, Americans want all possible nominees? You mean like Asians, Mexicans, Indians? Please. We're talking about the Supreme Court here, not a food court. And we know what all possible nominees is code for. Old white guys. And certainly not black lesbians with a beer gut like me. Now emojipedia the company who created the beer gut emoji says the new figure may be used by transmen, non-binary people or women with short hair. Which is all good news for my softball team. But it's true, all of those people can get their own beer gut, that's science according to the researchers at Old Milwaukee. It's not like saying a guy can get pregnant. That would be nuts. Or should I say nut less? And how crazy would it be to make an emoji for that? And pretend that it's a common everyday thing? It would be silly. I mean, I see beer guts wherever I go. But I never actually see a pregnant man. Unless it's the media pointing their cameras at one pregnant man. Sometimes I wonder how many so-called pregnant men there are on the planet. Are there enough on the globe to fill up one Lamaze class? Isn't it funny how no one ever bothers to count that sort of thing? Is it really a thing? Is it too hard to count? Or is it that they probably not like the answer? Because then you wouldn't be able to justify the emoji but that's OK with the media. You know what's not OK? The OK sign seen here."

Yes, this symbol as seen here. And here and here and here and here. Yes. Look at all these racists proclaiming white supremacy. Who's ever in charge of vetting members for the Klan is obviously doing a horrible job. But it doesn't matter. The cartoon mascot created back in the 1970s was changed to Herbie making a number one sign. I guess that's pleasing primatologist all over the country. But it's so racist. Don't they know what the number one sign means? It means quite literally supremacy because there's only one number one and who's doing it? Herbie who was as white as Gwen's Stefany taking a milk bath. But he's got the only mascot to come under fire this week."

We just didn't even want to be associated with portraying anything that somebody might think, you know, that it means white power.\" Well, hey, I got a better idea for your mascot. Why not have him holding his testicles in a mayonnaise jar? So there you go. It doesn't matter if the smear is real. It's only if someone out there might think it's racist and who cares who that someone is? It could be Jussie Smollett. You know, if it is MAGA attackers were making that gesture when they hate crime to him. And so the morons in Nebraska athletics think it's OK to see the OK sign is racist then I can see the pregnant man emoji as a beer gut. Because that's what I think I'm seeing, right?

Blasting Joe Rogan for misinformation, although they're old enough to die from constipation. That's a lot of rhyming. I couldn't make up my mind. So Harry Meg, what I call Prince Harry and his wife, apparently expressed concerns about COVID misinfo on Spotify where they also have a podcasting deal. So far that $25 million podcast deal resulted in just a single 30- minute episode. If I were Spotify, I'd express concerns about that. You know, you think they came from royalty. A spokesperson says the couple have continued to express concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform. Blah, blah, blah and address how public health crisis is. Meanwhile, their washed up artists have joined Neil Young, asking Spotify to pull their music and objection to Rogan, including Bruce Springsteen's guitarist Nils Lofgren, a poor man C.C. DeVille.

It's believed that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family were moved to a secret location over security concerns. Now warning, he might be disguised. Of course, there were zero reports of violence according to Ottawa police. Still Canada's black face in chief condemn the truckers for holding unacceptable views and not following the science. You know, like the science that said vaccines prevent infection and transmission. Speaking of, you'll never guess switch fully vaccinated boosted world leader tested positive for COVID today. Justin tweeted the news to let us know, he's feeling fine, good. And he's continued to work remotely or remotely working. Where that is exactly? Nobody knows. But what came first the COVID quarantine or the convoy cowering? Was his move to a secret location and orchestrated stunt to imply that mandate protesters are scary violent thugs.
