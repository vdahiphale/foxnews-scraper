I do think about one thing is that the president being agitated at the justice department for all sorts of reasons, I can understand. Not sure exactly the crime the DOJ would actually investigate here. Looks to me like it was an agreement and arrangement.

Now, if she could rig a primary against Bernie, she certainly attempts to rig a general against Trump. You've just said that. Now, the lawyers can decide if the laws were broken. The only issue is she sets up these joint fund-raising committees with the DNC to bust the donor caps. She brings in the all the cash and then squirrels in a way for herself and doesn't give the state committees anything. That's the issue. Now, Brazile coming clean, I think, basically tells Hillary stay in the woods with your chardonnay, we don't want to see you anymore. But it also curry's favor with the Bernie people in the future, and I think she's a smart player there.

This was one military court, a second, now a third that's says jail time is an appropriate for someone who was held five years as a prisoner and tortured. So, you know, I understand the politics of this because you wouldn't want to be this guy's mate in battle. I know you don't have your back covered or that he's engaging in some conduct that can put you in peril, and people were injured, people were hurt in the course of his disappearance in looking for him.

Think about it, not only people were harmed, the report is that six people died looking for him. The trade now five top Taliban commanders are back in the battlefield. I'm sure we have no idea where they are. And I believe, from what we've seen in the reports, that cash was exchanged. So that just encourages more hostage taking and more people being captured on the battlefield and held for ransom."

The judge is thinking this guy has suffered enough. Five years, Taliban captivity, fine. But, punishment in the United States not only is for punishment, but it's also as a deterrent. So for future platoons, it makes people think twice about deserting, because the platoon is only as strong as the weakest link. So now if you're out there, they take this very seriously in the U.S. military desertion. Extremely seriously. So when people think about it, doing it again? Hey man, get a slap on the wrist, no jail time. Not as stringent as it used to be in this country."

But it doesn't even change the fact here that justice was not served, because he should have been received proper amount of punishment for the crime that he committed.

OK, so two studies come out that show that people, if you're shown -- you can get contributions to, like, a little baby or a dog. They'll go with the dog. And also, when they looked at, at Northeastern University, students are shown fake newspaper clippings about a baseball bat attack on a puppy, an adult dog, a year old infant, and a 30-year old."
