We'll also speak to experts who've been through the impeachment battle. What does it really mean? How does it go? Plus the NBA siding with the Communist China. You are not going to miss this Angle.

Well, sources are now telling Fox that the Intel IG had no explanation for an 18 day period between Trump's July 25th call with Ukraine and the whistleblower filing his or her complaint on August 12th. Now it's during that period that the whistleblower contacted Schiff's aides and decided to go to the Intel IG to file the complaint. Sources are also saying the whistleblower didn't disclose to the IG any congressional contacts that he or she may have had. So here I'm going to remind you that Adam Schiff is the only one who has the ability to release the full transcripts from last week's hearings. So ask yourself, why isn't he?

Politicians on both sides of the aisle are calling this a bad move, endangers our Kurdish allies, they've done so much for us, but Trump did say he was going to pull our troops out of Syria. The use of force from 2001 that was sponsored by Tom Daschle on September 18th, 2001, I guess is still authorizing military force in the Middle East, which I'm not wild about.

And yet every time we fought in the last 20 or 30 years, the Kurds have been on our side, so I think what we need to do is find a way that's not antithetical to Trump's agenda, that is we're not going to go into these optional no-win, no-lose endless wars, but protect people that have helped us. And I think we can do that. But the problem is that we in the United States are pledged to help independent people, the Greeks, the Armenians, the Israelis, the Poles, the Kurds that are in difficult geographies, we always have. And one of the ironies is throughout history they've often been targeted by whom? The Turks. And yet we come to their aid when it's not in a cost-benefit analysis in our favor.

And the three Democrats at the top of the 2020 nomination polls have run into some serious trouble and tonight, there could be a new obstacle and it's not a joke. There are serious whispers about another Hillary Clinton run. I'm not kidding. We should be so lucky. But first we ask this simple question tonight. Just how improperly are the Democrats handling this impeachment push? I want to take you back to what might be the most fateful decision of this entire charade. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi putting the partisan and reckless Adam Schiff in charge of this impeachment inquiry."

Inspector General's testimony is happening on Friday. The collusion between the whistleblower and Schiff's committee could be far worse than we previously knew. Now we told you Friday that the whistleblower didn't disclose, he had met with Schiff's staff before following - filing that complaint, that sparked the whole impeachment frenzy. Well, sources are now telling Fox that the Intel IG had no explanation for an 18 day period between Trump's July 25th call with Ukraine and the whistleblower filing his or her complaint on August 12th. Now it's during that period that the whistleblower contacted Schiff's aides and decided to go to the Intel IG to file the complaint. Sources are also saying the whistleblower didn't disclose to the IG any congressional contacts that he or she may have had. So here I'm going to remind you that Adam Schiff is the only one who has the ability to release the full transcripts from last week's hearings. So ask yourself, why isn't he? Joining me now is a man who played an integral part of the President Bill Clinton impeachment, Bob Barr. One of the House impeachment managers at the time. I remember it well. Bob, how badly is Adam Schiff's leadership damaging the credibility of this inquiry?"

It illustrates to me that Speaker Pelosi for all of the fanfare that the Left gives her, she really does not have control of her caucus. She started out a few weeks ago as you remember, with allowing Nadler, you know the man who never smiles to take a crack at a full impeachment inquiry. That didn't turn out too well so then she turns it over to Schiff and that's turned out as disaster. It's not only hurting the impeachment effort for them but it's really hurting the country and that's really the bottom line here. This is a committee of the Congress and I was yes with the CIA back when we formed both the House and the Senate Intelligence committees through legislation back in the late 70s. And what Schiff has done to the House Intelligence Committee which is supposed to be the most nonpartisan of committees. He has turned it into the most partisan and in so doing is doing great damage to intelligence oversight for the United States."

      "utterance": "No, it doesn't wash and the fact of the matter is that an impeachment inquiry or an inquiry of impeachment does not start because the Speaker says it does. You know throwing around a magic wand. An inquiry of impeachment is a formal document as you know. This is how the impeachment process was started back in 1998 as well as in 1973, 1974 with Nixon. It is a very formal document. It places the responsibility where it should be and where the House rules require it to be and that is the Judiciary Committee. But I think Pelosi is doing this sort of faux impeachment inquiry because they realize that it might very well fall apart and crumble before their very eyes and if there is no formal inquiry, they can ingle back and say well, we didn't really mean it anyway."

The Attorney General has spoken directly to officials in Britain, Australia and Italy according to a Justice Department official. Joining me now to respond former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Matt, great to see it tonight. Should the Democrats be concerned?

I mean, they are - you can see, they are worried. They are worried. They're trying to discredit. They're suggesting that somehow this is illegitimate to look at why we even had this investigation.

It's all about Ukraine. You know how fast and furious. It came on before they even had the transcript, before they had the whistleblower complaint. Now they've realized the deficiencies in the complaint and so they got a second whistleblower that they don't want to put in front of American people. One of the number one tenets of the American judicial system is to confront the witnesses against you and that's exactly what they don't want to have them because they know these whistleblowers will completely fold and we've all seen the evidence.

One, the Attorney General signaled that he would do precisely this during his confirmation hearing and second, this is what the ordinary processes of the Department of Justice are about.

It quickly move to hit the NBA where it really hurts. The pocketbook. Suspending millions of dollars' worth of franchise business, Beijing banned the Houston Rockets games from Chinese TV.

I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\" But the most despicable reaction came from the NBA itself. The league put out two apologies. Count them. One in English calling Morey's tweet \"regrettable\" and then another shameless statement in Chinese reading, \"they were extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.\" Standing with the persecuted people of Hong Kong is inappropriate. They should wear any criticism of the Chinese regime as a badge of honor but no can do. You know what?

I stand by what I've said before -- we should gradually but seriously disentangle American interests from Chinese interests until they completely reform their ways. American brands, American companies are engaged in a demonic bargain in China.

But there wasn't a lot of money, though, to be made in South Africa, not really. And the value of billions in China is more important, though, than the precious value of free expression that the NBA claimed it cherished?

But I don't think it's sustainable because their attendance is sort of like the NFL. It's static, and they've so politicized the sport it's not going to grow on the interior of America, and its maxed out on the coast and the woke young audience. So what they're saying is we have an international sports and we are going to look for Chinese viewers and European viewers, and we're going to make the necessary political adjustments to get that cash and profit. And it reminds me of another point that is really I think the subtext of this whole issue, Laura, and that is, the greatest achievements of Donald Trump's first administration, his tenure, so far has been at the 11th hour that he woke America up, that the Chinese were so insidious in Wall Street and Silicon Valley and among Washington lobbyists, entertainment and professional sports, that they were really, from the interior of the United States, from the inside, destroying our own freedom of will and choice.  And he was the first person to call out the bipartisan establishment to say, you know what, this can't go on. If it goes on it's going to destroy the country. And I think the 11th hour we are starting to wake up. And it's really distasteful to see all these people like LeBron James and all these lecturers on virtue to be so cowardly and have no virtue when it comes to real life and death existential issues like the Chinese and the way they treat people well. They don't treat people well. They make the NBA a lot of money but they don't treat people well."

All right, Victor, I've got to get your thoughts, though, on President Trump's move toward withdrawing U.S. forces from a section in Syria and allowing Turkey to move in, Erdogan's forces. Politicians on both sides of the aisle are calling this a bad move, endangers our Kurdish allies, they've done so much for us, but Trump did say he was going to pull our troops out of Syria. The use of force from 2001 that was sponsored by Tom Daschle on September 18th, 2001, I guess is still authorizing military force in the Middle East, which I'm not wild about. But what about our Kurd allies? They've put everything on the line for us in our mission."

      "utterance": "I think we're trying to square a circle because the Kurds are our friends, but they're not our legal allies, and Turks are our legal allies, but they're not our friends. So we are at a dilemma. And we're in a circular firing squad in Syria where everybody is shooting each other. And yet every time we fought in the last 20 or 30 years, the Kurds have been on our side, so I think what we need to do is find a way that's not antithetical to Trump's agenda, that is we're not going to go into these optional no-win, no-lose endless wars, but protect people that have helped us. And I think we can do that. But the problem is that we in the United States are pledged to help independent people, the Greeks, the Armenians, the Israelis, the Poles, the Kurds that are in difficult geographies, we always have. And one of the ironies is throughout history they've often been targeted by whom? The Turks. And yet we come to their aid when it's not in a cost-benefit analysis in our favor. So I think Trump can find a way. Mike Pompeo has had great success in Greece, reestablishing relations with the Greeks who are also in the same situation vis-a-vis Turkey, and I think that's what he's going to have to work on."

Joe Biden \"donors gather for emergency closed-door meeting as campaign loses steam.\" Another big concern, Biden came forth in fundraising for the third quarter behind Mayor Pete. Then there's the not so secret plan to keep Elizabeth Warren from securing the nomination. An unnamed major Democrat donor -- Wall Street, excuse me -- telling \"The Washington Post\" if she's the nominee, \"we can't vote for her or Trump\" and would sit out the election. And Bernie Sanders, well, he had a heart attack last week, God bless him, and that's raising serious questions about his health and overall physical fitness for office. So all that combined, plus Hillary Clinton's new media tour, she's everywhere, raising serious questions if she actually is going to make a third run at the White House. Yes, we're serious. Joining me now, Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker, and Ethan Bearman, syndicated liberal radio host of \"Left Coast News.\" Ethan, are you concerned about the top three Democrats struggling so much now that even Democrats are seriously pondering this Hillary 2020 idea?"

So there are opportunities here. I just don't think it's Hillary Clinton. I think that people who are under that age of 51, a fresh face.

If anything, this impeachment inquiry has shown, the racket that the Biden family has been running in China, also in the Ukraine. And of course, Elizabeth Warren is stiff as a board. I can't even imagine her getting into the mud with the greatest mud wrestler of all time, Donald Trump. So for these reasons, there's a look to other people. But Beto, really?

But unforced errors are always regrettable. She really is brilliant, she's a great attorney, a great professor. She is brilliant on the debate stage, but unforced errors really are going to catch up.

She wanted to be not just a woman but a woman of color, and was so described in the \"Fordham Law Review\" and other places like that. So she used this not innocently. It wasn't an unforced error. These were cunning moves that she made to advance her career. Now obviously they're embarrassing to her now, and so she's trying to recreate this fictional narrative, sort of Abraham Lincoln style of having grown up in a log cabin, having been persecuted all the way along the way.

And then you've suddenly got this detail lead from the CIA, hanging out at the White House, hearing gossip from other people who are listening in on the calls.
