Fauci and his gang then end up giving up money to all of these people, $9 million worth of grants through the NIH to people that worked with them on clarifying or amending what they thought was a case. But here -- the bottom line on this thing is that science should be about debate, it should be about criticism, it should be receptive to skepticism. I mean, that's what science is all about. So, you get together with people and you test different theories. These guys are dictators, they got together and said, you know what, whether we're responsible or not, we're going to cover it up, and you know, the hell with science. And that's what they said.

I think, you know, now there is reporting that says his decision to announce was imminent and that the White House may be jumped the gun by a hair or somebody at the White House did or maybe not the White House. I understand why, because they have a lot of work to do. You got to get everybody in line. Now what do we report this morning on America's Newsroom?

Senator Schumer might not be the majority leader after the November midterms, so they had to do this right away. If they waited until the end of the term which was the end of June, that would've only given them four months and I think a lot of people including somebody like, even like Kyrsten Sinema or Joe Manchin could've said, you know what, we ought to wait."

Fauci should probably resign and get a lawyer, no wonder Fauci was quivering whenever anybody brought up China because the paper trail doesn't just involve Chinese scientists. It involves American scientists too. Think about that class action litigation when you're talking about 12 million people dead, you can bankrupt the country. That's trillions in settlements if you want to do it. So, somebody has to go to jail, if you're arresting non-vaxxed people in Applebee's, somebody should be paying the price for this. Which is now becoming a Holocaust. Right? So now we know the experts who -- well, it's over six million dead, I'm talking about numbers. We know -- we know why the experts ridiculed the other experts who are calling this out early on, it's because they didn't want to pass off China, lose funding or go to prison. And prison should be on the table for all of these people because they took a gamble on a dangerous concept. It wasn't deliberate, the leak wasn't deliberate, right?
