The new woke version judges students on their privilege. Want to get your kids into Harvard, well get divorced and move to a bad neighborhood. More on that story in just a minute. But first tonight, if a man runs for president, but nobody supports him, is it really a presidential campaign? That's a philosophical question, obviously. But it's also suddenly a very practical concern for Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York. De Blasio announced today that years of destroying the nation's largest city, he'd very much like to do the same thing to America.

Some will draw a neighborhood statistics like the crime rate, poverty, home values, a student's high school will supply other factors like estimated curricular rigor, and free lunch rate. And then there are factors that look at a student's own family. Factors like household income, and whether both parents live at home. This is a pure inversion of the intent of the SAT. From the first day, the whole point of the test of the SAT was that your background didn't matter. The SAT was devised to create as level a playing field as possible. Everybody took the same test, grading was blind. It didn't matter where you came from. Nobody thought the SAT was going to make everyone the same. That's impossible. People are not the same. Some people have natural advantages, including on standardized tests, and always will. You can't change that, unfortunately, any more than you could make everyone tall enough to play in the NBA. What you can do and what you must do is ensure fairness. Everyone deserves to have the same rights. Everyone should have the same standards and be held to them in the same way. That's the most basic promise of America. The College Board is explicitly rejecting this. On the new SAT, it isn't ability that matters, it's where you rank on the privilege hierarchy, and it's not hard to imagine the perverse effects of this. Under the new standards, if you worked hard and stayed married for the sake of your children, your kids will be punished for that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } David Coleman is the left-wing social engineer who runs the College Board. You won't be surprised to know he is also the genius behind Common Core. He says the new standards are designed to address quote, \"disparities of wealth\" reflected in the SAT, but it doesn't take a perfect SAT score to guess who is going to lose under the system. It's who always loses -- the middle class. They've been told that America is a meritocracy. Work hard, sacrifice for your kids, and you will be rewarded. But people like David Coleman know that's not true. They know it because they make the rules. They benefit from the corruption of the system. They pad their own kids' applications with phony extra-curriculars. They make up some new heritage so they can benefit from the Jim Crow system of racial discrimination we have on college campuses. The new SAT will only increase the opportunities to game the system. For example, the College Board plans to evaluate privilege based on home address. Well parents already use fake addresses to send their kids to choice public schools in many places. Why won't they use fake addresses from tough neighborhoods to give their kids an advantage in college admissions? Well, of course they will. English language proficiency, household income, family education levels, these are all factors, too. So get ready for an awful lot of lying about those subjects as well. Would it just be easier to reward the kids who know the most about English and Math? That's what you do if you cared about fairness or the future of your country. You would emphasize achievement over victimhood. Our decadent elites don't care, so they do the opposite.

We see every year in New York City that Asian kids from poor immigrant backgrounds, whoop everybody's ass, regardless of their income levels, because their families, their parents are so relentlessly focused on their student academic involvement. That is what is necessary to close the academic achievement gap and until you get rid of the acting white syndrome that stigmatizes academic achievement on the part of black students, unless we get rid of the preferences that black students know about, that sends the message that they don't need to work as hard in order to get admitted to highly selective schools over their non-student of color peers with better scores, we're not going to close that academic achievement gap and we're going to be saddled with this scourge of diversity, which is simply a way to dismantle precisely the colorblind meritocratic standards that are a key to any society's success.",

He is still yammering on about Russia, much to the embarrassment of his friends. It makes you think that Kasich and his staff must be true believers. They must really think that Russia is an existential threat to our democracy. But of course they don't really think that, they're lying. We know that because last month, John Kasich's closest adviser, John Weaver, signed a $350,000.00 contract with a subsidiary of -- wait for it - - Russia's state-owned a nuclear power company. John Weaver also registered as a foreign agent to lobby against sanctions on Russia. Keep in mind that just a few months ago like his partner, John Kasich, Weaver was accusing the President of betraying his country to work for Russia, which is precisely what John Weaver himself is now doing. Pause and let the irony sink in, marinate in it for a moment. Well, tonight, John Weaver is pledging to be ashamed of all of that, as if he is capable of shame. The rest of us should understand the John Weaver never cared about Russia. None of these people did. John Kasich, Bill Kristol -- the rest of them -- all the hysterics on Twitter, it was all fake. It had nothing to do with Russia. What they cared about was preserving a system that they benefited from. And to protect that system, they tried to overturn Democratic election results in this country using a hoax and a lot of lying, and a ton of hysteria and shouting and accusations. They've been caught doing that. There really ought to be some penalty for what they did. Let's hope there is.

Well, the same reason he ran for mayor of New York -- narcissism. Bill de Blasio represents the worst strain of American liberalism -- smug, arrogant, utterly hypocritical and lacking in self-awareness. This is the man who announced his own green deal, but then took a helicopter to the gym.

He wants to take apart the best schools in the city, which, you know, you get in to through a simple admissions test. And, you know, he thinks that the test needs to be abolished, because there aren't enough minorities in it supposedly. Although they're more than 50 percent Asian. There's been a series of anti-Semitic attacks in Brooklyn, which he has blamed on white supremacy and President Trump, even though everyone knows that these are not committed by white supremacists. They're committed by largely, you know, black teenagers, and in a few cases, like an Arab taxi driver. Ethically, he's got -- he is somewhat ethically challenged. He has run City Hall like a ticket booth where his donors come in to, you know, file their donations and then his consultants come and collect them on the other end. He had -- there's two people -- and there's people in two different Federal jurisdictions, the Eastern and Southern District of New York who are going to prison for bribing Bill de Blasio or people under him.

But the thing here, Tucker is, you know the bar for entry in the Democratic primary is now so low. So if you look at De Blasio, all his life, he's had -- being Mayor of New York is like the third most important position in America. People like Mario Cuomo -- all their career -- were talked about his presidential material. De Blasio switches on the TV and he sees the Mayor of some town called South Bend, Indiana is running for President. South Bend Indiana has 100,000 people give or take. New York City has 100,000 people who are homeless and that's actually not an exaggeration. It has as many homeless people as South Bend has non-homeless people. And from de Blasio's point of view, the problem for his campaign is that every single one of those homeless people on the streets of New York is polling higher than de Blasio in Iowa and New Hampshire right now."

      "utterance": "Well, speaking of that worldview, the company that administers the SAT has a new test. It does not measure what you know, it measures who you are. It's a privilege test. We will tell you what it entails after the break."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The College Board is adding a new score to the SAT. It doesn't measure aptitude in reading or grammar or Math or any other academic subject. Instead, the new category is called an adversity score. It will rate students from zero to 100 based on how much privilege the College Board believes they have. The formula for all this is secret. Of course, the people who came with it know that it's pure pseudoscience, and would never withstand public scrutiny, so they're hiding it. But according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the test will calculate privilege based on 15 different factors. Some will draw a neighborhood statistics like the crime rate, poverty, home values, a student's high school will supply other factors like estimated curricular rigor, and free lunch rate. And then there are factors that look at a student's own family. Factors like household income, and whether both parents live at home. This is a pure inversion of the intent of the SAT. From the first day, the whole point of the test of the SAT was that your background didn't matter. The SAT was devised to create as level a playing field as possible. Everybody took the same test, grading was blind. It didn't matter where you came from. Nobody thought the SAT was going to make everyone the same. That's impossible. People are not the same. Some people have natural advantages, including on standardized tests, and always will. You can't change that, unfortunately, any more than you could make everyone tall enough to play in the NBA. What you can do and what you must do is ensure fairness. Everyone deserves to have the same rights. Everyone should have the same standards and be held to them in the same way. That's the most basic promise of America. The College Board is explicitly rejecting this. On the new SAT, it isn't ability that matters, it's where you rank on the privilege hierarchy, and it's not hard to imagine the perverse effects of this. Under the new standards, if you worked hard and stayed married for the sake of your children, your kids will be punished for that. David Coleman is the left-wing social engineer who runs the College Board. You won't be surprised to know he is also the genius behind Common Core. He says the new standards are designed to address quote, \"disparities of wealth\" reflected in the SAT, but it doesn't take a perfect SAT score to guess who is going to lose under the system. It's who always loses -- the middle class. They've been told that America is a meritocracy. Work hard, sacrifice for your kids, and you will be rewarded. But people like David Coleman know that's not true. They know it because they make the rules. They benefit from the corruption of the system. They pad their own kids' applications with phony extra-curriculars. They make up some new heritage so they can benefit from the Jim Crow system of racial discrimination we have on college campuses. The new SAT will only increase the opportunities to game the system. For example, the College Board plans to evaluate privilege based on home address. Well parents already use fake addresses to send their kids to choice public schools in many places. Why won't they use fake addresses from tough neighborhoods to give their kids an advantage in college admissions? Well, of course they will. English language proficiency, household income, family education levels, these are all factors, too. So get ready for an awful lot of lying about those subjects as well. Would it just be easier to reward the kids who know the most about English and Math? That's what you do if you cared about fairness or the future of your country. You would emphasize achievement over victimhood. Our decadent elites don't care, so they do the opposite. Heather Mac Donald is the author of the book, \"The Diversity Delusion,\" and we're happy to have her join us tonight. Heather, thanks very much for coming on. So the SAT was created to prevent exactly what the new SAT will ensure, which is a system where, where you came from matters, right?"

      "speaker": "HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Well, right. And I think what everybody needs to understand, Tucker is all of this is driven by the seemingly intractable racial achievement gap. Everything about diversity in our culture is a surrogate for that problem. If we could close the racial achievement gap and the way to do that is by changing culture, the whole discourse about diversity would go up in a puff of smoke overnight and we would never hear about this pseudo-scientific concept again. The idea that it's privilege that drives SAT scores and academic success generally, as opposed to hard work, persistence and self-discipline is completely ludicrous. We see every year in New York City that Asian kids from poor immigrant backgrounds, whoop everybody's ass, regardless of their income levels, because their families, their parents are so relentlessly focused on their student academic involvement. That is what is necessary to close the academic achievement gap and until you get rid of the acting white syndrome that stigmatizes academic achievement on the part of black students, unless we get rid of the preferences that black students know about, that sends the message that they don't need to work as hard in order to get admitted to highly selective schools over their non-student of color peers with better scores, we're not going to close that academic achievement gap and we're going to be saddled with this scourge of diversity, which is simply a way to dismantle precisely the colorblind meritocratic standards that are a key to any society's success."

      "utterance": "Well, it's too bad because the College Board has actually resisted for decades the charge that the SAT is simply a function of white privilege, but it's not surprising. The only thing surprising is that they've held out this long. The fact that he has caved and is now throwing the College Board in full speed ahead into the excuse making grievance industry is simply what you would expect from anybody involved in higher education in this country. So again, all of this -- all of this is driven by the fact that there's a standard deviation of difference in SAT scores between blacks and whites, a difference that is not determined by a family income. In fact, according to \"The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,\" whites from households that make $10,000.00 or less, on average score better than black students on the SAT who come from households making $80,000.00 to $100,000.00. So again, Tucker, this is all about culture and for the College Board to be getting behind the idea that it's about white privilege is completely fallacious and a tragic disservice to the country."

Model and Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Emily Ratajkowski says the laws will perpetuate, quote, \"The industrial prison complex by preventing black women from getting abortions.\" Those are her words.

It does not add up to the number of blacks that are killed by abortion.

She was somebody who preached eugenics. She wanted to see that certain undesirable people were weeded out of the populace, and while they pretend they no longer espouse that that is exactly what they're doing. It is offensive. It is genocidal in many respects, but we're all instructed to turn a blind eye. The reason you are seeing all of this legislation now in states across America is because the more we know medically, the more we know scientifically, the more it is clear that we are killing human beings who do not have any voice and people are appropriately outraged."

People in Planned Parenthood, they think that it's inappropriate to be able to defend those who can't defend themselves. It is highly racist. The abortion industry intentionally targets people of color. This should be an outrage to people.

Some hold jobs. One woman bought a boat for 15 grand because rent for a studio apartment had grown to $3,000.00 a month. Do the math, it'll pay for itself in less than half a year. It might sound like an adventure, but it's also third world. Just like tent camps, most boats are not designed to be lived on permanently. During storms, they can endanger lives and cause damage -- huge amounts of damage -- these flotillas are illegal, by the way, but just like exploding housing prices, Bay Area government doesn't seem very interested in it or serious about fixing it. Whether it's San Francisco or New York or Seattle, when you think of homelessness, you think of major cities. But the homeless crisis is not limited to big population centers.

To get a sense of the scale of the problem, we drove to Eugene in the central part of the state. Eugene is a college town with a politics to match. Not surprisingly, it has an enormous homeless population. Ultimately, however, even the generosity of a place like Eugene has limits. On the night we arrived, multiple people were living in this makeshift structure. Two days later, the city had cleared the sidewalk and put up notices that it was going to scrap the belongings inside. Eugene is trying to get a handle on its homeless problem, but there are roadblocks. A major one, a ruling by the Federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that has declared it is somehow unconstitutional to shoo away homeless people if there's no place for them to go. Eugene's leaders have responded by trying to erect tent cities on public land. One proposal envisioned building a homeless encampment in a parking lot at the center of downtown.

      "utterance": "That's former Ohio Governor, John Kasich. He fell early and very hard for the Russia hoax. Two years later, he still has not recovered from that. He is still yammering on about Russia, much to the embarrassment of his friends. It makes you think that Kasich and his staff must be true believers. They must really think that Russia is an existential threat to our democracy. But of course they don't really think that, they're lying. We know that because last month, John Kasich's closest adviser, John Weaver, signed a $350,000.00 contract with a subsidiary of -- wait for it - - Russia's state-owned a nuclear power company. John Weaver also registered as a foreign agent to lobby against sanctions on Russia. Keep in mind that just a few months ago like his partner, John Kasich, Weaver was accusing the President of betraying his country to work for Russia, which is precisely what John Weaver himself is now doing. Pause and let the irony sink in, marinate in it for a moment. Well, tonight, John Weaver is pledging to be ashamed of all of that, as if he is capable of shame. The rest of us should understand the John Weaver never cared about Russia. None of these people did. John Kasich, Bill Kristol -- the rest of them -- all the hysterics on Twitter, it was all fake. It had nothing to do with Russia. What they cared about was preserving a system that they benefited from. And to protect that system, they tried to overturn Democratic election results in this country using a hoax and a lot of lying, and a ton of hysteria and shouting and accusations. They've been caught doing that. There really ought to be some penalty for what they did. Let's hope there is. Well, on a much happier note, it is time now for the \"Friend Zone.\" We bring in one of our friends here at Fox on to the program. Shannon Bream works two doors down. She hosts the 11:00 p.m. hour every night. She is also a terrific writer. She has a new book out this week and not unlike Ed Henry's book we told you about last night, this book actually exists. It's called \"Finding the Bright Side: The Art of Chasing What Matters.\" We're proud to have Shannon Bream join us tonight. Hey, Shannon."

I mean, it's a constant refocusing on the things that are actually of significance -- your relationships, your faith -- whatever that may be. So for me, that's really what it is. And sometimes you get your eyes off the real prize, and it's easy to be distracted in this world."

I've always been into that. But when I was in college, my dad who has passed away now, he was a Marine. He was an undercover cop. He was a tough guy. And he said, \"Listen, you're going to law school or med school, you pick one.\" And that's it. And I knew that he wanted me to have a good financial foundation. But he didn't think of journalism as a real job. He thought it was sort of more like \"Entertainment Tonight\" or something."

But I never got over this kind of news junkie thing. It was always there. So I made some crazy changes. I became an intern at a news station, a local news station at 29. I was \"grandma intern,\" and everyone else there was 20, who was interning, but I made coffee and I worked overnights and I learned the business from the ground up. I made a lot of mistakes, but I loved it. And that passion has never going away."

And if you're a little bit ADD, which I am, I mean, we're always learning new topics, meeting new people change -- you know, learning new policies. So for me, it's a wonderful job. I hated being a lawyer. I'm not going to lie. So I don't miss that at all, which is kind of just the truth. But I'm so excited every day when I get up and I come here to work, to work with people like you and to get to chase stories. It's endlessly fascinating to me, and I really do love it."

      "utterance": "I would say getting fired from my first TV job -- it was rather unexpected. I was told I am the worst person on TV and I would never make it in this business. That was very painful and humiliating. But it keeps you humble, which is an important part of the book as well. It's good to stay there."

The new guy came in and was like, \"What was that dude thinking?\" So there have been some serious valleys along the way. But you know what? If you're passionate about something, just stick with it. Because for every person who tells you, you know, keep going until you get to that one person who sees some kind of glimmer in you that you actually can pursue your passions and make your dreams come true."
