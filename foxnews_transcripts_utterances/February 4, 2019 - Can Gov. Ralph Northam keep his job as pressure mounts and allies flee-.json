But I do think that after a week that we had last week, where we had literally the governor talking about what to do in the situation of performing an abortion on the day of delivering a child, it's shocking the silence that we got from national Democrats and a large portion of the media ignoring that. But then literally just two days later, these old racist, offensive pictures emerged and then suddenly the media turns on it and the Democrats across the country turn on. And I think that in a lot of ways, and I think that it's very important to remember at this moment that it was just a year and a half ago that Ralph Northam took part in weaponizing racial politics that is the downfall of this country, that Ralph Northam actually accused Ed Gillespie of being a racist and tying him to that horrible situation in Charlottesville, all for political points.

He has got to dig in and he's got to stay because he is saying if I resign, I'm admitting I did this thing which everybody agrees is disqualifying. And as soon as he leaves office, he's admitting it. So this is a guy who is digging in, and he's going to stay there. And quite frankly, I don't blame him. At this point, he screwed up Friday to a fare-thee-well. From pen to post he did that wrong in every way possible."

Legally he can continue to be governor, but he can no longer govern. Politicians can survive scandals. Bill Clinton did, Donald Trump did, but they did that by maintaining the support of their base, and he lost the support of just about every Democrat in America."

      "utterance": "Absolutely not. And I think Ralph misspoke on that. No Democrat I know is for infanticide. None, none. I just don't know of anyone who was for it. He was speaking as a doctor, and what he was trying to say, I'll be honest with you, is inartful, and that is not who he is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So that was another element to the story. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, it was. And of course, that is different from what Dr. Northam was saying, which is that his words were ripped out of context. Terry McAuliffe was clearly saying right there that, no, actually, it really did sound like you were talking about infanticide, and I think any reasonable person listening to that would have agreed to that. But I do think that after a week that we had last week, where we had literally the governor talking about what to do in the situation of performing an abortion on the day of delivering a child, it's shocking the silence that we got from national Democrats and a large portion of the media ignoring that. But then literally just two days later, these old racist, offensive pictures emerged and then suddenly the media turns on it and the Democrats across the country turn on. And I think that in a lot of ways, and I think that it's very important to remember at this moment that it was just a year and a half ago that Ralph Northam took part in weaponizing racial politics that is the downfall of this country, that Ralph Northam actually accused Ed Gillespie of being a racist and tying him to that horrible situation in Charlottesville, all for political points. And so I think it's kind of interesting to keep that in mind. And to me, that is an unforgivable thing in politics."

And when Kirsten Gillibrand and other female Democrats said, no, we have a zero tolerance policy and you have got to go, the civic religion of the Democrat party is anti-racism and feminism. These are the most important moral issues for Democrats, and they can't cede any ground on this stuff. But I would just say, this is why rule by mob doesn't work. There was a collective decision reached on social media on Friday about Ralph Northam and what happen and what this is, and he must go. And everybody gets there statement out to get on the pile. I bet now Democrats wish, especially with these allegations against Fairfax, I bet the Democrats wished they had left a little more wiggle room on this one to see how it played out."

I am stunned he has survived this long, so perhaps I'll be wrong, but it seems to me he is in a politically untenable situation where everybody from the two Democratic senators from his home state, neither of them are grandstanders, have called for him to resign, the speaker of the House, the former vice-president.
