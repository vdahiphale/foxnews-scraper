But you look at these images from this trip so far, A.B., and you have the meeting with the Saudis, you have the stop in Israel and the Western Wall and the meeting with the Pope, three major religions, and the images of this trip so far. Your thoughts?"

      "utterance": "I think it's gone very well for the president, and I think it was very ambitious, high risk but high reward. Bad things could have happened, some stumbles, but they didn't. The planning was done in advance, which is really important. And a lot of people had a lot of doubts about what would be arranged in advance, what the front work would be, what they'd show up in Saudi Arabia with, how they'd pull it off. The speech was well-written there, and the other speeches. It really is interesting. He was dreading it and wanted to cut the trip back from nine days to five and he really seems in his element."

      "utterance": "Look, I understand the theme, the three great religions, trying to tie them all together to make it look somewhat nonpolitical. But the real story is not the Vatican, it's not even the Israeli trip. It is the realignment of American policy over Iran, getting the 50 Sunni nations lined up with Saudi Arabia. This is a new day in the Middle East and it's going to have reverberations for many years. That's the story. It's a new Middle East right now. America is back. That's the story, and the consequences are going to be immense."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yes, one of the more interesting things that came out today was that Donald Trump is actually getting these nations to lay out exactly how they are going to get to their two percent commitment that they've already agreed to do. That is something that not only President Obama didn't get done but something that presidents going back to Reagan have tried to accomplish and have been unable to accomplish. So we are getting some indication that countries are taking it more seriously, and they should, because if they claim that Russian is such a big threat, they should actually align their budgets and their defense positions to match what they're claiming.
