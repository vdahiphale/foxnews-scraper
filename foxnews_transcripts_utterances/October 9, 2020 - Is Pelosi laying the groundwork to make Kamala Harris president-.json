Bush, as his VP. Could you have seen a scenario where Bush would have immediately, under the Pelosi idea of the 25th Amendment, would immediately started to undermine Reagan from the outset, under the scenario, you don't even want to tempt a vice president, tempt him with something like this or her.

Since BLM's ethos ran contra to his Christian faith, Beathard took the sign down and replaced it with one that said all lives matter to our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

The press should force him to answer this question. Joe what do you think. But I'm not going to hold my breath. Now, this isn't the first time Democrats have invoked the 25th Amendment and it won't be the last. So, what does the amendment actually say about removing a sitting president. Well, here you go. Whenever the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of other such body as Congress may by law provide transmit to the president pro tempore of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Reps, their written declaration that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the vice president shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president. Now remember, this amendment was passed initially in the Cold War years when Congress was worried about the president being in let's say a coma, if a nuclear war broke out and then the JFK assassination validated those fears for a lot of Americans.

This is really important is putting the power to remove the sitting president in the hands of an unelected 17-member commission and the vice president. Eight would be medical professionals, medical deep state and another eight would be former executive branch officials including former presidents. Now both Democrats and Republicans would be able to appoint an equal number of members who would then those 16 choose the 17th member to chair the committee. So, in theory this all sounds really bipartisan and fair, but in reality this means the committee will be stacked with liberal or mostly establishment types and then shared like the 17th member, chaired by someone like, let's say, a Colin Powell or Barack Obama or even Hillary Clinton. You know where that will go? Well, this is the Left's version of a somewhat like a Soviet Politburo that can exercise total control over the White House by continually dangling the threat of the president being declared unfit for office. And don't think for a second that the VP will always act as a check on this, I was thinking about my old boss, Ronald Reagan today. Now, he was an outsider. He ran as the anti-establishment candidate in 1976 and ultimately won the nomination against George Herbert Walker Bush in 1980. He picked the establishment guy, George H.W. Bush, as his VP. Could you have seen a scenario where Bush would have immediately, under the Pelosi idea of the 25th Amendment, would immediately started to undermine Reagan from the outset, under the scenario, you don't even want to tempt a vice president, tempt him with something like this or her. It is glaringly obvious how dangerous this would be to our system of government, so much so that even CNN, I love this, is begging Pelosi change course now."

They don't want to be primaried by the gang of radicals. So, if you tonight have a Democrat representing you and your district or who is running as a so-called moderate against an incumbent, remember, this is what you're supporting, what Pelosi pushed today, the complete undermining of our electoral process. Look at what they're already planning. They're going to pack the courts; they're going to pack the House and Senate with D.C. statehood and maybe other places as well. They'll cede control over our borders, total open borders, trade, energy, health policies. They'll give all that decision making to a lot of international bodies.

And now, they want to make sure that nothing like that happens again and they want to dissuade another populist, another true rebel from taking office or even running for office. This will likely go the way of Peter Strzok's insurance policy, though. Remember, they thought the deep state in the media would be enough to take out Trump, but it wasn't. Now, this is their new insurance policy, the 25th Amendment. This will just create continual constitutional crises and a permanent state of chaos, which is exactly what the Democrats want. All designed to get you to just be so fed up that you give up on America. But we will not do that. Big mistake, Nancy, and that's the angle. Joining me now is Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at the Federalist. Both are Fox News contributors. Mollie let's start with you. And we talked about this the other night when you were on just like packing the court, the press has to ask these questions about whether Biden and his campaign, do they agree with this move and not let them get away with saying, well, I'll tell you when I get elected."

      "utterance": "There's this contradiction between what the media claimed the Biden campaign is about, which they claim it's moderate and a return to normalcy and what's actually happening in the Democratic Party, as you laid out with this 25th Amendment plan. I think Nancy Pelosi was trying to highlight that President Trump had recently been in the hospital and it wasn't meant to be as serious as it's being taken. And instead it's highlighting other problems for her, such as that. Joe Biden picked a vice presidential candidate who does not seem particularly loyal to him and that people could envision someone like Kamala Harris quickly using something like this in order to gain the presidency. But that 25th Amendment discussion has been very damaging. And it actually goes back to the very first week of the Trump administration when the Atlantic published something about using it to oust President Trump and the media and Democratic figures just keep revisiting it over and over again as part of their inability to accept the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election, to accept that Americans chose as their president Donald Trump, and to do everything in their power to fight it."

      "utterance": "Well, first and foremost, Laura, I think we need the exact same commission for future speakers, male or female, who get set up by their hairdressers. Anybody who can't control their hair dressing, we've got to have a commission look at whether they are capable of being a speaker. It's a very hairy job and you have to be good at it. Look, this is how meaningless this exercise is today. She's left something out and it's called the Constitution. Under the Constitution, if somebody deems that the president is unfit for office under the 25th Amendment, they seek to remove them either by congressional act or by half the cabinet saying he should be removed. The president under the Constitution, then replies in writing and says, no, I am capable of serving. Once the president replies and says that, it takes two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate to remove the president. It's a higher, harder bar than impeachment. So, this one is even passed Nancy Pelosi's house. If they tried to do this to a president, at least to President Trump. So, it's a completely meaningless exercise. It's bad politics. I really don't get why she did this and then exempts Trump from it. It's just weird. It does make you think does this apply to Biden and Harris and asked for this transfer of power? She took both sides of it. And so, the press does have to dig in. What she says doesn't make sense."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to get your thoughts on this too. There's another controversy regarding the next debate., moderator, C-SPAN's Steve Scully. Now on Twitter, Scully openly asked Trump hater Anthony Scaramucci, should I respond to Trump after the president questioned whether or not Scully was nonpartisan? So, everyone speculated that if he meant to send it as a private message. But here's how the debate commission responded. They said Steve Scully did not originate the tweet and believes his account has been hacked. The Commission on Presidential Debates has stated publicly that the tweet was not sent by Scully himself and investigating it with the help of authorities. Mollie, this controversy aside, doesn't this call into question the entire notion of this presidential debate commission, given the fact that Republicans always seem to get hosed on the moderators?"

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "The presidential debate commission has had a horrible year. And another thing that happened today is that former presidential candidate Bob Dole said that he knows that the commission is supposed to be bipartisan and he knows all the Republicans that are associated with it. He doesn't know any of them who support Trump, and he thinks that is unfair, that was a brave thing for him to come out and say that. And this is an issue that you're talking about earlier when the establishment is all on one side of an issue that is not good for the American people. This debate commission has not done a good job of reflecting the current moment of hosting debates where people can actually talk about where, what they believe, how they differ from other people. And in part, I think it's just because it's somewhat antiquated and they haven't freshened up who's advising them and also who is on their board might not represent actual voters in any meaningful sense. They need to do something drastic. They need to do if they if they want to have any role in the future. And they are really behaving poorly right now."

What was your reaction when Joe Biden said blacks don't have diversity? She didn't pick up on any of Biden's dumb statements and whole Kamala Harris account for them. And that's my beef with these reporters. They come from the same liberal mindset, which is where Republicans are always put on the defensive for the things that they do and say, Democrats get a pass. And if the debate commission keeps serving it up that way and they don't go to alternative media, which today's era where full of. Then I really do think the debate commission's usefulness comes into question, it'll be hard to replace them for a bunch of reasons, but their fundamental mission, they need to re- examine."

We're going to show you how it's handed unchecked power to governments now across the globe. Plus, one of the country's top infectious disease experts is here.

Well, the article in The Guardian paints a vivid picture of where over-the-top COVID panic could take us. Surveillance tools and technology such as fever detection, goggles and drones that monitor curfews and lockdowns and apps that do track the spread of COVID are already being deployed as part of permanent laws and countries including Cambodia, China, of course, Pakistan and Thailand. Joining me now is Wesley Smith, Discovery Institute Senior Fellow and National Review Contributor. Wesley, people kind of - well, they criticized the angle heavily back in April and May when we started to raise the warning flag about the tracking apps.

You find now that there is a great deal of push for mandates by government. And part of this is not just government, but you're going to have the private sector also enforcing these issues. For example, there was an article on August 6th in the USA Today by three very prominent bioethicists calling for a mandatory vaccine. And let me read just real quickly, a few of the things that they said would be required. And this is a quote, vaccine refusers could lose tax credits or be denied non-essential government services, health insurers could levy higher premiums. You wouldn't be able to go into private businesses unless you showed your vaccine papers. This is advocacy, preparing the ground for that kind of a draconian and I would have to say, soft authoritarian type of existence enforced by the private sector. And then you have Dr. Anthony Fauci. Now, I've never been in the anti- Anthony Fauci chorus, but then he wrote a piece in a science journal. He co-authored it in a journal called Cell. And he is saying--"

We have to change our water systems. We have to change the way we travel and that kind of thing. It's just the most remarkable call for an authoritarian imposition internationally.

And so, this would be a permanent condition because supposedly we're entering into the era of pandemics and this is how we're going to have to live to try to keep safe. I don't want to be a surf.

Thank you so much. It's great to see you tonight. Two media stories, two miraculous stories of COVID recovery. Now, if you're looking for info on the treatment that saved the lives in these incredible tales, don't count on the press. The write ups in The Washington Post and a local New Jersey paper credit the power of prayer. Believe me, we're all for the power of prayer and a little luck. But my next guest says that's not the whole story and says that the media, well, they're covering up the fact that those people, those patients made their stunning recoveries while taking the drug hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Stephen Smith, founder of the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health, the man behind those two life-saving treatments joins me now. Dr. Smith, what's the motivation for leaving out the fact in these media accounts that both patients were put on doses of HCQ?"

We use hydroxychloroquine to them in New Jersey, the New Jersey news one and the third one actually were seen by another team first, infectious disease team. I can't really imagine why. I mean, the piece in The Washington Post that the patient I went to bat for and put my career on the line for. That's the patient I referred to earlier when I talked about having fights about with the administration at the hospital I was working at and having fights with them about using the dose recommended by the French group. They wanted me to stop it after 24 milligrams of hydroxychloroquine. I don't know the motivation. I can't speak to it. I can tell you that in the lap of the articles photo, half of those people never saw the patient. It was actually - the reward of course, of being a doctor is not press and you know the name Mike Smith. I don't really care about my name being out there. I do care that they're not talking about the truth. And the truth is that woman and the other two patients were men, both got high doses of hydroxychloroquine."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They both got high doses of hydroxychloroquine, they both recovered, neither fact was reported in the press. Now, Dr. Smith, the New England Journal of Medicine just released a study claiming that among patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at the baseline, those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. In other words, another negative study supposedly or review of hydroxy. Your response?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's the recovery trial, that's the Great Britain trial, that's a trial that got all the fanfare when it came out saying dexamethasone saves lives. That same study on the dexamethasone part of it said that if you were on oxygen and you got dexamethasone, you did worse, physically, significantly worse. That's inconsistent. It doesn't make sense to me. So those problems with the coverage and I'm trying to figure them out. But I do also know they did not use azithromycin, which we try to use on our patients. Not all our patients get azithromycin because the doctors won't give it if the patient is in the ICU. They'll sometimes restrict the use of azithromycin. But I was stunned by that, they have inconsistent results. And our results are not inconsistent, and I'll show those data in full later, but we know that patients that get hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin at a higher dose. I said high dose. I should correct that. The dose that is recommended by the French regimen and the dose that we use for a total dose is much lower than any lupus takes in one month. And they take it --"

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Again, Dr. Smith, and also these people in this recovery study were given the hydroxychloroquine late in the disease. They were already mechanically being ventilated. So everyone has to understand, as a prophylaxis or early after you test positive or early, that's where people had seen better results. Obviously, Dr. Smith, that's where you see the best result. People have to understand what they're looking at. I've got to tell you another thing, Dr. Smith, I'm so glad you're on tonight, because the media are refusing to report good news about the recent trends we're seeing for COVID. For example, according to the CDC's latest figures, COVID hospitalizations are decreasing, we're putting it up on the screen, for all age groups, especially for those 65 years and over. Look at this. What does this tell you about where we are with the pandemic? Look at those lines for every age group, and especially the older Americans, Dr. Smith?"

      "utterance": "Are Christian athletes and coaches the next targets for the Black Lives Matter movement? If that seems farfetched, this shocking story may change her mind. A few weeks ago, Illinois State football coach Kurt Beathard, son of the legendary Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard, discovered a BLM sign taped to his office door. Since BLM's ethos ran contra to his Christian faith, Beathard took the sign down and replaced it with one that said all lives matter to our lord and savior Jesus Christ. It's a beautiful message to most, but this was hate speech according to BLM radicals. Of course it was. After a sustained pressure campaign, Beathard lost his coaching position. Joining me now is Jason Whitlock, partner and columnist at the fabulous \"Outkick\" . Jason, it wasn't too long ago that outward shows of faith were commonplace among athletes and coaches. So is this now a Black Lives Matter chilling effect on that expression? JASON WHITLOCK, PARTNER AND COLUMNIST, \"OUTKICK\": No question about it, Laura. And this has been the intent of Black Lives Matter from the very beginning. We're seeing reshape right before our eyes the hostility towards Christianity is overtaking the sports world, and Kurt Beathard is paying the price."

      "utterance": "Isn't it the case that in all kind of Bolshevik or Marxist takeovers, you have to take out faith, because the faith has to reside, Travis, only in government. So the government is the almighty. The government becomes the orthodoxy. And that orthodoxy can't be challenged by anything higher, which in this case is our savior Christ the Lord. That's to whom the Christian's answer, not to the heads of BLM."

      "utterance": "If you want to usher in immorality, you have to usher out God. And that's what's happening in America. And it's a calculated, it's not an organic deal. This has been underway for years. Look at just what, look at the immorality as it relates to Kurt Beathard. His wife died this summer of cancer. His nephew was shot and killed here in Nashville, Tennessee, outside of a bar. In what society does an employer, looking at an employee that lost his wife and his nephew in the past few months, fires the guy, removes him from his job because he expresses his Christian faith and does something objectionable to what's popular now, this Black Lives Matter movement? What Illinois state has done here is immoral. You have got to usher out God to usher in immorality."

      "utterance": "He potentially could be. He's probably their biggest target. He is a very traditional faith-based coach right in line with Tom Landry, former coach of the Dallas Cowboys, Vince Lombardi with the Packers, Joe Gibbs with the Washington Redskins, Tom Osborne with Nebraska. Dabo Swinney is the next iteration of that. He wears his faith on his sleeve. They're going to eventually have a problem. And his team is highly successful. Other than Alabama, it's the most successful program in college football, and the guy is doing it from a faith-based point of view and perspective. He will eventually come under attack."
