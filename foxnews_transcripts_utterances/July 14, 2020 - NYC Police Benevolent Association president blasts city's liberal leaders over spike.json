      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Breaking big tonight, a lot of news. Big new promising developments from America's search for a coronavirus vaccine. Just had a talk with a very prominent medical doctor who is more than optimistic. We will share this good news with you tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, buckle up, we are now just 112 days away what has now merged into the single biggest choice election in modern American history. Not an exaggeration, not hyperbole. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If -- let's see, look at Joe's team. If Joe Biden wins, he has the strength and stamina and mental alertness to do the job, if he implements the extreme agenda that he's now embracing, let me be clear -- America as you know it, we know it, will be destroyed. Our entire way of life will be flushed down the drain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If the issue of law and order security and safety, if that matters to you and to your family, if free-market capitalism matters to you and your family, if our Constitution, the rule of law matters to you, here's what you need to know -- in 112 days, you are the ultimate jury. Joe Biden doesn't, well, really have any original ideas. He never has. He's been in the swamp 50-plus years. It's 50 years of elect me and I'll do this. I'll do this. The president says all talk, talk, talk, no action. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden alone, 125 combined years of elect me and I'll promise this, this, and this -- nothing but 125 years of meaningless promises and unmitigated failure. Oh, and on Biden's part, lots of plagiarism. Remember he was accused of plagiarizing a paper in law school. 1980s, many of his speeches were plagiarized. He was accused of plagiarizing Robert Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, British MP Neil Kinnock. We played that for you last week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the scary part is Biden has taken his cues from the most radical, the most extreme socialist, extremist that this party has ever embraced -- the Democratic, modern, socialist party. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at the corrupt forgetful Joe Biden team. You've got Biden, Schumer, Pelosi -- that's 125 years of, well, failure alone. Now add to that Bernie Sanders, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Beto Bozo O'Rourke, gun czar. His latest policy proposals were literally authored by the devout socialist Bernie Sanders. And Joe even plagiarized Bernie's agenda literally in many instances word for word right out of Bolshevik Bernie's a socialist platform. Now, keep in mind, Bernie wants the government to control all means of production. He wants to nationalize industries like they did in Venezuela and Cuba. He has praised those regimes. And, by the way, honeymoon and the former Soviet Union. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, socialist Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she's in charge of Biden's climate task force and she wants to ban oil, gas, coal, air travel, and eventually even cows, says we have 12 years and it's all over. Her Green New Deal will cost $94 trillion over 10 years. That will turn America into a socialist bankrupt hellhole. And then, of course, there's Biden's gun-control czar, Beto Bozo O'Rourke whose top priority is to literally take your guns away. This is what's at stake in 112 days. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Beto Bozo, he's coming for your guns. And, by the way, he also has Schumer and Pelosi in Congress. This is his team? Right there? Add Beto and add AOC. They win and you can start singing bye-bye Miss American pie because it's over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What's next? Is he going to tap -- let's see -- the ever incompetent Cuomo to, what, lead his coronavirus task force?

In other words, he's embraced the \"defund the police\" movement. He's the guy that said last week, police have now become the enemy. In New York City, Comrade de Blasio, already slash the NYPD budget by a billion dollars. He has disbanded the uncovered, the most effective anti- crime unit in the city. He's banned all stop and frisk. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, New York Governor Cuomo, while he's the genius that let thousands of violent criminals out of jail every single time with his idiotic zero dollar bail policy. And as a result, what are we seeing? Shootings in New York City and New York state, they have more than doubled over the last year. On Monday, at least 17 people shot, that includes three drive-by shootings. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At one point over the weekend, there was a shooting every single hour. And last night, we brought you Lawrence Jones' heart-wrenching interview with the family of their 1-year-old baby boy who was shot and killed. He was in a stroller. He was in a playground in Brooklyn. Now, this violence is unacceptable. It comes as police all over the country now are under attack. Since May, 12 police officers have now been killed in the line of duty. Two were murdered over the weekend in Texas while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Over 1,000 other police officers seriously injured, rocks, and bottles, and bricks, and Molotov cocktails, knives and guns being used against them. The chaos, the carnage in America's big liberal cities, it's out of control. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, if you want a preview of coming attractions, that will be America with Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Schumer, and Beto. That's your choice. We can't make it anymore clear. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You are the ultimate jury. So do you want in 112 days law in order to be restored or do you wanted to get worse? Because Biden wants to defund the police and abolish cash bail just like they did in New York. He's come a long way from calling people predators and, you know, while saying under incendiary things on racial issues, like he didn't want his kids in a racial jungle if we're talking about integration. He used those words. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Like I said at the top, this is now become the single biggest greatest choice election in our lifetime, on every single important issue that will impact your kids, your life, and your grandkids. Do you want Biden's plans for open borders, for amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America? The minute you get into America, you get absolutely free health care, free, free, free -- free schools for every illegal immigrant and amnesty. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Or do you prefer border security? Four hundred miles of border wall will be built by Election Day. You get to decide. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want Biden's tax increases that he is promising? Or do you prefer lower taxes that Donald Trump is promising? Do you want Biden's Green New Deal madness or President Trump -- let's see, he's made this country energy independent for the first time in over 75 years. And he's also made it for the first time in 75 years, we are now the world's number one producer of energy. Do you want that or do you want to ban coal and fracking and oil production? Do you want Biden's activist judges, legislating for the bench, do you want to stack the courts like, well, Democrats have been talking about, or do you prefer constitutionalist, those that believe that's the fundamental rule of law for the United States of America? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want socialized health care? Do you want to keep your private health care? How did Obamacare/Bidencare work out for you? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want Hunter Biden making sketchy billion-dollar deals with the Bank of China, lining his own pockets or do you want a president who will actually stand up to China as this president did earlier today? Do you want zero experience Hunter making millions more in Ukraine? Quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter, oh, it worked out perfectly, didn't it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As president from said today, there's never been a time when two candidates were so different. Let's watch the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You are the jury here. Do you want America to become a place where working hard, doing the right thing is punished, mob rule, anarchy is rewarded? Because that's what Biden is now selling with his team of Pelosi, Schumer, AOC, Bernie and Bozo. Well, that's -- those are the stakes in the 112 days. You're the ultimate jury.

In 112 days, maybe early to 113 days, early in the morning, having to choke on the words \"we can now project that Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States.\" How do you think that's going to go over when you get the call that they -- we get to watch them make that call? That would be pretty amazing. We survived eight years of Obama. I don't want to go back. You know what, America was resilient. This plan is way beyond anything that's ever been proposed -- the most radical, extreme, socialist proposals in the history of this country. It will destroy the U.S. freedom that has created more wealth, more opportunity that we have used for human advancement around the world. That's all because of liberty and freedom.

That's not stopping him, though, from releasing what is a tone-deaf, out of touch poster celebrating the city's coronavirus response efforts, along with a Monday appearance on Jimmy Fallon. Cuomo's behavior is even drawing rebuke from fake news CNN. I can't believe it. I'm actually going to say something nice about our old friend, fake Jake Tapper. Take a look.",

The far left has now shifted their outrage over the prospect of reopening schools in the fall. Let me be clear: of course, the safety and security of our children is an important as anything. They are our American treasure. I say that often. There's increasing evidence that we can do this safely. \"Wall Street Journal,\" I point out to their article and a new editorial pointing out that schools have reopened in most countries including Germany, Singapore, Norway, Denmark, Finland, they have not experienced outbreaks. Remember, the cost of shutting down schools indefinitely are immense. American Pediatric Society has weighed in on the side of opening them. And the fact is we can't shut down and stay shut down forever and that will -- those with were words of Anthony Fauci. And medical expert seemed to agree. Recent report, NBC Nightly News interviewed five pediatricians all said they would send their kids back to class. Democrats, the mob, the media, they would rather turn towards hysteria, rage, politicizing. For example, even as New York City sees an uptick in cases among young adults, city officials insisting there is no connection to mass protests that are taking place across the city. Blame the churches. New York Times, others, that's what they did. They blamed the churches for the spike. Also developing tonight, an investigation in Florida has found by FOX 35, numerous labs are misreporting their COVID results -- get this -- including a failure to report any negative cases. They're saying, oh, every single person that comes in has it. OK, that's not right. Joining us now with reaction with the very latest of developments, Governor Greg Abbott. Governor, let's go -- let's go put up some charts first. I love our friends in Texas. You've been very firm and I anecdotally have said -- I'm for masks. I'm for social distancing, use of plexiglass and opening stadiums. I want it all. If I have to go to a baseball game, football game and wear a mask, I'll wear it, because I saw in New York at the height of this, I saw that it worked in my grocery store, and my drugstore.

But we can do, however, we can use these practices like will you just said and that is -- people can wear masks, we can use these other strategies to slow the spread while we are awaiting the time of when we do have these vaccines. I do however want to add one thing because I heard on your show what I hear on every show, and that is people talk about the vaccines which will be coming.

And that can lead to the serious problem. That's exactly why during this time period while we are waiting on medications, it's so important that people in Texas as elsewhere wear masks. Remember this also, Sean, this isn't just Texas and Florida. Remember -- see what's going on in California, in Louisiana, in Illinois, all of which have upticks in the number of cases.

Just had a talk with a very prominent medical doctor who is more than optimistic. We will share this good news with you tonight. And, buckle up, we are now just 112 days away what has now merged into the single biggest choice election in modern American history. Not an exaggeration, not hyperbole. If -- let's see, look at Joe's team. If Joe Biden wins, he has the strength and stamina and mental alertness to do the job, if he implements the extreme agenda that he's now embracing, let me be clear -- America as you know it, we know it, will be destroyed. Our entire way of life will be flushed down the drain. If the issue of law and order security and safety, if that matters to you and to your family, if free-market capitalism matters to you and your family, if our Constitution, the rule of law matters to you, here's what you need to know -- in 112 days, you are the ultimate jury. Joe Biden doesn't, well, really have any original ideas. He never has. He's been in the swamp 50-plus years. It's 50 years of elect me and I'll do this. I'll do this. The president says all talk, talk, talk, no action. Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden alone, 125 combined years of elect me and I'll promise this, this, and this -- nothing but 125 years of meaningless promises and unmitigated failure. Oh, and on Biden's part, lots of plagiarism. Remember he was accused of plagiarizing a paper in law school. 1980s, many of his speeches were plagiarized. He was accused of plagiarizing Robert Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, British MP Neil Kinnock. We played that for you last week. And the scary part is Biden has taken his cues from the most radical, the most extreme socialist, extremist that this party has ever embraced -- the Democratic, modern, socialist party. Look at the corrupt forgetful Joe Biden team. You've got Biden, Schumer, Pelosi -- that's 125 years of, well, failure alone. Now add to that Bernie Sanders, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Beto Bozo O'Rourke, gun czar. His latest policy proposals were literally authored by the devout socialist Bernie Sanders. And Joe even plagiarized Bernie's agenda literally in many instances word for word right out of Bolshevik Bernie's a socialist platform. Now, keep in mind, Bernie wants the government to control all means of production. He wants to nationalize industries like they did in Venezuela and Cuba. He has praised those regimes. And, by the way, honeymoon and the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, socialist Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she's in charge of Biden's climate task force and she wants to ban oil, gas, coal, air travel, and eventually even cows, says we have 12 years and it's all over. Her Green New Deal will cost $94 trillion over 10 years. That will turn America into a socialist bankrupt hellhole. And then, of course, there's Biden's gun-control czar, Beto Bozo O'Rourke whose top priority is to literally take your guns away. This is what's at stake in 112 days. Take a look."

      "utterance": "OK. To recap, Biden has tapped Bolshevik Bernie, he's even plagiarizing him, to lead his economic policies. AOC will lead the Green New Deal climate task force. Beto Bozo, he's coming for your guns. And, by the way, he also has Schumer and Pelosi in Congress. This is his team? Right there? Add Beto and add AOC. They win and you can start singing bye-bye Miss American pie because it's over. What's next? Is he going to tap -- let's see -- the ever incompetent Cuomo to, what, lead his coronavirus task force? Is he going to tap Comrade de Blasio, mayor of New York, as his law and order czar? After all, just last week, Biden in his own words, he agreed that yes, funds, should be diverted away from the police. In other words, he's embraced the \"defund the police\" movement. He's the guy that said last week, police have now become the enemy. In New York City, Comrade de Blasio, already slash the NYPD budget by a billion dollars. He has disbanded the uncovered, the most effective anti- crime unit in the city. He's banned all stop and frisk. Meanwhile, New York Governor Cuomo, while he's the genius that let thousands of violent criminals out of jail every single time with his idiotic zero dollar bail policy. And as a result, what are we seeing? Shootings in New York City and New York state, they have more than doubled over the last year. On Monday, at least 17 people shot, that includes three drive-by shootings. At one point over the weekend, there was a shooting every single hour. And last night, we brought you Lawrence Jones' heart-wrenching interview with the family of their 1-year-old baby boy who was shot and killed. He was in a stroller. He was in a playground in Brooklyn. Now, this violence is unacceptable. It comes as police all over the country now are under attack. Since May, 12 police officers have now been killed in the line of duty. Two were murdered over the weekend in Texas while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Over 1,000 other police officers seriously injured, rocks, and bottles, and bricks, and Molotov cocktails, knives and guns being used against them. The chaos, the carnage in America's big liberal cities, it's out of control. And, by the way, if you want a preview of coming attractions, that will be America with Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Schumer, and Beto. That's your choice. We can't make it anymore clear. You are the ultimate jury. So do you want in 112 days law in order to be restored or do you wanted to get worse? Because Biden wants to defund the police and abolish cash bail just like they did in New York. He's come a long way from calling people predators and, you know, while saying under incendiary things on racial issues, like he didn't want his kids in a racial jungle if we're talking about integration. He used those words. Like I said at the top, this is now become the single biggest greatest choice election in our lifetime, on every single important issue that will impact your kids, your life, and your grandkids. Do you want Biden's plans for open borders, for amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America? The minute you get into America, you get absolutely free health care, free, free, free -- free schools for every illegal immigrant and amnesty. Or do you prefer border security? Four hundred miles of border wall will be built by Election Day. You get to decide. Do you want Biden's tax increases that he is promising? Or do you prefer lower taxes that Donald Trump is promising? Do you want Biden's Green New Deal madness or President Trump -- let's see, he's made this country energy independent for the first time in over 75 years. And he's also made it for the first time in 75 years, we are now the world's number one producer of energy. Do you want that or do you want to ban coal and fracking and oil production? Do you want Biden's activist judges, legislating for the bench, do you want to stack the courts like, well, Democrats have been talking about, or do you prefer constitutionalist, those that believe that's the fundamental rule of law for the United States of America? Do you want socialized health care? Do you want to keep your private health care? How did Obamacare/Bidencare work out for you? Do you want Hunter Biden making sketchy billion-dollar deals with the Bank of China, lining his own pockets or do you want a president who will actually stand up to China as this president did earlier today? Do you want zero experience Hunter making millions more in Ukraine? Quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter, oh, it worked out perfectly, didn't it? As president from said today, there's never been a time when two candidates were so different. Let's watch the president."

Because that's what Biden is now selling with his team of Pelosi, Schumer, AOC, Bernie and Bozo. Well, that's -- those are the stakes in the 112 days. You're the ultimate jury. You get to shock the world again and you get to stop what they want to do to this country from happening. You know, it would certainly be worthwhile just for the pure entertainment purposes to watch the fake news media mob in this country, I'm just thinking out loud. In 112 days, maybe early to 113 days, early in the morning, having to choke on the words \"we can now project that Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States.\" How do you think that's going to go over when you get the call that they -- we get to watch them make that call? That would be pretty amazing. We survived eight years of Obama. I don't want to go back. You know what, America was resilient. This plan is way beyond anything that's ever been proposed -- the most radical, extreme, socialist proposals in the history of this country. It will destroy the U.S. freedom that has created more wealth, more opportunity that we have used for human advancement around the world. That's all because of liberty and freedom. And every time you get a false promise of security, you give up your freedoms. Here with more, Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones. Lawrence, I got a lot of reaction.

Well, this administration decided that's not good. They demonize police officers. They've changed the rules where it's impossible to do our job and the criminals take advantage of that. When a criminal hears from city hall there's going to be a soft touch on crime, they know exactly what that means.

Donald Trump, I've never seen one politician more successful in three and a half years in my entire lifetime. But 112 days, I've never seen a clear choice for the American people. How do you assess this race at this point? PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX & FRIENDS\" WEEKEND CO-HOST: No president has had to take on what Donald Trump has had to take on. He's in a great place number one because of what he's done and what he stood for, the way he has taught Americans, Republicans, conservatives, his supporters, how to fight, how to expose the left-wing mob and how to be totally unapologetic with what he believes in. The other benefit he has is that Joe Biden is a fundamentally unserious human being who is completely captured by left-wing interests who are driving his agenda, totally detached from the safety and security and economic prospects of average Americans. The president needs to drive the narrative he talked about today. Where was Joe Biden when jobs were going to China? Where was Joe Biden when our border was wide open? Where -- all the things he says he represents that sound middle-of-the-road, he's making up and he had four years to do it if he wanted to. Donald Trump did it in three, three and a half years.

      "utterance": "The poster includes references to his daughters and a boyfriend, little inside jokes. There are no illustrations however of the more than 32,000 dead New Yorkers, the highest death toll by far of any state. No rendering on that poster of criticism the Governor Cuomo ignored warnings, no depiction of the study that he could have saved thousands of lives had he and Mayor de Blasio acted sooner, no painting there on the poster of his since rescinded order that nursing homes take all infected patients in."

      "utterance": "Well, the Humpty Dumpty, Mr. Potato head network fake news CNN actually got something right. Tip of a hat. Cuomo along with Governors Murphy and Wolf, and, of course, Michigan Governor Whitmer, you know, the worse those three states, executive orders forcing nursing homes to take COVID patients, and then, of course, lectures from Cuomo, I'm not responsible for your PPE. You wanted those patients for money and, by the way, people are going to die anyway. He actually said all of that. They failed their residents. It was a disgrace. Earlier tonight, the president laid out more of Cuomo's failures. Let's take a look."

      "utterance": "We did in New York, what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things. Two thousand eight hundred beds in Javits Center, but the governor used very few of them, unfortunately. Then we moved in our great hospital ship. We could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used that for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the governor."

      "speaker": "Let me be clear",
      "utterance": "of course, the safety and security of our children is an important as anything. They are our American treasure. I say that often. There's increasing evidence that we can do this safely. \"Wall Street Journal,\" I point out to their article and a new editorial pointing out that schools have reopened in most countries including Germany, Singapore, Norway, Denmark, Finland, they have not experienced outbreaks. Remember, the cost of shutting down schools indefinitely are immense. American Pediatric Society has weighed in on the side of opening them. And the fact is we can't shut down and stay shut down forever and that will -- those with were words of Anthony Fauci. And medical expert seemed to agree. Recent report, NBC Nightly News interviewed five pediatricians all said they would send their kids back to class. Democrats, the mob, the media, they would rather turn towards hysteria, rage, politicizing. For example, even as New York City sees an uptick in cases among young adults, city officials insisting there is no connection to mass protests that are taking place across the city. Blame the churches. New York Times, others, that's what they did. They blamed the churches for the spike. Also developing tonight, an investigation in Florida has found by FOX 35, numerous labs are misreporting their COVID results -- get this -- including a failure to report any negative cases. They're saying, oh, every single person that comes in has it. OK, that's not right. Joining us now with reaction with the very latest of developments, Governor Greg Abbott. Governor, let's go -- let's go put up some charts first. I love our friends in Texas. You've been very firm and I anecdotally have said -- I'm for masks. I'm for social distancing, use of plexiglass and opening stadiums. I want it all. If I have to go to a baseball game, football game and wear a mask, I'll wear it, because I saw in New York at the height of this, I saw that it worked in my grocery store, and my drugstore. Nobody contracted it and they all had plexiglass and masks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. GREG ABBOTT, R-TEXAS",
      "utterance": "And that's exactly what Texas has adopted. We observed the same thing. Early on, we had some grocery stores, H-E-B, which was just ranked America's favorite grocery store, they had best practices in place to slow the spread. And that's exactly what we're doing in Texas. Sean, know this -- we do not want to shut down business or Texas again. We cannot have that. But we can do, however, we can use these practices like will you just said and that is -- people can wear masks, we can use these other strategies to slow the spread while we are awaiting the time of when we do have these vaccines. I do however want to add one thing because I heard on your show what I hear on every show, and that is people talk about the vaccines which will be coming. But before vaccines will come, we will have therapeutic drugs coming and maybe two or three months before vaccines will come, so that people will be treated who do contract COVID-19."

      "utterance": "Well, Governor, you know, we do know that after all was said and done, it turns out the first real study on hydroxychloroquine, it turns out Donald Trump was right. Had very effective. Remdesivir is another drug showing promise. Let me show -- I'm putting up on the screen, for example, the daily new cases in your great state of Texas, hospitalizations, positivity rate. All right. Now, we're seeing this a lot in the Sun Belt. We have Governor DeSantis on. He pointed out something that I found, I -- very interesting, and as much as that a lot of the new cases are younger people. They are less at risk, but then they are at risk of may be infecting grandma or grandpa. That concerns me. As you look at the charts and you been very outspoken, what do you make of it? What are you seeing, and what have we learned from the last time that you were implying?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",
      "utterance": "We are seeing two things. One is we are seeing a meaningful increase in hospitalizations and that's a very dangerous sign. We are seeing however, also, what you're pointing out and that is almost half of the people who are testing positive are under the age of 35. As a result, it means that more people who are testing positive will not be going to the hospitals as before. But we do need to be very concerned about those who are hospitalized, but also we must emphasize exactly what he said that is for the young adults who do test positive, they can spread that with their parents, with their grandparents. And that can lead to the serious problem. That's exactly why during this time period while we are waiting on medications, it's so important that people in Texas as elsewhere wear masks. Remember this also, Sean, this isn't just Texas and Florida. Remember -- see what's going on in California, in Louisiana, in Illinois, all of which have upticks in the number of cases."

They all wore masks, not one person got it. So why would I -- why do I say I'll wear it? Number one, it's short-term. It's not going to be long. We'll kill this thing. Number two, I wear it for grandma, grandpa, mom and dad, and selfishly, I want to go to a baseball game and I want to go to football game. If I have to wear it to go, I'll wear the stupid thing. I don't like it but I'll do it for other people. Governor, keep us updated. We're praying for the state of Texas, flatten again, go down and get this thing done with. All right, when we come back, New York Times opinion columnist, wow, a powerful beat down an editor by the name, her name is Bari Weiss, resigned from the paper today and penned a scathing resignation letter where she was bullied by her New York toilet paper \"Times\" colleagues.

Wow. And it gets -- well, even worse from there. Here now with reaction, former White House press secretary, Fox News contributor, Ari Fleischer, former Arkansas governor, Fox News contributor, Mike Huckabee. I would imagine both you, Ari, and both you, Governor, you don't have a love of \"The New York Times.\" we know how they treated you, Ari, and we know how they treated Sarah Huckabee who will be the governor one day in Arkansas.

We all know papers have been liberal for decades and networks have been liberal for decades, but this is an indictment of the internal intolerant culture led by the editors of \"The New York Times\" who have acquiesced to the younger journalists where she puts it have basically taken over because of the Twitter mentality, a collegiate landscape mentality.

What advice 112 days out, I consider you to of the smartest political guys in the country.

What you got to remind the American people is that you fought for border security. You've fought for lower taxes, for less regulation that opened up business. You've fought to push China fact. You fought for the sanctity of life. You fought for our alliance with Israel. Focus on the things that he has done that made a lot of people, even folks who didn't like his personality, vote for him and forget the slights that he gets from \"The New York Times\" and CNN. They don't matter. Thus people are never going to like him. He shouldn't want them to like him because if they did, it must be that he has compromised his core values. So, stick to the fight that matters to the American people as they sit around talking about who they're going to vote for. And I think he will win in a landslide if he does that. I truly do."

There was the empathy the president was showing as somebody who cared about COVID, protecting the American people. His job is to protect us from all enemies, including the COVID enemy. He's got to talk about it. He's got to lead the country on it and show that he cares. He's a tough guy. We all know that. He's also got to show he's a caring guy.
