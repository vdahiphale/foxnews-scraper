On Saturday, there was a glimmer of hope with the announcement of a cease- fire and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to allow those civilians to get out, but the cease-fire collapsed almost as soon as the first of those civilians set out among the supposedly-safe corridor. Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces opened fire and therefore they ordered all of those trying to escape to go back to their homes or whatever is left of their homes. Another cease-fire was declared for today. That appears to have collapsed too, and those 200,000 civilians remain trapped in the most appalling and terrifying conditions imaginable -- Shannon.",

Like in many other cities, Kyiv, Kharkiv, everywhere where people are shelled and shot at, but everywhere, Ukrainians are putting resistance because we are fighting for our homes. So what we need right now is pretty simple. You know, we need as much defensive and offensive -- all kinds of weapons -- that the U.S. can give to us in order to defend ourselves, especially with regard to air defense and airplanes. We need much tougher sanctions on Russia. You know, it's 11th day now. We are thankful for the sanctions that have been implemented by the United States, but as the allies, but since Russia is not changing their behavior, they're escalating actually. They're killing us more and more. The sanctions should toughen up. So, we are asking for full embargo on oil and gas, for everything. This is a terrorist state and we should treat Russia as terrorist state. And, of course, we are also asking to protect the civilians. That's why we need all the support that, you know, as NATO allies, or individual countries can provide to us.",

We would be at war, and soon, Russia would likely be able to move into Ukraine their own air defense systems being able to shoot missiles at pilots who are flying above.

Russian imports into the United States are relatively meager, but if United States did this together with Europe, that would have a significant impact. So a lot of people wanted President Biden to rush out economic sanctions on Russia without Europe. He was right to wait to do it together with Europe.

I mean you heard both senators say the same thing, that if we start to take a more aggressive posture militarily, we are inviting an open conflict with a nuclear state. We don't want to give them license or give other authoritarian regimes license to go ahead and pursue nuclear weapons. But, at the same time, we don't want to invite that conflict now.

So that, of course, throws another wrench into the situation. The White House has been saying on one hand that we don't need to sanction Russian oil because it's a very small fraction of what we import here in the country. On the other hand, they're also saying that Americans need to brace or have higher gas prices as a result of this. So, they're trying to play that both ways. But, overall, they're not treating domestic energy production through oil and gas as a national security issue. Jen Psaki was asked about the Keystone Pipeline, how that was put off a year ago, and her response was that it would take too long to get the pipeline back online, and therefore it wasn't an immediate solution. Well, it might not be an immediate solution, but it is a long-term national security solution for the United States to be domestically energy independent. We're also seeing now that the State Department is sending officials to Venezuela to try and negotiate getting the gap filled in terms of oil with the Venezuelans. We saw Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, this week saying Iranian oil is on the table. So, there is this question of, the administration doesn't want to ramp up domestic production, but they're willing to get oil from adversaries. And you combine that with the negotiations with the Iran nuclear deal and things get quite completed.",

Ukrainian officials saying Russian forces opened fire and therefore they ordered all of those trying to escape to go back to their homes or whatever is left of their homes. Another cease-fire was declared for today. That appears to have collapsed too, and those 200,000 civilians remain trapped in the most appalling and terrifying conditions imaginable -- Shannon."

The train station here is packed daily with women and children seeking safety as men are ordered to stay in Ukraine to fight. And Lviv has not yet been physically touched by this war, but they are preparing. We were out yesterday as own statues in the city were wrapped in plastic and stained glass windows and the churches were boarded up in hopes of protecting them from future Russian bombardment. That is, of course, Shannon, a futile effort, and will do nothing if and when the Russian shells hit this city. But it is another sign that people here want to do something, anything, to feel they are protecting their beloved Ukraine -- Shannon."

Doctors Without Borders saying now that some pharmacies are running out of medication. We know that you are here lobbying Washington for help, things that will help Ukrainian people to hold on. So, what are you asking for today?"

So, we -- today, we woke up here to learn that Russian troops attacked Vinnytsia Airport. It's a city which is almost in the western Ukraine already. And city of Mariupol, which is the size of Tampa in Florida, is under siege and they again for the second time refused to allow women and children to get out and for the humanitarian goods to get into Mariupol. Like in many other cities, Kyiv, Kharkiv, everywhere where people are shelled and shot at, but everywhere, Ukrainians are putting resistance because we are fighting for our homes. So what we need right now is pretty simple. You know, we need as much defensive and offensive -- all kinds of weapons -- that the U.S. can give to us in order to defend ourselves, especially with regard to air defense and airplanes. We need much tougher sanctions on Russia. You know, it's 11th day now. We are thankful for the sanctions that have been implemented by the United States, but as the allies, but since Russia is not changing their behavior, they're escalating actually. They're killing us more and more. The sanctions should toughen up. So, we are asking for full embargo on oil and gas, for everything. This is a terrorist state and we should treat Russia as terrorist state. And, of course, we are also asking to protect the civilians. That's why we need all the support that, you know, as NATO allies, or individual countries can provide to us."

And even though we didn't threat anyone, Russia attacked us in 2014, and Russia brutally attacks us for the past 11 days. So if the situation, you know, happened to Ukraine, who is safe? What democracy can feel safe right now? So I think, you know, the events of the past 11 days clearly shows that we have to act together, and that Russia can attack anyone being totally unprovoked like they did with Ukraine.

It sounds like Ukraine is planning for that. But I know what you've asked for, what President Zelenskyy has asked for is a cease-fire and the safe corridors for humans to be able to evacuate and escape the areas that are being shelled. It doesn't look like Russia is adhering to either of those requests. Are these talks worth the time? Do you trust the Russians to engage in good faith?"

They are committing war crimes in Ukraine. At the same time, our president said numerous times that he's always ready for peace talks because he values, and he would like to save every Ukrainian life possible. So we will respond to any peace talks, we will go and try to reach whatever we can reach, but we have to also see that after the previous peace talks, we agreed on some of the humanitarian corridors, so we tried twice about the city of Mariupol.

It's evidence, clear to us, that what they are doing is illegal and it's war crimes. I mean, they are targeting hospitals. They're targeting schools. They're targeting civilians. They are doing everything possible you can imagine illegal during the war. But -- and the whole war is totally unjustified, unprovoked, ungrounded.

This is nothing new to us. We live with us for the past 400 years. So they attacked us. They always supported the pro-Russian government. They tried to install them in Ukraine previously. That's why we had two revolutions of dignity -- of Orange Revolution and Revolution of Dignity. When people of Ukraine, because we are a democracy, essentially said no, we want to be free. We want to be European. We want to live like we want to live. That's why they attacked us militarily in 2014. That's why they illegally grabbed Crimea and part of Donetsk and Luhansk. And that's why they are killing us now or trying to kill. And they're trying to attack us. So, you know, it's -- it's not about Ukraine or it's not only about Ukraine. And it's not even about Putin's state of mind. You know, I think the focus right now should be, what do we do to stop him? Because unfortunately every large war in the past started locally, and we know from the past that all of them could have been stopped locally.

My hope is that the Europeans will do more as well.

    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "No. I think we need to be clear that we are not going to go to war with Russia. That would be the beginning of World War III, would drag all of Europe into a much broader war. But if I were President Zelenskyy, I would be asking for a no-fly zone. The problem is there is no such thing as a no-fly zone over Ukraine. If the United States put planes in the air, we would immediately be shooting at Russian planes. They would be shooting at us. We would be at war, and soon, Russia would likely be able to move into Ukraine their own air defense systems being able to shoot missiles at pilots who are flying above. So, I get why President Zelenskyy is pressing on a no-fly zone and I think we should answer many of his other calls for additional defensive equipment, for more humanitarian assistance. I don't think it's in our interest, the interest of Europe, to have United States and Russia -- the two world's biggest, most-equipped nuclear superpowers -- going to war directly against each other."

He told the world what he was going to do. This experience should ring alarms concerning the rest of the world's autocrats. What have they been telling us that they've convinced ourselves couldn't possibly mean? Has the West in some respects been asleep at the wheel?"

And so, I think you have to take him at his word and understand that this might not be the end for Vladimir Putin. It used to be that we thought it was impossible that Putin would march an army into a NATO country. I don't think we can take that for granted any longer, which is why the American public are going to have to be comfortable with additional amounts of U.S. troops going to protect the eastern flank of NATO. Similarly, we have to listen to President Xi, who has acted in a way over the course of the last several years as if he is going to do the same thing with respect to Taiwan. We have a policy of strategic ambiguity about what our defense relationship is with Taiwan. We are likely going to have to make a clear decision about whether the United States is willing to step in and protect Taiwan. If we are, that involves a much more significant commitment than we have made already."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, we've been clear about some of the things we are not willing to and for good reason, not going to do and getting involved with Ukraine. But now, there are things domestically that we're talking about. So, there's this bipartisan bill that's talking about banning import of Russian energy products. I think the number two Democrat, Dick Durbin, in the Senate, has now joined on to this. The White House has pushed back on this idea but one of the co-sponsors, Republican Lisa Murkowski, has said it's a moral obligation. She said -- and we played this earlier in the show -- I don't want U.S. dollars to be funding this carnage in Ukraine. So, do you think this bill goes anywhere? Would you support it? And if so, how would you convince the president to get on board?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "I think the White House is open to this ideal. They just want to make sure that it's done in no way that doesn't dramatically increase prices for American consumers. You know, if the price of a barrel of oil goes to $150 because we ban Russian imports, you and I can deal with that, but there are a lot of low income consumers who would be hurt. Similarly, President Biden has made it really clear that the best policies for the U.S. and Europe to act together, right? Russian imports into the United States are relatively meager, but if United States did this together with Europe, that would have a significant impact. So a lot of people wanted President Biden to rush out economic sanctions on Russia without Europe. He was right to wait to do it together with Europe. So, on this one, I think the White House is just trying to make sure that we mitigate any impact on lower income Americans and that we try to bring Europe along to the extent possible to make the impact as big as possible. But the short of it is yes, I would absolutely support cutting off Russian oil to the United States. I just would much rather do it with the Europeans."

If prices go up, then you're naturally, through the market mechanisms, going to have more U.S. production. Joe Manchin represents a coal state. I represent a state that's going to have a lot of wind power online very soon. And so, you know, my preference would be to try to fill in that gap with renewable energy. But I think the reality is if Europe decides to take a tough stand against Russian gas and oil, there's no way to not have some of that filled in with U.S. natural resource production. LNG in particular, natural gas that we produce here in the United States and shipped to Europe is likely going to have to be part of the solution. I would just want to make sure that in the United States, if we're going to have to fill in what we lose in Russian gas that's not just from West Virginia coal, that's also from Long Island sound wind power."

So, it's unlikely you can do a deal without Russia being at the table, but if you got the classified briefings that I've gotten about how close Iran is to a nuclear weapon right now, you would agree that we cannot leave a good deal on the table. If there is an agreement to be had that allows inspectors back in, that stops Iran's research program, we should take it, because the alternative is disastrous for the region. Not just Iran becoming weeks away from getting a weapon, but the Saudis, the Emiratis, everyone else deciding that now is the time to pursue their own nuclear weapon. A nuclear Middle East would be a disaster for the world and for the United States. So I'm hopeful that we're going to get an agreement soon."

So, obviously, Putin is not playing by these rules, from that or many other agreements at this point, and yet the rest of the world is trying to play by the rules.

We do know that the burn rate for lethal aid that we've sent into Ukraine has gone up as the Russians have changed their strategy both in the air and on the ground, so reinforcing that will be extremely important. But also humanitarian aid, making sure that we are able to provide for those refugees that will be flowing into Europe. I understand there's over a million and a half displaced people now. So, again, helping our Polish friends, anyone in those other countries that need assistance. So there's a lot that we can do. But, you're right, these agreements, they need to mean something.

We have become much more reliant upon Russia and President Putin instead of providing jobs and energy security right here on the homeland. So, I recognize that we are in a difficult position, but his choices, the administration's choices, when he first came into office, put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil. This needs to stop. I would much rather ramp up American energy production here in the United States than provide dollars to Russia and to President Putin to fund the war machine that is killing innocent civilians in Ukraine."

      "utterance": "Senator, I want to quickly ask you a little -- about a little bit of family business. There's been some debate within the party. Republican Senator Rick Scott put out an 11-point plan. It would ask every American to pay at least a little income tax in order to, quote, have skin in the game. He even put out an op-ed about this. It's \"Why I'm Defying Beltway Cowardice.\" He says, if we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to socialism, we don't deserve to govern. Most Republicans in Congress agree, but many live in fear of speaking the truth in Washington, which we all know can be a bit dangerous. That's my ad there. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell says, not going to raise taxes. What's the conversation now between these two and internally, the party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly that's up for Leader McConnell and Senator Scott to figure out. I am very focused on representing my constituencies here in Iowa and making sure that they have a voice at the table. I think every Republican, as we step forward, will determine what is in the best interest for their own party dynamics within their states and defending what we believe to be true, liberty, freedom, you name it, that's what we are for. We want to see prosperity in the United States, and each of us have a very important role and voice no matter where we are."

Jonathan Swan, national political correspondent for \"Axios.\" Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. And Katie Pavlich, editor of \"Town Hall.\" And I've got to say, it's great to see all of you in person. CATHERINE LUCEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, indeed."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Catherine, I'll start with you. You know, there's this conversation, and you've heard it from these senators this morning, about banning energy imports from Russia. The White House has seemed resistant to that idea. Do you think, as calls grow and the pressure on her own energy system here in America, we see these prices going up, that they'll maybe change their minds?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUCEY",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, I think you saw it just play out in the show. We're really seeing a, you know, bipartisan conversation about this. Both senators said this was something that, you know, was being looked at. And the White House has indicated to us that they are looking at all the options. The president said this week that nothing was off the table. So, I think this conversation is going to continue. One of the things, though, that they are trying to balance, as you said, is this issue around inflation and gas prices. And the president is very aware of how this is impacting Americans, prices at the pump. You heard him talk about that at the State of the Union, that that's a real anxiety for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "And that's not a headache they need right now with everything on their plate over there at the White House. OK, Mo, this issue of nuclear weapons, Ukraine giving theirs up under the Budapest memo back to '94 and finding themselves in this place. \"The Wall Street Journal\" opinion piece says this, many countries, including maline actions watching Russian's actions will inevitably now seek their own nukes. Vladimir Putin is demonstrating that these weapons give an aggressor license to attack and without them a peaceful nation is at the aggressor's mercy. You heard Senator Murphy talk about this. Like, everybody's going to want their own nukes now."

      "utterance": "No, I -- look, the world is watching, right? China is watching. Their authoritarian regimes are watching. And how the United States and NATO are able to contain this is going to be critical. The last thing we need is for Putin to get everything he wants in Ukraine and for Xi to then say, OK, I now have my road map in Taiwan and elsewhere. But it's delicate, right? I mean you heard both senators say the same thing, that if we start to take a more aggressive posture militarily, we are inviting an open conflict with a nuclear state. We don't want to give them license or give other authoritarian regimes license to go ahead and pursue nuclear weapons. But, at the same time, we don't want to invite that conflict now. So, it's a really tricky place that they're at."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And as we've all discussed, I mean this goes far beyond just Ukraine and Russia. President Xi is washing this. Malign actors around the world are watching. And that gets to another piece in \"The Wall Street Journal\" said, Mr. Putin and no doubt China's Xi Jinping saw the west on the brink of political and moral decadence. Counties whose leadership allowed marginal issues, such as windmills and gender complicity to displace natural self-preservation. Do nothing, and disorder descends. Katie."

    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND TOWNHALL.COM EDITOR",
      "utterance": "Well, as the world watches, something that has been kind of pushed to the side in terms of the headlines is the negotiations over the Iran nuclear agreement and Russia is at the table with that and now we're hearing and reporting in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that Russia is now demanding that the new Ukrainian sanctions do not impact their ability to trade with Tehran. So that, of course, throws another wrench into the situation. The White House has been saying on one hand that we don't need to sanction Russian oil because it's a very small fraction of what we import here in the country. On the other hand, they're also saying that Americans need to brace or have higher gas prices as a result of this. So, they're trying to play that both ways. But, overall, they're not treating domestic energy production through oil and gas as a national security issue. Jen Psaki was asked about the Keystone Pipeline, how that was put off a year ago, and her response was that it would take too long to get the pipeline back online, and therefore it wasn't an immediate solution. Well, it might not be an immediate solution, but it is a long-term national security solution for the United States to be domestically energy independent. We're also seeing now that the State Department is sending officials to Venezuela to try and negotiate getting the gap filled in terms of oil with the Venezuelans. We saw Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, this week saying Iranian oil is on the table. So, there is this question of, the administration doesn't want to ramp up domestic production, but they're willing to get oil from adversaries. And you combine that with the negotiations with the Iran nuclear deal and things get quite completed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and, Jonathan, to the point about Secretary Buttigieg, I mean he said this week something to the effect of, we can't be chasing permanent solutions to these short-term problems. And so for a lot of people that sparks the question, well, why don't we want a permanent solution so we don't -- the world find itself in this position again?"

      "speaker": "JONATHAN SWAN, AXIOS NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, this -- this just happened on multiple fronts where the climate agenda runs into another agenda. In this -- in this instance it's a national security agenda. I'm old enough to remember a year ago, I went to Kyiv. I interviewed President Zelenskyy. I interviewed him again in the spring. He was pleading with the United States and the Germans to shut down the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. I'm old enough to remember being told by the U.S. and the Germans it couldn't be done, that it was already completed, that it was essential so that the U.S. and the Germans could cooperate on climate change. And we've learned in the last two weeks, oh, actually, it could be done. And you make choices. And these are competing priorities running headlong into each other. I will say, I've been stunned at how European foreign policy has done a complete 180 in the last three weeks. If you told me that Germany had done all the things it's done, I would have said you were smoking whatever that hashish (ph) was that that basketball player -- poor basketball player is being caught with."

All right, Jonathan, a lot of what he said seemed to be pushing back on sort of some of the GOP criticisms and talking points against the Democrats. So, who was that message to? Was that to Democrats, Republicans, voters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWAN",
      "utterance": "It's to the independent voters who have abandoned him in numbers that no one could have believed at the start of his presidency. And they're looking for -- the Biden team is looking for moments this year, opportunities to not just contrast himself with Republicans, but to contrast himself with the left flank of his own party. And one of the issues they've identified his crime. You're going to see Joe Biden, over the next few months, at -- at -- when the moments arise, you know, try to embrace figures like Eric Adams in New York and some of the tougher on crime figures, and to really try and distance himself from \"the squad\" and the left flank of the party. Immigration surprised me because that's one issue they want to bury deep under the soil. I don't expect him to be talking much about immigration this year. They see that as a total loser for them. But you'll certainly see it on crime."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "He's had a good week. We'll see if that can be sustained. He did bring up the issue of immigration. But policy changes are what are needed to actually sustain that bump in approval. For example, Title 42 is about to be repealed, which means that the crush at the border will be increasingly worse than it is already with record numbers of people, 200,000 people coming over every single month. You have Secretary Mayorkas having problems internally with border patrol, feeling like their mission is lost as a result of the policies that have been implemented. And I think the administration, on the crime issue, is looking around the country and seeing these radical leftists DAs being recalled and then applying that to the situation with the midterm elections coming up and looking at what issues that, again, independents really care about and issues that affect everybody. Crime is not something that affects one group of people. In fact, it affects the demographic that Democrats claim to care about the most."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "And, listen, there is troubling polling, Mo, for the Democrats going into those midterms that Katie mentioned. This new ABC News/\"Washington Post\" poll asked, would you rather see the next Congress controlled by the Republicans to act as a check on Biden, or controlled by the Democrats to support Biden's agenda. And Republicans lead that by ten points."

      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "And, you know, we see numbers like that and it usually foreshadows a big wave election in a midterm. But, you know, I think things are -- there are still a couple of triple bank shots Democrats could make to mitigate some of the expected losses. And some of it is within their control, some of it is not. The speech by the president the other night was an important step in that. And here's the thing, it wasn't a reorientation I think of Joe Biden, this was the Joe Biden we heard going back to the Democratic primaries back in 2019 and 2020. Remember, he defeated candidates within the Democratic primary who were further to the left with this message. So -- and the democratic Party and its voters embraced him, So I think what he was doing was helping, you know, those voters that Jonathan was talking about remember why they voted for him in the first place. And I think it was him sort of reorienting the public perception of the Democratic Party, which, for many months now has been defined by a fight between the left and Joe Manchin, you know, and Kyrsten Sinema -- Kyrsten Sinema over the Build Back Better, right? That was what was defining the Democrat Party in the eyes of many voters. And I think Biden said, let me remind you what you got when you voted for me."
