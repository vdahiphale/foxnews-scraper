And tonight for the full hour, we're going to highlight the president's efforts to dismantle the tangled elitist web of high-ranking government bureaucrats who are just hell-bent on destroying his administration and many actually cheering for failure. Now, but first, we have some breaking news. And this show, we're going to be hitting the road next week. We'll be traveling to Singapore for the president's historic summit with little rocket man. That's right, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. And in moments, we're going to preview the president's upcoming push for peace. Imagine that, in the Korean Peninsula. Denuclearization would be amazing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, we're going to show you how did we get to this point despite Democrats, mainstream media doubting, doubting. And sadly, even saying Trump is going to cause a nuclear war. Against the president every step of the way. Predictably. And just hours ago, ahead of his historic meetings in Singapore, the president landed in Quebec for the annual G7 summit. We'll bring you the latest out of Canada and we'll highlight some brand new outrageous examples from the mainstream media's Trump Derangement Syndrome, more revelations surrounding the media's attacks, yes, against yours truly, they are so dumb. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we have an important story surrounding freedom of the press.

And tonight, we're just days away from the direct talks between the United States of America and North Korea. Something that many thought was totally, completely impossible.

And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons.

In fact, when President Trump took office in 2017, the situation in North Korea was at a boiling point. Remember, Kim Jong-un shooting long-range missiles over Japan, threatening to blow up Guam. And conducting numerous underground test of nuclear weapons. But after eight years of weak, pathetic spineless leadership under Obama, things have changed. And President Trump actually responded. You may remember this."

And it's time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of the other countries. Now, what they've been getting away with is a tragedy and it can't be allowed. If anything happens to Guam, there's going to be big, big trouble in North Korea. If he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it. And he will regret it fast.

He wants free and fair trade. And last night, the president called on Canada, he called them out on Twitter writing, \"Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things, but it doesn't bring up the fact that they charge up to 300% on dairy hurting our farmers, killing our agriculture.\" And French President Macron responded on Twitter calling the president \"isolated\".

You know, what he able to interview all the people he wanted to interview? Who were the people he would have liked to have interviewed that he didn't have an opportunity to interview?

Mr. Trump has recently angered allies with new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Following the talks, Macron said there is a way to make progress on trade and that they had an open and a direct conversation. President Trump stressed he and Macron have a good relationship but they have tests once in a while when it comes to trade. Fans around the world mourning Anthony Bourdain the globe's traveling chef who explored culture through cuisine. The 61-year-old was found dead from an apparent suicide in his hotel room in Stratford, France. Bourdain's death comes just days after designer Kate Spade also took her own life. I'm Jonathan Hunt.

The president tweeted earlier, \"I'm headed to Canada for the G7 for talks that will mostly center on the long-time unfair trade practices against the United States. From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on the denuclearization. Of course, of the Korean peninsula. Won't be talking about the Russia witch hunt hoax for a while.\" Here with reaction to the upcoming I.G. report and Mueller's ongoing witch hunt, former Clinton pollster and adviser, Mark Penn. Attorney Victoria Toensing, and David Limbaugh. Well, I got to say about David and Victoria and pretty much everybody, I have the best lawyers in the world. They've done legal work for me. But if I don't say it every time the left wing media has a heart attack over nothing. Good to see you all. David Limbaugh, let me start with you. We know crimes are committed here. Now the president is moving in to real opportunity to make some significant changes that will impact the entire world. Our kids and grand kids. But the witch hunt continues.

You know, when he made that comment -- on foreign policy, I mean. When he made that comment about not preparing what he meant was he has negotiated all his life.

Look, you are a long-time Clinton pollster, Mark. You have been there. You've been critical. David and Victoria will tell you that Hillary violated multiple laws. Server, literally having top secret classified special access program information on an -- mishandled it, destroyed it, covered it up, obstructed after subpoena deletions and all of that.

And we really have to be on guard here that presidents can do their job without the constant threat of an investigation for everybody in their administration, for everybody in a campaign that go on without end. Because I can tell you I've been there. I was with the president in '98. It did not help the country that we wasted a year on that. It did not help the country that we wasted a year on this.

The Republicans in Congress are not doing their job. I have some very good sources. And let me tell you that Speaker Ryan and Trey Gowdy decided that it was not in the moderates, the Republican moderates' interest for the fall election to, that it was bad politics to be at odds with the Justice Department and the Democrats on the 2016 election. So they decided they were going to tamp it down. And when Trey Gowdy came on Fox and said well, when the FBI heard what they heard, they did exactly what we all hoped they would do. No, he was -- he was tamping it down. And they were not doing what we hope they would do, because they did not follow protocol. They are supposed to go to the American and say, hey, do you know that you are being targeted by the Russians? But tot only that. Trey Gowdy said that with any other knowledge whatsoever.

And you know, that's multiple decades of failed policy the president is trying to correct. It's not easy to do. But I will tell you, the summit is making me nostalgic for the old days. This is a time intelligence play such a critically important role in prepping the president. We've got the number one best subject matter expert on the Korean peninsula Andy Kim who runs the Korea mission center at CIA. He's been attached to Secretary Pompeo for a couple of trips out to North Korea. And you know, in spite of some of the criticism unfounded in my view in the press about the president's preparation or lack thereof for the summit he is getting all the preparation he needs from the secretary of state and the CIA."

The United States is the leverage. And he is willing to act on that and he's also willing to walk away if the United States does not get the total verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. Donald Trump knows the lessons of Ronald Reagan at Reykjavik, he is willing to walk away. And he is and he is being totally prepared for this summit, he's also bringing some carrots as well in terms of economic issues that if North Korea does decide to do this full on denuclearization that's verifiable and irreversible that the United States will permit some economic investment. Not economic aid of the kind Obama gave to the Iranian regime but allow economic investment into North Korea. And that's something that that country needs more than anything else."

That would mean to me, we put our people on the ground. We help, we assist and we actually even do it for them if they need it done. And then they now have an opportunity to actually feed their own people and focus on economic growth and joining the world community. To me, it's a pretty good option for them."

He wrote in part, \"I leave this life with no regrets, it was a wonderful life full and complete. With great love and great endeavors that make it worth living. I'm sad to leave, but I leave with the knowledge that I lived the life that I intended.\" He is going to be sorely missed. His whole life a profile of courage, an amazing, brilliant human being who contributed so much to the intellectual thought and debate in this country and made the world a better place. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with Charles, we're thinking of you and your family at this very difficult time. All right, as always, thank you for being with us.
