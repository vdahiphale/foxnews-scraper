And if you, look, if you live in a community where everyone has access, and they get anxious, they run out get tested, you might think well, but most people are getting tested.

So, everybody thinks either you had it, you're one of the 29 million or and you have or you might have antibodies because you had it and people who have antibodies can get tested for that and know it. But you're saying that there's a huge part of the population who may have been exposed to it or may have been exposed to a prior virus that elevated their T-cells. So, essentially, they won't get it. They can't get it. They're immune from getting it. There's about 320 million Americans in this country.

I've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard MIT Scientist, to co-lead the Presidential Council of Advisors in Science and Technology, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. These are White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists and address their most pressing needs. They'll be part of administration's work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like there is DARPA and the Defense Department that develops the breakthroughs to protect our country.

I'm here to thank my good friend Governor Whitmer, and she has become a good and close friend. Governor's been on the front lines of this pandemic as well for a long time, and I think she's doing an incredible job under very difficult circumstances. And Michigan is also fortunate to have my buddy Gary Peters as United States senator and Debbie Stabenow. Gary's here. Gary has been a workhorse and making sure that we move through this funding to get things done, because he understands better than anyone. It's about urgency, the urgency of the moment. So, Gary, thank you, Senator, thank you for all you're doing. Last week, I toured the vaccine research center at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I met world class doctors, scientists and researchers who were critical for discovering the vaccines in record time. I remember when we first started talking about this asking Dr. Fauci and others it could take up to several years, maybe as many as six or eight years to find, find a vaccine. It's a miracle of science and the brilliant minds that we have around us. And now, its second miracle, the miracle of manufacturing to produce hundreds of millions of doses -- let me say that, again, hundreds of millions of doses. I came here because I want the American people to understand the extraordinary, extraordinary work that's being done to undertake the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced. And let me say parenthetically, that it's not enough that we find cures for Americans, there needs to be a cure is that the world is able to take part because you can't build a wall or fence high enough to keep a pandemic out. On our tour, I met a few of your nearly 3000 workers Albert. Experts manage ingredients that come in from different cities and states, experts handling 3-D modeling and artificial intelligence to ensure that every dose is properly crafted. Experts ensuring environment, a sterile environments, so that each vial each and every one is safe and free of contaminants. All this is followed by extensive safety and quality control inspection, then carefully -- we walk by a freezer farm then that then keeps those doses viable so they can be shipped. This is an incredibly complex process. And at every stop safety is the utmost priority. The whole process takes teamwork, precision, and round- the-clock focus. Machinist, operating some of the most advanced equipment in the world. Working side by side with chemists, biologists, pioneering technologies, that less than a year ago were a little more than theories and aspirations. It takes a partnership in our view between the federal government and all the companies and universities contributing to the vaccine effort. Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country, my predecessors, as my mother would say, God love them, failed to order enough vaccines; failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots. Failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office. I directed Jeff Science, my COVID-19 Response Coordinator to lead my administration's work with the vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and to speed up delivery. Albert referenced it earlier. I want to thank him for making it happen. Because we work together, we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. And doesn't mean it'll be in all Americans arms, but enough vaccine will be available by that time. These orders allow facilities like this one to plan ahead, accelerate to production schedules. Here's what else we did. When we discovered the vaccine manufacturers, working -- prioritized when it came to scrutinizing and securing supplies they needed, we fix that problem and got them what they needed. Were also used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, like fill pumps and filters. This has already helped increase vaccine production. In fact, on our tour today, they showed me a critical piece of machinery they didn't have before. Now they do, and it's allowing them to ramp up production. And as we increase supply, we're carrying out a clear plan to get shots into the arms of 300 million Americans or more. And I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, I just toured and it's -- where it's being made. It takes more time to do the check for safety than it does actually to make the vaccine. That's how facilities they are. And listen to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci assured me the COVID-19 vaccines were safe. That's why several weeks ago I went through the rigorous scientific review. That's why I took my vaccine shot publicly, to demonstrate to the American people that I know and believe it's safe. That's why Vice President Harris also received a shot publicly. We all know there's some histories or some hesitancy about taking this vaccine. We all know there's history in this country of having subjected certain communities to terrible medical abuses in the past. But if there's one message to cut through to everyone in this country is this, the vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it's your turn and available. That's how to beat this pandemic. We're making progress. We deployed more vaccinators, the people who put the vaccine in your arm. We're now making it possible for retired doctors and nurses to come back and under law administer these shots. We've put new vaccinators in the field. These include over 800 medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, Defense Department National Guard. We're literally lined up -- we're lining up thousands of vaccinators, because it's one thing that the vaccine is very different to get into someone's arms. We're also creating more places for people to get vaccinated. We provided $3 billion to states, territories and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers to ramp up and ramp up the existing ones that now that are there. Right here in Michigan with Governor Whitmer, FEMA has provided tens of millions of dollars to bolster the state's community vaccination centers. From the National Guard at the Expo Center here in Kalamazoo, to the TNT -- excuse me, the TCF center in Detroit, to parking lots in churches across the state. We've worked with governors in California, Texas, New York, more to come to stand up massive, mass vaccine sites and stadiums. There'll be open 24/7 in arenas and community centers. It's an effort that's on top of the federal government covering the full cost for the state's use of their National Guard's for pandemic efforts. And you suggested I do that a while ago and I promised you I'd do it and we did it. We also started shipping vaccines directly to thousands of local pharmacies across the country, so eligible folks can get the COVID-19 shot like they would a flu shot. Here in Michigan, that's already more than 220 pharmacies like Rite Aid and Myers, in more than 130 cities in Michigan. And that's just the beginning. It's only been four weeks. And for folks who aren't near pharmacy or mass vaccination centers, we're deploying mobile clinics. These are special vehicles and pop up clinics that meet folks where they live, folks who don't have access to transportation to get the shots. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers, federal community health centers to reach those who are hit the hardest. Black, Latinos, Native Americans and rural communities, which have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other group. Here in Michigan, we're already partnered with community health centers serving more than 370,000 patients in 11 cities across the state as. That's because you guys have pointed out where they were and why it was so important, and how we get to, as Gary talks about, get to the people most in need and the people most dying from COVID. It's important to ensure everyone is treated equally and those hardest hit, get the care they deserve. We're now at a point where you've seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before I took office, to about 1.7 million average per day getting a shot. We're on track to surpass my commitment. You may remember when I said in my first 100 days just before I was inaugurated, which seemed like 100 days, anyway, first 100 days before I was inaugurated, that we did administer 100 million shots, in my first 100 days. But we're on the path to do that, we're averaging 1.7 million a day, soon will be at 50 million. And I'm confident we'll exceed the number. But that's just the floor, we have to keep going. But despite the progress, we're still in the teeth of a pandemic. New strains are emerging. In a few days, we'll cross 500,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19, 500,000. That is almost 70,000 more than all the Americans who died in World War II over a four year period. All the sorrow, all the heartache, all the pain. And while we wait for everyone to get vaccinated, we still need you to wash your hands stay socially distance and mask up to help save lives. That's why with the authority I have as president, I signed an executive order, the only authority I have to require this, to require masking on all federal property, all modes of travel like planes, trains and buses. We've been calling on governors and mayors, and local officials, Republicans and Democrats to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions, just like governor Whitmer has done here in Michigan. Look, I know it's inconvenient but you're making a difference when you do it. Everything we do matters. We need everyone to do their part for themselves for their loved ones and, yes, for your country. It's a patriotic duty. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis, the urgency. Now, critics say my plan is too big that it cost $1.9 trillion. That's too much. Let me ask them. What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave out? Should we not invest $20 billion to vaccinate the nation? Should we not invest $290 million to extend unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans who are unemployed so they can get by, while they get back to work? Should we not invest $50 billion to help small businesses stay open, when tens of thousands have had to close permanently? Should we not invest? And by the way, they make up half the employment in America. Should we not invest $130 million to help schools across the nation open safely? Right now, 24 million adults, 11 million children don't have enough food to eat. And unless you think I'm exaggerating, think of those scenes you've seen on the television. With cars lined up with seemed like miles to wait, to have someone put a box of food in their trunk. People will never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they would need help, and through no fault of their own or in that circumstance. If we don't pass the American Rescue Plan, 40 million Americans will lose nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program. Should we not invest $3 million, $3 billion to keep families from going hungry? One in five Americans are behind in the rent, one in 10 are behind in their mortgage, how many people do you know that will go to bed tonight staring to the ceiling say God what is going to happen? I don't keep my job if I don't have my unemployment check. What's happen to me? I'm losing my health insurance, what do I do? This is United States of America for God's sake. We invest in people. We're in need. Do we not invest $35 billion to help people keep a roof over their heads? I could go on but you get the point. I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly, not prepared to hear their ideas how to make the package better and make it cheaper. I'm open to that. We have to make clear who is helped and who is heard. And my hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents. According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support. The vast majority of American people, more than 70% of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including the majority of Republicans, want us to act and act big, and quickly and support the plan. Major economists, left, right and center, say we should focus on smart investments we can make now in jobs and our people got long term economic damage to our nation, and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year, this year. We've also been in constant contact with mayors and governors, county officials, members of Congress, both parties, both parties. I've met with them in my office. I've met with them on the internet, I'm Zooming on with them, both parties in every state. And guess what, they agree we have to act now. I got a letter from more than 400 mayors from big cities and small towns, they understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape, and the millions of people back to work and that we beat this virus. That's why the American Rescue Plan puts $160 million -- billion into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites. Everything is needed to get vaccines in the people's arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States is undertaken in peacetime. It includes 4 billion for new manufacturing plants. So we're ready to manufacture vaccines in the future. We don't have to wait. I want to close with what I said before. I'll always be straight with you. I said a minute ago, I'll give it to you straight from the shoulders, Roosevelt said, because the American people can take the truth. They can handle anything. I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later. And all of you here are doing some of the most important work in this facility, right here, that can be done. And I know this is personal. I walked in today and I won't say who came up to me, but one of the people in this building came up to me and said, my father in law is dying from COVID. I said, can I call him? He said, no, he couldn't take a call. He says keep him in his prayers, please. How many of you know somebody who's in real trouble or has passed? How many people do you know who sat down to breakfast this morning and looked at an empty chair across the table? You've seen the devastation of this virus in your family, your community, but you're stepping up. You're saving lives here, lives of your loved ones, your neighbors and fellow Americans. You're showing how this town, this state, this country takes care of our own. Leave nobody behind. We can do anything when we do it together. I believe we're on the road, I promise you. I know we'll run into bumps. It's not going to be easy here to the end, but we're going to beat this. We're going to beat this. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Our thank you and your people for all you do.",

Look what's happening with the weather now, for example, slowing up to distribution right now. But I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year, and God willing, this Christmas will be different than last. But I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don't know what could happen in terms of production rates, things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done. We're going to have debates about whether or not, for example, I can't set nationally who gets in line, when and first. That's a decision the states make. I can recommend, I can say what I've said like I'm the guy that said we should lower to 65 years of age. I think 35 states have done that or more. I think that, for example, I think it's critically important to get our kids back to school. I think it's really important because of the psychological damage being done and the loss of time. A kid loses semester when they're in fifth grade, it means they're not just a semester behind, they may be a year and a half behind all the difficulty. You were at that town meeting I have where that little girl was worried that, you know, her mommy -- told her mommy she worried maybe she's going to die. So there's a lot, I think it's important we get people back in school. There's a difference, for example, according to science now. Between -- kids between the ages of three and probably 12 years old, in terms of whether they can absorb in or communicate to disease than it is for kids who are 15, 16, 17, 18 years old who congregate more together. It's harder in a high school than it is in a grammar school. We know certain things are necessary, social distancing, smaller class sizes, ventilation, testing and the possibility that staff whether it's the staff taking care of the sanitary conditions in the school, or simply you've heard me say this before, bus drivers. Open the schools, we need more buses and bus drivers. We can't put kids packed in a bus, sit next to one another. So we know the things that have to be done. The question is, the order in which we do them is going to determined on what moves the quickest and where the need is the greatest. Obviously, we still have to focus on first responders, our doctors, our nurses, those delivering the services. But the reason I bother to bore you with that detail, is to try to explain to the American people that this is a process, that we know now the fundamental basic elements. The fundamental basic elements are that before you get the shot and after, if you get the shots and after, social distancing saves lives, wearing mask saves lives, making sure that you wash your hands with hot water saves lives. This is not hyperbole. This is not a political statement. It's reality. The science has demonstrated that. We also know that it's one thing to have a vaccine available. The problem was how you get into people's arms and not enough people vaccinate all the great hospitals in the state. And in my state, they can line up and give people but they can't possibly handle the volume that is needed. So what do you do? You get more people qualified to give vaccinations. The quicker you can open up places, and people can come up and demonstrate they're on the pecking order, they're ready for their shot and they're qualify. Keeping places open 24/7 makes a lot of sense but you need people to do it. So we all know the basic things that have to happen now. We also know that there are things that intervene, things happen. Weather, people get ill, people get confused. There's a lot of people who don't -- are unable. You know, I you've heard me say before, you know, my little granddaughter can use that cell phone of hers to do more in about 12 seconds than I can do it in an hour. But a lot of people aren't able to, a lot of people who need the help. They say will get online, well they don't have the means to get online. They may not have, you know, the ability to get online, and they may not know how to do it. Talk about everybody is, you know, most people are within five miles of a pharmacy. Well, if you're living alone and you're a 68-year-old woman, and you're in a minority neighborhood, and there's no bus service, you might as well be 500 miles away. That's why we're leaning out. And, Gary, you talked to me about it, getting mobile vans to go out. So we know the kinds of things have to be done, but there has never ever, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequential we're trying to do. But we're getting it done, and as my mom would say, with the grace of God and goodwill of neighbors, we're going to save a lot of lives. Thank you very much.",

He said even before and after you get the shot that you should social distance and wear masks. He said, weather and illness and confusion can lead to some people not being able to get the shot or not knowing where to go for the shot. He said they're trying to clarify that. Didn't give any credit to Operation Warp Speed here this afternoon, although he said that it was a miracle of science that Pfizer got that vaccine ready to go in about a year, under a year, actually. But he said that the prior administration did not leave them enough in terms of distribution. He said we fix the problem. So, you know, a bit of back and forth there on who's to blame for some of the slowness and the rollout now. So all right, we want to get one more topic in with you this afternoon. The President also addressed Iran today, after taking steps to reenter the nuclear deal when the White House remains largely silent on Monday's missile attack against a US-led military base in Northern Iraq that killed a military contractor and wounded a US service member. So let's bring in KT McFarland, former Deputy National Security Advisor for the Trump administration. KT, good to have you watching all this with us this afternoon, thank you so much for being here. So, you know, I mean, we all talked a lot about the advances that were made in the Trump administration and the Abraham Accords. And the shifting of the dynamic in the Middle East, that now you had Israel engaging in trade in relations with the UAE and Bahrain, and the Arab states, and increasing some communication with Saudi Arabia as well. What happens to that if you start to turn your attention back to Iran and bring them back into the fold?",

They're already trading, as you pointed out, they already have diplomatic relations, and they potentially have a military relationship, I don't know.

He talks about the Iran nuclear deal. The Iran nuclear deal, (inaudible) Iran have nuclear weapons within a decade. So again, the deeds don't back up the words.

This is where they first started rolling out vaccines in December, which of course was a historic moment for the country. The White House now says that they're going to have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of July. That's most of the country. And a new study says that the Pfizer vaccine is 85 percent effective after just one dose. It also turns out that it holds up very well in just normal freezers.

He says, \"We will have herd immunity in this country by April.\" And then he goes and lays out the science on that.

Herd immunity is not binary, Martha. It's not an all or nothing thing. And as more people get infected, and as there's more natural immunity out there, there are fewer people left who are susceptible. And what we're seeing is that herd immunity has already kicked in. It's on a slope to be at very low levels of infection by April and we add to that vaccinated immunity, we're about to see a very steep decline. And I think it's important to plan accordingly."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, you're right, people are looking at the trackers and say 28 million, and that's the number of people with infection. But that's only confirmed. And we've only been confirming about one in four, to one in 10 cases. And if you, look, if you live in a community where everyone has access, and they get anxious, they run out get tested, you might think well, but most people are getting tested. Most Americans don't live like that. Most people have had major barriers to testing. And that 28 million cumulative total, it probably represents one in 6.5 actual infections out there. We know from the U.K. now and from European studies that even if you never had symptoms, you felt great the entire time, but were close to someone or exposed or you live with somebody who had, your T-cells, which are very good immune cells have been activated. And looking at antibodies does not capture activated T-cells. There are more people with activated T-cells than there are with antibodies."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So, everybody thinks either you had it, you're one of the 29 million or and you have or you might have antibodies because you had it and people who have antibodies can get tested for that and know it. But you're saying that there's a huge part of the population who may have been exposed to it or may have been exposed to a prior virus that elevated their T-cells. So, essentially, they won't get it. They can't get it. They're immune from getting it. There's about 320 million Americans in this country. How many people do you think are now immune from COVID?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "I think at least 180 million just using the general extrapolation of number of confirmed cases, to number of people who probably had it and didn't have access to testing. Look, for example, at the mathematics, about one in 600 Americans have died of COVID. And we know the case fatality rates, about one in 400. That means about two-thirds of the country is represented right now in the current death tolls. So, we generally think that T-cell activation is a powerful form of immunity. Europeans believe it a lot better than we do. And when we start to add in a lot of vaccinated immunity, which by this week will be 15 percent of Americans, and by the end of April, as much as 40 to 45 percent of Americans. That's a powerful deterrent, herd immunity is not binary. It may have already started to kick in."

And the other half say that they're just dismissive of natural immunity, because there's no randomized control trial. Well, you can't randomize a country to not get the infection. And the reality is that the reinfection rates from after prior infection are very low. They're less than one percent. And when they do happen, they're mild cases. So, natural immunity is powerful. It works. India may already be at herd immunity levels. At one town in Brazil, I talked about in the piece, has already reached herd immunity levels. That's where we are."

Now, I've got against these unions as you just mentioned, during my time as governor, you were in New Jersey, you saw it, you need to stand up and stand up for what's right. We need to put our children and the parents first. And if there was real danger here, no one would want people to go back to school. But the statistics, the science, we were told all through the campaign, Martha, follow the science. Well, now we don't want to follow the science because the Teachers Union are telling the Democrats not to; they're manipulating the CDC.

And it's unfortunate that, you know, this pandemic has exposed so much from homelessness, to violence, to food insecurity. It's also exposing who Andrew Cuomo is, and who he has always been. He's been very Trumpian, for a long time. He's been more competent at it. But I also want to say that while I appreciate folks helping to hold accountability, I would ask that folks who don't check their party affiliation before they ask for accountability, take the lead here, because there are many folks from the Republican party and media, who, for the past four years, have been absolutely silent.

I want to, I want you to know that once we beat the COVID, we're going to do everything we can and cancer as we know it. I've asked Dr. Eric Lander, a renowned Harvard MIT Scientist, to co-lead the Presidential Council of Advisors in Science and Technology, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. These are White House offices that bring together the country's top scientists and address their most pressing needs. They'll be part of administration's work to develop a DARPA-like advanced research effort on cancer and other diseases, just like there is DARPA and the Defense Department that develops the breakthroughs to protect our country. This administration is going to be guided by science, to save lives and to make lives better. That's why I wanted to come here, Albert, thank you, and thank all the workers here in Kalamazoo. I'm here to thank my good friend Governor Whitmer, and she has become a good and close friend. Governor's been on the front lines of this pandemic as well for a long time, and I think she's doing an incredible job under very difficult circumstances. And Michigan is also fortunate to have my buddy Gary Peters as United States senator and Debbie Stabenow. Gary's here. Gary has been a workhorse and making sure that we move through this funding to get things done, because he understands better than anyone. It's about urgency, the urgency of the moment. So, Gary, thank you, Senator, thank you for all you're doing. Last week, I toured the vaccine research center at the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. I met world class doctors, scientists and researchers who were critical for discovering the vaccines in record time. I remember when we first started talking about this asking Dr. Fauci and others it could take up to several years, maybe as many as six or eight years to find, find a vaccine. It's a miracle of science and the brilliant minds that we have around us. And now, its second miracle, the miracle of manufacturing to produce hundreds of millions of doses -- let me say that, again, hundreds of millions of doses. I came here because I want the American people to understand the extraordinary, extraordinary work that's being done to undertake the most difficult operational challenges this nation has ever faced. And let me say parenthetically, that it's not enough that we find cures for Americans, there needs to be a cure is that the world is able to take part because you can't build a wall or fence high enough to keep a pandemic out. On our tour, I met a few of your nearly 3000 workers Albert. Experts manage ingredients that come in from different cities and states, experts handling 3-D modeling and artificial intelligence to ensure that every dose is properly crafted. Experts ensuring environment, a sterile environments, so that each vial each and every one is safe and free of contaminants. All this is followed by extensive safety and quality control inspection, then carefully -- we walk by a freezer farm then that then keeps those doses viable so they can be shipped. This is an incredibly complex process. And at every stop safety is the utmost priority. The whole process takes teamwork, precision, and round- the-clock focus. Machinist, operating some of the most advanced equipment in the world. Working side by side with chemists, biologists, pioneering technologies, that less than a year ago were a little more than theories and aspirations. It takes a partnership in our view between the federal government and all the companies and universities contributing to the vaccine effort. Just over four weeks ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country, my predecessors, as my mother would say, God love them, failed to order enough vaccines; failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots. Failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office. I directed Jeff Science, my COVID-19 Response Coordinator to lead my administration's work with the vaccine manufacturers to buy more vaccines and to speed up delivery. Albert referenced it earlier. I want to thank him for making it happen. Because we work together, we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July. And doesn't mean it'll be in all Americans arms, but enough vaccine will be available by that time. These orders allow facilities like this one to plan ahead, accelerate to production schedules. Here's what else we did. When we discovered the vaccine manufacturers, working -- prioritized when it came to scrutinizing and securing supplies they needed, we fix that problem and got them what they needed. Were also used the Defense Production Act to speed up the supply chain for key equipment, like fill pumps and filters. This has already helped increase vaccine production. In fact, on our tour today, they showed me a critical piece of machinery they didn't have before. Now they do, and it's allowing them to ramp up production. And as we increase supply, we're carrying out a clear plan to get shots into the arms of 300 million Americans or more. And I know people want confidence that it's safe. Well, I just toured and it's -- where it's being made. It takes more time to do the check for safety than it does actually to make the vaccine. That's how facilities they are. And listen to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci assured me the COVID-19 vaccines were safe. That's why several weeks ago I went through the rigorous scientific review. That's why I took my vaccine shot publicly, to demonstrate to the American people that I know and believe it's safe. That's why Vice President Harris also received a shot publicly. We all know there's some histories or some hesitancy about taking this vaccine. We all know there's history in this country of having subjected certain communities to terrible medical abuses in the past. But if there's one message to cut through to everyone in this country is this, the vaccines are safe. Please, for yourself, your family, your community, this country, take the vaccine when it's your turn and available. That's how to beat this pandemic. We're making progress. We deployed more vaccinators, the people who put the vaccine in your arm. We're now making it possible for retired doctors and nurses to come back and under law administer these shots. We've put new vaccinators in the field. These include over 800 medical personnel from our Commissioned Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, Defense Department National Guard. We're literally lined up -- we're lining up thousands of vaccinators, because it's one thing that the vaccine is very different to get into someone's arms. We're also creating more places for people to get vaccinated. We provided $3 billion to states, territories and tribes to create hundreds of new vaccination centers to ramp up and ramp up the existing ones that now that are there. Right here in Michigan with Governor Whitmer, FEMA has provided tens of millions of dollars to bolster the state's community vaccination centers. From the National Guard at the Expo Center here in Kalamazoo, to the TNT -- excuse me, the TCF center in Detroit, to parking lots in churches across the state. We've worked with governors in California, Texas, New York, more to come to stand up massive, mass vaccine sites and stadiums. There'll be open 24/7 in arenas and community centers. It's an effort that's on top of the federal government covering the full cost for the state's use of their National Guard's for pandemic efforts. And you suggested I do that a while ago and I promised you I'd do it and we did it. We also started shipping vaccines directly to thousands of local pharmacies across the country, so eligible folks can get the COVID-19 shot like they would a flu shot. Here in Michigan, that's already more than 220 pharmacies like Rite Aid and Myers, in more than 130 cities in Michigan. And that's just the beginning. It's only been four weeks. And for folks who aren't near pharmacy or mass vaccination centers, we're deploying mobile clinics. These are special vehicles and pop up clinics that meet folks where they live, folks who don't have access to transportation to get the shots. We're also supplying vaccines to community health centers, federal community health centers to reach those who are hit the hardest. Black, Latinos, Native Americans and rural communities, which have higher rates of COVID infections and deaths than any other group. Here in Michigan, we're already partnered with community health centers serving more than 370,000 patients in 11 cities across the state as. That's because you guys have pointed out where they were and why it was so important, and how we get to, as Gary talks about, get to the people most in need and the people most dying from COVID. It's important to ensure everyone is treated equally and those hardest hit, get the care they deserve. We're now at a point where you've seen the average daily number of people vaccinated nearly double, from the week before I took office, to about 1.7 million average per day getting a shot. We're on track to surpass my commitment. You may remember when I said in my first 100 days just before I was inaugurated, which seemed like 100 days, anyway, first 100 days before I was inaugurated, that we did administer 100 million shots, in my first 100 days. But we're on the path to do that, we're averaging 1.7 million a day, soon will be at 50 million. And I'm confident we'll exceed the number. But that's just the floor, we have to keep going. But despite the progress, we're still in the teeth of a pandemic. New strains are emerging. In a few days, we'll cross 500,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19, 500,000. That is almost 70,000 more than all the Americans who died in World War II over a four year period. All the sorrow, all the heartache, all the pain. And while we wait for everyone to get vaccinated, we still need you to wash your hands stay socially distance and mask up to help save lives. That's why with the authority I have as president, I signed an executive order, the only authority I have to require this, to require masking on all federal property, all modes of travel like planes, trains and buses. We've been calling on governors and mayors, and local officials, Republicans and Democrats to institute mask mandates within their jurisdictions, just like governor Whitmer has done here in Michigan. Look, I know it's inconvenient but you're making a difference when you do it. Everything we do matters. We need everyone to do their part for themselves for their loved ones and, yes, for your country. It's a patriotic duty. We need Congress to pass my American Rescue Plan that deals with the immediate crisis, the urgency. Now, critics say my plan is too big that it cost $1.9 trillion. That's too much. Let me ask them. What would they have me cut? What would they have me leave out? Should we not invest $20 billion to vaccinate the nation? Should we not invest $290 million to extend unemployment insurance for the 11 million Americans who are unemployed so they can get by, while they get back to work? Should we not invest $50 billion to help small businesses stay open, when tens of thousands have had to close permanently? Should we not invest? And by the way, they make up half the employment in America. Should we not invest $130 million to help schools across the nation open safely? Right now, 24 million adults, 11 million children don't have enough food to eat. And unless you think I'm exaggerating, think of those scenes you've seen on the television. With cars lined up with seemed like miles to wait, to have someone put a box of food in their trunk. People will never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever thought they would need help, and through no fault of their own or in that circumstance. If we don't pass the American Rescue Plan, 40 million Americans will lose nutritional assistance through a program we call SNAP, the old food stamp program. Should we not invest $3 million, $3 billion to keep families from going hungry? One in five Americans are behind in the rent, one in 10 are behind in their mortgage, how many people do you know that will go to bed tonight staring to the ceiling say God what is going to happen? I don't keep my job if I don't have my unemployment check. What's happen to me? I'm losing my health insurance, what do I do? This is United States of America for God's sake. We invest in people. We're in need. Do we not invest $35 billion to help people keep a roof over their heads? I could go on but you get the point. I'm grateful that the Senate and the House are moving quickly, not prepared to hear their ideas how to make the package better and make it cheaper. I'm open to that. We have to make clear who is helped and who is heard. And my hope is that the Republicans in Congress listen to their constituents. According to the polls, there is overwhelming bipartisan support. The vast majority of American people, more than 70% of the American people, with all the polls you all conduct, including the majority of Republicans, want us to act and act big, and quickly and support the plan. Major economists, left, right and center, say we should focus on smart investments we can make now in jobs and our people got long term economic damage to our nation, and to strengthen the economic competitiveness going forward. In fact, an analysis by the Wall Street firm Moody's estimates that if we pass my American Rescue Plan, the economy will create 7 million jobs this year, this year. We've also been in constant contact with mayors and governors, county officials, members of Congress, both parties, both parties. I've met with them in my office. I've met with them on the internet, I'm Zooming on with them, both parties in every state. And guess what, they agree we have to act now. I got a letter from more than 400 mayors from big cities and small towns, they understand we're not going to get our economy back in shape, and the millions of people back to work and that we beat this virus. That's why the American Rescue Plan puts $160 million -- billion into more testing and tracing, manufacturing and distribution, and setting up vaccination sites. Everything is needed to get vaccines in the people's arms, which is the most difficult logistical effort the United States is undertaken in peacetime. It includes 4 billion for new manufacturing plants. So we're ready to manufacture vaccines in the future. We don't have to wait. I want to close with what I said before. I'll always be straight with you. I said a minute ago, I'll give it to you straight from the shoulders, Roosevelt said, because the American people can take the truth. They can handle anything. I can't give you a date when this crisis will end, but I can tell you we're doing everything possible to have that day come sooner rather than later. And all of you here are doing some of the most important work in this facility, right here, that can be done. And I know this is personal. I walked in today and I won't say who came up to me, but one of the people in this building came up to me and said, my father in law is dying from COVID. I said, can I call him? He said, no, he couldn't take a call. He says keep him in his prayers, please. How many of you know somebody who's in real trouble or has passed? How many people do you know who sat down to breakfast this morning and looked at an empty chair across the table? You've seen the devastation of this virus in your family, your community, but you're stepping up. You're saving lives here, lives of your loved ones, your neighbors and fellow Americans. You're showing how this town, this state, this country takes care of our own. Leave nobody behind. We can do anything when we do it together. I believe we're on the road, I promise you. I know we'll run into bumps. It's not going to be easy here to the end, but we're going to beat this. We're going to beat this. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Our thank you and your people for all you do."

President Biden in Portage, Michigan today, at the Pfizer manufacturing plant where they rolled out the first doses in December and have amped it up in a remarkable way. And we're going to have, he said, all Americans by the end of July, we'd be able to get a vaccine by that point? Also interesting just to note a couple of things from his statements just now. He said it could have taken six to eight years to get a vaccine, but that was -- I'm listening."

    {
      "speaker": "BIDEN",
      "utterance": "We will have ordered much of what you have been distributed, over 600 million doses by the end of July, July 29 is the expected date. That could change. Look what's happening with the weather now, for example, slowing up to distribution right now. But I believe we'll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year, and God willing, this Christmas will be different than last. But I can't make that commitment to you. There are other strains of the virus. We don't know what could happen in terms of production rates, things can change. But we're doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done. We're going to have debates about whether or not, for example, I can't set nationally who gets in line, when and first. That's a decision the states make. I can recommend, I can say what I've said like I'm the guy that said we should lower to 65 years of age. I think 35 states have done that or more. I think that, for example, I think it's critically important to get our kids back to school. I think it's really important because of the psychological damage being done and the loss of time. A kid loses semester when they're in fifth grade, it means they're not just a semester behind, they may be a year and a half behind all the difficulty. You were at that town meeting I have where that little girl was worried that, you know, her mommy -- told her mommy she worried maybe she's going to die. So there's a lot, I think it's important we get people back in school. There's a difference, for example, according to science now. Between -- kids between the ages of three and probably 12 years old, in terms of whether they can absorb in or communicate to disease than it is for kids who are 15, 16, 17, 18 years old who congregate more together. It's harder in a high school than it is in a grammar school. We know certain things are necessary, social distancing, smaller class sizes, ventilation, testing and the possibility that staff whether it's the staff taking care of the sanitary conditions in the school, or simply you've heard me say this before, bus drivers. Open the schools, we need more buses and bus drivers. We can't put kids packed in a bus, sit next to one another. So we know the things that have to be done. The question is, the order in which we do them is going to determined on what moves the quickest and where the need is the greatest. Obviously, we still have to focus on first responders, our doctors, our nurses, those delivering the services. But the reason I bother to bore you with that detail, is to try to explain to the American people that this is a process, that we know now the fundamental basic elements. The fundamental basic elements are that before you get the shot and after, if you get the shots and after, social distancing saves lives, wearing mask saves lives, making sure that you wash your hands with hot water saves lives. This is not hyperbole. This is not a political statement. It's reality. The science has demonstrated that. We also know that it's one thing to have a vaccine available. The problem was how you get into people's arms and not enough people vaccinate all the great hospitals in the state. And in my state, they can line up and give people but they can't possibly handle the volume that is needed. So what do you do? You get more people qualified to give vaccinations. The quicker you can open up places, and people can come up and demonstrate they're on the pecking order, they're ready for their shot and they're qualify. Keeping places open 24/7 makes a lot of sense but you need people to do it. So we all know the basic things that have to happen now. We also know that there are things that intervene, things happen. Weather, people get ill, people get confused. There's a lot of people who don't -- are unable. You know, I you've heard me say before, you know, my little granddaughter can use that cell phone of hers to do more in about 12 seconds than I can do it in an hour. But a lot of people aren't able to, a lot of people who need the help. They say will get online, well they don't have the means to get online. They may not have, you know, the ability to get online, and they may not know how to do it. Talk about everybody is, you know, most people are within five miles of a pharmacy. Well, if you're living alone and you're a 68-year-old woman, and you're in a minority neighborhood, and there's no bus service, you might as well be 500 miles away. That's why we're leaning out. And, Gary, you talked to me about it, getting mobile vans to go out. So we know the kinds of things have to be done, but there has never ever, ever, ever been a logistical challenge as consequential we're trying to do. But we're getting it done, and as my mom would say, with the grace of God and goodwill of neighbors, we're going to save a lot of lives. Thank you very much."

      "utterance": "All right. I wanted to go back there and make sure that we got that Q&A from President Biden at Pfizer, at the plant in Michigan today. He said even before and after you get the shot that you should social distance and wear masks. He said, weather and illness and confusion can lead to some people not being able to get the shot or not knowing where to go for the shot. He said they're trying to clarify that. Didn't give any credit to Operation Warp Speed here this afternoon, although he said that it was a miracle of science that Pfizer got that vaccine ready to go in about a year, under a year, actually. But he said that the prior administration did not leave them enough in terms of distribution. He said we fix the problem. So, you know, a bit of back and forth there on who's to blame for some of the slowness and the rollout now. So all right, we want to get one more topic in with you this afternoon. The President also addressed Iran today, after taking steps to reenter the nuclear deal when the White House remains largely silent on Monday's missile attack against a US-led military base in Northern Iraq that killed a military contractor and wounded a US service member. So let's bring in KT McFarland, former Deputy National Security Advisor for the Trump administration. KT, good to have you watching all this with us this afternoon, thank you so much for being here. So, you know, I mean, we all talked a lot about the advances that were made in the Trump administration and the Abraham Accords. And the shifting of the dynamic in the Middle East, that now you had Israel engaging in trade in relations with the UAE and Bahrain, and the Arab states, and increasing some communication with Saudi Arabia as well. What happens to that if you start to turn your attention back to Iran and bring them back into the fold?"

      "speaker": "KT MCFARLAND, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "You know, the odd thing about this is if President Biden does carry out what he's talking about doing rejoining the Iranian nuclear deal, favoring Iran over others in the region, having an anti-Israel policy and an anti-Arab policy. The odd result is it'll probably force Israel and the Arab countries closer together. They're already trading, as you pointed out, they already have diplomatic relations, and they potentially have a military relationship, I don't know. The problem I have, though, with all of the Biden foreign policy, look, he's a good and decent man, but his deeds never match the words. He talks about getting tough with Iran. He talks about the Iran nuclear deal. The Iran nuclear deal, (inaudible) Iran have nuclear weapons within a decade. So again, the deeds don't back up the words. The words are great, but there's nothing there. And that's my problem with Iran, with China, with NATO, with Russia. Great words, no deeds."

      "speaker": "MCFARLAND",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, we're going back to the good old days of the Biden administration -- the Obama administration, right, when we were dependent upon Middle East oil, when gasoline was very high, when energy prices were very high, when American manufacturing was not competitive because of those energy prices. And so, by -- they're closely tied together, Martha. Our economic policy, our foreign policy, our energy policy and our foreign policy particularly in the Middle East. If the United States has to go back to depending upon Middle East oil, we are going to get sucked right back in to the tribal warfare that they've had there for hundreds of years. In fact, President Biden's already sent American troops back into Syria. I mean, I'm not so sure that good old days of the Obama administration are going to be such good old days now. They're going to destroy the American economy, put American security at risk, and only enrich China and embolden Iran."
