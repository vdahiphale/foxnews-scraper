Could the pressure campaign to vaccinate the entire American populace be putting those already infected at risk? Two doctors from our medicine cabinet say, yes. And they're here to reveal the evidence. But first, the racism Gold Rush. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Because public schools have become cesspools of far-left political thought, many parents whose views don't align and who can't afford private or parochial schools, rightly feel that their children are trapped. Plus, many of those private schools are just as bad anyway, if not worse. Now, I can't tell you how many parents I run into complain about this dynamic. Well, today former Attorney General Bill Barr delivered one of the most important speeches in recent memory on the dire state of public education in America.",

They think they shouldn't answer to anyone outside their own sphere on issues like curriculum, on sports on anything related to life at school.

Many are eager to embrace critical race theory throughout their curricula across every subject and every aspect of schooling. And all this wokeness cost big bucks and variably funneled to anti-American race hucksters. Courtesy of Judicial Watch, we learn that schools in Montgomery County, Maryland, paid nearly $0.5 million on something called an anti-racism audit. And they gave it to a group called the Mid Atlantic Equity Consortium, which now get this is funded by your tax dollars via the Department of Education. Of the $19 million, the group has raised since 2001, $17 million is from taxpayer backed cash, what a scam. In the past four years, these race hustlers haven't received a single private donation. So, in Montgomery County, Dr. Monifa B. McKnight, and she's now the acting superintendent claimed the anti-racist audit would examine the district's systems, practices and policies that do not create access opportunities and equitable outcomes for every student's academic and social emotional well-being and what analyze policies and practices that impact staff. Now let me translate this for you. They're preparing as are many schools across America to bring racial propaganda into school subjects, every syllabus and every academic award given out. They're going to higher scores of rabid anti-American ideologues, destroying what is left at this point of objective merit for students and faculty alike. So, if you're white, you're de facto guilty. Now, if you're not white, you're given special status and consideration. Now, they call this diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, but it's really just plain old racism. Now, here are the types of DEI consultants and lectures hired for the reprograming.

Religious liberty is not safe in the United States, as long as we have the kind of public school system. We have the forced monopoly and the indoctrination of children into these radical secular progressive orthodoxies. Now bar has it right. And he went on to say that the solution here is to give parents universal school choice, where their tax dollars travel with them, and they get to choose where to send their kids to school. And while things are dire on college campuses, there are rays of hope. The Board of Trustees at UNC Chapel Hill struck a note for common sense yesterday by revoking a tenure offer to Hannah Nikole Jones, that creator of the widely discredited 619 projects. Of course, in response to that the race mongers claim that the college boards of trustees are themselves racist. Well, look, it's all they have. Naturally, the Biden Administration is full steam ahead with critical race theory in the schools. The U.S. Department of Education issued two proposed priorities last month that would direct federal grant money to projects that incorporate racially, ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse perspectives into teaching and learning and projects that promote information literacy skills. Come on, screams boondoggle. But they've poked the bear 20. State attorneys general are fighting against these plans that oppose any government funds going to any projects that characterize the United States as irredeemably racist or founded on principles of racism, or that assign fault blame or bias to a particular race or to an individual because of his or her race. Folks, it's my firm belief that Democrats will rue the day that they linked arms with the Marxists on this issue. I think most suburban women who voted for the decent Old Joe Biden, they didn't think this was part of the bargain. And the next time they walk into the voting booth, they're going to have a chance to strike a blow against the racial industrial complex that wants to wreck America, as it robs us blind. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Glenn Loury, Professor of Economics at Brown University. Professor, it's good to see you tonight. Now, this Hannah-Jones dispute leads to a larger question. Why was a woman who distorts history, even up for a tenured position at any university in the first place?",

There's nothing wrong with not having a Ph.D., but you think making someone a permanent member of the faculty of a serious university, you might want to see a little bit more depth. So, I'm not at all surprised the trustees might have been putting the political issues to the side at having that be a 10-year appointment from the start. My understanding is, their position is, let's see, five years, it's a renewable appointment, let's see how you do it and what you produce.

Now, the groups are not performing to the same extent. If you insist upon equal outcomes, but you don't have equal performance, the only way you get it is by lowering standards. So, from my perspective, the insistence upon equity, to the - over and against equality of opportunity is a concession. It's a concession that we're going to not look at performance too closely, if doing so would prevent us from getting our numbers, right. And that's a bad thing.",

Well, the randomized trials, the registrational trials excluded patients with prior COVID-19. So we have no safety data, and to this day we have no studies demonstrating any clinical benefit.

And they're here to reveal the evidence. But first, the racism Gold Rush. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Because public schools have become cesspools of far-left political thought, many parents whose views don't align and who can't afford private or parochial schools, rightly feel that their children are trapped. Plus, many of those private schools are just as bad anyway, if not worse. Now, I can't tell you how many parents I run into complain about this dynamic.

They think they shouldn't answer to anyone outside their own sphere on issues like curriculum, on sports on anything related to life at school. They want complete and total control, no questions asked. Well, parents, forget it, be damned. We saw this during COVID, where teachers summarily dismiss parents' concerns about remote learning."

Many are eager to embrace critical race theory throughout their curricula across every subject and every aspect of schooling. And all this wokeness cost big bucks and variably funneled to anti-American race hucksters. Courtesy of Judicial Watch, we learn that schools in Montgomery County, Maryland, paid nearly $0.5 million on something called an anti-racism audit. And they gave it to a group called the Mid Atlantic Equity Consortium, which now get this is funded by your tax dollars via the Department of Education. Of the $19 million, the group has raised since 2001, $17 million is from taxpayer backed cash, what a scam. In the past four years, these race hustlers haven't received a single private donation. So, in Montgomery County, Dr. Monifa B. McKnight, and she's now the acting superintendent claimed the anti-racist audit would examine the district's systems, practices and policies that do not create access opportunities and equitable outcomes for every student's academic and social emotional well-being and what analyze policies and practices that impact staff. Now let me translate this for you. They're preparing as are many schools across America to bring racial propaganda into school subjects, every syllabus and every academic award given out. They're going to higher scores of rabid anti-American ideologues, destroying what is left at this point of objective merit for students and faculty alike. So, if you're white, you're de facto guilty. Now, if you're not white, you're given special status and consideration. Now, they call this diversity, equity and inclusion, DEI, but it's really just plain old racism. Now, here are the types of DEI consultants and lectures hired for the reprograming.

Religious liberty is not safe in the United States, as long as we have the kind of public school system. We have the forced monopoly and the indoctrination of children into these radical secular progressive orthodoxies. Now bar has it right. And he went on to say that the solution here is to give parents universal school choice, where their tax dollars travel with them, and they get to choose where to send their kids to school. And while things are dire on college campuses, there are rays of hope. The Board of Trustees at UNC Chapel Hill struck a note for common sense yesterday by revoking a tenure offer to Hannah Nikole Jones, that creator of the widely discredited 619 projects. Of course, in response to that the race mongers claim that the college boards of trustees are themselves racist. Well, look, it's all they have. Naturally, the Biden Administration is full steam ahead with critical race theory in the schools. The U.S. Department of Education issued two proposed priorities last month that would direct federal grant money to projects that incorporate racially, ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse perspectives into teaching and learning and projects that promote information literacy skills. Come on, screams boondoggle. But they've poked the bear 20. State attorneys general are fighting against these plans that oppose any government funds going to any projects that characterize the United States as irredeemably racist or founded on principles of racism, or that assign fault blame or bias to a particular race or to an individual because of his or her race. Folks, it's my firm belief that Democrats will rue the day that they linked arms with the Marxists on this issue. I think most suburban women who voted for the decent Old Joe Biden, they didn't think this was part of the bargain. And the next time they walk into the voting booth, they're going to have a chance to strike a blow against the racial industrial complex that wants to wreck America, as it robs us blind. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Glenn Loury, Professor of Economics at Brown University. Professor, it's good to see you tonight. Now, this Hannah-Jones dispute leads to a larger question. Why was a woman who distorts history, even up for a tenured position at any university in the first place?"

But 10 year, 10 years right at the heart of the University, where is the big book, where's the sustained body of work, where's the Ph.D., she's got a Master's degree, God loves her. There's nothing wrong with not having a Ph.D., but you think making someone a permanent member of the faculty of a serious university, you might want to see a little bit more depth. So, I'm not at all surprised the trustees might have been putting the political issues to the side at having that be a 10-year appointment from the start. My understanding is, their position is, let's see, five years, it's a renewable appointment, let's see how you do it and what you produce. And we'll see that strikes me as a quite liberal way of handling it."

Of the equity position is that as you say, we want to see disparities between the groups go away, we want to see the same number of black and Latino, white and Asian doing this or doing that, whether it's the School of Engineering, the medical school, the calculus department, whatever it is. Now, the groups are not performing to the same extent. If you insist upon equal outcomes, but you don't have equal performance, the only way you get it is by lowering standards. So, from my perspective, the insistence upon equity, to the - over and against equality of opportunity is a concession. It's a concession that we're going to not look at performance too closely, if doing so would prevent us from getting our numbers, right. And that's a bad thing."

I hope that we don't get to that point. But this is the kind of thing that would set that up. And we need to understand that there are consequences for these kinds of actions.

Case in point, California Governor Gavin Newsom is sending out roughly 2,000 door knockers to show up at citizens homes to inquire about their vaccination status. And the media, well, they're joining in. This is from \"USA Today,\" \"Fact Check, businesses can legally ask if patrons have been vaccinated. HIPAA does not apply.\" Of course, the prospect, though, of widespread vaccine shaming has Dr. Fauci and friends very excited."

      "utterance": "Thanks for having me on, Laura. It's important that we have made great progress in COVID-19. Patients are being treating early. Rates of hospitalizations and deaths are way down. But a common question I get in clinical practice is, do I need the COVID-19 vaccine if I've already had COVID-19? And very importantly, is there any risk to that? Well, the randomized trials, the registrational trials excluded patients with prior COVID-19. So we have no safety data, and to this day we have no studies demonstrating any clinical benefit. Now two studies out of the United Kingdom and one out of New York City show higher rates of vaccine adverse events when COVID-19 recovered patients are needlessly vaccinated. So in my view, these patients, it's contraindicated for them to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. No evidence of benefit, and only evidence of harm."

      "utterance": "It's irrational because young children particularly do not get very sick with COVID. They get fevers and headaches and tiredness and that's it. They don't spread the virus. They certainly don't die from the virus. So neither they nor the society around them has any interest in vaccinating them. And the only thing that could happen to them is they get some harm from the virus. And now we've started to see in the VAERS database 15-year-old children getting heart attacks, two years old dying a day after the vaccination, a six month old dying from the child's mother's vaccination and getting it through breast milk. So children have no reason to die from vaccination. That isn't going to help them or the society either."

And the gamble was the epidemic was going to be closed out with vaccination alone. And what we found is the vaccine does not provide complete protection, and now we're seeing really alarming rates of harm in the adverse event reporting system. So the CDC really immediately needs to have an external, unbiassed event adjudication committee and data sifting monitoring committee as it would in any clinical investigation."

      "speaker": "RISCH",
      "utterance": "Well, the absence of information is not information on the absence of risk. And pregnant women have not been study in the clinical trials of safety that were used by the manufacturers, and they haven't even been studied long enough to know what outcomes from first trimester vaccinations, so the first third of pregnancy, if women get vaccinated, we don't even know what happens to their offspring, if there's risks of stillbirth, genetic abnormalities. We know that fevers in the first third of pregnancy increase risk of genetic abnormalities in their children, and these vaccines frequently cause fevers when they're given. So they have not been studied. There is the complete absence of information about what happens when you vaccinate pregnant women."

Senator, could this be a model for other states given how these emergency powers were used and abused and reupped and reupped and reupped?"

And the issue of legislative responsibility and the executive branch responsibility was the main topic of all these states, whether they have Democratic or Republican governors, Democratic legislatures, Republican legislatures. The legislative branch of government is the voice of the people. And to be shut out for this period of time is just unacceptable, and it's not what our framers had intended. And so I believe that we're the first out, and we're excited about that, but I believe other states will follow."

So then we went the constitutional amendment process, which takes two sessions to complete. We completed it this year, went on the main ballot this primary, and the voters overwhelmingly supported it. So that's a process that we needed to do. But yes, we are preparing for not only the completion of this one, but for the next one so that people won't be subjected to the same type of unilateral control as this governor has had for the last 14 months."

      "utterance": "Yes, the language is clear, and now we could end the emergency at any point in time, or after 21 days he has to come to the legislature for an extension. So that's what the two ballot questions were. So we're planning on working with the governor. Our whole idea was that we needed to be at the table to have discussions, to be part of the process on how we govern Pennsylvania. And so we'll be jumping right in. We've already had some discussions with the governor, and we're going to be putting our opinions at the table on this. And then if we don't agree with the governor we'll end the emergency. But hopefully we can work together now as our framers intended."
