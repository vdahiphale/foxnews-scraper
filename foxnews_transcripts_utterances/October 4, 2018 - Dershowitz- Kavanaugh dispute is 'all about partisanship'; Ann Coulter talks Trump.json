      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" This is the 13th night in a row we have led this show with the Brett Kavanaugh story. And it looks like after delays and countless twists in the saga, it may finally be coming to a conclusion. The FBI investigation, one that Senator Jeff Flake demanded last Friday, appears to be wrapping up; a final vote could be held this weekend, that's what they're saying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But what's remarkable is that, after all we have learned, there are still basic questions that remain unanswered, central ones that pertain directly to the core allegations here, the ones that Christine Ford made more than two weeks ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yesterday, for example, Fox News obtained a written declaration from an ex- boyfriend of Christine Ford's. In that declaration, which was made under oath, the ex-boyfriend says that Ford once coached a friend through a polygraph exam to help her get a federal job. If true, that would contradict what Ford told Congress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The man also says that, during their entire six-year relationship, Ford never mentioned being a victim of sexual assault or of any other kind of trauma. He says that she flew on airplanes many times, including on small prop planes around Hawaii. You'll recall that her lawyer said she was too afraid to fly to come to Washington. They also said she was a claustrophobic. He claims she was not at all afraid of enclosed spaces. Are these claims true? We don't know. Ford disputes them and there is no evidence to support them independently. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But there's also no evidence you'll remember to support Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. And that is the point, we need to know more. But we don't know more because nobody is asking these questions and many other questions. For example, we still haven't seen Ford's therapy notes or the notes on the polygraph exam she says she took. Ford's legal team is only now at the very last moment offering to reveal these, but only if the FBI agrees to interview Christine Ford. Why weren't these notes turned over at the very beginning of all of this? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If the goal is to get to the truth, they would have been of course. Why has Ford apparently told different stories about whether she showed her therapy notes to The Washington Post or simply described their contents to the paper? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's significant because it bears directly on her credibility and Christine Ford's credibility is literally the only reason to believe that her story is true. So that matters. And there are other obvious unanswered questions. Here's this one. Ford says the assault defined her entire life. Apparently, she thought about it every day. It defined her academic performance, it affected all of her personal relationships, and yet she says she told not a single other human being about it for fully 30 years. How can that be? Well, here's an idea. In a Washington Post profile, Ford says that she \"came to understand her assault and the significance during a psychotherapy session.\" What does that mean exactly? Is Ford's story at least in part a recovered memory? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is a central question, because most psychiatrists consider recovered memories, however sincere, as roughly as reliable as dreams. It's worth getting a clear answer on that, but so far nobody has, because nobody has asked that question. Why is that? When an adult makes a serious allegation, asking real questions is the only correct response. It's on an attack to ask for follow-ups or probe inconsistencies, it's not victim shaming. In fact, it's patronizing not to. We don't consider Christine Ford a child. Many of her advocates clearly do; the press obviously does. Instead of gathering facts about this story, they are busy moralizing and lecturing the rest of us about how Brett Kavanaugh's very existence proves that an entire class of people is evil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just the other day, Donald Trump Jr. made the point that what he's been watching on television makes him fear for his sons. Watch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It was true then, it is true now, it always will be true. Now, you wouldn't think you'd have to say something that obvious in a developed country, one that literally has a statue of Martin Luther King on the National Mall. But we do have to say that we have no choice, and for the crime of arguing against racism, we are denounced by the Left as, yes, racists. Well that's insane.

At the time, Google said it has never changed search results for political reasons and it never will. We knew it was untrue then, now we can prove that it is untrue. This show has obtained internal Google emails in which an employee discusses editing YouTube's search results to suppress videos based on their political content. Here's one example. Last March, Google engineer Dong Jiao sent an email saying the company wanted to, \"demote low authoritative content on controversial queries to fight against fake news.\" This was not hypothetical. He said the company had already succeeded in suppressing unwanted videos, videos for searches like Hillary, and we're flattered here, Tucker. It's not clear which videos were suppressed because of Google won't admit it or tell us, but the email does indicate that Alex Jones and Infowars were a major target of this. Google says their efforts are not political and meant to fight conspiracy theories, though for the record we have never endorsed any kind of conspiracy through on this show and never would. And by the way, how does Google define a conspiracy theory. They haven't told us that either, or why a superpower global monopoly ought to be making that decision in the first place since they have a Congressional exemption in which they promised not to. They promised to be a conduit through which information flows and not a news site that edits it. Congress might want to rethink that agreement. Well, it's no speech - secret, rather, that free speech is evaporating in this country. Even if the government is still prevented from punishing your speech, you're more than likely than ever to be suspended from school, fired from your job, or banned from social media for saying something that descends from the consensus or the simply makes a few people feel bad.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" This is the 13th night in a row we have led this show with the Brett Kavanaugh story. And it looks like after delays and countless twists in the saga, it may finally be coming to a conclusion. The FBI investigation, one that Senator Jeff Flake demanded last Friday, appears to be wrapping up; a final vote could be held this weekend, that's what they're saying. But what's remarkable is that, after all we have learned, there are still basic questions that remain unanswered, central ones that pertain directly to the core allegations here, the ones that Christine Ford made more than two weeks ago. Yesterday, for example, Fox News obtained a written declaration from an ex- boyfriend of Christine Ford's. In that declaration, which was made under oath, the ex-boyfriend says that Ford once coached a friend through a polygraph exam to help her get a federal job. If true, that would contradict what Ford told Congress. The man also says that, during their entire six-year relationship, Ford never mentioned being a victim of sexual assault or of any other kind of trauma. He says that she flew on airplanes many times, including on small prop planes around Hawaii. You'll recall that her lawyer said she was too afraid to fly to come to Washington. They also said she was a claustrophobic. He claims she was not at all afraid of enclosed spaces. Are these claims true? We don't know. Ford disputes them and there is no evidence to support them independently. But there's also no evidence you'll remember to support Ford's allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. And that is the point, we need to know more. But we don't know more because nobody is asking these questions and many other questions. For example, we still haven't seen Ford's therapy notes or the notes on the polygraph exam she says she took. Ford's legal team is only now at the very last moment offering to reveal these, but only if the FBI agrees to interview Christine Ford. Why weren't these notes turned over at the very beginning of all of this? If the goal is to get to the truth, they would have been of course. Why has Ford apparently told different stories about whether she showed her therapy notes to The Washington Post or simply described their contents to the paper? That's significant because it bears directly on her credibility and Christine Ford's credibility is literally the only reason to believe that her story is true. So that matters. And there are other obvious unanswered questions. Here's this one. Ford says the assault defined her entire life. Apparently, she thought about it every day. It defined her academic performance, it affected all of her personal relationships, and yet she says she told not a single other human being about it for fully 30 years. How can that be? Well, here's an idea. In a Washington Post profile, Ford says that she \"came to understand her assault and the significance during a psychotherapy session.\" What does that mean exactly? Is Ford's story at least in part a recovered memory? This is a central question, because most psychiatrists consider recovered memories, however sincere, as roughly as reliable as dreams. It's worth getting a clear answer on that, but so far nobody has, because nobody has asked that question. Why is that? When an adult makes a serious allegation, asking real questions is the only correct response. It's on an attack to ask for follow-ups or probe inconsistencies, it's not victim shaming. In fact, it's patronizing not to. We don't consider Christine Ford a child. Many of her advocates clearly do; the press obviously does. Instead of gathering facts about this story, they are busy moralizing and lecturing the rest of us about how Brett Kavanaugh's very existence proves that an entire class of people is evil. Just the other day, Donald Trump Jr. made the point that what he's been watching on television makes him fear for his sons. Watch."

You should not attack people for their immutable characteristics, period. We have made that point consistently again and again over the past two years on this show. You shouldn't ever reduce people to their skin color, because they're much more than that. You ought to treat people as individuals, unique human beings, not faceless members of a tribe sorted by hue. That's exactly the argument you could have made in 1960 against Bull Connor and if we'd been there, we would have made that argument. It's the same argument we are making today. It was true then, it is true now, it always will be true. Now, you wouldn't think you'd have to say something that obvious in a developed country, one that literally has a statue of Martin Luther King on the National Mall. But we do have to say that we have no choice, and for the crime of arguing against racism, we are denounced by the Left as, yes, racists. Well that's insane. In fact, it's Orwellian, it's the mirror image of the truth. But there is a reason that they are saying it. Our elites stoke race hatred in order to divide this country against itself. People are easier to control when they are divided into tribes sorted by color, it is that simple. It is also that evil, just like the racism they are peddling to you. We will never endorse that against any group at any time, period. Francey Hakes is a former DOJ National Coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction; she joins us tonight. Francey, thanks for coming on. Now, I know that you have worked in this field for so long and that's why I wanted a reality check from you on some of these outstanding questions. And I want to say the obvious at the outset, I'm not impugning anyone's character or story. But I think it's fair to ask the most basic question, which is, is this a recovered memory or not?

It was apparently an effort to promote harassment, intimidation, who knows what else, against those lawmakers. Now, authorities believe they have arrested the man who did it. He is called Jackson Cosko. He's an intern for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas. Cosko also previously worked for Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. He's been charged with burglary, witness tampering, making threats, and identity theft in relation to these actions. We will of course continue to follow this story. Senator Lindsey Graham, as you know, has emerged really out of nowhere as one of Brett Kavanaugh's most aggressive defenders. He continued that defense today at The Atlantic Festival, named after the ludicrous magazine that sponsors it, and he was booed for what he said. Watch this."

The biggest threat turns out not to be the government, but instead corporations, schools and especially the online mob. What happened and more importantly, how can you say what you really think in the face of all of this? David Portnoy of Barstool Sports is managing to do that. He joins us next to discuss how. We are interested in what happened to free speech and why the people who once defended it now attack it, there's a long and detailed chapter on that in our new book, Ship the Fools, just came out. Hope you read it."

      "utterance": "Previously on this show, we've told you how employees at Google discussed altering search results to undermine the White House's immigration policies. At the time, Google said it has never changed search results for political reasons and it never will. We knew it was untrue then, now we can prove that it is untrue. This show has obtained internal Google emails in which an employee discusses editing YouTube's search results to suppress videos based on their political content. Here's one example. Last March, Google engineer Dong Jiao sent an email saying the company wanted to, \"demote low authoritative content on controversial queries to fight against fake news.\" This was not hypothetical. He said the company had already succeeded in suppressing unwanted videos, videos for searches like Hillary, and we're flattered here, Tucker. It's not clear which videos were suppressed because of Google won't admit it or tell us, but the email does indicate that Alex Jones and Infowars were a major target of this. Google says their efforts are not political and meant to fight conspiracy theories, though for the record we have never endorsed any kind of conspiracy through on this show and never would. And by the way, how does Google define a conspiracy theory. They haven't told us that either, or why a superpower global monopoly ought to be making that decision in the first place since they have a Congressional exemption in which they promised not to. They promised to be a conduit through which information flows and not a news site that edits it. Congress might want to rethink that agreement. Well, it's no speech - secret, rather, that free speech is evaporating in this country. Even if the government is still prevented from punishing your speech, you're more than likely than ever to be suspended from school, fired from your job, or banned from social media for saying something that descends from the consensus or the simply makes a few people feel bad. Dave Portnoy is at the very center of this. You may know him as El Presidente. He's the founder of Barstool Sports, the beating heart of it. Barstool Sports is not a political site, but it has faced repeated demands that it be censored, so we want to talk to him about what that is like. Dave, thanks a lot for coming on."

They hear, they see something linked on Twitter, they see somebody maybe comments about an article, and then when I react to them or talk to them or go any deeper, they literally have no clue what we do. They're just saying this cycle -- this vicious cycle basically on social media and it all just feeds on itself.

And if they don't like something you said or they think a joke isn't funny, or they take something literally, I've always explained it this way. For us, it would be if somebody went to a comedy show and they didn't have a ticket, they didn't know who the comedian was, they walked into the room, they heard a joke, then they walked out in the street and said, \"Hey, you'll never believe what this guy's saying.\" But they give no context of how the joke was told, where they saw it, that's what happens a lot of times with people like us, and I think a lot of people know comedian doesn't--"

I will not let people who have no idea what we do, no idea how hard we've work, no idea how long we did it. We out-worked, out-hustled, out-blogged everybody else that we did.

But, Meryl Streep was credible in Sophie's Choice. She wasn't at Auschwitz, she hasn't committed suicide, no we're not talking about just judging someone's performance. That's why we have evidence and wow the evidence is overwhelmingly against Christine Blasey Ford, not a licensed psychologist. I do think the tide seems to have turned because I am a hate watcher, I mostly watch MSNBC and CNN, and I noticed since these latest -- the ex- boyfriend of Dr. Ford, isn't Dr. Ford, has come out and said I lived with her for six years, she never talked about sexual assault, she flew all the time, she's not afraid of closed spaces, oh yes, and she stole $600 from me.
