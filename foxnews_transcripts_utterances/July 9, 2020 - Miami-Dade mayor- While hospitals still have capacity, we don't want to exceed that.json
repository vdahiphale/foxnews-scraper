And now the positivity rate, meaning those who have tested 24.3 percent have tested positive. Mayor, what number concerns you the most? Is it the positivity rate going up so dramatically over the past few weeks?",

You know, even in Florida, the ICUs are about 85 percent full, which means they still have beds. And that's a level one. That's really no surge capacity. And I just point out, you know, if you think back to March, March, New York State, people were talking that the governor of New York State, Governor Cuomo, was talking about 140,000 hospitalizations. 140,000 people in beds. Right now, in Miami or not Miami, in Florida as a whole, we're in the low thousands. OK. Well, under 10,000. In California, 6000. In Texas, under 10,000.

COREY LEWANDOWSKI, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, it sounds so familiar. Look, I had to go back and pick up my book \"Let Trump be Trump\" and I had to open up to page one to remember what they said about Donald Trump as they approached election day. let me just read you a couple of these. This is the Washington Post, October 24th, Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero. The Los Angeles Times, November 6, 2016, our final map has Hillary Clinton winning 352 electoral votes. Here is the Huffington Post October 27, 2016. Donald Trump stands a real chance to being the biggest loser in modern election politics. Look, prognosticators were wrong. This particular group was also wrong in 2016 when they predicted Donald Trump would lose by six points to Hillary Clinton. So why do we give them any credence? The truth is looking all the way back in the way back machine of the New York Times of 1988, when they predicted that then Governor Michael Dukakis was going to defeat then Vice President George H.W. Bush by a massive total of 55 to 38 percent. They're wrong every time, but they're only wrong when it counts for the left.",

As the nation's top infectious disease expert says, he is cautiously optimistic that a COVID-19 vaccine will be developed by the end of the year. President Trump said this about a potential timeline earlier today."

      "utterance": "This as nine states now report more than 100,000 COVID-19 cases. Florida is among them as it continues to emerge as a global epicenter of the surge, hitting a record high one day death toll today. In moments, we will be joined by Carlos Gimenez, the mayor of Florida's hardest hit county, Miami-Dade, where one in four residents who have been tested have tested positive. And later tonight, Corey Lewandowski with the Trump campaign's reaction to Joe Biden's lead in the polls. Plus, Economist Stephen Moore on Biden joining forces with Bernie Sanders and KT McFarland on new developments in the investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. But we begin tonight with Mayor Carlos Gimenez. Mayor, thank you so much for joining us. I want to put these numbers to get everybody up to speed on the board, if I can, to show people where we are today in Miami-Dade, 1987 new cases, 24 new deaths. And now the positivity rate, meaning those who have tested 24.3 percent have tested positive. Mayor, what number concerns you the most? Is it the positivity rate going up so dramatically over the past few weeks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAYOR CARLOS GIMENEZ, R-MIAMI-DADE COUNTY",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's it. We know that there's a heck of a lot more people that with the virus in the past than the official numbers. And so, we've gone from around 8 percent positive to about two weeks, two and a half weeks ago, and risen kind of dramatically to over, really over 25 percent is the last number that I've got. So, that's a pretty sharp increase in about three weeks. So, that's the number that really concerns me. How many people are going to the hospital? We've got double the number of people in the hospital. Double the number of people in ICUs. We have about 100 additional people in our ventilators. And so, while we still have capacity, we never want to exceed the capacity of our health system here to take care of lives that are safe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And that is a key metric because the hospitalizations, everybody looks out across the country. And we did some research. And you're right, sir, up 70 percent over the past couple of weeks. The question, though, remains you still do have capacity. So, it doesn't appear as if the hospitals in Florida are being overwhelmed. And that was kind of the goal in the beginning of flattening the curve. So that's a good sign for the state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIMENEZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is. It is so far. But look, we keep going like this and we have more and more. We are increasing the number of people going into the hospital, even though they're younger and they're staying. You know, the length of stays is less. It's just the sheer number. And so, the positivity rate is really what we need to start to take down. And so that's why we issued a curfew order last week in order to stop social activity, because I think that's driving a lot. We closed the interior dining rooms of restaurants in Miami-Dade today. And so, you know, we're taking additional measures here of masks orders in and out, inside and outside, mandatory and additional measures and enforcement measures to see that people will comply with the rules because it actually if they had just follow the rules, we wouldn't be in this situation."
    },

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",

They're kind of against this closing back up again because they want to know the science and the data. And a lot of them are saying, well, now we would like the mayor to show us the science and the data. And, sir, do you have any information? Do you have statistics, contact tracing that actually points to restaurants or restaurants, kind of like beaches, just low hanging fruit, where they're kind of the first ones that are shut down when things get tight."
    },

      "speaker": "GIMENEZ",
      "utterance": "They have to be and because the restaurants are - it's the only industry that I know of that you have to take your mask off inside to do what a restaurant is, eat and drink. And we all know now, you know, the science is telling us that the virus is hanging around in the air on interior spaces for hours. And so, it's a very risky business. And so, you know, I feel sorry for them--"

      "speaker": "GIMENEZ",
      "utterance": "We feel that actually what would cause this is the behavior of people. But when you have an industry where you have to take the mask off in an interior space and it's the only one that we do, we're not going to - that's the one place that we have to close because we don't want to spread it anymore. We already have a positivity rate over 25 percent here in Miami-Dade County. That means that when you're in a restaurant, the odds are that many people in that restaurant are positive with COVID-19 spreading the germs in an interior space, that's incredibly dangerous. And that's the only thing - not like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",

I mean, we found a restaurant in Wuhan, sir, that had actual - they had proof positive that a man contacts in the restaurant spread the virus because of the air conditioning. The restaurant tours are only asking, look, do they have the science, and can we see the data? And we haven't seen that anywhere across the country, except that it seems like it's a bad outfit when you don't have a mask on. I want to move on if I can. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says that he thinks a lot of this is, you know, media coverage taking this out of context, politicizing this. He says he wouldn't hesitate to put his kids in school. Listen to him and I'll get your response."

I have a newborn. I have a two-year-old, I have a three-year-old. They're not old enough to go to school. So, obviously they won't be in kindergarten or anything coming up. But I would not hesitate to putting them in, in terms of the risk."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "And sir, the President has also said he would put some pressure on governors to kind of open these schools up. Where do you stand on the opening of school's subject, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIMENEZ",
      "utterance": "Well, look, the administration also said there are different areas, different hotspots may get different rules. And so, we're a hotspot. And so, we may get different rules. And so, look, we have a positivity rate here of over 25 percent. So, I had conversations today with the superintendent of schools and we're going to come up with a plan of how we can open up schools, but we have to reach a certain threshold. Again, listening to our doctors and our medical advisers asking what would be that threshold which is safe for our children to go to school. There's nothing more that would please me. Nothing that would please me more than have our kids go to school. But we are a hot spot here in Miami-Dade County and we're going to make sure that our kids are safe. And so, we're going to do whatever we need to do to make sure that they're safe. That's one of the reasons why we make - taking these measures to kind of drive down these positivity rates, get below the gating threshold that the administration put on less than 10 percent positive rate, which is a gating - that's their threshold. We want to get below that before we say that the kids, you know, really can go back to school in a classroom setting."

And I know, Alex, you're all about kind of cooler heads prevailing on this. But you look at the Gallup poll, I want to put this on the screen if you can. And the Gallup poll says the following, 65 percent think that COVID is getting little or a lot worse. Only 23 percent think it's getting better. What do you say to the 65 percent who are kind of freaked out by the latest statistics and numbers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALEX BERENSON, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think when you look at these big case numbers, they are - they're going to frighten people, especially if the media doesn't do a good job of reporting on the case mix, reporting on what's happening in hospitals. And by the way. I don't mean to say that there's no reason to pay attention, not reason for concern about what's happening in Miami, what's happening in Houston, what's happening in Arizona, what's happening in California, by the way, which gets much less attention because, you know, California has a Democratic governor and is a blue state. And so, the problems there tend to get less attention. But there are problems there, too. I would actually push back on you a little bit in terms of what you were talking to the mayor about. I don't think that closing bars and restaurants right now inside is a bad idea necessarily. There is evidence of cluster transmission there. And if things are getting a little bit hot and that's a way to cool them down a little bit, that might be a good idea. But when we really look at what's happening in hospitals, even in these most affected states, they still have capacity. You know, even in Florida, the ICUs are about 85 percent full, which means they still have beds. And that's a level one. That's really no surge capacity. And I just point out, you know, if you think back to March, March, New York State, people were talking that the governor of New York State, Governor Cuomo, was talking about 140,000 hospitalizations. 140,000 people in beds. Right now, in Miami or not Miami, in Florida as a whole, we're in the low thousands. OK. Well, under 10,000. In California, 6000. In Texas, under 10,000. So, these numbers are just orders of magnitude lower than what the fears were back in March and April. There's no evidence the hospitals are not able to handle this right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "No. And I think that's a fair assessment. And just kind of going back to our debate with the mayor there, I wasn't talking about bars because I agree with you. There is evidence of cluster events at bars. Haven't seen it at restaurants that maybe you have. I haven't seen it from inside of restaurants except for Wuhan. That was my question. Haven't seen any science against beaches and restaurants that points to events happening--"

      "speaker": "BERENSON",
      "utterance": "I mean, I would say, let's separate beaches and restaurant. Beaches, you know, for three months, I've been screaming that outdoor transmission is not a risk here. We know that. And that's one reason why encouraging people to wear masks outdoors are much less making them is so silly. If we were smart about what we told people, then the few recommendations that really should be made and paid attention to, I think people would pay more attention to. And let's go to schools for a second. Unlike the governor, I actually do have children of school age and I am so eager to get them back in school come this fall because I think it's so important to them that my family is actually considering to moving to a state where we know the schools are going to be open. There is just no evidence that children are at serious risk from this. And for us to deny them to even consider denying them another year of education is beyond a bad idea."

And, you know, I've been getting a lot of e-mails from people saying, you know, various colleges are doing aggressive contact tracing. They're going to if they're letting people back in at all, they're going to do some randomized tests. And I would ask you, if they were doing this for, let's say, sexually transmitted infections and forcing people to get tested and doing contact tracing against people's will, what the outcry would be? Well, for Coronavirus, for most people under 25, the risk is comparable to an STI because it's so low. And I just - I think we have lost any semblance of rationality in our public health debate here."

    {
      "speaker": "BERENSON",

And that's why until this year, if you look at the recommendations that the CDC and other places made about pandemics, they did not encourage the wearing of masks. And I don't know what has changed in the science. I'm talking about outside. I'm talking about community wearing by, well, people. Universal masking. I don't know what's changed."

I see you know Joe Biden, Stephen Moore, to you first, kind of laying out his economic agenda here.

And there is no middle ground position in any of this. Even Bernie Sanders said that this is the most progressive Left-wing agenda since Franklin Roosevelt. The only thing that he got wrong about that is it's to the Left of what Franklin Roosevelt ran on 50, 60 years ago. Look, I think if you look at the taxes, if you look at the fact that he wants to destroy the American oil and gas industry, by the way, that's 4 to 5 million blue collar jobs that are lost right out of the gate. How do you - here's the question I would pose to the Vice President. Mr. Vice President, how do you create jobs by taxing the very employers that create the jobs. You're doubling the capital gains tax. You're increasing the tax on American corporations. You're increasing the tax on our 30 million small businesses. I don't see how in the world that adds up to more jobs."

FDR created one of the most - the most - the greatest period of economic growth in American history. And if that is what Joe Biden is going to do, then I'll take it. I've got to tell you that, Trace. And let's talk about what's in that plan that Joe Biden talked about. In that plan is fund. Desperate need of funds for state and local governments. And we know this in your last segment, you talked about reopening schools. Here's what's happening all across the country. A lot of these cities and states are cash strapped because a lot of this money is going to COVID relief. They don't know how to pay their teachers. They're laying off teachers, they're laying off firefighters. They desperately need money. And that's what's in Joe Biden's plan. What's also in Joe Biden's plan is how he's going to fix many; help extend unemployment benefits to many folks who are currently unemployed. Right now, last week alone, 1.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. At the end of this month, they're going to lose the extra $600 that the federal government chipped in. Joe Biden is going to extend that. That's all things that all Americans could benefit from. We've heard from the Donald Trump is none of that."

No mention of the Green New Deal or abolishing ICE Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Did that surprise you at all, Steve, that none of that was in?

I care more about the green movement than I do about blue-collar workers. But look, I've got to get this off my chest, Franklin Roosevelt was not an economic success story. We had 10 years of 10 percent unemployment or higher. Richard, if you think that's an economic success and that's what Joe Biden is going to do for the country.

And then you can't say that he's the most progressive. He's the most progressive candidate you've ever seen. If Green New Deal is in the plan and Medicare for All is in the plan, it's because Joe Biden is a moderate candidate. Right. And you can't also defy the chronicles of history. And what we know from history is this. When Roosevelt took the keys to this economy in the late in the late 1930s, the economy is doing terrible. And when he left and when he died, the economy is doing way better. And these are the facts and that's the truth. And the American people know it.

The court is unanimous, and the President does not have absolute immunity when it comes to a state criminal subpoena.

But the president's legal team has made very clear, that opening is there for them to go reargue this case maybe argue additional grounds. They are going to take their time doing that. So, I wouldn't expect those documents to be handed over anytime soon."

      "utterance": "We are disappointed in the decision to the extent it did not accept our argument, the government's argument about the extent of the president's immunity. But as a practical matter, the decision made very clear that the president just is not at the mercy of litigants and investigators. And that there are protections and defenses that can be raised."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, because when Congress comes to the president with the subpoena, the chief justice writing for the majority talk to a number of factors that you have to look at is a legitimate legislative purpose. What they are trying to get at can't be a fishing expedition. Is there anywhere else they can those documents without going to the president? And acknowledging that this is very disruptive to a president in his or her role as commander in chief. And also noting that, listen, these are two competing branches and especially if they are going to be from opposing parties no matter if it's a Republican or Democrat in the White House, an independent, or whatever. There can be other motivations for congressional committees to come after a president. So, in that case, they said you're definitely not getting these records yet, they are all of these considerations to take into account. We don't think the lower courts did that properly, so we are sending them back. So, the Democratically controlled committees these three House committees won't get any of those documents any time either. So, the bottom line with both cases, I don't think anybody gets these documents before Election Day which is what everybody -- well, some of them, at least the House committees we could say they were probably aimed at."

Now if he is reelected, those House committees are really going to fight for those documents. Justice Thomas in his dissent said listen, I don't think they should get the documents, if they want them, they should go through impeachment, which there have been whisperers of that if he is reelected that they would try that again. But listen, that New York investigator or the district attorney there is not going to give up on that case either. So you can see that that's going to go through fruition.

FiveThirtyEight pointing to stretch of positive polling averages for Joe Biden in both battleground states and nationwide with a more than nine- point advantage. Declaring, quote, \"the race between President Trump and Joe Biden is verging on a landslide. That's not a word we use lightly.\" They go on to say that things can always change, but recent numbers show President Trump, quote, \"treading on thin electoral ice.\" Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser Corey Lewandowski is here to respond to that. Corey, verging on a landslide. Thank you for joining us, sir. First of all. Verging on a landslide, thin electoral ice sounds kind of like fighting words if you are in the Trump campaign. COREY LEWANDOWSKI, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, it sounds so familiar. Look, I had to go back and pick up my book \"Let Trump be Trump\" and I had to open up to page one to remember what they said about Donald Trump as they approached election day. let me just read you a couple of these. This is the Washington Post, October 24th, Donald Trump's chances of winning are approaching zero. The Los Angeles Times, November 6, 2016, our final map has Hillary Clinton winning 352 electoral votes. Here is the Huffington Post October 27, 2016. Donald Trump stands a real chance to being the biggest loser in modern election politics. Look, prognosticators were wrong. This particular group was also wrong in 2016 when they predicted Donald Trump would lose by six points to Hillary Clinton. So why do we give them any credence? The truth is looking all the way back in the way back machine of the New York Times of 1988, when they predicted that then Governor Michael Dukakis was going to defeat then Vice President George H.W. Bush by a massive total of 55 to 38 percent. They're wrong every time, but they're only wrong when it counts for the left."

Biden's lead has hovered within a tight band of 8.9 to 9.6 percentage points since mid-June, that's according to FiveThirtyEight's national polling average. But look, it shows, also shows the polls, he is tied with Joe Biden in Florida which is significant because he was down and he's also narrowing the ground in Pennsylvania. Your thoughts."

Look, Donald Trump won all of those states in the last election when they said he was not going to. Florida is always a battleground. Donald Trump only won by 113,000 votes in 2016. He won Michigan by 10,704 votes. We are going to campaign extremely hard for every single vote, but this election, here's where the president wants to do. He wants to open our schools and close our borders. That's exactly the opposite of what the Democrats want to do. They want to keep our schools closed and they want to open our borders. This is about the opportunity to maintain your lifestyle if you like it. If you do, you have to vote for Donald Trump, if you want somebody to change your lifestyle, then you are going to vote for Joe Biden. That's what this election is about.

This is about the election of 2020 and this is what the Democratic Party does every four years, they use black people, they use the misery, they use our pain to get elected, to get power. What you have here is again -- and one thing I want to point out, one out of six of these protesters in these marches are black. One out of six. You have -- every time you have -- hold on, you're going to have black people in the front of these lines doing the things that they are doing now. So if we want to really understand what the issues are, let's go back to the beginning of the year where real black lives were impacted. We have the lowest unemployment in the history of our country for blacks, Asians, Hispanics, women, veterans, teens.
