Here you have Russia sitting there trying to take over Ukraine. They're taking American hostages. You've got China who's trying to bully Taiwan and scare the rest of the world into in any way defending Taiwan. You've got Afghanistan now harboring terrorists that are trying to kill Americans by allowing al Qaeda back into Afghanistan. It's been a total mess. And what we've seen is Biden has run scared from a shadow, the entire administration. We've got to start showing strength and preventing wars. We've got to start taking the world back towards an avenue of peace and not one that runs from any enemy that seems to shout louder.

Finland and Sweden make that alliance even stronger. Finland is very strong militarily. But think about this: we have never had to defend a NATO country in the history of its alliance. The only time they've ever had to use their defense forces was after 9/11 when we asked them to, and all of NATO went to Afghanistan in defense of us. So there's a reason that when you look at who Russia has invaded in the past, they've invaded Georgia. They've invaded Moldova. They've invaded Ukraine -- all countries outside of NATO, because that's where they go after. They go after countries of weakness. This alliance is strong. This alliance needs to stay strong. That is why Russia is staying away from it. We have to also remember, we never take our eyes off of China. China is right now trying to gobble up as much agricultural land as they can. Look at what they're doing. They're putting cables in rural areas. They just bought land near North Dakota's Grand Forks Air Force Base because that's a big military drone technology hub.

Did it go far enough? Does it make the base happy, particularly progressives? And on top of that, I would even go further and ask, did this process, this year and a half long process, did it do more harm to this party than it did good? At the end of the day we saw a lot of interparty fighting, a lot of name- calling publicly on Twitter, on the steps of The Capitol, on TV.

In order to do so, they are taking a series of rapid-fire amendment votes in a process called vote-a-rama. It's been underway for more than nine hours. In the 50/50 Senate and without Republican support, they'll likely need Vice President Kamala Harris to cast the tie-breaking vote to send the package to the House of Representatives. In a moment we will speak with Democratic Senator Ben Cardin. But first, we will turn to Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with the latest -- Chad."

The hope is to get Democrats on the record taking bad votes. Now, later today, Vice President Harris will cast a tie-breaking vote to pass the bill.

I'm very confident. I've seen discipline over these votes where Democrats have stuck together.

And we did it paying for it through the corporations that have escaped taxation through better collection of taxes on high income people, and we reduced the deficit at the same time. That's quite an accomplishment. So, yes, there are things that I would like to have seen done that weren't done, including in the tax code, but this is a great bill for progressives. It's a great bill for America. It's a great bill for American families."

On balance, this is a win for our environment and a win for America clean energy."

So, that's good news for the inflation and we're dealing with the cost centers the typical families are facing in health care and energy costs. So this should be helping to American families and should be helpful for our economy and will help us deal with the inflation."

    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "You're right. I have worked with Republicans and Democrats to try to modernize the IRS. Most Americans pay their taxes. Most Americans have their taxes taken out from their payroll and there's never a question of their paying their fair share of taxes. But for those that have complicated incomes, those who have high incomes, they're the ones that are escaping. It's been estimated that we have a $1 trillion leakage in tax collections every year. I think most Americans want a level playing field. They want to pay their taxes but they want everyone else paying their taxes. So I think this is a fair situation. The IRS desperately needs help and this bill gives them the help they need."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "Well, millions of Americans aren't going to be impacted by that other than getting better service from the IRS, having their telephone answered, getting the questions they need in order to comply with our tax laws. The auditing is going to be focused on those with high income, the large corporations, et cetera. So, there's no reason to be fearful. And if you paid your taxes and if you comply with our laws, you should want to make sure everyone else does that."

      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "Let me say this: doing all these bills by reconciliation is not the right way to do it. The Republicans did it in 2017 on the tax bill. We are obligated to use this process because we can't get Republicans to work with us on fundamental issues such as -- such as energy, climate and health care costs. But it would be much better if we could have a process where we work together and have the richness of every member participating in the process, bipartisan process. That's what I do in legislation that I have worked with Republicans to get to the finish line. That's what we did in regards to the NATO session with Finland and Sweden. That's what we did in regards to our veterans. That's what we did in regards to the infrastructure bill. That's what we did in regards to the chips and science bill. We have a good record of working together. Let's work together for the American people and let's not threaten that we're going to shut down government or do things that are -- that are wrong. Let's figure out ways that we can work together buried"

You know, China is trying to bully us the same way they try and bully their own people, and we shouldn't have it. Taiwan is an island of 23 million people who have managed to be free for 70-plus years. We should always have the backs of our allies and we should always hold our enemies to account. They are a huge force when it comes to our economy and we need to make sure that Taiwan knows that we're going to be there for them.

He's trying to pretend that there's going to be a war. He's trying to scare them. But America should never respond to fear. We should always focus on preventing wars. The way you prevent wars is you don't shy away from having the backs of your allies and let your enemies know what we expect of them.

They're asking us to help them with equipment and asking us to help them defend themselves. What you have to look at Biden is look at the world in which we live in. Here you have Russia sitting there trying to take over Ukraine. They're taking American hostages. You've got China who's trying to bully Taiwan and scare the rest of the world into in any way defending Taiwan. You've got Afghanistan now harboring terrorists that are trying to kill Americans by allowing al Qaeda back into Afghanistan. It's been a total mess. And what we've seen is Biden has run scared from a shadow, the entire administration. We've got to start showing strength and preventing wars. We've got to start taking the world back towards an avenue of peace and not one that runs from any enemy that seems to shout louder. And that's we watched Biden do and I think it's a terrible mistake and we have to snap out it."

And so, I think that's great. But what this is very telling is if you're standing, you know, comfortable and free on a balcony, you can bet there are other terrorists all over Afghanistan. Mark my words -- had we never had that blunder in Afghanistan, we would not be having the war you are seeing in Ukraine. We would not have al Qaeda terrorists sitting there running free in Afghanistan. We would not have China showing the arrogance that they're showing over Taiwan. This all happened because of how America showed weakness. Now we have to find our strength and we better get to work and we better get to work soon."

The only time they've ever had to use their defense forces was after 9/11 when we asked them to, and all of NATO went to Afghanistan in defense of us. So there's a reason that when you look at who Russia has invaded in the past, they've invaded Georgia. They've invaded Moldova. They've invaded Ukraine -- all countries outside of NATO, because that's where they go after. They go after countries of weakness. This alliance is strong. This alliance needs to stay strong. That is why Russia is staying away from it. We have to also remember, we never take our eyes off of China. China is right now trying to gobble up as much agricultural land as they can. Look at what they're doing. They're putting cables in rural areas. They just bought land near North Dakota's Grand Forks Air Force Base because that's a big military drone technology hub.

What I will tell you is, look, if there's a place for me, I look at the craziness in the world, I look at what's happening with this woke culture and our schools wanting our kids to decide their gender, I look at the fact that we've got men playing women's sports, I look at the fact that we got our military focused on gender pronoun classes. What I will tell you is we need to snap out of it. This is absolute craziness. We've got enemies trying to come after us and America has been naive, it's been a weak, and it's been asleep at the wheel. I'm just saying, sometimes, it takes a woman. And Margaret Thatcher said, if you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman. We should not take our eyes off of 2022. If we don't win in 2022, there won't be a 2024. So we need to stay humble, disciplined, and win that. And then if there's a place for me, I've never lost a race, I'm not going to start now. We'll see what happens and we'll go forward. But we need to get America strong again. We need to start focusing on our foreign policy in a way we haven't done in a while, and we're going to need to focus on it for the next 20 years. We need to bring sanity back to our domestic policy. And we need to start fighting for Americans again -- fighting for their wallets, fighting for their children's education, fighting for opportunities, and making sure we get back on track.

Proving they deserve to be there when they win is the other half of the battle. We expect every person that is elected in November that they should fight on their first day. They shouldn't wait until 2024. We need to see Congress putting bills on Joe Biden's desk. He can't veto everything. Instead of jumping on TV and fighting and showing rhetoric, we want to start seeing Congress get something done. The American people are tired of seeing what's happening at the border.

Yes, so we're watching this vote-a-rama go on. It started off at 11:00 last night. It continues. I think we're expecting a final passage vote in the next hour or so. And, look, Republicans are trying to not only slow down the process as much as they can. I think Lindsey Graham said he was going to make this hell for Democrats. But I think, don't be fooled. They're not going to walk away empty-handed. They are getting as much midterm ammo as possible by putting Democrats -- having them vote on -- taking these very uncomfortable votes. For Democrats, I think, obviously, if they do pass this, which - which they will, as expected, this will be a win. But my question is, and I think Francesca can speak to this, is, how big of a win? Did it go far enough? Does it make the base happy, particularly progressives? And on top of that, I would even go further and ask, did this process, this year and a half long process, did it do more harm to this party than it did good? At the end of the day we saw a lot of interparty fighting, a lot of name- calling publicly on Twitter, on the steps of The Capitol, on TV. And then we saw the president, the leader of this party, someone who has many years of Senate experience, someone who was supposed to be the dealmaker, as you even call him in your piece this morning, and he didn't turn out to be that. This is not happening because of him. And I think several people in the Democratic Party feel a little let down looking for leadership in the president and didn't really get it."

FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"USA TODAY\": And Democrats do say that the president is on a hot streak with this. But when you talk to activists and voters and progressive lawmakers, they do want to see more from President Biden. They really want to see him test the limits of his executive authority in the way that his predecessors have. When it comes to issues like immigration, you know, the former president, President Donald Trump, he - he was repeatedly using his executive power under migration. President Obama, he used his executive power to create the DACA program. What progressives would like to see President Biden do take action on those issues and more, such as abortion rights. Abortion is the number one issue for Democrats heading into the election according to the latest \"USA Today\"/Suffolk polling."

So, what we've seen in Kansas is Democrats being able to reframe the conversation a little bit and talk about what they want to do. In politics you want to talk about your issue and have your opponent talk about your issue. You don't want to talk about your opponent's issue. That's where Republicans need to be. Any time they're talking about anything other than inflation, it may be rising crime and immigration, they're losing a - they're losing the battle."

And then Speaker Pelosi sort of feeling a little taken aback when she was asked about the president's comments and said that she never really heard from the president directly.

Luckily for Democrats, most Republican candidates are not listening to Doug Heye right now."

      "utterance": "Yes, exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "No, the -- the fact is that more and more of the candidates who were being nominated in these Republican primaries are more focused on issues like election denialism, are - were out there celebrating in the seats when the Hobbs (ph) decision came down and said that they were going to drive more restrictive measures on abortion in whatever offices they won. They're focusing on the issues that you heard at CPAC. You weren't seeing a lot of panels at CPAC on inflation, you were seeing panels on the 2020 election and whether it was stolen. You weren't seeing big thought leaders speaking on how to -- on delivering a conservative economic message, you saw Viktor Orban as the -- as the keynote. The base of the party right now, I agree with Doug, is not reflective of where most of the party is. The fact is, in Kansas -- I don't know if you should read too much into it, but 20 percent of Republicans, about, voted with the Democrats and the independents to protect abortion rights. There is a big centrist coalition out there. It feels like Democrats are speaking more to them - they're not speaking to the Democratic base right now, they're speaking more to them, whereas Republicans who are speaking to the CPAC crowd might end up being the ones a little bit more out of step."

      "speaker": "HEYE",
      "utterance": "And, Mike, here, electorally, is why that matters. Think of Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle, Richard Mourdock, Todd Akin. What do they all have in common? They won their nomination and lost the general election. Republicans have left four Senate seats on the table in the past 10, 12 years and Mitch McConnell is very fearful of some of the Republican candidates, and gubernatorial candidates doing the same thing this cycle."

    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

      "speaker": "HEYE",
      "utterance": "Governor's races I think is where you start to look at that. Pennsylvania and Arizona being the two prominent examples. Otherwise, it's really hard to extrapolate Kansas affecting a particular congressional race. But it's that larger conversation. And so as we have these trigger laws, as we have other measures on the ballot, Republicans, if you're not talking about inflation, you're losing your - you're losing your message."

    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "And the one thing I'll say, the one thing I think you can look at Kansas and - and - and really take note of was the turnout, right? You saw presidential level turnout in a primary where there was really no big Democratic primary going on, right? There's the -"

      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "And no doubt in Kansas you did see in conservative, rural counties, in some cases 40 percent of people voting no on that ballot measure. But I want to come back to the point that you made, Doug, about these untested candidates. The concern I'm hearing from conservative activists is that when Republicans aren't prepared to talk about abortion, that you could come into instances where you run into races that should have been safe seats or competitive seats for Republicans and then candidates make missteps because they were not prepared to define their position on the issue."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HASNIE",
      "utterance": "I don't think that they're confident publicly or privately. I think if you listen to Mitch McConnell, who just spoke with Bret Baier on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" right here in this room, I don't think that you hear confidence. I think he was preparing everybody for the worse-case scenario, saying that he wasn't sure that they were going to be able to take back the Senate. And I think it's baffling when all you need is to flip one state. You have four flappable states and you're seeing Trump-backed candidates not doing well. Take Pennsylvania for example. Dr. Oz is trailing behind Fetterman, when he had the entire space to campaign freely because Fetterman was still recovering from a stroke. Didn't take advantage of that. Down in Georgia you're seeing the same thing with Herschel Walker trailing behind as well. I think Republicans privately know what the problem is and they know that it is these candidates. I think publicly they continue to endorse, to support, and to campaign for these candidates. And, at the end of the day, if these candidates can't win, it's -- you can't just point the finger at Trump. They're going to be pointing the fingers at each other too."
