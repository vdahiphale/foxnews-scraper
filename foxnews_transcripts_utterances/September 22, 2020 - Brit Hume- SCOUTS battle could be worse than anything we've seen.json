      "sentences": "Good evening, everybody. I am Martha MacCallum in New York and this is THE STORY. President Trump is about to hold a rally into in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. He has campaigned in Pennsylvania four times this year. Biden has visited the home of 20 electoral votes ten times since becoming the nominee. Several of those were during the DNC. We are watching and we're going to take you there shortly. Meanwhile though back on Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court prepares to remember Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She will lie in repose there tomorrow and Thursday, and then on Friday she will become the first woman in history to lie in state in the United States state capital. As the battle over for her replacement rages on tonight with President Trump announcing that he reveal his nominee on Saturday evening. We expect that around 5:00 pm. listen to this statement though that was written by 11 U.S. Senators. \"Not since 1932 has the Senate confirmed in a presidential election year a Supreme Court nominee to a vacancy arising that year. And it is necessary to go back even further to 1888 in order to find an election-year nominee who was nominated and confirmed under divided government as we have now\". Now that letter was not written by today's Senate Democrats but these Republican Senators back in 2016 when President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland. The key phrase in that letter is this one \"Under divided government\" in that case meaning a Democrat who was in the White House, President Obama, and the Republican Senate at that time. Senator Mike Lee is one of the Senators who signed that letter and we will hear from him on his thoughts on the current state and just a moment. Brit Hume is going to join us as well to tackle how the messaging from some in both parties shifted on this issue. Take a listen.",

You're going to have a majority of U.S. Senators who believes that we need to fill this vacancy. Look we've had 29 Supreme Court vacancies arise during Presidential Election years in the history of our republic. On ten of those occasions we had divided government. The president in charge of one party in the Senate under another, nine out of those ten cases, the candidate the nominee was rejected. 19 times of those 29, there was no divided government. 18 out of 19 of those times the vacancy was filled. We're following precedent that has been set and adhered to in most cases where vacancy arises in a Presidential Election year. We chose not to confirm Merrick Garland as was our prerogative it was a divided government. We had a Democratic President and Republican Senate. It was surprising to no one that we do it that way and Democrats would have done exactly the same way have a shoe been on the other foot.",

We performed our advice and consent function by rejecting Merrick Garland. We just chose to not run him through hearing process when we knew the outcome at the outset. The person isn't confirmed unless the Senate votes to confirm. We chose not to do that. There's nothing in the constitution that requires us to hold that vote or even to hold that hearing.

The reason for that is this; it's not that politicians like to change their position so much. It is that Supreme Court nominations have become such prized developments such important developments. The aftermath of Roe versus Wade in particular which I think is driving most of the intensity we are seeing here and in previous nominations. No one wants to do anything but keep the judges they don't want off the bench and get the judges they do want on the bench. The fear on the American left and among many women is that a conservative jurist that's distinct from a political conservative. A judicial conservative might well vote and provide a deciding vote to reverse Roe versus Wade. That's something, that outcome is something that is looked upon as intolerable.

He said one side puts three judges on and then in the next round the other side puts three judges on. But here's what he said when he was asked about the other day in Wisconsin.

But right now there's no way around it. Right now today the big issue is the court and the opening and the opportunity the Republicans have to fill it and the desire of Democrats to block it. That's where we are. I don't know that Joe Biden can duck questions on this perpetually. My sense about his instinct is that he recognizes that the idea of court packing starts a lot of people as liberal, the overwhelmingly popular Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried it they back fired. It has a kind of bad name court packing it just sounds bad. And so I think he may be want to shy away from that reason and I don't think it's totally about the feeling that keeps the focus on Trump.

The next question will be in the thing we need to concern ourselves with, what they will do to try to stop the nomination once it comes before the Senate.

Bush looking into Putin's soul or President Obama leaning over to President Medvedev if he was keeping the seat warm for President Putin to come back and saying hey I can work with you more after the election or Secretary Clinton bringing the reset button. These are stories that I tell in \"Battlegrounds\" and it's the real argument I'm making, is Vladimir Putin is not going to change? He is driven by anger, a sense of honor lost during the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is determined since the time he took over in the year 2000 and now extending his rule we think until at least 2036, he is determined to restore Russia's national greatness. But you know what? Russia is not that strong these days. They have a lot of problems. So the way Putin is going about it is he wants to drag everybody else down, especially in Europe and especially the United States.",

Pence and staff are now taking a cargo plane back to Washington according to that reporting from WMUR in New Hampshire. So, we'll keep a close eye on that. As you see President Trump taking the stage in Moon Township in western Pennsylvania tonight. Pennsylvania, of course, has 20 electoral votes at stake. The president's opponent Joe Biden called an early lead today on public events. That happened this morning. We have not seen him today although he did do some virtual fund-raisers that were on his schedule. He is currently up almost four points in the polling average in the Keystone state. President Trump hoping to turn that around and repeat 2016 where he eked out a victory over Hillary Clinton by less than one point in the end. This event is, like so many we have seen over the course of this campaign so far, at Pittsburgh International Airport this time which is in Allegheny County, one of the county -- one of the areas that Clinton outperformed Trump in 2016. So, he is trying to make up some ground there and pick up a few extra votes with this stop tonight.

He has campaigned in Pennsylvania four times this year. Biden has visited the home of 20 electoral votes ten times since becoming the nominee. Several of those were during the DNC. We are watching and we're going to take you there shortly. Meanwhile though back on Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court prepares to remember Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She will lie in repose there tomorrow and Thursday, and then on Friday she will become the first woman in history to lie in state in the United States state capital. As the battle over for her replacement rages on tonight with President Trump announcing that he reveal his nominee on Saturday evening. We expect that around 5:00 pm. listen to this statement though that was written by 11 U.S. Senators. \"Not since 1932 has the Senate confirmed in a presidential election year a Supreme Court nominee to a vacancy arising that year. And it is necessary to go back even further to 1888 in order to find an election-year nominee who was nominated and confirmed under divided government as we have now\". Now that letter was not written by today's Senate Democrats but these Republican Senators back in 2016 when President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland. The key phrase in that letter is this one \"Under divided government\" in that case meaning a Democrat who was in the White House, President Obama, and the Republican Senate at that time. Senator Mike Lee is one of the Senators who signed that letter and we will hear from him on his thoughts on the current state and just a moment. Brit Hume is going to join us as well to tackle how the messaging from some in both parties shifted on this issue. Take a listen."

You're going to have a majority of U.S. Senators who believes that we need to fill this vacancy. Look we've had 29 Supreme Court vacancies arise during Presidential Election years in the history of our republic. On ten of those occasions we had divided government. The president in charge of one party in the Senate under another, nine out of those ten cases, the candidate the nominee was rejected. 19 times of those 29, there was no divided government. 18 out of 19 of those times the vacancy was filled. We're following precedent that has been set and adhered to in most cases where vacancy arises in a Presidential Election year. We chose not to confirm Merrick Garland as was our prerogative it was a divided government. We had a Democratic President and Republican Senate. It was surprising to no one that we do it that way and Democrats would have done exactly the same way have a shoe been on the other foot."

It would be a waste of everyone's time including Merrick Garland, to put him through a hearing when we knew that we weren't going to confirm him. We gave our advice and consent. We performed our advice and consent function by rejecting Merrick Garland. We just chose to not run him through hearing process when we knew the outcome at the outset. The person isn't confirmed unless the Senate votes to confirm. We chose not to do that. There's nothing in the constitution that requires us to hold that vote or even to hold that hearing. It would've been cruel to do so knowing that we were going to reject him."

To Dianne Feinstein, that's dogma living loud within a nominee. I think the most ordinary people, being Christian and serious about it is not only permissible but in many cases a highly desirable quality in anybody. We are in for a battle here, Martha. It could be worse than anything we've seen so far. I hope not but I fear it may be so and this is a very kind of claim that she has some sort of religious extremist that I'm afraid we are going to hear."

And I expect we're going to hear a lot of that back and back-and-forth. With regard to the prior statements that have been made and here's one of them back in 2016 by Senator Lindsey Graham.

They never reversed themselves. Democrats who are good otherwise now have reversed themselves. So there is plenty of that to go around. The reason for that is this; it's not that politicians like to change their position so much. It is that Supreme Court nominations have become such prized developments such important developments. The aftermath of Roe versus Wade in particular which I think is driving most of the intensity we are seeing here and in previous nominations. No one wants to do anything but keep the judges they don't want off the bench and get the judges they do want on the bench. The fear on the American left and among many women is that a conservative jurist that's distinct from a political conservative. A judicial conservative might well vote and provide a deciding vote to reverse Roe versus Wade. That's something, that outcome is something that is looked upon as intolerable. That's why we are seeing what we are seeing and are about to see again."

He said one side puts three judges on and then in the next round the other side puts three judges on. But here's what he said when he was asked about the other day in Wisconsin. He wouldn't answer the question. He said it's a legitimate question but let me tell you why I'm not going to answer that question because it will shift the focus. What do you say about that answer?"

      "speaker": "HUME",

The Trump Campaign obviously thinks there is a defensible record on COVID-19 but it thanks Joe Biden, his positions, his condition should be the bigger issue. So there is a struggle over that. But right now there's no way around it. Right now today the big issue is the court and the opening and the opportunity the Republicans have to fill it and the desire of Democrats to block it. That's where we are. I don't know that Joe Biden can duck questions on this perpetually. My sense about his instinct is that he recognizes that the idea of court packing starts a lot of people as liberal, the overwhelmingly popular Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried it they back fired. It has a kind of bad name court packing it just sounds bad. And so I think he may be want to shy away from that reason and I don't think it's totally about the feeling that keeps the focus on Trump. Although not answering that question doesn't really do that."

And I would imagine in the coming debate cycle, we are not privy to the questions that Chris Wallace will ask but I would imagine that this is going to come up and that is going to be a little more difficult to not give a decisive answer to.

      "speaker": "HUME",

Republicans don't do that the next question will be not what they are going to do after the election or whether they will try to pack the court, although that could come up in time. The next question will be in the thing we need to concern ourselves with, what they will do to try to stop the nomination once it comes before the Senate. We have seen the most reckless kind of unsubstantiated allegations used in the past. The most recent example being with the Brett Kavanaugh nomination and I think there's every chance that such a thing can happen again. It won't be pretty. It won't be inspiring. It will be the next thing."

I think what's important to know is that the best way to deal with a pandemic is to stop it before outcomes of pandemic at its source. And thanks to the Chinese Communist Party, we couldn't do that. And so this is a virus that has been inflicted on the world by the Chinese Communist Party's repression of the truth, repression of doctors who are trying to warn about it the news of human to human transmission shutting down domestic travel before they shut down international travel. And so the Chinese Communist Party revealed I think it's irresponsibility and of course the danger associated with its closed authoritarian system."

What Russia wants to do first and foremost is shake our confidence, shake our confidence in our democratic principles, our institutions, and our processes. I don't really think Vladimir Putin cares who wins the election as long as Americans are torn apart by the result. And so you saw this in 2016. I think they had it teed up to sow disinformation and propaganda about Hillary Clinton winning the election because the election was rigged, you know. But then of course when President Trump won, they had to adjust and then they changed the story to well President Trump would have won the popular vote if the election hadn't been rigged.

    {
      "speaker": "H.R. MCMASTER",
      "utterance": "I don't understand it. I think it does play into Putin's hands in large measure because Putin is the best liar in the world. President Trump is the third of three presidents and he will eventually figure this out. It came late to other presidents as well. You might remember President George W. Bush looking into Putin's soul or President Obama leaning over to President Medvedev if he was keeping the seat warm for President Putin to come back and saying hey I can work with you more after the election or Secretary Clinton bringing the reset button. These are stories that I tell in \"Battlegrounds\" and it's the real argument I'm making, is Vladimir Putin is not going to change? He is driven by anger, a sense of honor lost during the collapse of the Soviet Union. He is determined since the time he took over in the year 2000 and now extending his rule we think until at least 2036, he is determined to restore Russia's national greatness. But you know what? Russia is not that strong these days. They have a lot of problems. So the way Putin is going about it is he wants to drag everybody else down, especially in Europe and especially the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So you say that you don't favor that kind of language, saying I like Putin and he likes me. I know that you also in an interview that you did a little while ago said he thought it would make Putin happy to hear the president's response to a question about whether or not he thought that Putin was sort of behind the poisoning of Alexey Navalny, the Opposition Leader there, activist there. So why do you think that the president says these things so publicly if it gives Vladimir Putin solace?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "H.R. MCMASTER",
      "utterance": "I don't know but I think what's important to recognize about the Russian threat is that they want to disrupt us, right? They want to shake our confidence and at the same time, deny it even their most obvious and egregious actions. Remember this is a regime that shot down an airliner and murdered hundreds of people and then just kept denying it even though there was incontrovertible evidence. So I think it's important to pull the curtain back on Russian activity and to be quite clear about it. I think for President Trump, sometimes he tries to separate the relationship from issues at hand. You see that with other leaders that he approaches where we have real big problems as well."

I wish the president would be tougher on Putin publicly because I think what Putin will do is he will push as much as he can until there are costs imposed on him that are beyond those that he factors in at the beginning of his decisions. I think this is backfiring on him. You mentioned the Navalny poisoning using a military grade nerve agent like he did against Sergei Skripal in March of 2018. If you remember, President Trump took very strong action. He closed the San Francisco Consulate which was a big intelligence collection platform for the Russians. He kicked out 60 undeclared Russian intelligence agents. And so I think those kinds of actions should speak louder than words I hope. But the word sometimes, I don't understand."

This is WMUR that is reporting that Air Force 2 carrying the Vice President Mike Pence just returned to the Manchester Boston Regional Airport after takeoff due to a possible bird strike. Reporters traveling with the vice president were told that Air Force 2 turn around after taking off because of an issue with the plane's engine. Pence and staff are now taking a cargo plane back to Washington according to that reporting from WMUR in New Hampshire. So, we'll keep a close eye on that. As you see President Trump taking the stage in Moon Township in western Pennsylvania tonight. Pennsylvania, of course, has 20 electoral votes at stake. The president's opponent Joe Biden called an early lead today on public events. That happened this morning. We have not seen him today although he did do some virtual fund-raisers that were on his schedule. He is currently up almost four points in the polling average in the Keystone state. President Trump hoping to turn that around and repeat 2016 where he eked out a victory over Hillary Clinton by less than one point in the end. This event is, like so many we have seen over the course of this campaign so far, at Pittsburgh International Airport this time which is in Allegheny County, one of the county -- one of the areas that Clinton outperformed Trump in 2016. So, he is trying to make up some ground there and pick up a few extra votes with this stop tonight.

If it hadn't been for that, he wouldn't be president right now. A large percentage of those voters were voting on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was the, if go back and look at the exit polls in 2016. Donald -- Donald Trump won voters who for whom the Supreme Court was the number one issue by 15 points. Twenty-six percent of his voters, that's fifth -- that's almost 16 million people, said that was the number one issue for them. This year it wasn't -- it was shaping up to not be as much of an issue because he was so successful because he put two great justices on the Supreme Court, he secured 200 judges on the lower courts. He seemed to have succeed, he saved the conservative majority on the court and now all of a sudden, the Supreme Court back front and center in the minds of a lot of voters and especially with reluctant Trump voters.
