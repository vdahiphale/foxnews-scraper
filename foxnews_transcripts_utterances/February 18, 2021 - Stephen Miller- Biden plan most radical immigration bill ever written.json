      "sentences": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is the Ingraham Angle from Washington tonight. Disturbing video shows California school board members mocking parents as just wanting their babysitters back when an outraged mother from that community is here in a big exclusive tonight. Also, who's populating the Biden administration. Tonight, the Ingraham Angle investigates Vanita Gupta who would be number 3 at the DOJ and after demurring on the campaign trail Joe Biden is now fully endorsing a study looking at reparations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The legendary Bob Woodson reacts to that but first, they don't care about you. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. In May 2019, this show traveled to the border town of Del Rio Texas to document the growing illegal immigration crisis at the time. Now record numbers of illegals, family units and unaccompanied minors were flooding across the Rio Grande. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Human smuggling like drug smuggling was a big business. Soon afterward President Trump tightened processing of asylees, and refugee applications and he even struck historic agreements with Mexico and Central America to try to tackle the problem here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The number of border crossers in turn dropped dramatically but now Joe Biden is in the process of reversing all that progress. Beyond creating a humanitarian nightmare at our southern border, his policies will create more economic and security problems for an America that's already on the edge. Simply put, Biden is captive to two constituencies. The left that wants to remake our country with new more progressive voters and the donor class that wants an endless supply of cheap labor. Hard working Americans be damned. Listen to the pleas of the Mayor of Del Rio.

Your safety, your job prospects, your kids going back to school, your mental health, your freedom. None of that is as important to the left as their desire to fundamentally transform America and achieving this requires that they pass an amnesty bill as soon as possible, certainly before the next election.

Well this legislation creates an 8-year path to citizenship. It immediately grants green cards to farmworkers, TPS designees and DACA recipients. It expands the controversial work visa lottery from 55,000 to 80,000 a year and it exempts children and spouses from any visa cap numbers. It gives dependents green cards, it recaptures unused visas, I love this one, from previous years to clear a backlog and eliminates per country visa caps. It takes the word alien out of the U.S. code and it greatly expands the number of refugees allowed to settle here by creating refugee processing centers in Central America. Well, it gets worse and worse if you can believe it. Basically, Biden is going to cease deporting all but the most violent criminals and border patrol officers will no longer be able to ban entry at our borders by those who have - had already been here illegally on previous occasions.

The legendary Bob Woodson reacts to that but first, they don't care about you. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. In May 2019, this show traveled to the border town of Del Rio Texas to document the growing illegal immigration crisis at the time. Now record numbers of illegals, family units and unaccompanied minors were flooding across the Rio Grande. Human smuggling like drug smuggling was a big business. Soon afterward President Trump tightened processing of asylees, and refugee applications and he even struck historic agreements with Mexico and Central America to try to tackle the problem here. The number of border crossers in turn dropped dramatically but now Joe Biden is in the process of reversing all that progress. Beyond creating a humanitarian nightmare at our southern border, his policies will create more economic and security problems for an America that's already on the edge. Simply put, Biden is captive to two constituencies. The left that wants to remake our country with new more progressive voters and the donor class that wants an endless supply of cheap labor.

We may be a small town that is off of your radar, but we are a community of 50,000 people who need your attention. We are requesting that you please listen and that you please come through."

Your safety, your job prospects, your kids going back to school, your mental health, your freedom. None of that is as important to the left as their desire to fundamentally transform America and achieving this requires that they pass an amnesty bill as soon as possible, certainly before the next election. You kind of need to be replaced or at least canceled out by new voters who will be more compliant when new climate change or pandemic restrictions are enacted. They need new voters who won't obsess about protecting second amendment rights or frankly worry about the constitution at all. We're just learning now the details of the Democrats new amnesty bill supported by President Biden of course that would grant citizenship to an untold number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. What will happen? Well this legislation creates an 8-year path to citizenship. It immediately grants green cards to farmworkers, TPS designees and DACA recipients. It expands the controversial work visa lottery from 55,000 to 80,000 a year and it exempts children and spouses from any visa cap numbers. It gives dependents green cards, it recaptures unused visas, I love this one, from previous years to clear a backlog and eliminates per country visa caps. It takes the word alien out of the U.S. code and it greatly expands the number of refugees allowed to settle here by creating refugee processing centers in Central America. Well, it gets worse and worse if you can believe it. Basically, Biden is going to cease deporting all but the most violent criminals and border patrol officers will no longer be able to ban entry at our borders by those who have - had already been here illegally on previous occasions. Oh goody, well, most Americans aren't traveling out of the country due to the COVID stuff, illegals will be free to come and go, no questions asked. Now this legislation is sponsored by rabidly pro open borders Senator Robert Menendez who will call you a racist if you don't support his efforts."

And speaking of red zones, of the cities hit hardest by COVID, three of the top for are border towns. That's just a total coincidence I'm sure.

It's so bad that starting tomorrow Biden is going to use taxpayer money to begin physically retrieving the 25,000 migrants now living in Mexico who were at least temporarily deported there by the Trump administration, pending their asylum hearings. But don't worry, I'm sure he's going to get temperature checks before they board the buses. And maybe even their first dose of the COVID vaccine. I understand some are getting that too. Grandma can't get it but legal immigrants can. There may be room for compromise on immigration bill if there's any sense the Democrats would take enforcement seriously. Maybe they could show us for - I don't know a couple of years that they'll lock down the border really enforce it. But we know they won't do that so this bill like all the others that came before will go down in flames. Democrats will turn off millions of already beleaguered voters in 2022, probably will be all masked up then too if the Democrats have their way and those voters are going to wonder why they ever voted for a party that never put them first and that's the Angle. Joining me now is someone who knows this issue better than most. Former White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller. Stephen, it's good to see you tonight. I mean you're kind of that - you're kind of that poster child other than President Trump himself for the Left's outrage and vile directed toward any of us who believe in border enforcement first.

It is the most radical immigration bill ever written, ever drafted, ever submitted in the history of this country. It is breathtaking. As just a few examples Laura. Under this bill, every single illegal alien in the country who merely submits an application to the U.S. government, if they want to work, they are work authorized immediately just submitting the application, you are work authorized. Furthermore, every employer in the country is immediately allowed to hire illegal aliens even if they haven't submitted their application.

This is a full-scale attack on the very idea of nationhood. If you were - if you were trying to write a bill to eliminate the concept of having a nation, this is the bill you would write. It lets criminals back into the country. It says that as long as somebody has a need for family unity, their criminal conviction can be overlooked, even very serious felony convictions can be overlooked and waved by the Secretary in the name of family unity."

But this is not - we're not talking about a couple of million people. We're not talking about 11 million illegals Stephen. The actual number of illegal immigrants is much higher. A New Yale study says, it's as high as 19.8 million and it doesn't seem to be slowing down. The Wall Street Journal reporting that more than 75,000 people were arrested crossing the border illegally in January, the most in any January and more than a decade.

It also - it also eliminates a law passed by Bill Clinton that establishes a waiting period to get free federal health care for people who get green cards. It just deletes it right in the bill and says that section of law is gone and just page after page after page. I'll give you another example. This bill establishes a $50,000 fine if a federal worker refers an application to law enforcement because they're concerned about what they see on it. It fines them $50,000.

We were down to 2 percent because the turbines were frozen and there's a lesson here. The lesson is we cannot go down this road, Laura of green energy because right now we have almost everyone's power back. We had millions out several days ago, we have generation now, power generation for almost everyone. And it's not winds and it's not solar, it's dark out and I can't make the turbines go around. It's fossil fuel, it's clean burning coal, it's nuclear. That's what this country and this state need so we do lead the country in wind, but it is not 25 percent of our everyday power use."

There was - you were talking about Del Rio where I know you've been, and I've been on the border. They had 10 inches of snow today. It's unheralded but what happened should have never happened. We have this overseeing group, a private company, non for profit called ERCOT and they told us, the leadership in the state last week, they were ready for this so either the power generators that power our energy lied to them or misled them or they misled us because four days later, this past Monday, ERCOT now says we were just a few megawatts away from the whole system going down. We will have an investigation beginning this week in the Senate Laura and as President of the Senate, as lieutenant governor a bill doesn't come to the floor without my signature on it. There's not a bill coming to the floor unless we now mandate, we made recommendations 10 years ago. We thought they were doing everything they said they were doing.

And he also politicized it, because as long as Trump was in an election cycle and he was running for president, he thought the narrative would hurt Trump by saying we are in a recession that Trump caused by locking us down, but we have to stay locked down. It was a lose-lose situation. The irony, Laura, is that now the science really is -- we are getting new data, and it shows that about 100 million Americans according to the CDC have some sort of immunity through exposure, another 60 are vaccinated, may be 50 million are under the age of 15 and are not going to get serious cases. And we are inching up to the point where we may be approaching in another month some type of immunity that it's going to force Biden to act. And even the scientists that are in the minority now who say the lockdown are not going to be tenable."

Let me jump in really quickly, because I think that we are at the point that until the voters say no to lockdowns by voting these people out of office, they are going to still keep as much power and control over people as possible. That Capitol fence isn't coming down, the troops aren't leaving D.C. Do you agree with that, that we are going to have to vote these people out because this is too much power, they don't want to give it up, real quick?"

They're going to have to double down and use more authority, resort to more coercion as the science disappoints them every day. And that's what I'm really worried about. They are on the wrong side of the science, and it's a fluid, radical, changing environment that is antithetical to their agenda, and they are not compromising.

Now, what is scary about this is that not the liberalism of Vanita Gupta, but her illiberalism. In other words, the willingness to turn the police agencies of government into weaponized agencies against political opponents. That's not liberalism, that is actually illiberalism. And she seems to have this kind of agenda in which she targets people who are against her, and she is willing to overlook even the unlawful activity of people who she deems to be on her side. The very fact that she is OK with policies like censorship, suppression of speech, she is part of that coordinated action on the left to shut down and criminalize her opponents.

And I think most Americans would agree that one of the core functions of the government is to keep us safe. And this is what happens. This is part of the trend we have seen of Soros type prosecutors who are really public defenders coming in and dismantling justice at every level in our country. And now this is probably going to be the highest level of DOJ official who has these radical views, and her experience in the government shows she knows how to work those levers. She was acting head of the civil rights division under Obama. And so she played a central role in the outcome of the election last year by helping the big tech companies justify censorship of speech that criticized how our elections were being run. So you can only imagine with this type of power how the government is going to be weaponized against the critics of the government."

Just contrast this, for example, with Attorney General Barr who appeared before a Democratic committee just a few months ago. And they basically were accusing him, the Trump administration, of weaponizing the Justice Department. And Barr said something like, well, can you name a single Democrat I've gone after? Can you give me one case where I have used the Justice Department against a political opponent? And they couldn't, and he couldn't either. So he was using this as a demonstration of the Trump administration's fairness. So while our side bends over backwards to create not only the actuality, but the appearance of fairness, the other side just goes all out in pushing its agenda without having to worry about even the appearance of unfairness."

They don't have to answer why if racism were the primary barrier facing blacks, why have low income blacks suffered these inequities in these cities, all of these black run Democratic cities over the past 50 years where blacks have been -- why are blacks failing in institutions run by their own people? And the fact that Proposition 16 in California has been rejected, in a liberal state like California, they are rejecting an affirmative action. So where is a market for this? I just think it's a distraction so they don't have to deal with the fundamental challenges facing it, and that is the self-inflicted wounds that are occurring in America today. What we are doing at the Woodson Center is we have to have solutions. The solutions cannot be found through transactions like reparations. It's going to be found by investing in institutions and individuals within those communities. It's more cultural than it is economic."

But we are suffering more by the so called friends and champions of blacks than we are our obvious enemies. And what they are communicating to blacks is that we don't have the capacity or ability to be agents of our own uplift, that somehow our destiny is going to be determined by what white people do or do not do. That's a more insidious form of racism is to assume that we don't have the capacity to achieve. When whites were at their worst in the past, blacks were at their best. We owned hotels, we had our own railroads. In Chicago, we have 731 black owned business, $100 million in real estate assets. We did this during segregation."
