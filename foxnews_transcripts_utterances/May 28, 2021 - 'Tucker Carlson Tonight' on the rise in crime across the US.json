One Sunday afternoon last September, a 16-year-old boy called Aaron Pryor was shot to death in a driveway near his home in Oakland, California. Even by the standards of midday drive-by shootings, it was an awful crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Surveillance footage showed the killer firing more than a dozen rounds before fleeing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No one was arrested for the murder, but local media did not seem especially interested in finding out who did it because they already knew.

Aaron Pryor's football coach agreed with this. It was COVID that really killed this kid, he told reporters. The coach didn't explain how exactly COVID had done this killing or what COVID's motive might have been. But no one asked. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Everyone, particularly people in power seemed happy to blame COVID, the pandemic did it.

We forced everyone to stay home and that's why there are many people on the streets shooting each other and pushing strangers into oncoming subway cars. Does that make sense to you? No. It doesn't make sense to anyone. But thankfully, experts soon emerged to explain why something so obviously untrue must in fact be true, quote, \"Because of the stresses of the pandemic, they are everywhere,\" explained the former C.I.A. officer called Jeff Asher to \"The New York Times.\" \"You're seeing this everywhere.\" Except we're not seeing this everywhere. That's not true. The coronavirus may be global, but rising crime rates are not global. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Police in Canada, for example, reported that crime fell by 18 percent between March and October of last year. In the U.K., crime saw its biggest annual decrease in a decade. In Sweden and Russia, crime dropped, too. Even in Mexico, which is in the middle of a drug war. There were fewer homicides in 2020 than there were in 2019. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So for normal countries, pretty much all countries, the pandemic meant more Netflix, but less killing. Not here. In the United States, the opposite happened. A lot of Netflix, even more killings. You're seeing the data on your screen right now. It's from a nonprofit called the Council on Criminal Justice and researchers at the University of Missouri. It shows the average weekly homicide rate in 21 major cities. Killings spiked in late May, well after the pandemic began. According to Council on Criminal Justice, quote, \"Homicides, aggravated assault, gun assaults rose significantly beginning in late May and June of 2020. They jumped by 40 percent during the summer and 34 percent in the fall when compared to the previous summer and fall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So far this year, these sad trends have continued. Murders are up 800 percent in Portland, Oregon. They're up 56 percent in Minneapolis, scene of George Floyd's death. They are up 27 percent in LA, 22 in New York, they're up 40 percent in Philadelphia. So you have to ask yourself -- because your life may depend on it -- why is this country different from say, Sweden or Russia or Mexico? And you know the answer. It's not COVID. It's that in our country, stupid, malicious people took full control, the Democratic Party took full control of the country, and their policies resulted in a huge number of killings. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's not speculation.

According to a report in AXIOS, 20 major U.S. cities have slashed their police budgets in the last year, they defunded the police. Collectively, they cut more than $840 million from law enforcement. In Atlanta, in a story that we love to read, one city councilman who voted to strip $73 million from the police, a genius called Antonio Brown just had his car stolen in broad daylight by children who were not held back by the police, they had been defunded. It must have been COVID that did it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, at least 25 cities have pulled police out of public schools. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They've canceled the contracts.

One of them, an especially entitled young lady called Madeline Wright shouted this through a megaphone, quote: \"We're going to fight to abolish this effing system, not reform it.\" Professors at the school joined her. One of them a character called Damon Jones led seminars on the problem of over-policing in the neighborhood around the University of Chicago, it is called Hyde Park. It is where Obama is from. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Professor have dozens of posts on Twitter last summer explaining that because the University of Chicago's police stop more African-Americans than white people in a predominantly black neighborhood, keep in mind, they are racist. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What's interesting is that Damon Jones hasn't said anything on Twitter about the police since January of this year. Why January? Well, that's when Yiran Fan, a 30-year-old PhD student at the University of Chicago was murdered in a killing spree on Chicago's south side along with two other people killed for being there. And at that point, it's possible that even morons like Damon Jones realized there's a reason the University of Chicago has one of the largest private police forces outside the Vatican. Why? Because the neighborhood around the school is a very dangerous place. That's not the fault of the police. That's the reason they have police. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that can be true for the entire City of Chicago, which is dangerous and becoming more so by the day. Now, why has that happened? It's happened because people with a political agenda have taken over law enforcement. It was in Chicago, for example that BLM activists declared that looting, stealing is a form of reparations.

Nixon expressed outrage the other day that the CVS in her neighborhood was trying to prevent thieves from walking off with their entire inventory. Quote, \"I can't imagine thinking that the way to solve the problem of people stealing basic necessities out of desperation is to prosecute them.\" So you've got to wonder what would happen if you showed up at Cynthia Nixon's place tonight and tried to help yourself to some quote, \"basic necessities.\" Would Cynthia Nixon understand your theft is a profound form of social protest? As a form of social justice? Will she applaud it? Or would she tell her bodyguards to shoot you? And then thank them profusely when they did? It's not a tough question.

None of them mean a word of what they say about crime. They're just trying to feel like good people in a world that confuses destruction for virtue. These people need to help, they should be nowhere near power. Unfortunately, at the moment, they run the Democratic Party and all of us are seeing the results of that.

An awful lot of rich people become philanthropists in order to honor themselves. They build a new wing on an art gallery or they endow a business school and then put their name on it. Foster Friess by contrast, gave almost exclusively to individuals, to people he liked or believed in, and above all, to people who needed it. He was far more likely to write a check to the busboy than to Harvard. He got no recognition for that, you never do. Waiters don't issue press releases when you leave a 1,000 percent tip after dinner, but Foster Friess didn't care. He loved giving because he loved people, which is pretty much the best thing that you can say about anyone. Foster Friess, rest in peace. Well, that is about it for us tonight.

One Sunday afternoon last September, a 16-year-old boy called Aaron Pryor was shot to death in a driveway near his home in Oakland, California. Even by the standards of midday drive-by shootings, it was an awful crime. Surveillance footage showed the killer firing more than a dozen rounds before fleeing. No one was arrested for the murder, but local media did not seem especially interested in finding out who did it because they already knew. The coronavirus killed Aaron Pryor. That's what they told us. When local television station noted that violence in the area had risen since the pandemic began, they must be connected. Aaron Pryor's football coach agreed with this. It was COVID that really killed this kid, he told reporters. The coach didn't explain how exactly COVID had done this killing or what COVID's motive might have been. But no one asked. Everyone, particularly people in power seemed happy to blame COVID, the pandemic did it. You've heard that a lot, and not just in California. Across the country in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio blamed rising crime rates squarely on the virus."

We forced everyone to stay home and that's why there are many people on the streets shooting each other and pushing strangers into oncoming subway cars. Does that make sense to you? No. It doesn't make sense to anyone. But thankfully, experts soon emerged to explain why something so obviously untrue must in fact be true, quote, \"Because of the stresses of the pandemic, they are everywhere,\" explained the former C.I.A. officer called Jeff Asher to \"The New York Times.\" \"You're seeing this everywhere.\" Except we're not seeing this everywhere. That's not true. The coronavirus may be global, but rising crime rates are not global. Police in Canada, for example, reported that crime fell by 18 percent between March and October of last year. In the U.K., crime saw its biggest annual decrease in a decade. In Sweden and Russia, crime dropped, too. Even in Mexico, which is in the middle of a drug war. There were fewer homicides in 2020 than there were in 2019. So for normal countries, pretty much all countries, the pandemic meant more Netflix, but less killing. Not here. In the United States, the opposite happened. A lot of Netflix, even more killings. You're seeing the data on your screen right now. It's from a nonprofit called the Council on Criminal Justice and researchers at the University of Missouri. It shows the average weekly homicide rate in 21 major cities. Killings spiked in late May, well after the pandemic began. According to Council on Criminal Justice, quote, \"Homicides, aggravated assault, gun assaults rose significantly beginning in late May and June of 2020. They jumped by 40 percent during the summer and 34 percent in the fall when compared to the previous summer and fall. So far this year, these sad trends have continued. Murders are up 800 percent in Portland, Oregon. They're up 56 percent in Minneapolis, scene of George Floyd's death. They are up 27 percent in LA, 22 in New York, they're up 40 percent in Philadelphia. So you have to ask yourself -- because your life may depend on it -- why is this country different from say, Sweden or Russia or Mexico? And you know the answer. It's not COVID. It's that in our country, stupid, malicious people took full control, the Democratic Party took full control of the country, and their policies resulted in a huge number of killings. That's not speculation. They bragged about it. Here they are bragging about their plans."

According to a report in AXIOS, 20 major U.S. cities have slashed their police budgets in the last year, they defunded the police. Collectively, they cut more than $840 million from law enforcement. In Atlanta, in a story that we love to read, one city councilman who voted to strip $73 million from the police, a genius called Antonio Brown just had his car stolen in broad daylight by children who were not held back by the police, they had been defunded. It must have been COVID that did it. Meanwhile, at least 25 cities have pulled police out of public schools. They've canceled the contracts. How's that going to work? You know the answer? At universities, activists have pushed for the same, total abolition of the police When they said we're going to defund the police, they meant it."

One of them a character called Damon Jones led seminars on the problem of over-policing in the neighborhood around the University of Chicago, it is called Hyde Park. It is where Obama is from. The Professor have dozens of posts on Twitter last summer explaining that because the University of Chicago's police stop more African-Americans than white people in a predominantly black neighborhood, keep in mind, they are racist. What's interesting is that Damon Jones hasn't said anything on Twitter about the police since January of this year. Why January? Well, that's when Yiran Fan, a 30-year-old PhD student at the University of Chicago was murdered in a killing spree on Chicago's south side along with two other people killed for being there. And at that point, it's possible that even morons like Damon Jones realized there's a reason the University of Chicago has one of the largest private police forces outside the Vatican. Why? Because the neighborhood around the school is a very dangerous place. That's not the fault of the police. That's the reason they have police. And that can be true for the entire City of Chicago, which is dangerous and becoming more so by the day. Now, why has that happened? It's happened because people with a political agenda have taken over law enforcement. It was in Chicago, for example that BLM activists declared that looting, stealing is a form of reparations.

So, this is the result of intentional policies designed to give us more stealing, designed to give us more murder, more rape, more pushing strangers in front of subway cars. It's happened because the people in charge allowed it to happen. And it's happening everywhere. It's particularly happening in New York. Several candidates for Mayor of New York, people running to replace Bill de Blasio have announced that anyone who opposes stealing is quote \"criminalizing poverty.\" Who are the people with views like that? They're not normal people. They are, it goes the saying, pampered out of touch liberals. They are the only ones who can afford views like that. Actress Cynthia Nixon certainly fits that description. Nixon expressed outrage the other day that the CVS in her neighborhood was trying to prevent thieves from walking off with their entire inventory. Quote, \"I can't imagine thinking that the way to solve the problem of people stealing basic necessities out of desperation is to prosecute them.\" So you've got to wonder what would happen if you showed up at Cynthia Nixon's place tonight and tried to help yourself to some quote, \"basic necessities.\" Would Cynthia Nixon understand your theft is a profound form of social protest? As a form of social justice? Will she applaud it? Or would she tell her bodyguards to shoot you? And then thank them profusely when they did? It's not a tough question. You'd be dead in seconds. Cynthia Nixon doesn't mean a word of what she says about crime. None of them mean a word of what they say about crime. They're just trying to feel like good people in a world that confuses destruction for virtue. These people need to help, they should be nowhere near power. Unfortunately, at the moment, they run the Democratic Party and all of us are seeing the results of that. Tania Owen lost her husband in October of 2016.

And, you know, the three strikes law was in effect back in 1996 as a result of the murder of Polly Klaas by Richard Allen -- I can't remember his last name at this point. But anyways, he went and took her from her bedroom, raped her and murdered her. And that individual was an extremely violent felon. And so he had to be held accountable and as a result, the three strikes law came into effect. The other is the gang enhancements as well as the gun enhancements.

One, that so-called memory B cells patrolling the blood looking for reinfection, and two, bone marrow plasma cells then produce antibodies for decades. Studies from Israel and the U.K. have similar findings.

And frankly, I live in the safest town in Maine and our police department is top notch -- and he missed all of that. And he kind of said, sorry, you took it that way. He then doubled down on that a couple of days later, with a you're-not- woke-enough-to-understand-what-I'm-talking-about letter.

And from there, they tried to cancel me. And once that occurred, I took the fight to them. I really held them accountable to their public comment policy. I used my First Amendment rights, and really tried to push the envelope to help them understand that as a parent, I just didn't want that in my community that I've lived in for over 20 years."

But I took a picture of her when she was not standing for the Pledge of Allegiance to honor our troops. And before I left the room, I put that on, on social media. And half the town lost their mind, they couldn't believe that I took a picture of a government official, elected official, and then sent that out to the world. From there, I made a small political sign of Ann. I brought that to a meeting which Jeff Porter kicked me out of, and then I put that sign right beside the road where I live on across the street, illuminated 24 hours a day. And frankly, the leftists lost their mind, Tucker."

I've got a business in town. We're a third generation Cumberland residents. And it's essentially, the cancel culture in that town is so venomous that everybody kind of got canceled out.

Well, no one ever heard of Christopher Steele, and yet everyone believed him immediately."

Barry Meier has written a new book though that examines that dossier and the broader relationships between journalists and the Intelligence Community. The book is called \"Spooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube and the Rise of Private Spies.\" He joins us now. Barry, thanks so much for coming on. It dawned to me, this is an hour-long conversation that we really should be having. But in the next short period of time, tell us the connection between the Intelligence Committee globally and American journalists? How broad is it? How big is this? BARRY MEIER, AUTHOR, \"SPOOKED\": Well, it's very big, Tucker. And thanks very much for having me on to start with. So journalists get information from all kinds of places. They get it from traditional Intelligence Agencies like the C.I.A. They get it from law enforcement agencies like the F.B.I., but what I really focus on in the book, is this booming growing role of private Intelligence firms or private spies, as I call them, and you know, this industry has exploded in the past decade and their connections with journalists have exploded along with it."

      "utterance": "It should be your first and foremost concern as a journalist. You know, at \"The Times\" where I spent most of my career, I did health and safety reporting. I was a reporter that first broke the story about OxyContin and its illegal marketing. And when drug companies were making claims, you as a reporter would scrutinize them. Unfortunately, in the case of the dossier and other situations, we have reporters who aren't giving these claims the same level of scrutiny. And as a result, this thing kind of metastasized on its own."

There are, you know, extremes on either end politically of the media arc. And so, you know, there's a great appetite for scoops. You know, everyone wants to claim that something is new, we have some intelligence, we have something fresh that no one else has, and as a result, this becomes, you know, a petri dish for these private Intelligence firms to kind of feed in information."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Facebook uses classifiers or algorithms to determine certain contents to be what they call vaccine hesitant or they call it \"vaccine hesitancy\" and without the user's knowledge, they assign a score to these comments.

Morgan Kahmann is the whistleblower who exposed all of this. He has been suspended from his job at Facebook. He joins us now. Morgan, thanks so much for coming on and for your bravery. It sounds like any real questions at all about the vaccines are not allowed by Facebook."

    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN KAHMANN, PUNISHED BY FACEBOOK",
      "utterance": "Yes, Tucker. That's true. Basically, with the way that they set this up is that anything that questions the vaccine or the narrative regarding the vaccine, which is, you know, everyone should get the vaccine and the vaccine is good, and you're not going to have very many bad side effects. Anything outside of that realm is basically considered under vaccine hesitancy by Facebook's algorithms."

    {
      "speaker": "KAHMANN",
      "utterance": "Well, honestly, Tucker, I think that they're afraid of what people might conclude, if they see that other people are having negative side effects and they think that this is going to drive up vaccine hesitancy among the population, then they see that as something that they have to combat. But honestly, I think that that is not something that -- basically, my moral compass says that that is not the right thing to do because basically, the users at Facebook are not aware that this is going on. And if you're using Facebook for a social platform, and they're censoring the content of your comments, unbeknownst to you, I think that's highly immoral."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "speaker": "KAHMANN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I believe that any consequences that are bestowed onto me by Facebook, as a result of this leak, and these documents that I've leaked to Project Veritas, I think any of those consequences don't really -- don't really weigh much when it comes to having to live with myself and ask myself the rest of my life, you know, I saw these documents, and I had the opportunity to, you know, show the public this and what's going on behind the scenes, and I didn't do it. And so I wouldn't be able to live with myself after that."

      "utterance": "Among the close company I have now, yes. As for Facebook, they decided to suddenly tell me to stop my work one day while I was at work, call me into a meeting with my supervisor and a security guard. They removed all my company equipment from me, my company laptop, company cell phone and my badge, my access badge. They walked me out to my car and basically informed me that they would be having an investigatory meeting with me at a later date, which they actually ended up canceling at the last minute. So not a very good reaction for Facebook. No."

      "utterance": "Amen. And I hope many will. I appreciate it. Well, sad news. Our friend, Foster Friess died today at the age of 81 in Arizona. His obituary describe him as a conservative philanthropist or a mega donor. But those descriptions do not capture the man. You can tell a lot about somebody by where he gives his money. An awful lot of rich people become philanthropists in order to honor themselves. They build a new wing on an art gallery or they endow a business school and then put their name on it. Foster Friess by contrast, gave almost exclusively to individuals, to people he liked or believed in, and above all, to people who needed it. He was far more likely to write a check to the busboy than to Harvard. He got no recognition for that, you never do. Waiters don't issue press releases when you leave a 1,000 percent tip after dinner, but Foster Friess didn't care. He loved giving because he loved people, which is pretty much the best thing that you can say about anyone. Foster Friess, rest in peace. Well, that is about it for us tonight. Tomorrow, at this hour, we will be here to investigate the war on science that is in full flower tonight to our detriment. That's tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. Eastern right here on FOX News and of course, tune in every night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn and sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. I hope you have the best night with the ones you love. The happiness is right next to you, you just need to recognize it. See you tomorrow."
