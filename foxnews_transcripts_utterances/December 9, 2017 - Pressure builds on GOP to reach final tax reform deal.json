So as opposed, a half a million dollars of additional income being taxed at the lower rate of 35, rather than 38.5, that had to be taken into consideration. If your income is over a million --",

I know you played a big part in writing the Senate bill. So the president said last weekend that 22 percent on the top corporate rate would be possible after saying for months that 20 percent was his real target. So is 22 percent possible in the end? SEN. PAT TOOMEY, R-PA.Paul, it is my hope that we will be able to hold to the 20 percent that we have in both the House and the Senate bills. We've got a lot of things to work out. There are differences, and there are many demands coming from my quarters. So I can't guarantee that it ends at 20, but there's a very strong desire on the part of most of the conferees I think to keep to 20."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right. The other criticism -- this is that I hear from Republicans around the country. My email is filling up, as maybe yours is too. Is because you're taking away the state and local tax deduction, which I think is good policy, but nonetheless, it means that in high-tax states, there's some people who are going to have to pay more. But you're not compensating for that by lowering the top income tax rate, that you're raising taxes on a lot of people. What's your response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it is a little more complicated than that, Paul. And one of the facts that mitigate against the loss in the value of the state and local tax deduction, which I agree with you, I think it is good policy to stop forcing low-tax jurisdictions to subsidize high tax jurisdictions, but what's the net effect? Sure, you lose some value if you lose the deductibility. But keep in mind, we take the -- the top bracket does not kick in as low an income level under our bill as it does under current law. And specifically, the point at which that highest rate, which in the Senate bill is 38.5 - 38.5 percent kicks in is not until a couple filing jointly $1 million income. So as opposed, a half a million dollars of additional income being taxed at the lower rate of 35, rather than 38.5, that had to be taken into consideration. If your income is over a million --"

      "speaker": "TOOMEY",

But people whose income is over a million very typically will have other sources of income as well, as you know, passive income, pass-through income, which does get a significant reduction, so all those factors really should be considered."
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

I guess the other argument is that you're making this tax reform, it's a big tax reform, very ambitious, but if you don't get the top tax rate down this time, and you reduce it in the Senate bill by 1.1 percentage point which, is a lot more than the House does, which is zero."

    },

      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Too early to say. You know, it is one of the moving pieces. I would love to get rid of the death tax entirely. That's the right policy in my view. But there -- you know, Paul, we have got a limited amount of revenue we can forego in this plan, given the budget rules we have to live with. It scores as a big loss of revenue if we eliminate it completely. It is on a list of things I would like to get to, but it is too soon to know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "On the other hand, the Senate has the Obama care mandate, the individual mandate repealed. The House bill does not. The Senate going to prevail on that one? That saves you money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOOMEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it does. And not only does it save us money, it saves us money in the first 10 years, which we call the budget window. But it also continues to save after that, which helps to offset the lost revenue from a lower corporate rate. What it does, the net effect, Paul, is it helps us to make the corporate reforms permanent. So it is really, really important policy in terms of its impact on the tax side. But it is also very good policy in and of itself. It is outrageous that the government forces Americans to buy a product that they don't want to buy. We eliminate the tax penalty associated with failure to do so. I think there's broad support for this in the House, and I really hope that the Senate provision prevails."

So now you have that entire constituency definitely prodded by special interests, you know, like the realtors, pushing to keep it. But that's also an expensive provision. And what we're coming up against here, Paul, is with everybody coming back to the table, there isn't a lot of place to drum up revenue. And the big risk here is that you do end up slipping on that corporate rate, going back to 22 percent. And then you're in the same situation.

What's your response to that? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: My response to that is that Robert Mueller has got his assignment. He's doing it. Director -- FBI Director Christopher Wray just appears before the congressional committee and is defending, as Bill says, there's some 13,000 FBI agents. I think they are underestimating the extent to which the American people or at least a lot of the people, especially the ones who voted for Donald Trump, feel that there is an imbalance here. Look, the investigation of Donald Trump goes forward. It is public. Whatever Hillary Clinton did with the server and the rest of it, the Clinton Foundation, seems to have fallen down the memory hole. Director Wray's position is the inspector general of the FBI, Michael Horowitz, is investigating all that. And while all that goes on, since January, in silence, you have got this public attack going on against the president.

That should be -- if you care, and you're an American citizen, and you really want to get to the bottom of what happened with Russia and the United States in the election, then let's investigate all of it, not just part of it.

This is why Strzok really matters and that he was at the center of all of this, not just the Hillary Clinton investigation, but the counterintelligence probe into Trump and Russia. So there are legitimate questions what role he played with the dossier and the FISA court. I think that this gets to what you just said, Mueller, can he legitimately look at this? And this is the real outrage, too, of the Strzok news. Yes, true, he fired him -- not fired him, demoted him when he found out about it. But he, nonetheless, did not tell Congress, and he knows that Congress is looking into this question. Because presumably he knew it would undermine the credibility of his special counsel probe. But I think that that does call into question, if he isn't even going to tell Congress that he's got situations like this, can we really expect him to be investigating many of the very people who are on his team who were back at DOJ and FBI, when all of this was going on?"

And the argument of not now, you know, sometimes in diplomatic lingo not now means not ever. And I think that's on the minds of some. It's early to really to say exactly what the response across the Middle East will be. There's evidence already that some of the demonstrations and violence are being provoked by Iran to stoke tensions in the region/ But I say again, when the United States succumbs to threats of violence, it simply encourages people to believe that might work elsewhere."

Will it affect the larger peace negotiations? It is too soon to tell.

But it's also the case, unfortunately, because of developments in the region, namely the rise of Iran, the Iranian nuclear weapons program, its support for terrorism, that a lot of structures and relationships that have existed for decades are now in flux. We've seen Russia re-enter the Middle East in a significant way for the first time since the 1970s. So I think a lot of the old verities here are coming into question. And a move like this, if it does nothing else, recognizes reality. The president made that point. It pops a lot of illusions. But precisely because peace is so complicated, so hard to attain, there's no chance you can build peace on soap bubbles. So I think by clearing away a lot of the illusions that may be, I don't know, we can make Jerusalem a separate city under U.N. authority, dating back to the idea of the 1947 original resolution partitioning the British Palestinian mandate, it's all hot air. And saying that I think is the right thing to do."

      "utterance": "Well, that's right. And one of those fundamental ideas is that there are certain basic protections inside the Constitution, regarding freedom of exercise of religion and of speech. There's an interesting thing going on here. For instance, on campuses, they are talking about -- they're saying, on one hand, we believe in free speech, but we think there are certain forms of hateful speech that ought to be outlawed. If they go down on that road, you are on kind of a slippery slope, as I think you are here, saying that, well, no matter what this baker may believe, we can compel him to believe in a certain forms of ideas. The idea behind the First Amendment was that's what they did in 18th-century England. They compelled people to behave in certain kind of set ways in terms of religious practice. That's why we have a First Amendment."

      "utterance": "Yes, I believe that the debate over what's an artistic expression on a cupcake is sort of like the debate over angels over pinheads. And Kennedy did bring it back to the fundamental question, does forcing someone to participate in a ceremony that goes against his conscience, does that violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment? I think that's the fundamental question. I do believe that if people are allowed to have their conscientious objections, we can live somewhat peacefully with same- sex marriage, plus people that oppose it."

      "speaker": "FINELY",

      "utterance": "Paul, Americans have been watching in horror this week at the wildfires that are raging across southern California, infernos on the sides of highways and fears for old neighborhoods in Los Angeles. So this is a very broad but deeply-felt hit for the 5700 men and women firefighters that are there trying to stop this. It's bad enough when fires rage uncontrolled across empty land, it's a lot more chaotic and more dangerous when it's in people's backyards."

They were basically referring to a Trump decision to scale back a huge national monument out west that had been taken in an Obama land grab last year. But I would say it's nice to hear that corporations have speech rights. From the left, we've been told for years that corporations don't have those."

For years, reformers in Washington have been arguing against federal subsidies for stadiums, usually done through tax-exempt municipal bonds. Now a prohibition is in the tax bill. And the Republican and Democratic congressmen who put it there say it's partly because of the attention that the kneelers brought to the issue. So, thank you, Colin Kaepernick. Nix special tax breaks for the wealthy."
