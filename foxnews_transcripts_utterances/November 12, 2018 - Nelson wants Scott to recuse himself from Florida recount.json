One is she feels extremely aggrieved and that it was unfair and that this election was stolen from her, perhaps with Russian involvement. And I think that she does think that that's true. But I also think that -- when Mark Penn says she has a 75 percent approval rating among Democrats, I think that's because they think she's not running again. Like, you're nice to people when they've lost and they're moving on. Like, oh, yeah, she's fine and nice. But if she were to actually run again, there are so many Democrats would say we cannot afford to run that same race again because a midterm is a referendum on the president's performance, OK, fine.

And this just didn't start with the new leadership in 2003 when he took oath, but her boss got fired for grave neglect, mismanagement and incompetence. So, this is a history in Broward County. The question is why didn't Rick Scott fire her when he had control of this, before this became about his race? This incompetence has been going for a long, long time.

Legally, it was a very narrow margin. They needed to do the recount. That is following rule of law. We're doing the recount and now it's just getting politicized, you're having tweet being sent. You're having people on both sides kind of yelling at each other. And it really does cause great consternation for the American people.

We're already doing a great job here. They need to focus on trade, immigration, health care reform. And if they can really work in a bipartisan manner, then I think 2020 will be very interested.

Now they want their own investigation. They're going after his taxes when they have no legal right about it. And then there's this notion that they also said they want to investigate the president for going after the press. This president has been very open for us now. He has a hostile relationship with them. But as far as access, I think he's been one of the most transparent. Sometimes he says too much to the press. So, again, I think this is all politics.

One, the committee chairman have a lot of power at their disclosure, right? So you think about something like a Devin Nunes for example, right? He was able to do things. Second, you have at least six senators who want to run for president in 2020. How are they going to get attention? They're going to talk about Donald Trump. It's the only way for them to get attention. The third thing is a restless base. All these Democrats are just, one, believed that their voters want them to investigate Donald Trump. Four is the media. There's going to be leaks to the media. The media is going to look for stories and it's going to be everywhere.

Tell a veteran, \"Never forget.\" When you say, \"Never forget\" to a veteran, you are implying that as an American, you are in it with them.

So there were three winners here: Crenshaw for his reasonable response to a careless comment; \"SNL\" for finding a clever way to clean up a mess; and America for being handed an honest to God's blueprint for dealing with future outrages. Instead of ramping up the rage, it dialed it back. We've said it here before. It's beyond time to stop chasing scalps, demanding apologies, only to then refuse them. Haven't we had enough of the mob?

I think Pete's Davidson apology was mediocre at best. You know, I wish we didn't even get to a point where there was an apology. I agree. I don't necessarily know if we needed one. I can't believe that the comment came out of his mouth. His father died on 9/11 when he was a young boy, and Dan Crenshaw lost his eye on his third combat tour in Afghanistan a year after 9/11.

So eat -- eat a diet with fish and plenty of milk growing up, and then you're probably good enough. Get enough sun exposure. This does not talk about Vitamin D and bone health. We know Vitamin D is good for bone health, but we are showing that these supplements aren't necessarily helping reduce risk of cancer or heart disease."

Former president George w. Bush and first lady Laura Bush, they were mid- field at the Cowboys-Eagles game prior to kickoff for the coin toss. They were accompanied by three service members. Veterans from across the country were recognized throughout the game. And the NFL has helped raise close to $5.5 million for the league's military nonprofit partners. They also, the two of them, George W. Bush and Laura Bush, were given yesterday the Liberty Metal for their commitment to helping veterans. The center it was awarding them this medal for their Texas charitable mission helping wounded post-September 11 veterans get back on their feet. And Joe Biden presented them the medals, saying, \"He was my opposition and never my enemy.\" So they had a nice day."
