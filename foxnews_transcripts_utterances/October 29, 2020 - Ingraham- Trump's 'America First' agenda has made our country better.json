      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from Washington tonight. The media, they are desperately trying to shield Joe Biden from any coverage of his son's scandal, his family's scandal, and of course conceal whatever Joe knew and when he knew it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, we on the \"Ingraham Angle\" will not let this story get buried. So we went straight to swing state voters to find out what they think. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, it went to Ohio State University, where I spoke with students who are begging, begging for things to return to normal. And Republican-state lawmaker tells us what he's doing to give people hope of getting their old lives back. And that is a state where interesting things could happen on November 3. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also Raymond Arroyo breaks down Biden's biggest tales from last night's debate. And he is going to reveal which candidate the moderator interrupted the most. I can't miss Friday follies in moments. But first, the final stretch, that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Biden has his big donors, he has his political consultants, of course he has his Hollywood celebrities and his Silicon Valley billionaires, but we all know that the man himself inspires zero excitement among the voters. For Democrats, he is just the un-Trumpion necessity of the moment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now by contrast, millions of Americans, they would walk across glass to vote for Donald Trump. They will line up by the hundreds of thousands this week when you add it all up at his rallies across the Midwest, the Sun Belt, and in states like Pennsylvania. Well, and for good reason, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } His \"America First\" agenda, it helped raise median wages by about $6,000. He kept us out of stupid wars, he took on China, he strengthened our border, and although the media won't admit it, he handled the pandemic better than Europe. Oh, a lots happening in Naples, Italy tonight. Check it out. Oh, and another reason, voting for Biden would mean, you would be aligning yourself with some of the most condescending snobs on the face of the planet. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He's just a hologram for the real power base. His real power base, who is it, wants the donors. And they had no use for people in flyover country? Well, unless they speak mandarin, maybe. Biden's puppet masters, they know that their candidate can't be beat Trump's economic record, and they don't even pretend otherwise. And they know they can't compete with Trump's record for African-Americans or Hispanics, so instead they throw down their worn-out racism card. And they repeat that Trump's Charlottesville, good people on both sides lie, then they pivot to the gassing of protestors and Lafayette Park lie and so on and so forth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And their media poodles recklessly regurgitated it all day in and day out with these pained expressions on their face. They never smile. Now in essence, the Democrats uplifting argument for Biden comes down to this, hey lizard brains, check your white privilege and vote for Joe. And if you don't, you're going to be branded a racist. If you put a Trump sign on your yard, you are going to be targeted. If you go to a Trump rally, you might as well wear a white hood. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These insinuations, these attacks, they are beyond cynical. It's not just hardball politics, these are flat out lies. It's actually evil. The forces propping up Biden do want you to know the truth, and they will spend billions to prevent you from getting the truth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it's not just that, like this man, Duke Tanner, just pardoned by President Trump, who was serving a 20-year sentence for a nonviolent offense. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

President Trump loves this country and he has made enormous personal sacrifices to serve the country. And from the beginning, even before he was inaugurated, his entire family came under a sustained assault from a failed establishment from both sides of the aisle that loathes him. Now others might have given up, or just soured on politics, gone back to New York, had a good life, maybe thrown in the towel, but not him. Through it all, he has continued to celebrate the United States and its history. He has defended our monuments and our cities. He's put conservative talented men and women on the federal bench, including soon-to-be associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court. And anyone who claims to be pro- life and yet isn't supporting him is a complete and total phony. He has done more to promote the pro-life cause than any president in U.S. history. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now compare that to Vice President Biden, who stands with the callous butchers who profit off abortion on demand. Biden supporters include many who despise this country, who believe that our whole history from beginning to end is nothing more than a sorry saga of racism. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

If you love America, if you think our experiment in democracy is one of the greatest triumphs of the human spirit and you reject this pay-to-play government symbolized by Biden, you must stand with President Trump, for all of us who love America and who fought as hard as we could for the middle class.

He's doing everything possible to get a message, a strong message, past a hostile media. We have to help him spread that message. Talk to friends, talk to your parents, talk to your kids, talk to people at work, at church, at your kid's schools. On Election Day, let's teach the elites and their lackeys, a message they will never forget. In America, power belongs to the people, all of the people.

Biden, the pessimist, thinks that government, not you, knows best. Once again, I'm always struck by how gloomy and dark the Democrat outlook has become. Months ago, \"The Angle\" told you that the Democrats were waging a war against freedom and a war against fun. For Biden it's always nighttime in America, where you have to work harder for less, sacrifice more in order to fund their radical destructive plans. But for Trump, like Reagan, it's always morning in America, because we believe we're heaven blessed with liberty, faith, and family. And just remember, as President Reagan said, freedom is never more than one generation away from extension. Let's not lose it on our watch. That's all the time we have tonight.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" live from Washington tonight. The media, they are desperately trying to shield Joe Biden from any coverage of his son's scandal, his family's scandal, and of course conceal whatever Joe knew and when he knew it. Well, we on the \"Ingraham Angle\" will not let this story get buried. So we went straight to swing state voters to find out what they think. Plus, it went to Ohio State University, where I spoke with students who are begging, begging for things to return to normal. And Republican-state lawmaker tells us what he's doing to give people hope of getting their old lives back. And that is a state where interesting things could happen on November 3. Also Raymond Arroyo breaks down Biden's biggest tales from last night's debate. And he is going to reveal which candidate the moderator interrupted the most. I can't miss Friday follies in moments. But first, the final stretch, that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Biden has his big donors, he has his political consultants, of course he has his Hollywood celebrities and his Silicon Valley billionaires, but we all know that the man himself inspires zero excitement among the voters. For Democrats, he is just the un-Trumpion necessity of the moment. Now by contrast, millions of Americans, they would walk across glass to vote for Donald Trump. They will line up by the hundreds of thousands this week when you add it all up at his rallies across the Midwest, the Sun Belt, and in states like Pennsylvania. Well, and for good reason, right? His \"America First\" agenda, it helped raise median wages by about $6,000. He kept us out of stupid wars, he took on China, he strengthened our border, and although the media won't admit it, he handled the pandemic better than Europe. Oh, a lots happening in Naples, Italy tonight. Check it out. Oh, and another reason, voting for Biden would mean, you would be aligning yourself with some of the most condescending snobs on the face of the planet."

      "utterance": "In 2008, you were clinging to your guns and religion; 2016, you were the deplorables, the irredeemables; and in 2020, a wanted historian says, \"You're just a bunch of racist lizard brains\". Lizard brains is the quote, racist is obviously implied. And of course Biden agrees, don't fall for the whole homespun, \"I'm from Scranton and I rode Amtrak\" nonsense. He's just a hologram for the real power base. His real power base, who is it, wants the donors. And they had no use for people in flyover country? Well, unless they speak mandarin, maybe. Biden's puppet masters, they know that their candidate can't be beat Trump's economic record, and they don't even pretend otherwise. And they know they can't compete with Trump's record for African-Americans or Hispanics, so instead they throw down their worn-out racism card. And they repeat that Trump's Charlottesville, good people on both sides lie, then they pivot to the gassing of protestors and Lafayette Park lie and so on and so forth. And their media poodles recklessly regurgitated it all day in and day out with these pained expressions on their face. They never smile. Now in essence, the Democrats uplifting argument for Biden comes down to this, hey lizard brains, check your white privilege and vote for Joe. And if you don't, you're going to be branded a racist. If you put a Trump sign on your yard, you are going to be targeted. If you go to a Trump rally, you might as well wear a white hood. These insinuations, these attacks, they are beyond cynical. It's not just hardball politics, these are flat out lies. It's actually evil. The forces propping up Biden do want you to know the truth, and they will spend billions to prevent you from getting the truth.

And it's another argument for Trump's reelection. President Trump loves this country and he has made enormous personal sacrifices to serve the country. And from the beginning, even before he was inaugurated, his entire family came under a sustained assault from a failed establishment from both sides of the aisle that loathes him. Now others might have given up, or just soured on politics, gone back to New York, had a good life, maybe thrown in the towel, but not him. Through it all, he has continued to celebrate the United States and its history. He has defended our monuments and our cities. He's put conservative talented men and women on the federal bench, including soon-to-be associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court. And anyone who claims to be pro- life and yet isn't supporting him is a complete and total phony. He has done more to promote the pro-life cause than any president in U.S. history. Now compare that to Vice President Biden, who stands with the callous butchers who profit off abortion on demand. Biden supporters include many who despise this country, who believe that our whole history from beginning to end is nothing more than a sorry saga of racism."

Even the election of Barack Obama, I guess that didn't count either. His administration would teach our young people to hate this country, to tear down its history, to spoil our cities, and terrorize our people. Meanwhile Biden's family, they have made a fortune out of what is supposed to be public service. If you love America, if you think our experiment in democracy is one of the greatest triumphs of the human spirit and you reject this pay-to-play government symbolized by Biden, you must stand with President Trump, for all of us who love America and who fought as hard as we could for the middle class. This is our time. This is our chance. Because never before in my lifetime have the elites gathered in such numbers, were spent such money to stop a political movement. They used to mock us, but now they fear us, and they are right. They had their chance to govern this country for decades and they blew it. So let them spend their billions on propaganda, let them spread their lies, let them quiver with threats and rage. We will defy them. In the final week of the campaign, President Trump is doing his part. He's doing everything possible to get a message, a strong message, past a hostile media. We have to help him spread that message. Talk to friends, talk to your parents, talk to your kids, talk to people at work, at church, at your kid's schools. On Election Day, let's teach the elites and their lackeys, a message they will never forget. In America, power belongs to the people, all of the people. Not just an elite few who write the checks every four years. And that's the \"Angle\". Now yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation, which means it will likely be up for a floor vote on Monday.

Chuck Schumer has done everything he could to politicize the court. And I told Schumer when he called me in 2013, you will regret changing the rules.

And as a person, she has lived an incredibly well- rounded life. She embraces her faith without apology, she's pro-life, but she's going to apply a lot of the facts not the law of Amy. By not showing up and giving her the courtesy of a vote says more about the Democrats than it says Judge Barrett. My opponents raised $109 million against me. He said the reason he got in this race is because the way I behaved in Kavanaugh. The reason I'm going to win South Carolina is because I stood up for Kavanaugh. They are trying to destroy the Trump presidency. They are trying to wipe us out financially. So, if you are out there and you want to do something to help the Republicans, go to my website LindseyGraham.com, have my back, I've got Amy's back. I need your help to finish this race, all of our Republicans do. They're trying to wipe us out with money, but South Carolina is not for sale. The president did a hell of a job last night.

And right now the American people are confused on, I'm sure, which way they are trying to talk."

We have the highest achievement gap in the country here in Minnesota, which means our low income and minority students aren't getting the same level of education as their peers. And we think that's shameful. Unfortunately, our governor has a policy in place right now that will have a default where most kids will be in a distanced learning situation. And we are hearing from parents via email and text message and calls constantly that their kids who are normally straight A students are suffering and falling behind in the classroom. So we have a very simple statement that we just believe that every Minnesota student has a right to be in the classroom. And that should be the default. And if there is some reason, maybe there's an infection and they need to quarantine, then they can participate via distant learning. But we feel that every Minnesota student has a right to be in a classroom."

And it's not even clear they transmit the virus as readily as adults.

There was a great article in \"The Atlantic\" recently that said that the infection rate among students is 0.013 percent, or about 1.3 infections per 1,000 students over a two-week period. That's almost nothing.

I know the vice president is coming up Monday to northern Minnesota up to the Iron Range. We think that Minnesota is absolutely in play. The president almost won it, a point- and-a-half from winning it four years go, and we think that it's absolutely in play. The Senate race is, we think that those numbers are accurate. We think that the Senate race is that close. Jason Lewis is a former congressman. The current senator, Tina Smith, is a former lieutenant governor appointed by our previous governor to fill Al Franken's seat. And she has probably the lowest name i.d. of any competitor would be my guess."

Biden, the pessimist, thinks that government, not you, knows best. Once again, I'm always struck by how gloomy and dark the Democrat outlook has become. Months ago, \"The Angle\" told you that the Democrats were waging a war against freedom and a war against fun. For Biden it's always nighttime in America, where you have to work harder for less, sacrifice more in order to fund their radical destructive plans. But for Trump, like Reagan, it's always morning in America, because we believe we're heaven blessed with liberty, faith, and family. And just remember, as President Reagan said, freedom is never more than one generation away from extension. Let's not lose it on our watch. That's all the time we have tonight.
