Thousands of Americans green card holders eligible to be in this country, abandoned. Afghan allies, tens of thousands of them, abandoned. Their families abandoned behind enemy lines, thanks to Joe Biden. And tonight, it is more clear than ever, Joe Biden, his radical socialist friends, are completely, totally incompetent and clueless and have no desire to help bail out our fellow Americans. They caused this. This was entirely preventable and they're not lifting a finger to help Americans in need. Everything they do causes an unmitigated disaster. Look at the record -- Afghanistan, the border, COVID-19. Labor Day last year versus this year, 300 percent increase. Look at the economy. Look at inflation. Look at eliminating energy independence that we had achieved under the Trump administration for the first time in 75 years. And now, we're all paying about a buck 50 more a gallon, and Joe's begging OPEC to produce more energy. By the way, Joe, you could ask Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Alaska. They can increase their production. And guess what? We can be energy independent again. You can secure the border, finish the wall. Keep the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. That problem will be solved too. And, by the way, you should go back and get our fellow Americans in Afghanistan. Biden's approval rating is at an all-time low, and this year, at sporting events all across the country -- Jimmy Kimmel, pay attention -- guess what? They've been chanting the following, \"F Joe Biden\" en masse. Take a look.",

Now, it's the presidential protection program. A task, by the way, that's growing more impossible by the hour. Now, another crisis for Joe Biden. His insane spending bills, socialism bills, they are now stuck in limbo. They cannot be passed at the moment, doesn't seem like any time in the near future. Majorities in the House, the Senate, Democrats are unable to pass their own trillion dollar infrastructure bill, as well as their radical new green deal socialist bill, $3.5 trillion, their Build Back Better proposal that raises taxes on all of us, in spite of their lying. The holdup, of course, we have a civil war standoff between liberal Democrats and then the more socialists, bordering on statist communist Democrats. On Friday, what many are calling a weird hollow gesture, Joe Biden did nothing. He just limped over to the Capitol and encouraged his fellow Democrats to get along and to play nice. But here's the interesting part, according to a political reporter, Joe actually attempted -- he was willing to take questions from other congressmen and senators in the press, his staff again -- oh, I'm going to get in trouble. No, they get mad at me. They're going to yell at me if I take a question. I'm not allowed. Joe, you're the president. It's almost as if Joe Biden isn't in charge, isn't it? In other words, his staff knows he's a cognitive mess. Now, we do know for a fact that radical socialists, they're ruling the Democratic Party with an iron fist. And per usual, they are definitely not playing nice. This weekend, look at this in Arizona. One unhinged group of activists, including several illegal immigrants stalking Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema. They chased her into a bathroom stall and stayed outside the stall and kept filming.

And, by the way, $3.5 trillion, their eco-socialist amnesty for all spending bill. And tonight, she's calling out Democratic leadership for their, quote, inexcusable, deeply disappointing actions and Senator Sinema's colleague, Joe Manchin, also refusing to sign off on this monstrosity. And the liberal Democrat from West Virginia will only commit to a mere $1.5 trillion bill. Okay, some level of fiscal responsibility I guess. I don't think we should be spending a penny, especially after all the money we had to spend as it relates to the worst pandemic since 1917 and `18. Even Manchin is confronted by activists on his houseboat on the Potomac. But, first, you might be wondering what does Joe Biden think about his fellow Democrats being stalked and harassed by other Democrats? You would think that maybe Joe Biden would speak out, right?

The deal that our administration negotiated actually was -- was finished in February of 2020. That was just a matter of weeks after President Trump had given the order to take out Qasem Soleimani. It was just a few months after we had eliminated the ISIS caliphate and taken down Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And the president made it clear, and I was in the Oval office when he was speaking to Mullah Baradar that they would either keep the deal to work with the Afghan government to not harm any American personnel in Afghanistan and not be a safe harbor for terrorists, or we would hit them harder than we'd ever hit them before. And as evidence that they took us seriously, we went 18 months without a single American casualty in Afghanistan. But weakness arouses evil, Sean. And there's no question that the weakness evidenced by the Biden administration, I would say beginning when they were silent when thousands of rockets were rained down on our cherished ally Israel from Hamas, sent a signal into Afghanistan that we would not respond. And you saw, as you said earlier, you saw the Taliban march into Mazar-i- Sharif and then just simply -- simply walk into Kabul. And I just -- I really want people to know that I believe with all my heart that this never had to happen. I -- my -- I grieve for the 13 service members who were lost. Karen and I prayed and spent time with the family of Corporal Humberto Sanchez from Logan's Fort, Indiana. We -- we -- we -- it's hard for me to say it, but it just didn't have to happen, but it just -- it's an example of what weak leadership means on the world stage. And it's such a contrast to the -- to the heavy handed leadership of this administration at home. We have -- we have a president who is weak abroad but is very content to be lecturing the American people about vaccine mandates and attempting to drive through the Congress what would be not just the largest -- largest spending bill in the history of the country, Sean, it would be the largest tax increase in the history of the country that the Joint Taxation Committee in Congress just said would raise taxes in just a matter of a few years on Americans who make over $40,000 a year. We have got to dig in, tell the story of what they're doing, and I truly do believe that the voice of the American people can turn back this massive big government, socialist bill and -- and I'm doing my level best --",

We wanted to do it in an orderly way and we wanted to leave behind the kind of conditions that would be reflective of the enormous service and sacrifice of our troops over the last 20 years. And the president made it clear. He said, if you break this deal we're going to hit you harder than we have ever hit you before. He added -- he said, I don't like saying that, but he said I -- I just want you to know. And I could hear in Mullah Baradar's voice that he knew President Trump meant business. And -- and then you see this administration come in. They moved the -- the date for the withdrawal beyond the spring and into the fighting season, first incomprehensibly saying on September 11th. But I have to tell you, the idea that we abandoned Bagram Airbase in the middle of the night without telling our allies, and worst of all, that we left Americans and American allies behind was unconscionable. And -- and I have to tell you that -- that the generals that have been testifying before the Congress, the focus on all the advice the president got, the American people know the buck stops on the president's desk.

And this latest massive bill going -- that they're trying to force through to Congress is just the latest example of that. I mean, we cut taxes on working families and small businesses and created seven million good paying jobs. We -- we built 400 miles of border wall and negotiated with Mexico in the \"Remain in Mexico\" agreement that reduced illegal immigration by 90 percent. Now we're in the middle of the worst border crisis in American history. On my podcast that we just recorded today, I talked to Rodney Scott who was the chief of the Border Patrol until about five months ago and he said literally from -- from election day forward the rhetoric coming out of the Biden-Harris team was emboldening the cartels, emboldening people to begin the long and dangerous journey north through our border. And the crisis that you see today is the result of them unraveling our policies that we're working at the border and the messages that they have been sending south of the border. And I just -- I have to tell you, on one issue after another, I'm -- I'm absolutely convinced that the American people can see that in our administration, we were putting common sense conservative principles into practice. Our nation, our border was more secure. Our economy more prosperous, our liberties more secure with 300 judges on our Supreme -- on our courts and three on the Supreme Court. And now the American people can see this big government socialist agenda, writ large, open borders, higher taxes, a weak and apologetic foreign policy.

I did a podcast recently with the Gallup poll expert who's spent years now in Central America. He describes and in the Biden world, you now have people who fly from Haiti to Ecuador and then come up through Colombia to the United States by the tens of thousands. You have Africans flying into Brazil to come up to the United States by the thousands. And all of this is spreading and accelerating, you're presently going to have four or five hundred thousand people every single month. And no society can absorb and assimilate that scale of in-migration.

And tonight, it is more clear than ever, Joe Biden, his radical socialist friends, are completely, totally incompetent and clueless and have no desire to help bail out our fellow Americans. They caused this. This was entirely preventable and they're not lifting a finger to help Americans in need. Everything they do causes an unmitigated disaster. Look at the record -- Afghanistan, the border, COVID-19. Labor Day last year versus this year, 300 percent increase. Look at the economy. Look at inflation. Look at eliminating energy independence that we had achieved under the Trump administration for the first time in 75 years. And now, we're all paying about a buck 50 more a gallon, and Joe's begging OPEC to produce more energy. By the way, Joe, you could ask Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Alaska. They can increase their production. And guess what? We can be energy independent again. You can secure the border, finish the wall. Keep the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy. That problem will be solved too. And, by the way, you should go back and get our fellow Americans in Afghanistan.

His insane spending bills, socialism bills, they are now stuck in limbo. They cannot be passed at the moment, doesn't seem like any time in the near future. Majorities in the House, the Senate, Democrats are unable to pass their own trillion dollar infrastructure bill, as well as their radical new green deal socialist bill, $3.5 trillion, their Build Back Better proposal that raises taxes on all of us, in spite of their lying. The holdup, of course, we have a civil war standoff between liberal Democrats and then the more socialists, bordering on statist communist Democrats. On Friday, what many are calling a weird hollow gesture, Joe Biden did nothing. He just limped over to the Capitol and encouraged his fellow Democrats to get along and to play nice. But here's the interesting part, according to a political reporter, Joe actually attempted -- he was willing to take questions from other congressmen and senators in the press, his staff again -- oh, I'm going to get in trouble. No, they get mad at me. They're going to yell at me if I take a question. I'm not allowed. Joe, you're the president. It's almost as if Joe Biden isn't in charge, isn't it? In other words, his staff knows he's a cognitive mess. Now, we do know for a fact that radical socialists, they're ruling the Democratic Party with an iron fist.

And, by the way, $3.5 trillion, their eco-socialist amnesty for all spending bill. And tonight, she's calling out Democratic leadership for their, quote, inexcusable, deeply disappointing actions and Senator Sinema's colleague, Joe Manchin, also refusing to sign off on this monstrosity. And the liberal Democrat from West Virginia will only commit to a mere $1.5 trillion bill. Okay, some level of fiscal responsibility I guess. I don't think we should be spending a penny, especially after all the money we had to spend as it relates to the worst pandemic since 1917 and `18. Even Manchin is confronted by activists on his houseboat on the Potomac. But, first, you might be wondering what does Joe Biden think about his fellow Democrats being stalked and harassed by other Democrats? You would think that maybe Joe Biden would speak out, right?

The deal that our administration negotiated actually was -- was finished in February of 2020. That was just a matter of weeks after President Trump had given the order to take out Qasem Soleimani. It was just a few months after we had eliminated the ISIS caliphate and taken down Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And the president made it clear, and I was in the Oval office when he was speaking to Mullah Baradar that they would either keep the deal to work with the Afghan government to not harm any American personnel in Afghanistan and not be a safe harbor for terrorists, or we would hit them harder than we'd ever hit them before. And as evidence that they took us seriously, we went 18 months without a single American casualty in Afghanistan. But weakness arouses evil, Sean. And there's no question that the weakness evidenced by the Biden administration, I would say beginning when they were silent when thousands of rockets were rained down on our cherished ally Israel from Hamas, sent a signal into Afghanistan that we would not respond. And you saw, as you said earlier, you saw the Taliban march into Mazar-i- Sharif and then just simply -- simply walk into Kabul. And I just -- I really want people to know that I believe with all my heart that this never had to happen. I -- my -- I grieve for the 13 service members who were lost. Karen and I prayed and spent time with the family of Corporal Humberto Sanchez from Logan's Fort, Indiana. We -- we -- we -- it's hard for me to say it, but it just didn't have to happen, but it just -- it's an example of what weak leadership means on the world stage. And it's such a contrast to the -- to the heavy handed leadership of this administration at home. We have -- we have a president who is weak abroad but is very content to be lecturing the American people about vaccine mandates and attempting to drive through the Congress what would be not just the largest -- largest spending bill in the history of the country, Sean, it would be the largest tax increase in the history of the country that the Joint Taxation Committee in Congress just said would raise taxes in just a matter of a few years on Americans who make over $40,000 a year. We have got to dig in, tell the story of what they're doing, and I truly do believe that the voice of the American people can turn back this massive big government, socialist bill and -- and I'm doing my level best --"

It included a conditions on the ground based withdraw. It included America keeping Bagram Air Base forever, strategically important location, China.

And - - and you know I share the conviction that the vast majority of Americans that we want -- we wanted to get our troops home but we wanted to do it with honor. We wanted to do it in an orderly way and we wanted to leave behind the kind of conditions that would be reflective of the enormous service and sacrifice of our troops over the last 20 years. And the president made it clear. He said, if you break this deal we're going to hit you harder than we have ever hit you before. He added -- he said, I don't like saying that, but he said I -- I just want you to know. And I could hear in Mullah Baradar's voice that he knew President Trump meant business. And -- and then you see this administration come in. They moved the -- the date for the withdrawal beyond the spring and into the fighting season, first incomprehensibly saying on September 11th. But I have to tell you, the idea that we abandoned Bagram Airbase in the middle of the night without telling our allies, and worst of all, that we left Americans and American allies behind was unconscionable. And -- and I have to tell you that -- that the generals that have been testifying before the Congress, the focus on all the advice the president got, the American people know the buck stops on the president's desk.

And this latest massive bill going -- that they're trying to force through to Congress is just the latest example of that. I mean, we cut taxes on working families and small businesses and created seven million good paying jobs. We -- we built 400 miles of border wall and negotiated with Mexico in the \"Remain in Mexico\" agreement that reduced illegal immigration by 90 percent. Now we're in the middle of the worst border crisis in American history. On my podcast that we just recorded today, I talked to Rodney Scott who was the chief of the Border Patrol until about five months ago and he said literally from -- from election day forward the rhetoric coming out of the Biden-Harris team was emboldening the cartels, emboldening people to begin the long and dangerous journey north through our border. And the crisis that you see today is the result of them unraveling our policies that we're working at the border and the messages that they have been sending south of the border. And I just -- I have to tell you, on one issue after another, I'm -- I'm absolutely convinced that the American people can see that in our administration, we were putting common sense conservative principles into practice. Our nation, our border was more secure. Our economy more prosperous, our liberties more secure with 300 judges on our Supreme -- on our courts and three on the Supreme Court. And now the American people can see this big government socialist agenda, writ large, open borders, higher taxes, a weak and apologetic foreign policy.

I did a podcast recently with the Gallup poll expert who's spent years now in Central America. He describes and in the Biden world, you now have people who fly from Haiti to Ecuador and then come up through Colombia to the United States by the tens of thousands. You have Africans flying into Brazil to come up to the United States by the thousands. And all of this is spreading and accelerating, you're presently going to have four or five hundred thousand people every single month.

In the case of Sinema, she's shown very tough very calm very much just being her own person and frankly they can't pressure her very much. I mean, she's been elected in a state which elects mavericks, that elect Barry Goldwater, it elected John McCain. She's perfectly in that kind of a tradition.

It's up on the upper west side in New York City, on Broadway. We've been friends a long time and I've known you for a long time. You're really not that political this hit you hard and I and I'll be honest, John, I'm -- it's day 51. We abandon Americans they're families green card holders eligible to be here, thousands of them, tens of thousands of allies Walk us through the process. How did you -- you don't usually do political songs, although Superman would be maybe an exception."

      "utterance": "You know, Sean, I had no intention of writing a song. I take no joy in writing this song. But when we saw those images coming out, Afghanistan, it certainly shook all of us. And when our 13 soldiers were killed, I was very angry like so many and I went up and banged on my piano. But it didn't take shape the song until I got a call from a friend after our troops had left, and she said I need a contact because I'm organizing evacs of AMCITs from Afghanistan. And I said, what's an AMCIT? And she said American citizen. And I said, are you telling me that you're risking your life and your colleagues' life to go rescue Americans that we left behind? And there was silence on the line. And I couldn't believe we were living in that world. And then finally when the president gave his extraordinary success speech, I was hoping that General Milley and General Austin would come out and give us some clarity on that because I know that they knew that was not the case. But they echoed the same what \"a great airlift\" line which was a narrative to distract from their failures, and that scared me. And I wrote those Milley and Austin and Blinken lines the song wrote itself. I took no joy and put it out. I put it out because somebody in the arts had to say it."

When I spoke to you about this because it's now gone so viral and I said, are you aware what's happening here? And you are. You're very aware that this song is -- has almost become an anthem for our military guys. Guys that did many tours there and then you told me what the reaction is when you sing this song on stage now, which you'll be doing in New York tomorrow."

      "utterance": "It's surreal. It's like nothing I've ever seen. At the end of my show, I asked my quartet to leave and I take a few minutes before I play the song and put it into context for everyone, that it is a moral message. It's not a political message. The American promise matters. No man left behind matters. Accountability matters, and when I sing the song you'll hear soldiers screaming \"oorah\", you'll hear people crying, and then when it's over, I'll have veterans regular citizens across the political inspection -- spectrum come up to me. Some of the veterans can't even talk, Sean. They're so ashamed that we left those behind that they fought with. Some of our military heroes are down there right now. They have drained their bank accounts. They have quit their jobs. They went down to save those that saved their lives and they're risking their lives as we speak. The American promise is not dead. Our government has just abandoned it. But we're doing it."

      "utterance": "Imagine our State Department, the same ones that said, oh, you might want to make your way to the airport, but we can't guarantee your safety. This was so preventable because we saw the Taliban you know moving forward in March, in April and May and June and July and the and the Afghan army collapsing as Joe Biden's praising them in July. And you know, you watch how preventable this is when we had full control. We could have gotten every single person out of there. All our military equipment out of there and they didn't do it. And then they take a victory lap and then they talk about turning the page. They're abandoned behind enemy lines. They're hostages to a terrorist group. That's not an America I recognize. That's not political for me either."

And if we don't admit our complicity, and we have accountability, this is going to fester in our moral soul, and it will continue to erode. And look, the Biden administration may not have accountability for Blinken and Milley and Austin, but history will. And we're going to keep that in the face of everybody the best we can."

      "utterance": "All right. Before we go, fail, late night host Jimmy Kimmel, his ratings do suck is again -- all right, he's trying to take cheap shots. He wants to have another fight with yours truly, for accurately calling out the never-ending struggles of Joe Biden. So, Jimmy, obviously, your memory's short. You're desperate for attention. You pick a fight with Hannity, because, you know, I'm going to hit you back, and I'm going to hit you back times harder. I'm up for a fight any day. Anyway, Biden did abandon Americans in Afghanistan, Jimmy. Are you upset about it? He created a massive self-inflicted super spread of disaster at the border, you care about health? The inflation in this country is now going through the roof. Supply chains are now are now strained throughout the country. Biden abandoned energy independence. Now he's begging OPEC to produce more oil. Here's your biggest problem. I'm going to give you unsolicited career advice. You're not funny anymore. Your ratings suck because of it. Maybe if you stop being so political hire better writers and every once in a while, if people are chanting \"F Joe Biden\", you might want to run it. And if you want to have this fight -- okay, buckle up, because I got archives that go back your entire career and we'll have it out. Anyway, Joe was booed all over the country again this weekend. You know if it was Trump you would run it. It's pretty fascinating, by the way, keep watching Greg Gutfeld here on the FOX News Channel, the cable channel. You know what? It's fast becoming the top rated late night show. I'm on Team Gutfeld. I'm all in the fight if you want it. It'll be me versus you, ABC, Bob Iger and Disney, and I'll win. But unfortunately, that's all the time we have left for this evening. The ball's in your court. Please set your DV, never miss an episode. In the meantime, let not your hearts be troubled. Laura Ingram's next. We'll see you back here tomorrow night. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2021 VIQ Media Transcription, Inc.
