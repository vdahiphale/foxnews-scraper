We have incredible breaking news that we're going to be covering all night tonight. The Trump administration pushing hard for peace on the peninsula and now, a senior North Korean official as we speak is traveling right here in New York for a historic meeting with the Secretary of State Mark Pompeo. By the way, they'll probably have to pay taxes while they're here. It's such a high tax state. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, the, of course, destroy Trump media openly mocking the president's negotiations with Kim Jong Un and guess what? They're all but ignoring the Trump administration's massive diplomatic success here including freeing the American hostages from all over the world. We're going to show you the worst of the worst and how corrupt your bias media is tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, we have Robert Mueller's out of control Russia probe has now lost any sense of legitimacy and will explain. And according to reports, Obama's Justice Department, they utilized at least one informant to spy on multiple Trump campaign officials and associates during the 2016 election.

I think one of the funniest moments tonight. By the way, if you here as a spy, just let me know. Please put your hand up and he's dragging out, by the way, the investigation he wants to derail many pro-Trump Republicans in the midterms. We'll explain the president's tweet from earlier and, of course, the media doesn't get it.

Tomorrow, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is said to meet with a high- ranking North Korean official in New York City -- now, the most senior official to visit the United States in nearly two decades.

And as you can imagine, your corrupt media use that letter to trash the president, revealing what I have been saying so many times on this program, they in order to have the president fail that means the country has to fail.

We have incredible breaking news that we're going to be covering all night tonight. The Trump administration pushing hard for peace on the peninsula and now, a senior North Korean official as we speak is traveling right here in New York for a historic meeting with the Secretary of State Mark Pompeo. By the way, they'll probably have to pay taxes while they're here. It's such a high tax state. Meanwhile, the, of course, destroy Trump media openly mocking the president's negotiations with Kim Jong Un and guess what? They're all but ignoring the Trump administration's massive diplomatic success here including freeing the American hostages from all over the world. We're going to show you the worst of the worst and how corrupt your bias media is tonight. Also, we have Robert Mueller's out of control Russia probe has now lost any sense of legitimacy and will explain. And according to reports, Obama's Justice Department, they utilized at least one informant to spy on multiple Trump campaign officials and associates during the 2016 election. And by the way, the media is lying about it. Also Robert Mueller has allegedly weaponized the information collected by the informants, spies in order to target President Trump and those connected to his campaign. I think one of the funniest moments tonight. By the way, if you here as a spy, just let me know. Please put your hand up and he's dragging out, by the way, the investigation he wants to derail many pro-Trump Republicans in the midterms. We'll explain the president's tweet from earlier and, of course, the media doesn't get it. And they are running for full cover for Robert Mueller, downplaying this elicit deep state spying scheme, the biggest abuse of power, the biggest corruption scandal in American history. Also, liberal activists all across the country were publicly embarrassed this week after they were caught pushing a salacious fake story about President Trump putting illegal immigrants in cages well it turns out that actually was under Obama's administration. And finally, we'll bring you all the latest on \"Roseanne\" canceled by ABC after Roseanne Barr's incendiary comments.

But first, as the president's historic talks now with Kim Jong Un weigh in the balance, now despite what you are hearing from the left-wing media in this country, we have full reason to believe and be hopeful about the potential upcoming talks with North Korea. Tomorrow, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is said to meet with a high- ranking North Korean official in New York City -- now, the most senior official to visit the United States in nearly two decades. A massive development and only the latest sign that these historic talks might still take place in Singapore. They're scheduled to begin on June the 12th. Of course, last week, President Trump initially canceled the summit, sending a strongly worded letter to Kim Jong Un after the despot, the dictator, authorized a series of aggressive statements and failed to comply with the -- some of the basic planning ahead of the talks. And as you can imagine, your corrupt media use that letter to trash the president, revealing what I have been saying so many times on this program, they in order to have the president fail that means the country has to fail.

Last week, we first reported that the Justice Department under the Obama administration utilized at least one FBI informant to actively spy on multiple people that are associated with the Trump campaign. That includes Sam Clovis and Carter Page. They will be here tonight along with George Papadopoulos who recently played guilty to lying to the FBI after pressure from the Office of the Special Counsel. Sam Clovis recently told Byron York that the informant FBI spy used him in order to secure the meeting with Papadopoulos. Meanwhile, former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo. He also, all three of these guys that were approached by the spy will join us tonight and, of course, Caputo's claiming that he was approached by multiple government informants during the 2016 election.

It ignored the norm against deploying such tactics against political opponents not based on evidence of a Trump Russia criminal conspiracy but on speculation about the Trump campaign's Russia contacts and Russians to sympathies.' How many times have I said they're weaponizing the powerful tools of intelligence? This elicit, this unprecedented spying is now being used by team Mueller to malign President Trump and everybody else around him. Hours ago, the president raised another pressing concern surrounding the ongoing Mueller witch hunt. He tweeted out, quote, 'the 13 angry Democrats plus people who work eight years for Obama worked on the rigged Russian witch-hunt will be meddling with the midterm elections, especially now that Republicans stay tough are taking the lead in the polls. There was no collusion except by the Democrats.' The president raises an important concern especially given the new revelation surrounding what the president is calling, rightly, spygate. And, of course, the mainstream media, they are providing cover for Team Mueller as they actively are rooting for the special counsel investigation to find something, to find anything on this president. And as you can probably imagine, the media's been doing everything in its power to downplay what is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in American politics and history. And, by the way, you have an administration using the Justice Department to spy on an opposing political party during a presidential election, using bought and paid for the other campaign in this case, Hillary Clinton, using her bought and paid for funneled money through a law firm, to Fusion GPS, to hire a foreign national to get Russian lies that even he says in an interrogatory in Great Britain maybe 50/50 at best raw intelligence, to then get a warrant by lying to a spy -- a FISA judge in an original application and three subsequent applications and not telling any of the judges that Hillary paid for it. Take a look at how the bias press is trying to brush aside this huge, massive national abuse of power corruption scandal."

You have activist Shawn King said that children of immigrants being held in cages like dogs and Linda Sarsour, remember her? Oh, yes, she's chimed in, hashtagging #weareourchildren. What Sarsour, King, and, yes, your friends and the media failed to realize is -- let's put those pictures back up. Those pictures were taken in 2014, Barack Hussein Obama was your president.

So, fast forward to 150 years, here we are now and Mueller wants to criminalize a perfectly legitimate conversation with the attorney general in which he's being scolded for essentially using the wrong regulation to recuse himself? The regulation calls for recusal in criminal cases. This wasn't a criminal case. It was a counter intelligence probe. This just underscores what a colossal waste of taxpayer money. Mueller is squandering and how desperate he is."

He gets them to defend MS-13, Hamas and the North Koreans all in the span of the last month. That's your Democrats, that's who they really are. Nice job, President Trump. He's the only one that could have done that."

Well, the breakup letter got within 24 hours, Kim Jung-un's people, pretty pleased, little rocket man begging to meet with the president. It's a classic example art of the deal. All right. Thank you both."

Now, so there is big news. We are going to continue our investigation. The media is wrong as it relates to no spies in the Trump campaign. We gave you tonight the definition of what a spy is, the dictionary definition. The Thesaurus definitions of what a spy is. So it's getting kind of interesting. We also are expecting the I.G. report as it relates to the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation, it could be any day of this week and all the other news. We promise we'll always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham has a big show. No time to chit chat, by the way. Take it away."
