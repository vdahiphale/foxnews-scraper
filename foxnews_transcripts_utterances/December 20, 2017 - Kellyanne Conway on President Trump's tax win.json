But Obamacare has been repealed in this bill. We didn't want to bring it up, I told people specifically, \"Be quiet with the fake news media because i don't want them talking too much about it because I didn't know how people would - but now that it's approved.

So, they are talking about a short-term budget to keep it open until roughly January 19th, and then they will have more talks. One sign of progress tonight is Republican leaders agreed to drop a provision to prop up the Obamacare markets that had angered Conservatives, by leaving that Obamacare fix on the shelf, they have a shot at getting enough republican votes in the house and senate to keep the government open without needing any democratic help. It's going to be hard to get even a small number of democratic votes to pass the budget because the Liberal leaders like Nancy Pelosi signaled today, they want to go back to resist. Pelosi, firing off a letter to her democratic colleagues that without adding new spending projects plus legislation allowing the children of illegal immigrants to stay in America, \"We continue to urge a strong no on the continuing resolution.\" That hints at a government shutdown as some of the President's outside advisors that run the nonprofit America first policies is planning a $1 million TV ad blitz focused on the positive of his agenda, what he has accomplished this year. The ad starts running on Christmas day, but we are getting a sneak peek tonight. Now, the President's advisors tell me the point is the President has been beaten up from day one. Despite all of the critics, there are millions of Americans who are grateful for his leadership particularly on tax reform and they are eager to get him going to pass other big items like infrastructure and immigration reform, so they do not want a government shut down right now to slow the momentum they believe he has. In fact, the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is telling our own Bret Baier tonight, he believes they will find a way to avoid a government shutdown, judge."

You saw the President really calling out by name the leaders of the House and Senate, the Chairman of the different committees and really the rank and file Republicans. Unfortunately there were no Democrats there because none of them took an opportunity to give tax cuts and relief to our job creators, to middle class families, and they are going to have to go home this Christmas and all next year and explain why they insisted this is a tax cut for the rich when just today you had major companies say - they are going to give bonuses and other charitable contributions to their employees. Are those employees receiving those hard working men and women the rich? So, I think the Democrats missed a huge opportunity here with President Trump's leadership that really put this over the top. We worked very closely with the Congress."

One is January 1st. Starting next year, literally we will have a different kind of tax code that we all live under. In February, many Americans will start to see their - the increases in their pay. Their paychecks will get fatter under this paycheck President. And in April, of course, April 15th, a day many Americans dread, they will recognize that many of them will simplify the way they file their taxes. They will take back so much of those wasted hours and wasted money. Then they will start to see many of these businesses repatriate the trillions of dollars that is parked legally offshore. We're going from the offshoring model to the American model it will make our job creators more competitive. I think today was a real turning point in terms of showing that the Congress and the Presidency can work together. President can work together to deliver for the American people. This was not a campaign promise. This is a moral imperative for people who deserve to keep more of their money."

      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "So, today was really three bills in one, and it was quite historic on every level. The tax cuts themselves are historic as the President noted. But, having the repeal of the Obamacare mandate, also means that another signature piece of the trump agenda that helped propel him to victory over Hillary Clinton, has all been fulfilled, that the Democrats who took the chance on the Obamacare mandate in insisting that the individual mandate would attract the young and healthy to the exchanges, it did not do that. The young and healthy were too smart. They wouldn't do it and the whole thing collapsed. As you know 30 million Americans, Jeanine, don't have healthcare as we speak. The insurers all fled the exchanges. It became prohibitive for them. And the third thing in this three-for-one was (ANWR). This has taken 40 years for a President and a Congress to pass with others, including President Reagan and the Presidents - Bushes tried to do, which is start drilling responsibly so that we are more energy dependent on America. We create those jobs. We tap those resources. I mean, some of the estimates are truly incredible, but all of this put together, America is going to see almost immediately what the difference there is in the economy. And let's face it Jeanine, the tax cuts is the centerpiece of regulatory roll back."

We have a 50 percent decrease in illegal crossing since he was elected. We want the poison out of our country, 90 percent of heroin; the President says comes through the Southern Border. We have fencing and all coming in. And so, all of this adds up to a President who has put forth a 70-point immigration plan including a merit based system.

Jeanine, all the press's predictions were corporate America would never - never allow this tax cut to be down to the benefit of the little guy of the worker. They were going to stick it in their own pockets; the minute it passed before the President even reacted with south lawn they had already announced these bonuses. They predicted a year ago, global recessions, stock market crashes, a disaster everywhere, the opposite has happened. The consumer confidence is historic. The unemployment rate is low - the lowest ever among Hispanics. Lower for African-Americans, in women and teens, in a while. And so, all of this knitted together shows a President and his leadership that has been able to realize a piece of legislation that many members who stood behind him tomorrow had voted on many years only to have it die on the President's desk. And some of those had voted for the Reagan tax cuts and they think this is even more bold."

Tiny Tim, we're taking your crutch away from you. And all the other kids in this country. And we're putting a lump of coal in to your Christmas stocking. It's shameful. It should not be happening in this country with so much wealth and so much greatness that we would allow these children and the 370,000 pregnant women in this country that also rely on chip. That we would shut them out of healthcare."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" We are learning more about FBI Director Andrew McCabe's seven-hour appearance before the House Intelligence Committee last night on the ongoing Russia investigation. Congressional investigators are exclusively telling Fox News that McCabe's testimony contained numerous conflicts with statements made by previous witnesses. According to these sources, the big issue at hand is whether McCabe told the truth about the FBI's probe into the anti-Trump dossier and the exact time frame when he found out that it was funded by Hillary Clinton's campaign as well as the Democratic National Committee. Due to you McCabe's alleged discrepancies the Republican in the committee is planning to issue fresh subpoenas next week on Justice Department and FBI personnel. Joining us now with reaction Republican Congressman Raul Labrador. All right good evening Congressman, thank you so much for being here. You know, this 7-hour testimony by McCabe seems to present a lot of paradoxes that apparently these guys don't have their stories together which suggest to me as a Judge that somebody is lying."

      "speaker": "REP. RAUL LABRADOR, R-ID., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Oh, we have a major problem. We have the Department of Justice that has an issue with the subpoenas that have been issued. They haven't answered all of our questions. But most importantly, you have an investigation that was started that it appears now for political reasons the Democrats have been claiming that there was collusion between the Republican and the Russians. And what we're finding out there was collusion, but the collusion was between the Democrats, the Department of Justice and the people who were doing this dossier. So, we have a problem and we need to get to the bottom of it."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "I must tell you, Congressman, I had a couple of your fellow Congressman on justice last Saturday night. And they said that they had gotten approval to start with the subpoenas as quickly as possible. Given the resistance by the FBI as well as the Department of Justice. It must frustrate you as an elected Congressman that for some reason the FBI thinks that they are above everyone when, in fact, they clearly are not."

We also had the chief deputy at the Department of Justice, and I believe that they are going to get to the bottom of this. I think they are investigating it. You have the investigation going on with all these -- with all these different members of the previous administration. But as you know, it would be very difficult if you were a prosecutor, it would be very difficult to trust what these people were doing, if you knew that they had a bias against the person that they were prosecuting."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Jeanine, you and I in careers basically in law enforcement, they have to give you the evidence that they need to give you, but, more importantly, none of these people, if they are not telling the truth, in the big picture, they can never be used as witnesses in any case ever in court again. That is exculpatory evidence that the FBI will always have to turn over. If they're not honest. So, if it's found that they are not honest when all these congressional hearings are finished, they can't be employed at all by the Department of Justice, period. None of them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. But that relates to the Department of Justice. I'm talking about taking them out in cuffs and making sure that if people are perjuring themselves. If there is an effort of conspiracy on the part of these higher ups in the FBI and DOJ to create a, you know, fake dossier which they then get, you know, before a FISA Judge, the Judge issues a warrant. I mean, this is fruit of the poisonous tree, Greg."

      "utterance": "One of the key questions was, when did you find out that this dossier was phony? This was posed to Andrew McCabe. We really don't know the answer, but it is critical. In they knew it was phony and went to a federal Judge and used fake or dubious evidence to spy on President Trump and his associates. It's a fraud on the court. It's a crime. That is a critical question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Greg, the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are refusing to give this information, I listened to Rod Rosenstein, I listened to Christopher Wray, the FBI. They were punting. They wouldn't give an answer. They don't have that right. They do not run their own government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Peter King, a Congressman who sat in yesterday behind closed doors at the hearing said adequate answers were not given by Andrew McCabe. Now, you know what that means as a Judge. And I do as a lawyer. That means somebody is lying and covering up. So it's triggered all of these other subpoenas that are going to happen in the course of the next several days to get other witnesses in there. Andrew McCabe, the man on the screen has a lot to answer for, because he is a guy whose signature is on the documents, saying that he was aware of the origins of the dossier. That is Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic national committee and, yesterday apparently, according to our source in the hearing, he said oh, gee, I don't really remember when I found out Hillary was behind this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "It's even worse, Pam, because then what he does is he goes with his wife to try to get some money from Hillary -- from Tim McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, I mean that is a conflict right there. Can you explain to me why the taxpayers are paying this man's salary, why he continues to be deputy and head of the FBI?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "And he had a duty to reveal that. An affirmative duty. No one should have to come to him and say do you have a conflict. He clearly had a conflict. We had McCabe on the Clinton investigation to explain to our viewers how complicated this whole thing is. We have Strzok who is still employed at H.R. but should no longer be employed who changed the language regarding what Comey, regarding Comey and Hillary Clinton. And he -- and his text messages to his girlfriend, Lisa Page employed, show complete disdain for the commander-in-chief of the United States. It should have never been involved in this investigation."

      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "You know, what's interesting is Democrats and the mainstream media and I realize that is redundant, keep saying well, Mueller got rid of Peter Strzok. Well, yeah. But how much damage did Strzok do in the full year he was on the case? He is the guy who launched it in July of last year. And why did Comey cover up the reasons behind getting rid of Peter Strzok for five long months, never telling congress, never telling the American people? That is deceptive and dishonest by Robert Mueller."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Tomorrow the U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to vote on a resolution opposing any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This comes as President Trump earlier this month boldly announced his intentions to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley is warning that the U.S. will be taking names. And today during a Cabinet meeting, President Trump doubled down on Ambassador Haley's message, take a look."

Or they vote against us potentially at the assembly. They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us. Well, we are watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We will save a lot. We don't care. This isn't like this used to be vote against you and pay them hundreds of millions of dollars and nobody know what is they are doing. Nikki that was the right message that you and I agreed to be sent yesterday. I have had a lot of good comment on it, believe me. People are tired of the United States, people live here great citizens, I love this country, they are tired of this country being taking advantage of and we are not going to be taken advantage of any longer."

      "speaker": "DANNY DANON, ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS",
      "utterance": "The U.N. has no right to tell the U.S. Where to put the embassy of the U.S. in Israel. I think tomorrow we will see another session of bashing not only of Israel, bashing of the U.S. and no resolution that is passed can change the reality that Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of the state of Israel. You cannot change that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, so many Presidents have promised that they were going to do it. What is it about this President obviously he is stronger. Why would they promise it and not deliver? What was the harm to them? Were they afraid of these other countries?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANON",
      "utterance": "We see a different kind of leadership. We appreciate that. Courageous bold decision of President Trump. Not only that, also the veto of Ambassador Haley and the Security Council. Last year, I was at the Security Council last September and there was another resolution. The previous administration supported that shameful resolution. We see the change, we appreciate it this is a way to U.N. to come with your values and ideology and to change the U.N. We need to reform the U.N."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Clearly the President is going to do that. He talked about it with NATO and now he is talking about it with the U.N. What money, I mean, is there money to individual countries that can be impacted by, you know, the United States saying you don't vote with us, we are not going to give you money anymore?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANON",
      "utterance": "That is for the President and Ambassador Haley to be excited about that hypocrisy in the U.N. If you give money to those countries, they think you had should demand from them. That is what we do when we support countries. I called many ambassadors today. We said we support you. Technology, cyber security, defense, now we need you to vote. If you do not support us we will also take notes."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANON",
      "utterance": "They see the peace process exactly the opposite. They don't support the peace process. They support the Palestinian ideology of incitement of running away from a dialogue. The only way to move forward is direct negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians. The President's decision is the right move, because now that understands new leadership. They have to decide whether they are joining the negotiations or moving on without them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And so I mean by saying that, you know, this is going to disrupt the peace process. That is just their excuse, in fact it hasn't gone forward for a long time. Maybe this the way to do it."

    {
      "speaker": "DANON",
