We're told other payments, according to The New York Times. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are going to explore that with the judge, Andrew Napolitano, in a second. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First to Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy, what he makes of all of this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Senator, thank you for your patience.

JOHN KENNEDY, R—LOUISIANA: You bet. Well, it's all speculation. If we look at the facts, we know that the New York Times reported that the FBI has raided Mr. Cohen's office. Now, presumably, it's about the $130,000 payment to Mrs. Daniels. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Since we're just speculating, and nobody knows, one point of view could be that someone has someone alleged the payment by Mr. Cohen to Mrs. Daniels was somehow a violation of the election laws. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But if we're going to be fair, it's equally plausible that somebody might have alleged that perhaps somebody was trying to extort the president through his lawyer. I mean, both of those are equally plausible. We don't know.",
