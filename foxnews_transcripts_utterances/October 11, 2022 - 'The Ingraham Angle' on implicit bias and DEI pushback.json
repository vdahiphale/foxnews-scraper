Now, this grouping of seemingly innocuous terms has become its own weapon against objective merit and excellence across the American landscape. The acronym is DEI, but it's really more like BVI, Bureaucracy, Victimology and Incompetence. Corporations spend as much as $8 billion a year for DEI compliance with so called diversity and bias experts being paid hefty sums to oversee this woke training and compliance.

It should be obvious why Biden and his cabinet have repeated the mantra so often that America is systemically racist.

The mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, somehow has the expertise we're supposed to believe, to run a department with 55,000 employees. And Biden set this DEI stage with a big Executive Order last year that planted these poisonous seeds. There's bias mitigation trainings now at the Energy Department. They push an oppression narrative at the State Department. And of course, Mayor Pete, at DH - DOT even called DEI critical and advancing the department's mission. My friend, so much is breaking down around us. And it's not just because of the supply chain. But it's the Biden team that we know doesn't care. Because in the end, they hope to train a new generation to believe that this is an acceptable way of organizing society. But we know it's not.

And hospitals, hospitals that implement these racist hiring programs will end up delivering care that is subpar. Let's put it this way. Do you want to take your sick child to a doctor who landed her position through a DEI program? Or do you want to take your sick child to the best doctor you can find regardless of DEI status? The midterms are right around the corner. And at a time when our country is in such dire shape, we need the best available people in all critical jobs. It's time to reject candidates who believe in governance through woke discrimination. The same people who stoke animosity and acrimony among Americans. It's time to defeat the DEI industrial complex and all the bias bullies. And that's 'The Angle'. Now joining me now is Laura Morgan.

I don't think any of us would have these stressful situations. What you're trying to do is help these people what I see in polling Laura is that people of color are embracing the police because they have chaos and violence in their in their communities. And this idea that that continues that somehow cops are a malign influence in society, and feeding racism is wrong. And one question on this marijuana thing, what I disagree at is Joe Biden pardoned these people, he didn't commit their sentences. He didn't take people who are in prison and take them out of prison because they're not violent felons. He you know, these people weren't in prison. It's almost like it was OK with what they did.

On Monday, the New York Times reported the company had been the target of so called election deniers reported quote, using threadbare evidence or none at all. The group suggested that a small American election software company Konnech had secret ties to the Chinese Communist Party and had given the Chinese government backdoor access to personal data of about 2 million poll workers in the United States. The company denied the exact accusations. The New York Times reported, the company claimed all the data for its American customers were stored on secure servers in the United States, and that it had no ties to the Chinese government. However, just one day later, the CEO of the company Eugene Yu, as you see here, was arrested by LA County officials in connection with the possible theft of personal information about the poll workers. New York Times has updated its story since then, saying the arrest was quote, prosecutors in Los Angeles who brought the charges against Mr. Yu said that they had found some company data stored on servers in China.

Any agent you cite as a source in your article apparently has committed such a felony. Joining me now is Harmeet Dhillon, Chairwoman of the Republican National Lawyers Association.

You know, there are ties, indisputable ties really to China, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania, the former wife of the mayor, former mayor of Moscow transferred $3.5 million to Hunter Biden that appears to be some form of money laundering. And so for all of those allegations, drug abuse, we have video from the, from the laptop, you're talking about a couple of small charges. And so this is all to lead attention away from Joe Biden, who has Tony Bobulinski has been saying for the last couple of years, and he would know as a former business partner is intimately involved in these influence peddling and money laundering and other activities that are criminal in nature by the Biden family.

He was then a law partner at the D.C. firm Morrison and Foerster, and an alum of the Nixon administration and Dartmouth. It was two days before his daughter's wedding, but he flew up to Hanover, New Hampshire, to help our student newspaper, \"The Dartmouth Review,\" in a free speech battle royale with the college. Long story short, because of Judge Silberman's staunch support and legal acumen, they backed down. He went on to become one of the most consequential jurists in the past 50 years in this country. He was nominated to the bench by President Reagan and served as a fierce defender of the principle of judicial restraint. And he was widely respected for his intellect and his passion for the rule of law. His opinions on the separation of powers and the Second Amendment and press freedom I think were among his most significant. And today, in a testament to how beloved he was, everyone from Clarence Thomas to Elena Kagan were at his memorial service. Attorney General Merrick Garland, with whom he served on the court and then became like a family friend, spoke at today's service along with Vice President Cheney. Silberman was a giant and a mentor. Had never met him, I probably would not have gone to law school, I wouldn't have clerked on the Supreme Court, and I wouldn't be here tonight. The country and the federal judiciary was so blessed by his service. Godspeed, Judge -- service is a choice. And we had very few giants like him.

They push an oppression narrative at the State Department. And of course, Mayor Pete, at DH - DOT even called DEI critical and advancing the department's mission. My friend, so much is breaking down around us. And it's not just because of the supply chain. But it's the Biden team that we know doesn't care.

And hospitals, hospitals that implement these racist hiring programs will end up delivering care that is subpar. Let's put it this way. Do you want to take your sick child to a doctor who landed her position through a DEI program? Or do you want to take your sick child to the best doctor you can find regardless of DEI status? The midterms are right around the corner. And at a time when our country is in such dire shape, we need the best available people in all critical jobs.

And I think it's so cynical because the question of the impact of drugs on our kids in our societies is immense. I mean, I've spent a fair amount of time in Colorado, and they were kind of at the beginning of this 10 years ago. And now Colorado leads statistics and all kinds of violent crimes and overdoses. This isn't just about marijuana. It's about a whole embrace of a drug culture. And if we care about people that should guide what we do, and the Democrats once again show it's not about helping people. It's about winning races."

And in fact, President Biden has been very anti-legalization. So in those ways, he's been very good in on the topic.

I don't think any of us would have these stressful situations. What you're trying to do is help these people what I see in polling Laura is that people of color are embracing the police because they have chaos and violence in their in their communities. And this idea that that continues that somehow cops are a malign influence in society, and feeding racism is wrong. And one question on this marijuana thing, what I disagree at is Joe Biden pardoned these people, he didn't commit their sentences. He didn't take people who are in prison and take them out of prison because they're not violent felons. He you know, these people weren't in prison. It's almost like it was OK with what they did.

Now here's the backstory Laura, the Konnech Company based in East Lansing, when a five year $2.9 million contract with LA County for software to track election worker schedules, training, payroll and communications. On Monday, the New York Times reported the company had been the target of so called election deniers reported quote, using threadbare evidence or none at all. The group suggested that a small American election software company Konnech had secret ties to the Chinese Communist Party and had given the Chinese government backdoor access to personal data of about 2 million poll workers in the United States. The company denied the exact accusations. The New York Times reported, the company claimed all the data for its American customers were stored on secure servers in the United States, and that it had no ties to the Chinese government. However, just one day later, the CEO of the company Eugene Yu, as you see here, was arrested by LA County officials in connection with the possible theft of personal information about the poll workers. New York Times has updated its story since then, saying the arrest was quote, prosecutors in Los Angeles who brought the charges against Mr. Yu said that they had found some company data stored on servers in China. Konnech says Mr. Yu has been the subject of quote, wrongful detention and all the data was not quote stolen, as suggested Laura."

Sources telling Fox News the decision is now in the hands of the U.S., Attorney in Delaware. It's a Trump hauled over named David Weiss. Now when I asked for a statement Hunter Biden's team didn't address the potential charges, but instead focused on the leaks. It is a federal felony for the federal agents to leak information about Grand Jury investigation, such as this one. Any agent you cite as a source in your article apparently has committed such a felony. Joining me now is Harmeet Dhillon, Chairwoman of the Republican National Lawyers Association. Harmeet, so I guess leaks from the FBI are now bad again. They've been doing it for how many years against Donald Trump and Muller investigation on down.

And if there's a talk about a plea deal with Hunter Biden, it's to actually draw the sting away from the allegations and the allegations are very serious and dating back to the Obama years, the Biden family has been engaged in serious influence peddling with foreign countries. You know, there are ties, indisputable ties really to China, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania, the former wife of the mayor, former mayor of Moscow transferred $3.5 million to Hunter Biden that appears to be some form of money laundering. And so for all of those allegations, drug abuse, we have video from the, from the laptop, you're talking about a couple of small charges. And so this is all to lead attention away from Joe Biden, who has Tony Bobulinski has been saying for the last couple of years, and he would know as a former business partner is intimately involved in these influence peddling and money laundering and other activities that are criminal in nature by the Biden family. And so I'm pretty cynical about these things, Laura at this time, so I don't think that these leaks are coming out for purposes of furthering integrity left us in law enforcement there for political reasons, Laura."

And so again, what the Biden family - - not Hunter Biden, but Hunter Biden, Jim Biden, Joe Biden -- are accused of doing incredibly is very big and is international in scope. And so I think that nothing is going to end up happening. It would be a gift to the Biden family if Hunter Biden was offered the ability to plead to a couple of minor offensives and pay some money. This needs to be pursued. It needs to be pursued by the House if Republicans take back control. And we need to see justice done in this case, because the Ukrainian money flowing in the billions right now, I think you have to look at the ties of the Biden family to corrupt activities in that part of the world, that you would be a fool to ignore those facts."

      "utterance": "At age 21, while a senior at Dartmouth College, I first met Laurence Silberman. He was then a law partner at the D.C. firm Morrison and Foerster, and an alum of the Nixon administration and Dartmouth. It was two days before his daughter's wedding, but he flew up to Hanover, New Hampshire, to help our student newspaper, \"The Dartmouth Review,\" in a free speech battle royale with the college. Long story short, because of Judge Silberman's staunch support and legal acumen, they backed down. He went on to become one of the most consequential jurists in the past 50 years in this country. He was nominated to the bench by President Reagan and served as a fierce defender of the principle of judicial restraint. And he was widely respected for his intellect and his passion for the rule of law. His opinions on the separation of powers and the Second Amendment and press freedom I think were among his most significant. And today, in a testament to how beloved he was, everyone from Clarence Thomas to Elena Kagan were at his memorial service. Attorney General Merrick Garland, with whom he served on the court and then became like a family friend, spoke at today's service along with Vice President Cheney. Silberman was a giant and a mentor. Had never met him, I probably would not have gone to law school, I wouldn't have clerked on the Supreme Court, and I wouldn't be here tonight. The country and the federal judiciary was so blessed by his service. Godspeed, Judge -- service is a choice. And we had very few giants like him."
