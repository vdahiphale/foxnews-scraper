And I think that Biden would tell them, could you just hold your fire until after those run offs because it doesn't help Democrats to have Warren and Bernie saying, yes, we want to do this, and I want to be Labor Secretary, and I'd like to take over the Treasury Department, I want to do all of these things, because that's exactly what the Republicans will use to fight against the Democrats in Georgia.",

      "utterance": "But it did work in most of the down ballot races. It worked to help the Republicans not lose a single incumbent in the House. It worked to help elect all those additional Republicans that flipped seats from Democrats. It helped the Senate actually stay the way it is. You know, at one point, it was possible that all seven of those Senate seats were going to go to the Democrats. So I think that the message absolutely worked, and it over came a fundraising deficit. The Democrats have raised so much money. They outspent Republicans across the board, not everywhere by a lot, but in some places by a lot. So the message that they're bringing to Georgia I think that's absolutely right. The Republicans have raised, I think, $32 million right now. And they have joined the forces of Loeffler and Perdue, the two Republicans candidates. And the Democrats have done the same thing. And they are basically running in lockstep with each other. And the other thing that's kind of interesting is Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Bernie Sanders are headed down there to campaign. The Republicans couldn't be happier. Like, exactly, this is perfect. Please go down there and campaign a little bit more. We'll raise even more money. But I do think that's they're taking it so seriously. I think the senators going down there shows that, on the Republicans side, this is the first cattle call for 2024. This is a way to do some good -- get some goodwill from the Republicans. Build up your name ID, and not offend Trump world while you're doing it. And I think that you'll probably see a few more of them.

So if Georgia wants to be sick for six years pronouncing those two names, be my guest. I prefer Perdue and Loeffler. Those are much better names. By the way, Juan, has Ossoff denounced white supremacy yet? Because his silence, it really makes me wonder, because that's how we're doing this now. We're going to play that game. Also, I do believe Warnock, is his name, has supported Jeremiah Wright, remember America on 9/11, the chickens came home to roost. Are those Georgia values? I don't think so. Remember when all those mobsters were tearing down the statues of the founding fathers? Warnock and Ossoff were nowhere to be seen. Again, silence is violence in my book. And you know, think about this, Saturday afternoon, 3:30, SEC championship game, maybe Alabama is in town for the Georgia Bulldogs, live on ABC, national anthem plays at the stadium, Juan. Do Warnock and Ossoff stand or do they kneel? I believe they will kneel for the national anthem if it's played at Georgia Stadium. And I don't think those are Georgia values. Also, what are the biggest industries in Georgia? We have mining. We have wood products, machinery. We have chemicals.

I want to convince people who are left, right, center, and apolitical, why the Democrats should lose these elections. Because as a libertarian, it pains me to admit that small government is dead. We're never gonna have a small government. Small government dialed years ago. So all you can really have is something called slow government, very, very slow. It's -- because speed is the opposite of wisdom, as we learned in the election. And there is nothing scarier than big, fast government. I mean, imagine Michael Moore running a three minute mile. That is fast, big government. The only way to keep big government slow is divided government. That's the only way you can do it. So even if you're a liberal, you should go, like, maybe I don't want to give the keys to all the cars to AOC because that's what's gonna happen. And if you think political polarization is bad, i.e. two parties, the only thing worse than two parties is one party. Because then you -- you don't want either your side to achieve its dreams fast enough because it never works out. You have to have something slow there. You have to have a governor, which is the device that keeps something from going too fast. And that is divided government. I was trying to figure this out. How many times -- how long does a government have an entirely uniformed government? Like, Obama maybe had it two years. It only lasts like two years, right?"

And now, we take Georgia then we change America, the Republicans -- the national Republican senatorial committee already cut that ad staring Rick Scott.

And the reason is because it shows that liberals have so little respect for what Georgians think. They have to go down to Georgia and eat bag after bag of boiled peanuts and mispronounce (Inaudible) educate Georgians on what should matter to Georgians. That is the quickest way to lose your ass in that state and any state down south, so be very careful. Stop lecturing people. They know what they want.

OK, again, if you're the confident that the results are aboveboard, then you should welcome double checking, especially when you're complicit in sowing the doubt. For example, this is -- I don't think there's ever been a more emotional, contentious election, where one side branded another side as bigots and Nazis until the Democrats and the media created this environment where no one could trust anybody, right? And they still are by doing these naming and shaming lists, this black listing of Trump employees. That also sows doubt. You're going, like, these guys will do anything. They'll do anything even fix an election. And this also wouldn't be an issue if we didn't hand the power -- I maybe too late -- hand the power over to the media. I never really thought about it until this election, and maybe that's on me, the fact that it's the media that gets to decide who wins based on projections. It has nothing to do with certification. It's just, hey, I got to be first. I got to be first. I got to call this state first. It's a myopic mindset. And in its interesting -- you're actually undermining the trust in the system, especially when the current environment is as contentious, emotional, almost dangerous that maybe go slow, and nobody went slow. And you think they would have. And I think that contributed to what we have now, which is we can't trust this. And we shouldn't trust it. Let's check under the hood. This is a used car."

All those jobs got shipped overseas because of politicians in cahoots with large corporations, so wink, wink, nudge, nudge, you give us money, you can those jobs overseas and boost your earnings.

You stop and think about it. You know, he's gonna be less of an intimidating, bullying presence because he won't have the bully pulpit of the White House and the presidency at his disposal. And I think the party's got to find its way in terms of dealing with the virus, with the economy. And you know, just stop for a second. You were talking about this. But Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Liz Cheney even, they're all making plans for 2024 right now. So you know, and you look at Senator McConnell in the Senate. He's no populist. He's never been one. But he had to deal with the power of President Trump. He will not have to do that once Trump is not in the White House.

He's going to, you know -- if I were him I would go down to Mar-a-Lago and golf and hang out with Melania. But if he wants to run again in 2024, that could be the greatest comeback story ever. And he has got, like you said, 70 million Americans. It's an army. And they feel like he could avenge what they perceive as a rigged loss. I think the rationale in four years would be economic. If the Biden policies smother the Trump recovery, and hammer wages and job growth, Trump can just come in as an ally to the working people and really -- and in really help himself out there. Also, Biden probably get us into some dumb war, that he has a history of doing that. So, the President could also come in and make that argument. But is the country psychologically and four years going to be ready for the -- for the Trump show again? Biden could just bore us all to death, where you even get the media rooting for a Trump reentry into the ring.

And then act three, the triumphant return of Donald Trump. And I'm going to I predicted this. I think it was (INAUDIBLE) and this is, of course, assuming that the recounts don't work, and the legal stuff doesn't work. And I think the voters, the Trump voters, the people behind them, the 70 million, they won either way. They may feel like they haven't won right now, but you have to understand, you don't really love somebody until they go away. And then when they come back, you love him even more. And I think that's what's going to happen here. Think about this. Think about the comparison of Obama. Obama went away. He wasn't the titular head. He basically left the party, just disappeared. Trump isn't going to do that. And they need him. He defined -- he redefined the party because he spoke for people that both the Democrats and the Republicans forgot about.

It's like test -- it's like testing for arthritis. Like, you may never know you have arthritis until they test it. And they go, you have a little bit of arthritis. Like, I felt I had little. They did an X-ray. You have a little bit of arthritis. And I go, I'd never do that. It's something that is just prevalent to your point. And it's a grim point that I was thinking about last night. I don't think I've experienced more death in my life than in 2020 in terms of relatives, and friends, acquaintances in this year, and none of them were from COVID. You know, there was a cancer, there was -- there was pneumonia, there was an overdose. And I'm wondering, everybody -- if everybody sat down and went through their mental Rolodex of people who passed away this year, you will then be able to catalog this -- the butterfly effect of death, right? You change this one thing, shut down everything, and then what happens to everything else? That butterfly effect. People are home alone; they end up drinking a lot. They can't go to their meetings; they can't go to any meetings. There are people that are dying from car accidents. And you think that wouldn't be the case.

And I think that what you see is Joe Biden wants to work with the governors, the mayors, the scientists to try to find a way where you don't have to do a lockdown. But why would you say you don't do a lockdown if that would save us from getting sick, and people die? You got to be honest with people. I think that's the first step."

Is the advisor that told LBJ to send half a million troops to Vietnam, is he still around? Maybe Biden could pick him up? Or how about the guy that did the Web site for ObamaCare? Let's put him in charge of something big. I'm getting the feeling that Biden is surrounding himself by a bunch of idiots, and this is going to be presidency by committee. And if you walk into the White House with a lab coat on and tell Biden to do something, he'll say, OK, scientists, and he'll do it. This is not good. You're going to have more czars than you've ever seen. I mean, Biden doesn't even tweet himself. The guy from MSNBC wrote his speech for Saturday night, then went he went on MSNBC and praised it and didn't say he was the one that wrote the speech. Look at the transition team. It's all Silicon Valley. Check their names out. That's who's running the show right now. Biden doesn't know what he's doing."

Now, Biden comes in and you have a good chunk of that party telling him you're going to do this, and you better do this, and you better do this, or else. It's the exact opposite.

And what you see now is that you see the moderates in the Democratic Party finally finding their voice and pushing back against the squad and saying, oh, yes, you try to -- OK, fine, knock yourselves out. You try to win in my district. You couldn't possibly win in my district, so please don't bring your ideas that I just need to do more Facebook ads in order to win. So, I think that where they are is in the middle of -- they're in flux. And even Joe Biden said, I'm a transitional candidate. So, that will continue. And I think for Bernie and Warren, let's give them this. They closed ranks, they supported Joe Biden, they were pretty quiet and supportive. And now, you have these two Georgia runoffs. And I think that Biden would tell them, could you just hold your fire until after those run offs because it doesn't help Democrats to have Warren and Bernie saying, yes, we want to do this, and I want to be Labor Secretary, and I'd like to take over the Treasury Department, I want to do all of these things, because that's exactly what the Republicans will use to fight against the Democrats in Georgia."

So, could you guys just sit back because no one actually believes Bernie and Liz, that you have the right idea. So, just kind of shut up for a while until we take control of the government. This civil war is, will in fact, if the wrong side loses identity intersectional politics, you will see Trump regain in 2024. That's my theory is that -- because that's how we won in 2016.

And it turned people to look at the actual Green New Deal. Oh, you're going to get rid of gasoline-powered automobiles in 15 years. So, that is a huge problem.
