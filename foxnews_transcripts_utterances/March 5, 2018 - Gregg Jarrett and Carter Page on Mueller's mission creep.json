And tonight, we're going to spare you all the painful details from the focal hour holier-than-thou parade of Hollywood elitism and who wore what designer, and where did their jewelry come from, and how high their high heels are, and who did their makeup. We'll spare you all that important information. Instead, we're going to focus on some of the most egregious examples of hypocrisy from last night's show.

Let's not forget that while the entertainment industry, all these overpaid actors and actresses are pushing increased government restrictions on your right to bear arms and they are protected by heavily armed personnel -- in a lot of cases, 24/7. This includes last night's Academy Awards, which was safeguarded by over 500 LAPD officers, the LAPD bomb squad, and other federal officials. So, while Hollywood rejects an increase of armed security presence at our schools, well, they are the ones who enjoy the protection of hundreds of professional trained members of law enforcement that have guns and carry them and had them last night. And while Hollywood makes fun of Americans the ones that want to protect themselves and arm their families, and protect them as well, they are the ones that utilize the services of armed security. Don't our kids in school -- don't they deserve about 1/100th of the security that we have at the Oscars? Half these stars probably wouldn't even show up if there was no protection. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If Hollywood is wondering why the ratings for their biggest award show is in a free fall, perhaps they might want to do a little soul-searching and self-reflection, introspection, Americans don't want to be lectured from hypocrites about women's rights, from a group of people who actively supported monsters like Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski. And Americans don't want to hear about responsible gun ownership from a group of people who have never been responsible for their own personal security. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Americans, sure as hell, they don't want to hear about global warming from a group of people who jet-set around the world on their private jets and want us to stop driving SUVs and Dodge Caravans for our kids.

Also new this hour, this is a massive development, all roads in the Russia investigation leading directly back to one person, Hillary Clinton. John Solomon, who will join us tonight, is reporting that the Australian diplomat who helped trigger the start of the Russia investigation has deep connections to Bill and Hillary Clinton. And according to 'The New York Times,' well, Downer is the person, former Trump campaign associate, that George Papadopoulos got drunk without that London nightclub and then started talking about Russia having dirt on Hillary Clinton. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And two months later, Downer then told Australian officials about the conversation who then told American intelligence -- four-way hearsay as my friend Gregg Jarrett says. And Solomon is reporting tonight that Alexander Downer, well, he helped secure $25 million for funding for the Clinton Foundation starting back in 2006. Bipartisan lawmakers are telling Solomon tonight that Downer's ties to the Clintons were never previously disclosed to Congress. Shocking. And Solomon is also reporting that Downer met with Bill Clinton in '06 and with Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state in '09. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We did reach out to Hillary Clinton for comment. Shocking, she never got back to us. Her spokesperson did reply to Solomon and said that Hillary was unaware of possible contacts between her campaign and Downer. In a statement that they gave to 'The Hill,' Australian's foreign ministry declined to answer questions about whether Downer had any contact with Clinton associates around the same time we helped start the Russia investigation. This is a big report tonight. It also takes a lot, by the way, if you start connecting the dots and you could begin to see Clinton has her hands in everything here. All the evidence that was used to start and further the Russia investigation, all came from cronies and associates, whether people that were being paid by the Clintons, or knew the Clintons. On top of Alexander Downer, we have Clinton paying over $10 million to fund this dossier that we now know is full of Russian and Russian government lies. The FBI then takes the unverified dossier, going against their own protocols, they lied to a FISA judge about who paid for it, they hide that important fact, to get the warrant to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who is sitting right next to me now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And there's also a former State Department official, Jonathan Weiner, who admitted in a 'Washington Post' op-ed to meeting with Christopher Steele, and said that he was being fed even more anti-Trump information by longtime Clinton allies, like Sid Vicious Blumenthal and Cody Shearer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as we learn more and more information about this massive developing scandal, one thing is clear: Hillary Clinton is at the center of everything. And also breaking now, two stories about special counsel Mueller's investigative crept. 'Axios' is now reporting that a special counsel, Robert Mueller, he's now beginning to subpoena all communications as it relates to an unidentified witness and what meetings they might have had or contracts with key Trump associates going back all the way to November, 2015. These communications include emails, text messages, and even handwritten notes. And there are several other reports that Mueller is also now investigating the UAE trying to influence the Trump White House. So, Robert Mueller needs to explain what the heck any of this has to do with Trump-Russia collusion. Trump-UAE collusion, is at the next step? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is beyond Mueller's mandate because the entire investigation was supposed to be about Trump-Russia collusion. But since that evidence doesn't exist, well, Mueller is now conducting his witch hunt and he's shaking people down, hoping that he'll be able to charge them with something, anything, even if it has nothing to do with Russia. And since Mueller is so interested in me subpoenas and getting information out of people, well, we decided to put together a few questions we'd like answered on behalf of the American people. You. Let's start with Mueller himself. He should turn over all emails, text messages, handwritten notes from when he was the FBI director about why he didn't listen to an FBI informant, the guy that discovered Vladimir Putin had a group of people in this country, an organization, all trying to get a foothold in America's uranium market. And if Mueller wants to conduct a real investigation, I think he should subpoena all communications from the key players involved. In a scandal, by the way, where we had real collusion. Take a look at the side of your screen. All of those people there are people that Mueller needs to be issuing subpoenas too. You have officials from the FBI like Comey and Andrew McCabe, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, you got the love birds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. You got former Obama intelligence officials, key Clinton allies, and even members of Mueller's own team like Andrew Weissmann and Jeannie Ray. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All of these people either have ties to the real Russia scandal or are unmanageably corrupt. So, it's time that we start getting some answers. In addition to all this new information. Well, we now know another massive bombshell that's breaking tonight, hidden in an article from 'The New Yorker' about former British by Christopher Steele, it's a major revelation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, in the dossier, Steele's Russian sources told him that the hack of the DNC, the emails, the servers, quote, involved agents within the Democratic Party structure itself -- oh, not Russia -- as well as Russian cyber operators based in the U.S. and state-sponsored Russian cyber actors. This information is key because according to new reports, the special counsel Mueller is likely going to indict Russians for hacking Democratic emails. A few key points, though. Mueller can indict all the Russians he wants but they are never going to be extradited to face any charges here. So what is it Mueller really doing, nothing short of a cheap political statement on his part to advance his narrative. Of course, he has all the people that donated to Clinton, Obama, and the DNC on his team. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is one way he'll never get to take any of these Russians or talk to them. If these reports are true, and if Mueller wants to go down the road of hacking and if he actually cares about truth, they may be Mueller should talk to the one person on earth that would know, and that would be WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Assange is the one person in the world that would know where the emails came from before he put it up on WikiLeaks. Unlike Mueller, I actually took the time, I went to the Ecuadorian embassy in London. I talked to Julian Assange. He's the one I posted the emails, and Assange flat out denied that the emails ever came from Russia or any state. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's what Assange told me. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

All four pillars of the initial investigation of the Russia collusion, alleged Russia collusion that hasn't been proven, all start with someone close to the Clintons, and I think that's the picture that now concerns Congress.",

Now, we do know that the inspector general, Horowitz, we expect a report that they had been working on a pretty long time to be coming out perhaps maybe even this week, next week, or at least very shortly. But the inspector general has no prosecutorial l powers. We know certain facts here. Well know that in the FISA warrant there was never. They knew that in fat Hillary bought and paid for it. They didn't tell the original application the Judge that in fact that was the case. There is a special footnote may have political orientation, that tells nothing to the judge. They purposely withheld that information and every subsequent renewal of that application, three times, again they don't tell the judge and everybody knew the basis for it was the dossier or to quote the former FBI Director McCabe no dossier no FISA warrant application even.",

Why? Because when the inspector general just doesn't have resources to conduct such a massive investigation. This is what you is going to be need. You can't have the Fox guarding the hen house. You can't have the DOJ investigating itself. This is the two main arguments. Not the DOJ would say no look, he needs to be able to do his job and his job is to investigate the FBI and investigate those people in the DOJ that they believe broke the law.

Hollywood's glaring hypocrisy on guns, sexual assault, and much more on full display at the Oscars. Now, it's why this year's award show, guess what, it was the least watched ever. Now, tonight, we're going to be calling out these Hollywood leftist hypocrites. And also brand-new, a major development, all roads in the Russia investigation lead directly back to Hillary Clinton and we've got that math. John Solomon reporting that the Australian diplomat who helped start the Russia investigation has deep ties to the Clintons and according to Solomon, this diplomat actually helped secure $25 million in funding for the Clinton Foundation. And, breaking right now, 'Axios' reporting the special counsel Robert Mueller is subpoenaing communications involving key Trump associates. Now, tonight, we have our own list of corrupt officials and individuals you are going to want to take notes. And, Robert Mueller, you should be focusing in on this list. We'll explain. And, tonight, breaking news report from 'The New Yorker' casting doubt on if Russia was actually behind the DNC server hack. And this comes as Mueller is planning to indict Russians for stealing Democratic emails. All of that plus the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is getting answers some Obama officials about the Clinton bought and paid for dossier.

And tonight, we're going to spare you all the painful details from the focal hour holier-than-thou parade of Hollywood elitism and who wore what designer, and where did their jewelry come from, and how high their high heels are, and who did their makeup. We'll spare you all that important information. Instead, we're going to focus on some of the most egregious examples of hypocrisy from last night's show.

In 2009, after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and connection to his rape case, over 100 celebrities signed a petition demanding his release. So, don't be fooled by all the empowering rhetoric that you saw at the Oscars. Hollywood's hypocritical feminist movement is about as laughable and is flawed as Emma Watson's grammatically incorrect Time's Up tattoo, and predictably, by the way, the next blatant double standard from last night's show involves the topic of gun control and, of course, cheap shots at the NRA.

      "utterance": "All right. Let's not forget that while the entertainment industry, all these overpaid actors and actresses are pushing increased government restrictions on your right to bear arms and they are protected by heavily armed personnel -- in a lot of cases, 24/7. This includes last night's Academy Awards, which was safeguarded by over 500 LAPD officers, the LAPD bomb squad, and other federal officials. So, while Hollywood rejects an increase of armed security presence at our schools, well, they are the ones who enjoy the protection of hundreds of professional trained members of law enforcement that have guns and carry them and had them last night. And while Hollywood makes fun of Americans the ones that want to protect themselves and arm their families, and protect them as well, they are the ones that utilize the services of armed security. Don't our kids in school -- don't they deserve about 1/100th of the security that we have at the Oscars? Half these stars probably wouldn't even show up if there was no protection. If Hollywood is wondering why the ratings for their biggest award show is in a free fall, perhaps they might want to do a little soul-searching and self-reflection, introspection, Americans don't want to be lectured from hypocrites about women's rights, from a group of people who actively supported monsters like Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski. And Americans don't want to hear about responsible gun ownership from a group of people who have never been responsible for their own personal security. And Americans, sure as hell, they don't want to hear about global warming from a group of people who jet-set around the world on their private jets and want us to stop driving SUVs and Dodge Caravans for our kids. Maybe at next year's show, the leftist and Hollywood should just leave the politics at the door. All right. Also new this hour, this is a massive development, all roads in the Russia investigation leading directly back to one person, Hillary Clinton. John Solomon, who will join us tonight, is reporting that the Australian diplomat who helped trigger the start of the Russia investigation has deep connections to Bill and Hillary Clinton. And according to 'The New York Times,' well, Downer is the person, former Trump campaign associate, that George Papadopoulos got drunk without that London nightclub and then started talking about Russia having dirt on Hillary Clinton. And two months later, Downer then told Australian officials about the conversation who then told American intelligence -- four-way hearsay as my friend Gregg Jarrett says. And Solomon is reporting tonight that Alexander Downer, well, he helped secure $25 million for funding for the Clinton Foundation starting back in 2006. Bipartisan lawmakers are telling Solomon tonight that Downer's ties to the Clintons were never previously disclosed to Congress. Shocking. And Solomon is also reporting that Downer met with Bill Clinton in '06 and with Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state in '09. We did reach out to Hillary Clinton for comment. Shocking, she never got back to us. Her spokesperson did reply to Solomon and said that Hillary was unaware of possible contacts between her campaign and Downer. In a statement that they gave to 'The Hill,' Australian's foreign ministry declined to answer questions about whether Downer had any contact with Clinton associates around the same time we helped start the Russia investigation. This is a big report tonight. It also takes a lot, by the way, if you start connecting the dots and you could begin to see Clinton has her hands in everything here. All the evidence that was used to start and further the Russia investigation, all came from cronies and associates, whether people that were being paid by the Clintons, or knew the Clintons. On top of Alexander Downer, we have Clinton paying over $10 million to fund this dossier that we now know is full of Russian and Russian government lies. The FBI then takes the unverified dossier, going against their own protocols, they lied to a FISA judge about who paid for it, they hide that important fact, to get the warrant to spy on Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who is sitting right next to me now. And there's also a former State Department official, Jonathan Weiner, who admitted in a 'Washington Post' op-ed to meeting with Christopher Steele, and said that he was being fed even more anti-Trump information by longtime Clinton allies, like Sid Vicious Blumenthal and Cody Shearer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And as we learn more and more information about this massive developing scandal, one thing is clear",
      "utterance": "Hillary Clinton is at the center of everything. And also breaking now, two stories about special counsel Mueller's investigative crept. 'Axios' is now reporting that a special counsel, Robert Mueller, he's now beginning to subpoena all communications as it relates to an unidentified witness and what meetings they might have had or contracts with key Trump associates going back all the way to November, 2015. These communications include emails, text messages, and even handwritten notes. And there are several other reports that Mueller is also now investigating the UAE trying to influence the Trump White House. So, Robert Mueller needs to explain what the heck any of this has to do with Trump-Russia collusion. Trump-UAE collusion, is at the next step? This is beyond Mueller's mandate because the entire investigation was supposed to be about Trump-Russia collusion. But since that evidence doesn't exist, well, Mueller is now conducting his witch hunt and he's shaking people down, hoping that he'll be able to charge them with something, anything, even if it has nothing to do with Russia. And since Mueller is so interested in me subpoenas and getting information out of people, well, we decided to put together a few questions we'd like answered on behalf of the American people. You. Let's start with Mueller himself. He should turn over all emails, text messages, handwritten notes from when he was the FBI director about why he didn't listen to an FBI informant, the guy that discovered Vladimir Putin had a group of people in this country, an organization, all trying to get a foothold in America's uranium market. And if Mueller wants to conduct a real investigation, I think he should subpoena all communications from the key players involved. In a scandal, by the way, where we had real collusion. Take a look at the side of your screen. All of those people there are people that Mueller needs to be issuing subpoenas too. You have officials from the FBI like Comey and Andrew McCabe, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, you got the love birds Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. You got former Obama intelligence officials, key Clinton allies, and even members of Mueller's own team like Andrew Weissmann and Jeannie Ray. All of these people either have ties to the real Russia scandal or are unmanageably corrupt. So, it's time that we start getting some answers. In addition to all this new information. Well, we now know another massive bombshell that's breaking tonight, hidden in an article from 'The New Yorker' about former British by Christopher Steele, it's a major revelation. Well, in the dossier, Steele's Russian sources told him that the hack of the DNC, the emails, the servers, quote, involved agents within the Democratic Party structure itself -- oh, not Russia -- as well as Russian cyber operators based in the U.S. and state-sponsored Russian cyber actors. This information is key because according to new reports, the special counsel Mueller is likely going to indict Russians for hacking Democratic emails. A few key points, though. Mueller can indict all the Russians he wants but they are never going to be extradited to face any charges here. So what is it Mueller really doing, nothing short of a cheap political statement on his part to advance his narrative. Of course, he has all the people that donated to Clinton, Obama, and the DNC on his team. There is one way he'll never get to take any of these Russians or talk to them. If these reports are true, and if Mueller wants to go down the road of hacking and if he actually cares about truth, they may be Mueller should talk to the one person on earth that would know, and that would be WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Assange is the one person in the world that would know where the emails came from before he put it up on WikiLeaks. Unlike Mueller, I actually took the time, I went to the Ecuadorian embassy in London. I talked to Julian Assange. He's the one I posted the emails, and Assange flat out denied that the emails ever came from Russia or any state. Here's what Assange told me."

And I don't care if you like Assange or don't like Assange, I don't care if you like WikiLeaks or don't like WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has never been proven wrong in 11 years. He is a much better track record, by the way, then anyone in the destroyed Trump media, like 'The Washington Post' and 'The New York Times' and ABC, NBC, CBS, fake news CNN or the conspiracy network MSNBC. And since Assange published the emails, wouldn't he know exactly where they came from? And wouldn't he probably have some type of forensic proof about where it came from? Here is another part to this DNC hacking story. The FBI never was actually able to look at the DNC servers. This is an important point. They had to rely on a private company called CrowdStrike that was hired by the DNC because the DNC would never let the FBI look at the servers. Take a look at what the former FBI Director James Comey told Congress back in January of last year."

And finally tonight, breaking news from the House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes and his effort to get answers from key Obama administration officials about the phony dossier. Here is what Nunes said earlier tonight on with Martha MacCallum. Take a look. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Thankfully, we had received most of the people have responded, getting the information back promptly and on time. There are a few people who have asked for an additional week, which we have granted that time. There are a few people, though, that are not responding. They seem to have went dark. However, if they do not respond shortly here, they will be getting subpoenaed to appear before Congress to be treated with a deposition."

As we continue, major breaking news tonight from 'The Hill's' John Solomon, reporting tonight, quote: Australian diplomat who is tip prompted FBI's Russia probe has ties to the Clintons.' For that and more, we have from 'The Hill', John Solomon, and investigative reporter, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. John, let's start with this. So, you have the foreign minister, Downer, Australian foreign minister, and why don't I just let you set that up. And again, the FBI is implicated here for not doing their job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, you have the guy who gave us the start of the Russia investigation by the FBI's own account, Ambassador Downer's information that he had overheard a conversation about George Papadopoulos in the London bar, that he reported two months later, that became the genesis of this whole investigation. One of the things we didn't know the last few years we've been following this, he was a $25 million donor to the Clinton Foundation. He arranged foreign aid in the amount of $25 million from Australian taxpayers to do a very noble project, a project to help AIDS patients around Asia, but it's yet another connection of a friendly Clinton source who's at the front end of this investigation, and we are learning about it so late in the process. It frustrates Congress. We talked to Jim Jordan today and the first thing he said is, why do we keep finding out the stuff after the fact? Why can't the FBI tell the stuff up front? And I think it's a question a lot of people in Congress are going to be asking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, his prior connection to the Clinton Foundation, it was never disclosed. So, again, everything always goes back to the Clintons, and who they know, and Sidney Blumenthal, everything that is providing all of this, feeding this information, including Clinton -- Hillary paying for the dossier. They're all Clinton cronies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "The public information we have, there's only four sources of information that the FBI used to predicate or start its investigation. Ambassador Downer, we know he has a friendly relationship with the Clintons. Christopher Steele, we know he was paid by the Clintons. Christopher Steele talked to Mike Isikoff, the reporter, and Isikoff's story was then used. And the last one is Sidney Blumenthal and his friend Cody Shearer routing information to the State Department to get to Steele to get the FBI. All four pillars of the initial investigation of the Russia collusion, alleged Russia collusion that hasn't been proven, all start with someone close to the Clintons, and I think that's the picture that now concerns Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Sara, you have an interesting piece out, the case for or against a special prosecutor to investigate the investigators. Now, we do know that the inspector general, Horowitz, we expect a report that they had been working on a pretty long time to be coming out perhaps maybe even this week, next week, or at least very shortly. But the inspector general has no prosecutorial l powers. We know certain facts here. Well know that in the FISA warrant there was never. They knew that in fat Hillary bought and paid for it. They didn't tell the original application the Judge that in fact that was the case. There is a special footnote may have political orientation, that tells nothing to the judge. They purposely withheld that information and every subsequent renewal of that application, three times, again they don't tell the judge and everybody knew the basis for it was the dossier or to quote the former FBI Director McCabe no dossier no FISA warrant application even."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Correct. The inspector general, the Department of Justice has been advocating the inspector general and they put him in charge, Michael Horowitz of this investigation into FISA abuse. Everyone, there's a growing chorus now within the Republican -- within Republican lawmakers that are saying we really need to step outside of the DOJ and the FBI and call a special counsel to investigate this. Why? Because when the inspector general just doesn't have resources to conduct such a massive investigation. This is what you is going to be need. You can't have the Fox guarding the hen house. You can't have the DOJ investigating itself. This is the two main arguments. Not the DOJ would say no look, he needs to be able to do his job and his job is to investigate the FBI and investigate those people in the DOJ that they believe broke the law. You brought up a good point Sean. He can refer for prosecution but he can't prosecute himself. He can put the report together and refer for prosecution."

First, we're learning more damming immigration about the illegal immigrants that the mayor of Oakland California is trying to protect from following the law and federal immigration authorities. According to the L.A. Times, siding ICE of the 232 people that were arrested in the latest illegal immigration crackdown in California, 180 were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal or who had previously had been removed from the United States. Quote, 115 had prior felony convictions to serious offenses like child sex crime, weapons charges, assault or had pas convictions with significant or multiple misdemeanors. Here now with more, national security strategist Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera. You know, if you're going to -- the law of the land is the law of the land. You want to change the law, change the law. But when you are aiding and abetting, especially the people who you're looking for, criminal aliens that have committed crimes in these country, you're putting ICE members at work, Border Patrol people's lives in jeopardy and lives of people in the communities which they live in jeopardy, because most of them are known criminals.

I was upstairs with Ivanka. We are talking about --"

They ever says a rude word and most importantly, no penis at all. He is literally a statue of limitations. That is the kind of men we need more of it in this town. Here is how clueless Hollywood is about women. We made a movie called what women want and it starred Mel Gibson. That is all you need to know."

Tomi Lahren. I'm watching all this for a little bit until homeland came on at 9:00 eastern on Sunday night which I never missed. I'm sitting there thinking, nobody can tolerate this. I knew from the opening forum that it would be a disaster ratings wise. The lowest ever."

All of the individuals in this room they do that day in and day out, they pretend to be social justice warriors and humanitarians and they're really just overpaid hypocrites. They're not funny. I think that is the biggest crime here is that they are not funny and they try so hard to be funny and still not funny."

How did that guy get the biggest applause ever and how do we supposed to believe more on their saying when they applauded that guy? Because I had no faith in any of them. I think they're all phonies."

It should be #weallnew and it should be #weallknewandsaidnothinguntilitwastrendytospeakout. I think that is the biggest problem here is even tough there are interviewing people on the red carpet and those that are in that room, those friends with people like Weinstein, they all knew and had a pretty good idea and said nothing. They allowed it to continue and now they dress in a certain color, they wear a pin and make jokes about it. And somehow they think they're doing the country good and women good, and they think they're starting a movement. All hypocrites."

Before we go, remember the faith based film I produced last year that became a big hit. \"Let there be light,\" it is now available on demand on DVD and you can get it at Wal- Mart, Amazon.com and everywhere it is on Hannity.com. All right we will always be fair and balance, never the destroy Trump media. Thank you for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled -- hello."
