Even with America's death toll from the Coronavirus passing 100,000, the death of one man, George Floyd, killed in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, has become the dominant media story. Journalists -- excuse me, sparking riots in that city and across the country. Journalists wounded by rubber bullets in some instances, many police officers injured as well, President Trump urging a tougher stance toward the violence. And yet, the killing of Floyd, the officer charged with third degree murder and manslaughter in that case, transcending the usual divisions of the media, white and black, left and right. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

BUCK SEXTON, HOST OF \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW,\" FORMER CIA ANALYST: Yeah, and people have been pointing out, Howie, that there's been very little fact- checking of, say, the Iranian supreme leader going on in Twitter. I mean, if you're going to get into this game, you're obviously going to then run afoul of people who are looking at this as singling out, as targeting individuals for political purposes. So they also in this case picked a tweet that was about what could happen in the future. It is an opinion to say that he thinks the election would have a lot of fraud in this. So this just tells conservatives what we've known for years, there is a double standard, they do push against us in ways they don't against the other political side, and this is the president finally taking action on it.",

Even with America's death toll from the Coronavirus passing 100,000, the death of one man, George Floyd, killed in the custody of Minneapolis police officers, has become the dominant media story. Journalists -- excuse me, sparking riots in that city and across the country. Journalists wounded by rubber bullets in some instances, many police officers injured as well, President Trump urging a tougher stance toward the violence. And yet, the killing of Floyd, the officer charged with third degree murder and manslaughter in that case, transcending the usual divisions of the media, white and black, left and right."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",

      "utterance": "It was a smartphone video taken by a 17-year-old girl that showed the officer's knee on Floyd's neck, even as he pleaded he couldn't breathe. That convinced most of the media and public that this death was an outrage. And a second video obtained by NBC made even more clear that an unarmed man was being fatally mistreated. Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at the Federalist and a Fox News contributor, Gillian Turner, a Fox News correspondent here in Washington, and Richard Fowler, radio talk show host and also a Fox News contributor. Mollie, we'll get to the protesters in just a moment. But in so many cases, you have this partisan media divide where conservatives are backing the police. And liberals are backing the black person who was either killed or wounded. In the death of George Floyd, it seems to me you have all sides united over this Minneapolis tragedy."
    },

      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it did seem left, right, whatever your political persuasion, black, white. Everyone saw that video and they were horrified by what they saw. And that is an important thing to note. And divisions have developed in this story over how people have responded to it, but it seems there is a great deal of unity on that point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Richard, how has this story affected you personally? And given the history here, all these cases such as the police chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York half a dozen years ago, or even the other day, the white woman in Central Park calling police to frame a black man who asked her to leash her dog. Do you think the media are conveying that this is a deeply rooted problem?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think there are -- the reporting shows that they are conveying this is a deeply rooted problem. There is nowhere, Howard, for a black man to be safe. You can't be safe in your own home. You can't be safe in your grandmother's backyard. You can't be safe watching birds. You can't be safe selling loose cigarettes on the streets of Staten Island. And that is where this anger comes from tonight. And for the past five nights, is that people of color are saying where is our justice? Where is our liberty? Where is our freedom? And right now, that's what's in question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Gillian, in this case, as many others in recent years, it was smartphone video that show, for example, that the police account that George Floyd was resisting arrest was a lie. Without that video, of course, it's become so common with people all carrying cameras. Do you think this would even have become a national story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Who knows the answer to that? But thank God that that woman and those bystanders on the corner of that Minneapolis sidewalk had their cellphones and had the wherewithal during that moment of crisis to whip them out, get the footage that America need to see. I think what hits home for the American people and for journalists covering this is that though we're very lucky to have that coverage in this instance. Though we were very fortunate a few weeks ago to have that cellphone footage, again, of the moment that Ahmaud Arbery was shot in broad daylight as well. These are just the horrors that we now have on camera. Think about the thousands, the tens of thousands of murders that we don't have. It makes it -- it sort of compounds the heartbreak. A quick note on media unity here, I think it is important that the sides are united in the fact that, you know, the murder of George Floyd is a terrible thing, but it's hardly anything to commend. I mean, it's a pretty low bar when the media can widely agree that the murder of an American on an American street on Memorial Day is an egregious thing that upsets all of us. It's not really saying a lot that we can rally around that reality."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's a good bit of perspective. President Trump tweeted -- let me just jump in to Mollie and I'll come back to you, Richard. President Trump tweeted after the riots began. Let me put up on the screen. These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. I won't let that happen. He spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him the military's with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Now, Twitter hid that tweet, Mollie, from a lot of people. It's hard to -- you had to click on of something. You couldn't easily re- tweet it, saying that this was glorifying violence. Was that unfair, in your view?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, President Trump's words were ill-chosen and historically fraught. He later clarified. He said that he was just making a statement of fact about how looting can lead to unchecked violence, which is certainly true. But to me, the bigger issue is what Twitter did there. And this week, Twitter's actions against the president have really escalated a war there. They began by fact-checking his opinion about a future event, which is something you can't do by adding an editor's note that was factually incorrect itself. And then they went to straight-up censorship, not just of the president's Twitter feed, but of official government communications. And they're doing this only against Trump and his White House, not against Chinese propaganda, not against Iran when they call for the destruction of Israel and genocide of Jews. And this is -- really seems like election meddling and it's a big escalation."

And we can have this debate about whether or not there's a battle between Donald Trump and Twitter. But let's just listen to what he said. He said that peaceful protesters -- he called us thugs. And hours after that happened, a black journalist at CNN was arrested for covering this story. This is why African-Americans are broader than that. A multicultural coalition of folks is angry today. They're angry because the president doesn't seem to get it. That while, yes, we know about the case of George Floyd because that was caught on tape. There aren't journalists in the car with black men who are pulled over by the police. And we begin to flinch. And sometimes, because it happened to me, we begin to see our funeral play out when we're in that interaction."

Gillian, I lived through the devastating riots of 1968, which led -- left many urban areas scarred for more than two decades. Do you think the national media are playing this, the 24/7 media on that level, or is it too soon to say, you know, whether this calms down in a few days?"
    },

      "speaker": "TURNER",

The officers who were on the scene, all four of them, lost their jobs. That was the immediate step one. Now, one of them has been charged. But he hasn't been convicted. He has to of be tried first. He hasn't been convicted. And justice is not going to be served until the sentence matches what every American who has looked at this video with their own two eyes sees, which is the murder of an American on an American street in broad daylight on Memorial Day. That's how you start healing these wounds. When people all across the United States see that the criminal justice system will work in the way it's supposed to, that it's intended to work. Quick note on the riots, every time we talk about the lawlessness of these rioters, the folks --"

There just seem to be a lack of leadership in almost every sector of our society, political, media, and otherwise when it comes to something like this, where we need people to have good ideas about how to improve things. We take instances like this and we make them very political and we make them nationally political. But if you really want to improve relationships between police forces and the communities that they're supposed to serve, you need to actually have some changes. And this type of hysterical reaction that's not focused on what's actually causing problems doesn't lead to that. The media could serve a very good function here."

What's happening on the streets is pain that has deeply rooted in the black community. In 1955, Emmett Till was lynched, right? In 1992, Rodney King was beat by police officers. Just about six years ago, Eric Garner was choked and he says I can't breathe. And here we are again, in 2020, talking about the same case and nothing has changed. And that's why people are angry. And the president seems to be missing that anger and the historical roots of it."

And it is important that -- just seems that we have seen not enough attention paid to people who are having their communities destroyed, their businesses burned, and the destruction that comes along with that in the long term, particularly given that the media were so upset when people were peacefully protesting lockdowns a few weeks ago.

I was -- I know folks that went to one, likely be going to one this afternoon, because we're calling for justice. And at the same time, yes, there are folks who are engaging in violent acts and that's wrong. But let's be very clear, right? And let's understand that if you saw what happened in St. Paul, the mayor said very clearly. All the folks that were arrested for engaging in violence, none of them lived in St. Paul, right?

Again, what matters is the focus and the coverage going forward of how justice is sought, how justice is pursued. A quick note on the rioters, which came from a source, who is a psychiatrist last night, he pointed out to me, the media needs some empathy here when they -- to take into account the fact that when things go bad, it is in human nature to make things worse.

But Omar Jimenez did exactly the right thing. His episode should be shown in every journalism class in the nation for years come, because he was trying to work with the police. That's what we do.

Leland described it as a frightening experience. And in Atlanta on Friday night, CNN headquarters was attacked by a mob, I guess I'll call it, that smashed windows and they defaced the CNN logo.

Thank goodness Leland and Christian (Inaudible) are OK and got out of there. But it is both a combination of police now showing a -- we will arrest you sign that they never did before, and the protesters attacking you. Journalists need 19 eye balls in their heads because it's coming at them from every direction. And really, I think out of all this, while I realize that journalists put themselves in these positions, as I have done. It is important that both mayors, police chiefs, and ultimately all hopefully of our leaders help to fight for the First Amendment and the protection of journalists. I was proud of our CEO, Suzanne Scott, when she put out a statement supporting Omar Jimenez, in saying that this is unacceptable and it needs to stop."

We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\" The president issued an executive order that could lessen the legal immunity of Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other tech giants for questionable content posted by their hundreds of millions of users."

      "utterance": "Joining us in New York, Buck Sexton, host of \"The Buck Sexton Show\" podcast and a former CIA analyst, and in Los Angeles, Leslie Marshall, radio talk show host and Fox News contributor. Buck, is Twitter engaging in a double standard here by singling out these presidential tweets on mail fraud, citing NBC, CBS, and the Washington Post because Twitter has never gained to have its own fact-checkers? BUCK SEXTON, HOST OF \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW,\" FORMER CIA ANALYST: Yeah, and people have been pointing out, Howie, that there's been very little fact- checking of, say, the Iranian supreme leader going on in Twitter. I mean, if you're going to get into this game, you're obviously going to then run afoul of people who are looking at this as singling out, as targeting individuals for political purposes. So they also in this case picked a tweet that was about what could happen in the future. It is an opinion to say that he thinks the election would have a lot of fraud in this. So this just tells conservatives what we've known for years, there is a double standard, they do push against us in ways they don't against the other political side, and this is the president finally taking action on it."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

Why isn't that acceptable political rhetoric?"

    {
      "speaker": "LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, if he is giving an opinion -- the problem is that Twitter has to decide who they want to be when they grow up and they haven't defined themselves. They don't have the staff clearly like you said, Howie, to have their own fact-checkers. If they're going to fact- check, it's going to be across the board. If it's just going to be a platform to opine, to present one's opinion, then they've got to back off and let that go. But I do want to jump in on what Buck said because, you know, there have been tweets, as you remember, about Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden, and Twitter refused to take it down. So it's not always that Twitter is the bad guy with conservatives. They've done it to Democrats, liberals, progressives, as well."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "A lot of liberals are not happy with Facebook or Twitter. Buck, it doesn't exactly inspire confidence that Twitter's Yoel Roth has tweeted in the past that Donald Trump and his team are actual Nazis, that he is a racist tangerine. Trump has called this guy a hater. Jack Dorsey, the CEO, said there is someone ultimately accountable for actions of the company, that's me, please leave our employees out of this."

I mean, it is a very far left institution, talking about Facebook, talking about Twitter, and that they're going to have employees who are playing speech police. It's preposterous if you believe that these should be neutral platforms. Now, we can solve the debate about whether it's a private company -- I mean, it is a private company but can they do whatever they want? Well, a lot of speech regulations out there that deal with commercial entities, media properties. I work in radio. I am a syndicated radio host. You can't just say whatever you want on the air. So, it gets in the greater complexity there. But, yeah, the left wing bias of Silicon Valley, we keep seeing it come up again and again."

Leslie, the president's executive order would weaken the legal immunity of the social media giants enjoy because they've got all this content from all of us and all kinds of people and they don't really police it very well. You talk about Twitter needing to grow up. I think even though the president may be acting at a peak, it raises an issue. Why shouldn't they just be treated like media companies that are responsible for some of the vile content and propagandas posted on their sites?"

People were saying, well, how is this going to work with the First Amendment and how is this going to work if it's not being regulated? That's what we're seeing right now. A question, how is this handled? You know, Buck brought up a point. We're both syndicated talk show hosts. On radio, you can't say certain things.

Let me jump in because I want to get back to our top story which I know you both want to talk about, the riots across America in the wake of George Floyd's killing. Buck, you're in New York where police cars were set on fire among other things. New York Times had a headline yesterday. The president fans the flame, saying that the nation is on edge, ravaged by disease, hammered by economic collapse and so forth. President Trump's first instinct is to look for someone to fight. Is it fair or unfair journalistic observation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "Completely unfair. I had the president on my radio show last week. We spoke specifically about the George Floyd case. He said it was horrible, that the Justice Department was looking into it, that he expected authorities to bring swift justice. He said exactly what I would want any commander in chief to say because there isn't a whole lot of debate or discussion about how horrible what happened in Minnesota was. That said, if you're looking for people that are fanning the flames, I saw protesters here on the streets, I walked amongst them several times because they're all over the city, they're screaming profanity at police officers, they are calling them racist murderers, it's appalling. And then on top of that, you add the destruction of property. NYPD cars were lit on fire. The media is always soft-pedalling this. Oh no, this is an expression of rage. No, this is looting, this is arson, this is violence and it needs to be stopped."

      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not. Without media, we would not have seen the death of a man through someone who fortunately was filming it on their phone. Look, the president is not being responsible. He has talked about shooting the looters. You know, we have something called due process in this country. Second of all, the majority, overwhelming majority of the protesters are not looting, are not being violent, and are not shooting, which the president again is not doing. A president, a true leader, Howie, should be trying to make calm. You have to remember, it is not just the death of this man."

These are his allies."

I think this is an instance where you see this and say he has a very personal feud with Joe Scarborough. Scarborough has been separating out the family for a moment. It's terrible they have to go through this. I'm very sorry that they have to be dragged in through this again. But Scarborough and Trump -- Scarborough was effectively saying the president was a traitor for the last few years to the country. There's just a deep hatred between these men. I think the president is trying to just goad Scarborough a bit and also see the media reaction to this while we are still in lockdown and everything else. But yeah, if you're asking did this one -- was this one that a lot of people that really support this president or hardly wish he could take back? I think the answer is yes."

My question is, are the media so inert (ph) to presidential insults? And look, his supporters love it when he watch people particularly those who are taking him on, critics in the media, that this isn't that big of a story?"

      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Perhaps for some of his supporters. But, you know, I've been a guest on some conservative talk show host programs and they said this was going too far. There are a couple of things here. When you are a leader and especially president, you're going to be attacked. You're going to be attacked by the media. You're going to be attacked by the political party that you weren't the choice of. But to personally attack an individual and it has ramifications for that family, to dredge that up, and when the family says stop, you've got to stop. And what bothers me further is somebody around him, maybe Ivanka, somebody needs to say, daddy, stop, that's gone too far. Right now, we're in a pandemic. There are riots in the street. If he and Joe Scarborough want to go in the back and duke it out or duke it out on Twitter, fine. But there is no reason to drudge this family and make them relive a very painful wound, this man and the loss of his wife."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Buck, he was sort of making that point a moment ago. My question is, you know, having thrown the punch, having talked about this conspiracy theory, remember, Scarborough was in Washington when this woman died in Florida from, you know, it was ruled to have been a heart problem that caused her to fall and hit her head, why didn't the president stop when even conservatives were saying, please, move on, the country is in a pandemic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "Well, one thing about this president is no one can tell him what to do, and I do think the he tends to double down whenever there is an outcry, oh, you can't do that. This is really in part of the point that Rush Limbaugh was making. And I will say that Rush is also illuminating that at a time when there are far more important things. That's not to say that this was all fine and this was a clean Twitter fight so-to-speak. But there are far more important things going on in the country. The outrage from the media over this, over say what is going on right now with the 40 plus million people who have lost their job. And this isn't about whataboutism. This is about focus and outrage from the media. And also, we see even with General Flynn and the revelations that the FBI effectively did entrap this man and hid evidence and all the other things that have come out. But there's so much more outrage about this. The New York Times piece on this looked like this was the greatest injustice done in this country in a very long time. They need to scale it back a little bit except their audience I suppose expects this."

It is fine for colleagues to go President Trump is once again celebrating media layoffs during this tough economic time. \"Great news: The boring but very nasty magazine, The Atlantic, is rapidly failing, going down the tubes, and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20 percent of its staff in order to limp into the future. This is a tough time to be in the fake news business.\" Now, The Atlantic, which backed impeachment, did recently run a piece headlined, \"Donald Trump, the most unmanly president.\" But editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg found a silver lining to the tweets, saying, we have never got more subscribers in a day than we did today. Finally, for a nation reeling from the devastating coronavirus and an economic shutdown, the race riots that have broken out across the country after George Floyd's killing makes it seem like we're living to an endless nightmare. As I watch journalists being arrested, shot in being, it's a reminder that this can be a dangerous profession. And for all the media's flaws, my colleagues are out on the streets trying to bring you the story of these terrible clashes. Now, we need to do a better job of capturing the black community's frustration and anger over the years, but also to hold accountable those who use tragedy to unleash violence and lawlessness. We need to minimize the political blame game involving President Trump or anyone else in politics. America is burning, and we in the media need to rise to the occasion.
