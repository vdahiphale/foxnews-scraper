      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to HANNITY on this busy Friday night. That's right, 118 days Americans trapped, abandoned by Joe Biden in the Islamic emirates of Afghanistan. And, yes, your spineless feckless cognitively weak president has forgotten the people that he promised to protect. We will not forget them on the show until they're all home safely. He might have turned the page. The mob and the media -- well, they've turned the page too. Same with big tech, we won't. Now, sadly tonight, another crisis is spiraling out of control right here. Now, breaking earlier today, shocking new economic numbers that prove that Biden and Kamala Harris and Schumer and every Democrat and Pelosi have all been lying to you. First, we start with this -- inflation is now at a 39-year high, the worst number in four decades since 1982. Look at this headline from CNBC, quote: Inflation surged 6.8 percent in November, even more than is expected, the fastest rate since 1982. Price of gas up 58 percent, but you already know that. The price of food is up dramatically, the price of everything we buy in every store we go to is up dramatically. Now, make no mistake, this is a tax and this is disproportionately negatively impacting low and middle income Americans, so people that can least afford this. Now, no doubt, they're feeling a lot of pain right now. Now, it is a tax on retired Americans living on a fixed income. It is a tax on, quote, working men and women, in other words, the people that make this country great that Joe claims to relate to so much and has so much compassion for -- a monopoly of compassion for. Now, there's no mystery why this is happening. All of this was preventable and all of it is reversible, but you'd have to go back to the Trump policies that were working. Joe and the radical climate cult Democrats in Congress have been printing money at a record pace. They've been on a $2 trillion dollar spending bill they had in March. Another trillion dollar infrastructure bill in November. Now, they started out. They wanted $3.5 trillion. Now, they're attempting to spend what will ultimately be when you use real accounting numbers up to $5.1 trillion on Biden's socialist Build Back Better bill. Look at this: now, Democrats always say that the Congressional Budget Office is a gold standard, the gold standard in terms of numbers that you get. Well, the Congressional Budget Office, they did an analysis of Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism. This one bill alone could add $3 trillion plus to the deficit. They're saying it costs $1.75 trillion, it's not. It's costing $5.1 trillion when you include by the way that something called interest. Senator Lindsey Graham rightly pointed out this would now send inflation even further through the roof. It will wreck our economy even more. Watch.",

She circled back with and said the CBO isn't very experienced at scoring these kinds of socialist spending sprees. But let's go to Joe Biden in 2010. He actually called the Congressional Budget Office that scored it at $4.9 trillion, not $1.75 trillion -- if you include interest, it's $5.1 trillion -- he called the CBO the gold standard of scoring legislation.

Well, Joe Manchin, you got the score, $3 trillion added to the deficit and debt and with inflation already spiraling out of control, it's not $1.75 trillion, it's $5.1 trillion. So, Joe, there's your off ramp, time to walk away from this socialist spending spree and stand up for the people of West Virginia that are getting killed by the climate cult, New Green Deal socialist in the House and in your party. Rising prices are deeply impacting the people of West Virginia. This is, by the way, this goes right to the core of West Virginia's economy, energy. This bill will make everything much worse.

Now, Joe Manchin has talked about the possibility of a pause here. He is very concerned about inflation. So he says maybe we should put the brakes on here for just a little bit. He might in fact get that pause. Here's the reason. They still have not completed the legislative text. They are still running this past the Senate parliamentarian trying to get all the clearances there to make sure it comports with the special Senate budget rules, and this delay may give Joe Manchin exactly what he wants. Now, there was a push by the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to move this bill through the Senate before Christmas and then it would have to go back to the House of Representatives. And Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, indicated that she thought this could also get done in the House before Christmas time. That seems a little bit dubious.

Tonight, Joe Biden's poll numbers, they are falling again dramatically. New survey, this time CNBC, showing the president taking hits on his handling of COVID, the economy, pretty much everything. A year from now, Joe will be a massive liability in the midterm elections on the national state and local level. But the city of New York has a solution and that is a new measure that will allow non-citizens -- in other words illegal immigrants -- to vote in citywide elections. So you can add that to my list of election reform. For example, we need signature verification, we need voter ID, that should be mandatory. Even Joe's state of Delaware has that. We need chain of custody controls, updated voter rolls, and yes, partisan observers need to watch up close the vote counting start to finish and now, no illegal immigrants should vote. Now, the Washington Post once called it a conspiracy theory that illegal immigrants will vote. Now, it's called the reality. Under New York City's one party Democratic rule, power in perpetuity is all that matters. That's why the city is now devolving into a nasty, high crime, hell hole. I say that from experience. And meanwhile, south of New York, in the Washington D.C. swamp, not much better. Even some Democrats are concerned about Biden's cognitive decline. Look at this poll. Majority of Americans do not believe Joe is mentally fit to serve. By the way, we were way ahead of the curve. In an interview that will air this weekend, well, First Lady Jill Biden said that concerns around Joe's mental fitness are ridiculous. But everyone on earth including our allies and enemies and hostile regimes can all see what we see every day and that is every day is now a struggle for Joe -- walking, talking, reading, remembering. Some days are a little better than others but he seems to be getting worse. But it makes you wonder who then is in charge over at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. You know, just like when he said, oh, we're not going to pay illegal immigrants. Peter Doocy, you need to stop reporting that garbage. Two days later, he's advocating it. So the question is, I don't know what's worse, advocating the dumb policy or not knowing his administration put forth the dumb policy? FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz, former Trump White House aide Kellyanne Conway join us with this. So you get these numbers in today, Kellyanne, is 39-year high for inflation. Then we get a real CBO score, the gold standard, I don't think this is working out well for the Democrats right now.",

They're the ones producing the worst polls for Joe Biden. Let's unpack the CNBC poll. Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said that they disapprove of Joe Biden's handling of the economy, 41 percent say the economy will get worse for them over the next year, and a separate CNBC survey say 62 percent Joe Biden is just bad for small business. It's not just that people see it at the gas pump, in their grocery cart, in the supply chain shortage, the everyday cost of necessities. Folks, these are not luxuries. This is what people need to eat and where, where they need to live, how they fuel their cars, home heating bills are going to go through the roof, and they blame Joe Biden. \"But Trump, but Trump\" has hit a buzzsaw. They can't do that anymore. They know we had a roaring economy. And now, inflation has totally eclipsed coronavirus, COVID as the number one issue and Biden is underwater on all the issues. Inflation, followed by COVID, followed by crime -- immigration and then crime, all of a sudden, is raising to the top. You want to talk about chaos? Chaos at the border, chaos in our cities, smash and grab, public safety, cops not resourced or respected properly, chaos in Afghanistan, chaos at the gas pump. And everywhere you look inflation is a problem. Inflation is not transitory. They lied about that. They said the surge at the border was seasonal lie. Everything is going well in Afghanistan, lie. And then, of course, we're going to shut down and kill the virus, lies. These are not gaffes. These are lies. And people see the president for himself they know what's going on there. But I think he should be made to eat and own all of his decisions. Who's the president? Joe Biden. Who's the face of the Democratic Party? Joe Biden. Who's in charge? I would say Joe Biden. Let the Democrats defend against that, Sean. This guy is not up to the job, up to the fight, and up to the task. But people are blaming him now in his party. Lastly in that CNBC -- CNBC poll in the 20 years they've been asking the generic ballot question, this is the first time Republicans have had a double-digit advantage over Democrats as to whom do you want to control Congress, the highest watermark for the Republicans in the past CNBC poll was four points. It's plus 10. Forty-four percent want Republicans to control Congress, only 34 percent of the country, Sean, a third of the country want Democrats to control Congress, and that's who does control Congress.",

My executive order clearly states that no employer can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for an employee with a religious personal or medical exemption. Now, Abbott's success stands in direct contrast to the failures of the Biden administration and it is why so many Americans are flocking to states like Texas and Florida from these failed blue states with draconian measures. It's also why Abbott is up by a whopping 15 points over Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke, who apparently is eager to lose yet another election.

He wants to do nothing to secure the border. He wants to people to be coming across illegally just like Joe Biden has been in favor of people coming across illegally. Texas wants a governor who's going to step up and secure our border. That's one of the reasons why they support me. But, Sean, I got to tell you something else. If you dig into that poll, some very interesting findings, such as I'm supported by women overwhelmingly over Beto, by Hispanics more than Beto. But there was another very interesting finding in there and that is more people thought that Beto was dishonest than they thought he was honest. The poll also showed that Joe Biden has something like a 32 percent favorability rating and a 64 percent unfavorability rating. People do not like the Biden administration in the state of Texas and they view Beto O'Rourke through that very same lens.",

Anyway, the power grabs, pandemic theater, never-ending panic, it's now all part of the Democratic playbook. In New York City, you've got failing governor, failing mayor, soon to be gone, but the Governor Kathy Hochul now saying everyone across the state must wear a mask indoors, unless the venue has a vaccine mandate. Meanwhile, down in Florida, where there are no mandates, the COVID positivity rate -- well, continues to be far lower than New York and other blue states -- as a matter of fact, some of the lowest in the country. What happened to follow the science? And remember, no one has been more wrong than Dr. Fauci. Masks don't work. Then, one mask, then two masks, then vax or mask. Then, it's vax, mask, booster. And now, it's vaccine mandates from grandma and grandpa if they want to come visit over the holidays. Anyway, now you better get your booster or else you're not fully vaccinated. He's the same guy who said we wouldn't need -- we wouldn't have vaccine mandates. We would never have vaccine passports.

The truth from the CDC is quite the opposite. Over age 75, 97 percent of people have voluntarily chosen to be vaccinated. Between ages 64 and 75, 99 percent of people have been vaccinated. So we are voluntarily accepting this. Most people at high risk have been vaccinated. This is a disease of the elderly, not of children. And the thing is, is that, he's not obeying science.

So if you're an inpatient, Dr. Fauci forbids anybody in the country from having monoclonal antibodies if they're an inpatient. He's the one that directs the policy, you can't get it. So if your parents are sick and you're going to the emergency room, they may have to be admitted, you have to know enough to ask the doctors, hey, wait a minute, could we give them the monoclonal antibodies before they're admitted, because the algorithm, the rigidity of the state algorithm is that you can't get it once you've been admitted. You also supposedly can't get it after 10 days of symptoms. So you may or may not want to forget about the first couple of days when you're giving them your history because the thing is, is you still could get some benefit from the monoclonal antibodies. They're probably better used in the earlier stages of the disease, and that's what people should get as a message here get it before it's too late. But we should still being allowed to use in the hospital and at a later period of time. The company has been advocating for this, but you don't see the government being very eager to approve this in-hospital use.

Let me correct the headline for CNN, it was most, five out of six is most not some. But this shouldn't really surprise any of us because we know that the mainstream media has basically carried the water for the Democrat Party forever. For as long as so many of us can remember.

They want to change our country. We know that so many of them over there on the Democrat side want to socialize America. So how do you do that? You have to stoke hate, you have to continue to divide us and this story was perfect for them whenever they first got a whiff of it. The idea that a bunch of -- that a couple of Trump supporters were out there at 2:00 a.m. waiting in the freezing frigid winter of Chicago to attack Jussie Smollett while he went out per guidance apparently of his nutritionist. I don't know what nutritionist by the way would ever tell you to go eat at 2:00 in the morning. So that one got me from the jump. But the whole thing, we all said -- well, this is crazy.

Now, it is crickets from them because they can't spin this in any way positive for them.

If they did, Sean, what you just said if they went back and corrected the record and said you know what? We were wrong about this, we shouldn't have spoken so soon but we want to correct this or at least tell us the verdict, my goodness.

Well, Joe Manchin, you got the score, $3 trillion added to the deficit and debt and with inflation already spiraling out of control, it's not $1.75 trillion, it's $5.1 trillion. So, Joe, there's your off ramp, time to walk away from this socialist spending spree and stand up for the people of West Virginia that are getting killed by the climate cult, New Green Deal socialist in the House and in your party. Rising prices are deeply impacting the people of West Virginia. This is, by the way, this goes right to the core of West Virginia's economy, energy. This bill will make everything much worse.

Now, Joe Manchin has talked about the possibility of a pause here. He is very concerned about inflation. So he says maybe we should put the brakes on here for just a little bit. He might in fact get that pause. Here's the reason. They still have not completed the legislative text. They are still running this past the Senate parliamentarian trying to get all the clearances there to make sure it comports with the special Senate budget rules, and this delay may give Joe Manchin exactly what he wants. Now, there was a push by the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to move this bill through the Senate before Christmas and then it would have to go back to the House of Representatives.

Tonight, Joe Biden's poll numbers, they are falling again dramatically. New survey, this time CNBC, showing the president taking hits on his handling of COVID, the economy, pretty much everything. A year from now, Joe will be a massive liability in the midterm elections on the national state and local level. But the city of New York has a solution and that is a new measure that will allow non-citizens -- in other words illegal immigrants -- to vote in citywide elections. So you can add that to my list of election reform. For example, we need signature verification, we need voter ID, that should be mandatory. Even Joe's state of Delaware has that. We need chain of custody controls, updated voter rolls, and yes, partisan observers need to watch up close the vote counting start to finish and now, no illegal immigrants should vote. Now, the Washington Post once called it a conspiracy theory that illegal immigrants will vote. Now, it's called the reality. Under New York City's one party Democratic rule, power in perpetuity is all that matters. That's why the city is now devolving into a nasty, high crime, hell hole. I say that from experience. And meanwhile, south of New York, in the Washington D.C. swamp, not much better. Even some Democrats are concerned about Biden's cognitive decline. Look at this poll. Majority of Americans do not believe Joe is mentally fit to serve. By the way, we were way ahead of the curve. In an interview that will air this weekend, well, First Lady Jill Biden said that concerns around Joe's mental fitness are ridiculous. But everyone on earth including our allies and enemies and hostile regimes can all see what we see every day and that is every day is now a struggle for Joe -- walking, talking, reading, remembering. Some days are a little better than others but he seems to be getting worse. But it makes you wonder who then is in charge over at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. You know, just like when he said, oh, we're not going to pay illegal immigrants. Peter Doocy, you need to stop reporting that garbage. Two days later, he's advocating it. So the question is, I don't know what's worse, advocating the dumb policy or not knowing his administration put forth the dumb policy? FOX News contributor Jason Chaffetz, former Trump White House aide Kellyanne Conway join us with this. So you get these numbers in today, Kellyanne, is 39-year high for inflation.

They're the ones producing the worst polls for Joe Biden. Let's unpack the CNBC poll. Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said that they disapprove of Joe Biden's handling of the economy, 41 percent say the economy will get worse for them over the next year, and a separate CNBC survey say 62 percent Joe Biden is just bad for small business. It's not just that people see it at the gas pump, in their grocery cart, in the supply chain shortage, the everyday cost of necessities. Folks, these are not luxuries. This is what people need to eat and where, where they need to live, how they fuel their cars, home heating bills are going to go through the roof, and they blame Joe Biden. \"But Trump, but Trump\" has hit a buzzsaw. They can't do that anymore. They know we had a roaring economy. And now, inflation has totally eclipsed coronavirus, COVID as the number one issue and Biden is underwater on all the issues. Inflation, followed by COVID, followed by crime -- immigration and then crime, all of a sudden, is raising to the top. You want to talk about chaos? Chaos at the border, chaos in our cities, smash and grab, public safety, cops not resourced or respected properly, chaos in Afghanistan, chaos at the gas pump. And everywhere you look inflation is a problem. Inflation is not transitory. They lied about that. They said the surge at the border was seasonal lie. Everything is going well in Afghanistan, lie. And then, of course, we're going to shut down and kill the virus, lies. These are not gaffes. These are lies. And people see the president for himself they know what's going on there. But I think he should be made to eat and own all of his decisions. Who's the president? Joe Biden. Who's the face of the Democratic Party? Joe Biden. Who's in charge? I would say Joe Biden. Let the Democrats defend against that, Sean. This guy is not up to the job, up to the fight, and up to the task. But people are blaming him now in his party. Lastly in that CNBC -- CNBC poll in the 20 years they've been asking the generic ballot question, this is the first time Republicans have had a double-digit advantage over Democrats as to whom do you want to control Congress, the highest watermark for the Republicans in the past CNBC poll was four points. It's plus 10. Forty-four percent want Republicans to control Congress, only 34 percent of the country, Sean, a third of the country want Democrats to control Congress, and that's who does control Congress."

My executive order clearly states that no employer can mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for an employee with a religious personal or medical exemption. Now, Abbott's success stands in direct contrast to the failures of the Biden administration and it is why so many Americans are flocking to states like Texas and Florida from these failed blue states with draconian measures. It's also why Abbott is up by a whopping 15 points over Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke, who apparently is eager to lose yet another election. Here from react -- for reaction, Texas Governor Abbott. All right. You're up 15 points, I don't see this as a race. And I'll tell you, one of the reasons though I would give, Governor, is you've done a great job. And reason number two is when Beto ran the first time, he was kind of an unknown. Now we know how radical he is, the people of Texas know. You agree with that assessment?"

And as your audience will remember, Beto was far to the left of Joe Biden on open border policies, and he is falling way -- he being Beto O'Rourke -- is falling way behind on the border. He wants to do nothing to secure the border. He wants to people to be coming across illegally just like Joe Biden has been in favor of people coming across illegally. Texas wants a governor who's going to step up and secure our border. That's one of the reasons why they support me. But, Sean, I got to tell you something else. If you dig into that poll, some very interesting findings, such as I'm supported by women overwhelmingly over Beto, by Hispanics more than Beto. But there was another very interesting finding in there and that is more people thought that Beto was dishonest than they thought he was honest. The poll also showed that Joe Biden has something like a 32 percent favorability rating and a 64 percent unfavorability rating.

Now, the bar keeps moving and changing every other day, and it's killing economies in the Northeast as you are very well aware of. So you've taken a strong stand here.

Look at the Constitution and what the Constitution says with regard to giving the executive branch to regulate things like this, and it says absolutely nothing. And what that means is the 10th Amendment applies, and that's exactly why we've been winning all of these cases against the Biden administration with regard to the vaccine mandates. And that's why the only order or law or mandate in effect in the state of Texas is one that I issued that protects Texans' freedom. There's something important about this, Sean, and that is this is more than whether or not somebody's going to abide by a national order, whatever the case may be. This is whether or not somebody is going to have something put into their body that they do not want put into their body.

Anyway, the power grabs, pandemic theater, never-ending panic, it's now all part of the Democratic playbook. In New York City, you've got failing governor, failing mayor, soon to be gone, but the Governor Kathy Hochul now saying everyone across the state must wear a mask indoors, unless the venue has a vaccine mandate. Meanwhile, down in Florida, where there are no mandates, the COVID positivity rate -- well, continues to be far lower than New York and other blue states -- as a matter of fact, some of the lowest in the country. What happened to follow the science? And remember, no one has been more wrong than Dr. Fauci. Masks don't work. Then, one mask, then two masks, then vax or mask. Then, it's vax, mask, booster. And now, it's vaccine mandates from grandma and grandpa if they want to come visit over the holidays. Anyway, now you better get your booster or else you're not fully vaccinated. He's the same guy who said we wouldn't need -- we wouldn't have vaccine mandates. We would never have vaccine passports.

The truth from the CDC is quite the opposite. Over age 75, 97 percent of people have voluntarily chosen to be vaccinated. Between ages 64 and 75, 99 percent of people have been vaccinated.

      "utterance": "There's some knowledge about monoclonal antibodies that's incredibly important that Dr. Fauci never mentions and I've never seen him say it once. There's a window of time when you can get it. If you don't get it within that window of time, they won't give it to you. So if you're an inpatient, Dr. Fauci forbids anybody in the country from having monoclonal antibodies if they're an inpatient. He's the one that directs the policy, you can't get it. So if your parents are sick and you're going to the emergency room, they may have to be admitted, you have to know enough to ask the doctors, hey, wait a minute, could we give them the monoclonal antibodies before they're admitted, because the algorithm, the rigidity of the state algorithm is that you can't get it once you've been admitted. You also supposedly can't get it after 10 days of symptoms. So you may or may not want to forget about the first couple of days when you're giving them your history because the thing is, is you still could get some benefit from the monoclonal antibodies. They're probably better used in the earlier stages of the disease, and that's what people should get as a message here get it before it's too late. But we should still being allowed to use in the hospital and at a later period of time. The company has been advocating for this, but you don't see the government being very eager to approve this in-hospital use. They've been advocating for this for a couple of months now and to this day, you still can't get monoclonal antibodies in the hospital. It's probably your best chance not to get on the ventilator."

Up next, Don Lemon finally speaking out about his pal Jussie Smollett after he was found guilty of lying to the police. We've got the tape. We'll get reaction.

They got caught fueling yet another hoax. You know, like the four- year Trump Russia collusion hoax, just to name a few, like they always do. And while most of the left-wing sycophants in the media mob, big tech mob downplayed or ignored the story from yesterday -- well, fake news CNN host Don Lemon -- well, he was forced to face reality last night and admit that his friend is a big liar. Take a look."

      "utterance": "That's not all because fake news CNN was my widely mocked for their headline on their home page. Quote: Jussie Smollett, guilty on some charges. Well, I think guilty of five out of six charges and six counts and being exposed as a total complete liar and fraud is more than just some. Now, as resident HANNITY stalker, intern over fake news CNN, some guy named Oliver, anyway he writes quote how Sean Hannity and right wing media personalities are using the Smollett verdict to attack the media, because you get it wrong all the time. You lied about Trump-Russia collusion for years. Most media was wrong on pretty much everything, starting with Richard Jewell, Nicholas Sandman, Cambridge police, wrong on Ferguson, wrong on the case in Baltimore with Freddie Gray, UVA, Duke Lacrosse, and I can keep going. So why is it that we always get it right and they always get it wrong? And why is the mob so obsessed with fueling hoaxes? When do they apologize for getting things wrong? Why do they refuse to admit they're ever wrong? Why don't they just correct the record? It's not that hard. Anyway, get this, over at MSDNC, their prime time hosts, they never covered the verdict at all. One piece on msdnc.com used the case to attack conservatives. They're the ones who, quote, have strategically made the Smollett case their go-to example for how the left operates and how it wrongly makes villains out of Donald Trump supporters. Oh, if the dog bites, if the bee stings, if you're feeling sad, I guess you'll find some -- some way over there to blame Donald Trump. Here with reaction, FOX News contributors Leo 2.0 Terrell and Lara Trump is with us. You know, Joe Biden tweeted, what happened to Jussie Smollett must never be tolerated in this country. Kamala Harris, it's a modern day lynching. Cory Booker, a modern day lynching. Al Sharpton, Andrew Cuomo, Congresswoman Tlaib, human rights campaign, Bernie Sanders, Eric Swalwell, Maxine Waters, Dick Durbin, Cher, Katy Perry, Jemele Hill, Joy Reid -- I mean, all of them without any evidence, Lara Trump, all of them predictably wrong. Most of the same people wrong about your father-in-law conspiring with Russia."

      "speaker": "LARA TRUMP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it's funny how that all works out, isn't it, Sean? The good news is that the dozen or so people who watch MSNBC and actually tune in over there at that channel, they unfortunately did not get the verdict that Jussie Smollett was found guilty on most charges. Let me correct the headline for CNN, it was most, five out of six is most not some. But this shouldn't really surprise any of us because we know that the mainstream media has basically carried the water for the Democrat Party forever. For as long as so many of us can remember. And this is their -- basically their only job is to do the bidding of the Democrat Party. And if you look at what the Democrats want, they have told us they want to transform America. They want to change our country. We know that so many of them over there on the Democrat side want to socialize America. So how do you do that? You have to stoke hate, you have to continue to divide us and this story was perfect for them whenever they first got a whiff of it. The idea that a bunch of -- that a couple of Trump supporters were out there at 2:00 a.m. waiting in the freezing frigid winter of Chicago to attack Jussie Smollett while he went out per guidance apparently of his nutritionist. I don't know what nutritionist by the way would ever tell you to go eat at 2:00 in the morning. So that one got me from the jump. But the whole thing, we all said -- well, this is crazy. Let's wait until all the facts come out, not the folks on the left side of the mainstream media, not all those people. They jumped at this opportunity. Now, it is crickets from them because they can't spin this in any way positive for them. And sadly, it would actually go to help them and further trust in the media, although it is at a historic low right now. If they did, Sean, what you just said if they went back and corrected the record and said you know what? We were wrong about this, we shouldn't have spoken so soon but we want to correct this or at least tell us the verdict, my goodness. So this doesn't surprise anybody, but it is sad because what they are ultimately doing is hurting America and dividing people further. And it shouldn't happen. We should be able to turn to our mainstream media and have journalists out there and not people that are just pushing a political narrative."

The dry run -- the other people involved in the hoax, buying the rope, buying the red hat, their testimony was clear. All of this, anybody that followed the case. Now, when you have the president of the United States and the vice president calling it in her case modern-day lynching, the damage, the wreckage can be real here. You know, I would -- it's probably one of the reasons why that one of the ten commandments is don't bear force false witness, right, Leo?"

      "speaker": "LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And I'll tell you right now, let's add another charge. He perjured himself on the witness stand. You know, everything Lara said was absolutely correct. But you guys stop wasting your time. MSDC and CNN, those are not news organizations. Those are political organizations, social media outlet for the Democratic Party. Jussie Smollett is a convicted felon. He used his race to divide this country and it failed because, you know what? Our American legal system works. You know, Sean, you talk about the race card is played every election cycle. No, the Democrats played every single day, 24/7. They owe America an apology. They owe President Trump an apology, because they were trying to divide this country for people to hate each other. This jury came back and said, no, Smollett is a liar. He did not have a hate crime against him. Ad last point, Sean, he tried to diminish all those people who made sacrifices, gave up their lives, to establish civil rights laws, to make this country a colorblind society. He used it for his personal gain and he lost."
