      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. Since nobody reads books anymore, all of us get all of our history from Wikipedia. It is convenient. The problem is Wikipedia is so politicized and dishonest that on a lot of topics, certainly anything related to partisan politics, it's not even really worth reading anymore. There's just too much lying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On the other hand, there is a lot of stuff there, it's a huge site and there are some gems remaining on Wikipedia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So if you have a minute this weekend, take a look at the entry on mass hysteria through the ages before the authorities inevitably delete it as I'm certain they will, and as you read the entry, ask yourself if any of this sounds familiar to you? There are lots of witch trials of course, many of them -- many, many, many of them over many centuries. There are plagues of spontaneous dancing, mass ghost sightings, fits of laughing and trembling and babbling that seized entire towns at once for no apparent reason. It's all there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then there are more esoteric outbreaks of mass hysteria. There's a medieval French nun who according to the entry quote, \"Inexplicably began to meow like a cat leading the other nuns in the convent to meow as well. Eventually all of the nuns in the convent began meowing together leaving the surrounding community astonished. This did not stop until the police threatened to whip the nuns.\" It's hilarious as you read it, though at the time, the nuns definitely did not see the humor in it. They sincerely thought they were cats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hysteria is like that. When large groups of people start acting totally crazy, the reference points disappear. It all seems normal, no matter how nuts it is. So with that feature of human nature, which never changes, with that in mind, take a look at this tape from yesterday's hearing before the House Oversight Committee. The topic was legal abortion, but because it is the year 2021, and we're all convinced we're cats, the conversation soon turned to the newly established scientific fact that men can get pregnant. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We are cats, and that's all there is to it, and that's true across the ocean in Great Britain. The Head of the Labour Party in the U.K. has now declared that men too can have cervixes because of course they can, \"meow.\" A few days later, a senior member of the Labour Party was asked whether she agreed that men can have cervixes.

So no more pregnant women in \"The Washington Post.\" That's an outdated inherently offensive category, like secretaries and housewives. And this is true in hospitals, too, across the country. Some physicians now punishing subordinates who recognize biological differences between men and women. Dr. Lauren Chong for example, a pediatric trainee at the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network recently told \"The New York Times\" that healthcare workers should not use terms like \"ovaries\" and \"uterus.\" Quote: \"You can just say reproductive organs,\" Chong said, and that's an order. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The problem is that it may actually be medically relevant whether somebody has ovaries and a uterus.

So, the script has changed a little bit.

So shutting down the abortion clinics in New York, which no one is even proposing, but if you were to do that, you would have a lot more black babies than you have now. We can't even get to that conversation because we can no longer agree that only women have babies.

Strategy number two, which is just as effective or perhaps the most effective is they frame the left as, the Democratic Party has framed every argument in racial terms and they control the racial conversation in this country.

That report came to light after a CNBC Republican debate that featured several biased questions favoring Democrats. It was pretty over the top, actually, it's on YouTube. Treat yourself sometime. But the e-mails from Hunter Biden's laptop show that Brian Steel's wife was spending that money at his direction, which we think is illegal, actually. We'll leave that to the lawyers to determine, but here are the facts. In September 2016, Hunter Biden e-mailed Steel to invite him to a fundraiser for a former Biden aide who was running for Congress in South Carolina. The candidate was called Francis -- \"Fran Person.\" Steel responded this way: \"I'd love to support Fran, but unfortunately as the Executive Vice President of CNBC, I'm not allowed to donate to political campaigns. In years past, I would get around that by having my wife donate, but after CNBC hosted a controversial aggressive Republican primary debate earlier this year, Breitbart and Rush Limbaugh outed me as the husband of a max Hillary donor, so I can't have Eileen donate anymore.\" Explicit, anyone? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Steel was at CNBC from 2007 to just recently a month or so ago, 2021.

We've reached out to Steel and to CNBC for comment, neither one has gotten back to us, not surprisingly. Well, Dave Portnoy first became famous for Bar Stool Sports, but then he became a cultural phenomenon. Last year he had raised more than $40 million for small businesses suffering under corona.

By the way early this hour, we did a segment on UFOs. The government apparently is going to make a permanent office to investigate these things. Our apologies by the way, we do a segment on this topic once a month maybe, usually on a Friday. This is the largest story of our lifetime. The government has determined these are not of human origin. They're not actually Russian or Chinese. We don't know where they are from. They behave in a way that defies physics apparently and they're constantly buzzing our military installations. Why is this not huge? It is huge. And without shame, we're going to stay on it for months to come. That's it for us tonight. Have the best weekend with the ones you love. We'll see you 8:00 p.m. Monday.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. Since nobody reads books anymore, all of us get all of our history from Wikipedia. It is convenient. The problem is Wikipedia is so politicized and dishonest that on a lot of topics, certainly anything related to partisan politics, it's not even really worth reading anymore. There's just too much lying. On the other hand, there is a lot of stuff there, it's a huge site and there are some gems remaining on Wikipedia. So if you have a minute this weekend, take a look at the entry on mass hysteria through the ages before the authorities inevitably delete it as I'm certain they will, and as you read the entry, ask yourself if any of this sounds familiar to you? There are lots of witch trials of course, many of them -- many, many, many of them over many centuries. There are plagues of spontaneous dancing, mass ghost sightings, fits of laughing and trembling and babbling that seized entire towns at once for no apparent reason. It's all there. And then there are more esoteric outbreaks of mass hysteria. There's a medieval French nun who according to the entry quote, \"Inexplicably began to meow like a cat leading the other nuns in the convent to meow as well. Eventually all of the nuns in the convent began meowing together leaving the surrounding community astonished. This did not stop until the police threatened to whip the nuns.\" It's hilarious as you read it, though at the time, the nuns definitely did not see the humor in it. They sincerely thought they were cats. Hysteria is like that. When large groups of people start acting totally crazy, the reference points disappear. It all seems normal, no matter how nuts it is. So with that feature of human nature, which never changes, with that in mind, take a look at this tape from yesterday's hearing before the House Oversight Committee. The topic was legal abortion, but because it is the year 2021, and we're all convinced we're cats, the conversation soon turned to the newly established scientific fact that men can get pregnant. Watch this."

Amanda Presto just learned this. Presto is a writer at \"The Daily Wire\" and by the way, a woman, so she tweeted this thought crime assuming that she had biology on her side. She wrote this quote: \"Demanding others call you by your preferred pronouns and growing out your hair does not make you a woman. Stop demeaning womanhood.\" No, Amanda, you stop demeaning pregnant men. For her attack on the pregnant man community, Twitter shut Amanda Presto down. We are cats, and that's all there is to it, and that's true across the ocean in Great Britain. The Head of the Labour Party in the U.K. has now declared that men too can have cervixes because of course they can, \"meow.\" A few days later, a senior member of the Labour Party was asked whether she agreed that men can have cervixes. She was asked on television. Watch this uncomfortable moment."

But she can't bring herself to say it. On the other hand, she doesn't dare note the obvious, which is that the entire conversation is completely insane, so she breathes heavily. She harrumphs quite a bit and tries to move on to the next topic. \"The Washington Post\" is hoping to avoid moments of uncertainty like this, so Jeff Bezos's newspaper has just issued a new style guidance to all of its reporters. Here is what it says, quote: \"If we say pregnant women, we exclude those who are transgender and non-binary,\" which of course is not defined. So no more pregnant women in \"The Washington Post.\" That's an outdated inherently offensive category, like secretaries and housewives. And this is true in hospitals, too, across the country. Some physicians now punishing subordinates who recognize biological differences between men and women. Dr. Lauren Chong for example, a pediatric trainee at the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network recently told \"The New York Times\" that healthcare workers should not use terms like \"ovaries\" and \"uterus.\" Quote: \"You can just say reproductive organs,\" Chong said, and that's an order. The problem is that it may actually be medically relevant whether somebody has ovaries and a uterus. Reproductive organs might not be specific enough. But honestly in 2021, when we're all cats, who cares. Curing disease may be important, but is it more important than not offending the human rights campaign? Probably not. That's a conclusion the C.D.C. has reached. The Center just released a graphic pointing out that quote, \"Only 31 of pregnant people have been vaccinated,\" not pregnant women, pregnant people. And then there's \"The Lancet,\" which not that long ago was considered a serious medical journal. \"The Lancet\" just released a cover with this headline, quote: \"Historically, the anatomy and physiology of bodies with vaginas have been neglected.\" So that's the term. You thought you were a woman, now you're a -- according to \"The Lancet,\" a body with a vagina. Try to imagine a more dehumanizing phrase, but then, it is probably not possible to imagine it, actually. At yesterday's House Oversight Hearing, Gloria Steinem showed up to prove that she is still alive and still relevant somehow. For 50 years, Steinem has been -- as she describes it, defending women -- in the 70s, she wrote a piece for \"Cosmopolitan\" Magazine entitled, \"If men could menstruate\" and then she was constantly reminding us -- and this is a quote -- \"If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.\" Oh but now men can get pregnant. So, the script has changed a little bit. Here was Gloria Steinem who we should note is now a cat, meowing, telling us that absolutely anybody can get pregnant and therefore anyone can get an abortion. Watch."

      "utterance": "What's happening in Texas is not only a local issue or a women's issue, it's a step against democracy, which allows us to control our own bodies and our own voices. Remember when Hitler was elected and he was elected, his very first official act was to padlock the family planning clinics and declare abortion a crime against the state. Mussolini did exactly the same thing because they knew that controlling reproduction and nationalizing women's bodies is the first step in a controlling state -- in an all-controlling state."

      "utterance": "\"The Nazis preferred that the Eastern European workers not become pregnant so they would not be taken out of the workforce. They took measures to identify pregnant workers and to encourage or pressure them into making use of the abortion services the Nazis provided.\" Oh, does that sound familiar? So once again the goal is to reduce women to wage slaves. It is more virtuous to work at JPMorgan than it is to be a mother, that's what they're telling you. That's what Ayanna Pressley is telling you. She complained that abortion bans are tools of -- you guessed it -- white supremacy, and the experts at the hearings yesterday agreed. Watch."

There is no rational conversation about anything currently underway in the United States. We have to say, just again in the interest of fact checking that what you just heard is the opposite of the truth. New York City is the biggest city in America, it's got eight million people. The abortion rate in New York among African-American mothers is roughly three times the rate that it is for white mothers. Thousands more black babies are born in New York that are born every year. So shutting down the abortion clinics in New York, which no one is even proposing, but if you were to do that, you would have a lot more black babies than you have now. We can't even get to that conversation because we can no longer agree that only women have babies. Now men have babies, so for 50 years, they told us men have no interest in whether or not abortion is legal because they can't have kids, but now they can, so we thought it would be worth weighing in on this. According to the House Oversight Committee, it is all for your own good. Watch."

He is host of \"Fearless.\" He's just written a new piece in \"The Blaze\" about how lunacy like this is the left's new religion. Jason Whitlock, thanks so much for coming on tonight, so I don't know how you even begin to untangle the series of intersecting arguments none of which makes sense, but taken together become this like Gordian knot of insanity. How do you even unravel this? But I'm going to throw it to you and see if you can. JASON WHITLOCK, HOST, \"FEARLESS WITH JASON WHITLOCK\":  Tucker, we're looking at and we're living in an era where the truth is under an attack that it's never been under, a level of attack it's never been under. And you have to understand it from a biblical perspective. God is a search for truth. God is truth. The Gospel is truth, and it's under attack in this very secular society and they're very clever and strategic about how they're going about it. The whole defining of truth as offensive and this whole little safe space society we've built where everybody lives in fear of saying anything that someone can define as offensive is an attack on truth. Because the truth, particularly biblical truth in this era is probably offensive and will make people uncomfortable, but we're creating a society where we don't want to make sure anything that comes out of our mouth doesn't make any single person on the planet uncomfortable, therefore it's impossible to get to the truth. Strategy number two, which is just as effective or perhaps the most effective is they frame the left as, the Democratic Party has framed every argument in racial terms and they control the racial conversation in this country. And so if you disagree with anything they say, if they say you know what, abortion is freedom, abortion is an extension of white supremacy, even though the truth and the facts say 40 percent of the abortions in America are happening to black women and we're killing about 650 black babies per day here in America through abortion, it is not abortion. If it is an extension of white supremacy, it is because it's executing a genocide on black babies. The protection of abortion rights is in no way protecting black people, but the Democratic Party has just been so clever in its assault on the truth and its silencing of truth and anybody that speaks against it, I've just got to tip my hat to them because this is a propaganda campaign the likes of which I am not sure we've ever seen in the history of the planet, and it's effective, and if men don't stand up and women don't stand up and those of us that believe in truth, those of us that believe in the founding principles of this country, if we don't stand up they're going to continue to slaughter us with lies framed as truth."

They are using our previous pain and discrimination to bring us down and this entire nation down and I'm just begging those of us who are believers, not -- Just those of us with any commonsense, we must call this unbelievable racism that we're seeing from the left. We must call it out. We must stand up against it, call it exactly what it is. The left -- if there's anybody imitating Hitler, Margaret Sanger, it is the left. They are trying to destroy this country and they are doing it by destroying black people first and then using race and the religion of race that they've replaced Christianity and the Judeo-Christian values that made this country great.

Some of it is hard to defend, but some of it is worthwhile and some of it is interesting. So the bill includes a provision to create a permanent office under the Defense Secretary that will be tasked with investigating reports of UFOs. That office would quote, \"Carry out on a department-wide basis the mission currently performed by the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force.\" Interesting. It's unclear if the Senate will approve that provision. We'll be watching. Lue Elizondo led The Pentagon's secret UFO Task Force for years, he joins us tonight to assess.

But it is historic and it is historic for several reasons. In this obscure five pages that most people may not be aware of, it really says a lot. In fact, it -- first of all, it creates an environment where it disestablishes the UAP Task Force, which was a temporary capability to begin with and solidifies a permanent capability. Two, it also forces the Secretary of Defense to report on an annual basis to Congress what we've learned about UAPs. Three, it also requires us to now work with our international friends and allies. That's a big deal. And if that wasn't a big deal enough, two other items that I found very interesting. Number four is that it -- and you kind of broke this story a few years ago, it requires any recovered material associated with UAPs to finally be reported to Congress, and then last but not least, it also requires the government to report to Congress any adverse medical effects that have been encountered by our pilots who may have come up close and personal to these UAPs."

As crazy as it sounds, there are still people when you say hey, have you heard about the UAP issue that we're encountering off the Coast of California or over in the Middle East?

An estimated record 400,000 migrants might attempt to cross our southern border this month according to an NBC News report citing D.H.S. officials, but a major ruling yesterday from a Federal Appeals Court will allow the Biden administration to continue temporarily using Title 42 to turn away asylum seekers, which will now likely prevent that massive surge of migrants from making it into the U.S. this month. D.H.S. officials are warning that up to 400,000 migrants could cross our Southern border in October. Four hundred thousand would be nearly double the 21-year record reached in July when 200,000 migrants crossed our border. But yesterday, a Federal Appeals Court ruled the Biden administration can resume the use of Title 42 to turn away non-U.S. citizens. Two weeks ago, a lower court U.S. judge ruled that Title 42 was enacted under the Trump administration and that President Biden no longer had the authority to block asylum seekers using Title 42. Now you may recall, Title 42 is an emergency health law implemented when the C.D.C. believes prohibiting anyone except U.S. citizens into the country including asylum seekers can dramatically prevent the spread of disease. We reached out to the D.H.S., but they had no comment -- Tucker."

This is a real game changer and unfortunately, we're not going to get approval for about two months given our regulatory burden, but this was developed last year, if that doesn't say something about our F.D.A. and the process by which we develop life-saving medications, nothing will.

That would be improper, it would be an obvious evidence of bias, so it's not allowed. But as it happens, and this show has just obtained e-mails demonstrating that in private, news executives don't care about the rules or the concept of impartiality, they'll donate to any candidate they want, they just want to make certain you don't find out about it. The e-mails came to us from a source with access to Hunter Biden's laptop, the one he left at the computer repair shop, supposedly, not sure we believe that story. But the laptop itself is absolutely real and these documents show that a CNBC executive used his wife to dodge company rules that bar financial contributions to political campaigns. In 2015, Breitbart first reported the wife of a man called Brian Steel who until recently was an Executive Vice President at CNBC was a Hillary Clinton donor, a big Hillary Clinton donor. That report came to light after a CNBC Republican debate that featured several biased questions favoring Democrats. It was pretty over the top, actually, it's on YouTube. Treat yourself sometime. But the e-mails from Hunter Biden's laptop show that Brian Steel's wife was spending that money at his direction, which we think is illegal, actually. We'll leave that to the lawyers to determine, but here are the facts. In September 2016, Hunter Biden e-mailed Steel to invite him to a fundraiser for a former Biden aide who was running for Congress in South Carolina.

Steel was at CNBC from 2007 to just recently a month or so ago, 2021. During that time, his wife donated $16,000.00 to Democrats. How much of that money was given at his direction? We've reached out to Steel and to CNBC for comment, neither one has gotten back to us, not surprisingly. Well, Dave Portnoy first became famous for Bar Stool Sports, but then he became a cultural phenomenon. Last year he had raised more than $40 million for small businesses suffering under corona. He also has a massive social media following because he is a free thinker. He is not explicitly political or really political at all, but he says what he thinks and that's a rare thing, and the authorities don't like it.

I certainly have gone hard at the AMC in the billionaires club, so there's so many different angles, but one thing is for sure, if people in a certain side and it tends to be the big social media platforms don't like what you have to say, there is no doubt that you start disappearing and whether you like Trump, don't like Trump, I have no opinion on it. The fact they kicked him off, you know Twitter and social media totally and then you have like at one point the Taliban on there, there is no rhyme or reason for what's happening basically in social media.

Our apologies by the way, we do a segment on this topic once a month maybe, usually on a Friday. This is the largest story of our lifetime. The government has determined these are not of human origin. They're not actually Russian or Chinese. We don't know where they are from. They behave in a way that defies physics apparently and they're constantly buzzing our military installations. Why is this not huge? It is huge. And without shame, we're going to stay on it for months to come. That's it for us tonight. Have the best weekend with the ones you love. We'll see you 8:00 p.m. Monday.
