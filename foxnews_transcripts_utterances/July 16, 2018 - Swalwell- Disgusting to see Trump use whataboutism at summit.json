And that's why the intense media criticism has cut across the usual partisan lines. I mean, you have news anchors like CNN's Anderson Cooper saying one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president. Of course you have Obama administration liberals, even David Axelrod on CNN, usually sober minded, he likened it to Neville Chamberlain after meeting Hitler. I think some of that is over the top. But when you have Newt Gingrich, and he's a Trump ally, when you have conservatives, others on Fox News, when you have the national view on the Weekly Standard all saying that these were serious stumbles, serious missteps on such a global stage, I think it's clear that the president gave his detractors a lot of ammunition today.",

You know, I was on the Sanders campaign but I let people know all the time I did not believe in socialism when it came down to business, fair trade, competition. I do believe in socializing medicine.

People like Donald Mooney in San Antonio that came out of the system that now employed hundreds of thousands of employees across the country. It was the private sector that did that. It was the private sector that gave felons second opportunities when the government did not. So I am absolutely against one, business owners being classified as capitalist and greed. There's a big difference between corporate greed and the spirit of entrepreneurship. And that's been lost in the conversation, particularly within the African-American community when it comes to business. Business people are not bad people. We are here to make a difference, we're here to pay people, you know, to pay people when the government decides not to and I'm just not interested in the government writing my check.

It makes all the sense in the world for many -- for many reasons and given the major, major international global security issues that are really on the table between our two countries and our allies. So, that is absolutely a good thing that anybody that argues against that, I think is just dead wrong. Number two, Putin did what I expected him to do score, propaganda victory and lie his way through every single issue as the hypocrite that he -- that he truly is, and coated those issues in a way that's certainly favorable to Russia and what he is doing. But really, the stunner for me, and sadly to say, disappointment was in the president's two major mistakes I think he made. One is not to stand behind the intelligence community as everybody's been talking about when the hard evidence, Martha is there that Russia meddled in our election. There is no doubt about that. We have the goods on these guys. That's the reality of it, the president knows that. And to stand there on a world stage and appease Russia in favor, in disfavor to our intelligence community was the thing that shocked me."

And here is what he said when he got on the plane. \"As I said today, and many times before, 'I have GREAT -- all in caps, confidence in my intelligence people.' However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past as the world's two great nuclear power -- largest nuclear powers, we must get along.\" How could he have handled that moment differently, not the -- not that you can hit rewind here?"

And I think some of that information will come out later. But I do think that one of the things -- in fairness to President Trump, this did happen on President Obama's watch. But he's, he's got -- he's responsible for 2018 and 2020. And he has to give notice to Putin that, \"Look it, if you meddle in these elections in 18 and 20, not only am I going to impose the harshest sanctions that I'm able to do, but I will terminate the relationship with you to the end of my presidency.

And that just is not true. It's not the fact that we haven't made mistakes, of course, we have. But it's really Russia's malign and aggressive behavior for many years now that is causing the international security problems that we and our European allies have. Putin has expanded territory in a way that no one has done in the Soviet Union since Stalin. And he's encroaching on East European neighbors' intimidation and coercion on a regular basis, and not to speak of the intervention in Georgia, Crimea, Ukraine, and now in Syria. And obviously, undermining democracies of all of his opponents to include the United States. That is aggressive malign behavior that's at his doorstep. And by no means, as the United States contributed to that level of deterioration in a relationship, that's just wrong."

I did not see an American president, I saw two defenders of Russia and for the President to insult the FBI, and he knows that server was imaged. In our investigation, we found that was sufficient. The FBI does this all the time when cyber-attacks occur. They don't just take a server away from a business, a company, an organization if imaging will provide the same information. And so, it was just disgusting to see him use this what about is him, rather than confronting the person responsible for ordering that attack."

But then, he almost -- you know, sort of admitted involvement in it because he said that you know, these e-mails -- you know, we didn't make them up that they were hacked, and then, they showed a real -- a real bunch of e- mails and communication, they weren't made up.

But two, those e-mails were private e-mails. Not intended for the public. And by putting them out there and weaponizing them, they turned us against each other. This could happen to the Republicans. And Democrats, I hope if it ever does that we stand with them United and say, we're not going to tolerate this, whichever country does it, whichever party is affected by it, that we will use unity as an antidote if this was to ever happen again. And let me just add, Martha, Democrats have offered to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee a use truce saying that if e-mails are hacked this election, we won't use it against you, if you don't use it against us. And they won't take us up on that. And I don't know why, and I wish they would."

But given how dirty we know these campaigns get, it's almost impossible to believe that, that would actually be a deal that, that could be reached. But we have heard a lot about the fact that there is already very active campaigns to get involved in the 2018 election. But I think, one of the things that perhaps bothers the president so much. And I think, you know, not to psychoanalyze, but one of the reasons that perhaps he appears to hate to go there is because he doesn't want to give up any ground in terms of how he won the election. But at the same time, you can say there was no collusion and it didn't impact the outcome. But we do need to know what they're doing and what any other government out there is doing because they're not alone, the Russians, in terms of getting in the way of our elections and we simply won't stand for it."

    {
      "speaker": "SWALWELL",
      "utterance": "That's right, you can separate collusion from this interference campaign, and say, we're never going to tolerate an adversary doing this. Martha, just weeks after the November election, I wrote legislation -- bipartisan legislation to have an independent commission, because I fear this was too charged for Congress that we would dig in and if Republicans heard Russia, they would just assume that we were trying to delegitimize the presidency. And so, I wanted just like we did after September 11, to have a commission of elders and statesmen equally appointed by the House and the Senate Republicans and Democrats. So that they could give the American people the awareness they need and recommend the forms that Congress must pass. We could still do that, the September 11th commission was not created on September12th, It was over a year later, but I think that's the best way we could address this."

As someone joked on Twitter, I've got a rent-free space in his brain because he spent so much time thinking about me and he's so mad at me because of the act. The Magnitsky Act is a piece of legislation which freezes assets and bans visas of people in his inner circle who's involved in killing my lawyer Sergey Magnitsky and doing other type of stuff.

Both are Fox News Contributors. Gentlemen, thank you all for being here this evening. You know, Byron, a lot of very tough reaction to what we saw in there today, the president getting hit from all sides, Newt Gingrich saying it's the biggest mistake of his presidency to date and it's clear from the tweet that the president sent on his way out of town that he knows that there is fixing to be done."

You can maybe discount some of that stuff, separate those from the people who have been more balanced on Trump and who have not gotten upset with everything he's done who believe that today he made a serious mistake. And his serious mistake was not taking the side of not only U.S. intelligence agencies, but the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate and taking their side over election meddling over the Russians."

And that's why the intense media criticism has cut across the usual partisan lines. I mean, you have news anchors like CNN's Anderson Cooper saying one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president. Of course you have Obama administration liberals, even David Axelrod on CNN, usually sober minded, he likened it to Neville Chamberlain after meeting Hitler. I think some of that is over the top. But when you have Newt Gingrich, and he's a Trump ally, when you have conservatives, others on Fox News, when you have the national view on the Weekly Standard all saying that these were serious stumbles, serious missteps on such a global stage, I think it's clear that the president gave his detractors a lot of ammunition today."

I do not understand the obsession with this whole idea that we have to have good relations with Russia. We've done perfectly fine in the past at times not having good relations with Russia. Russia is an anti-American aggressive thug country and the only way we can have good relations with them is if we accommodate what it is that makes them a terrible regime. So I think the mistake is almost inevitable from today in the sense that the mistake was having this forum in the first place where the United States president has to be in the presence of this autocrat, this despot and treat him as if he were a statesman."

He wanted to present a, you know, we've turned a page, that all that changed four hours ago. He is very determined to show that he's going to have a different relationship with this man. He said it all through the campaign and he worked very hard and bent over backwards, some might say, to achieve that today. He clearly wants to, you know, have better trade relationships with them. Vladimir Putin was talking to Chris Wallace about cars and, you know, the kind of business agreements they could reach where cars are concerned, and possibly wants to peel him away in some respects from President Xi in China. He sees perhaps an alliance between these two countries, United States and Russia, as something that might be a bulwark against China. Your thoughts on any of that."

It's perfectly legitimate to fight back on the latter, but not so much in the former because there is bipartisan agreement of these Russian efforts, and yet, the president appears to believe that if he gives even an inch on conceding that there was this Russian effort, then they will all take a mile in the effort to get Trump."

You guys meddled; a lot of countries try to get in the middle of other countries elections. That's not going to happen anymore and just moved on.

I mean, some of this talk we are hearing from John Brennan about treason and so forth I think is over-the-top. He made some serious mistakes today and then of course the press ratchets it up to 11 as they do on just about everything, but the fact that it is also coming from the Republican side, from the conservative side, from people like Newt Gingrich I think drives home the point that -- I don't agree there shouldn't have been a summit. American presidents spoke to Soviet leaders from the worst years of the Cold War, Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons. We need to deal with Russia. But knowing this was going to come up, the fact that the president couldn't find a way to say let's not litigate the past, let's move on and said steam seemed to side with Putin over Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, for example, I think has dug m into political hole and I don't think this is a one or two day story."

In previous, behind closed doors interviews, Mr. Rosenstein has indicated to members of Congress that that did not involve Russia. Peter Strzok did not answer that question and Lisa Page I believe answered it in a way that is inconsistent with Rod Rosenstein's prior statements behind closed doors and if, in fact, they were trying to open up a Russia case because someone was the acting director that wouldn't have been opened otherwise, that shows the bias not just in people's hearts, but in their actions as they were conducting investigations.

People like Donald Mooney in San Antonio that came out of the system that now employed hundreds of thousands of employees across the country. It was the private sector that did that. It was the private sector that gave felons second opportunities when the government did not. So I am absolutely against one, business owners being classified as capitalist and greed. There's a big difference between corporate greed and the spirit of entrepreneurship. And that's been lost in the conversation, particularly within the African-American community when it comes to business. Business people are not bad people. We are here to make a difference, we're here to pay people, you know, to pay people when the government decides not to and I'm just not interested in the government writing my check.
