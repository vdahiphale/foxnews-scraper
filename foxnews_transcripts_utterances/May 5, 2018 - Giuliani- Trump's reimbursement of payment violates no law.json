      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. Rudy Giuliani, the attorney for President Trump in the Mueller investigation and the Stormy Daniels case. Rudy is standing by live for an exclusive interview on \"Justice.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I have a lot of questions for him in just a moment, but first my opening statement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you ever doubted that the mission of special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation is to secure the scalp of a sitting president, then listen up. For the first time, real evidence not of Russia collusion, but of the Mueller team's all-out war on our president was played out in a Federal courthouse in Virginia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The judge, United States District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III took no prisoners in addressing the motivation and the intent as well as the underlying authority of the so-called special counsel. Judge Ellis, a well-respected jurist has handled some of the highest profile national security cases in this country. His politics had never been questioned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He was born in Bogota, Colombia, served in the United States Navy and graduated both Princeton and Harvard. The colloquy between this respected judge and prosecutor, Andrew Weissman whose ethics and integrity had been repeatedly attacked by Federal courts for years was astonishing even to a veteran of the courtroom like myself. You will recall that Manafort stands accused by team Mueller in two separate indictments of money laundering, bank fraud and lobbying crimes when he worked for the Ukrainian, not Russian government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Judge Ellis, no friend of Manafort threatened that Manafort was faced with a real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison. He told Manafort that given his financial means, as well as his international connections, that he pose a substantial a flight risk from justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, yesterday as Manafort's team sought dismissal of Mueller's indictment based on lack of jurisdiction, the court did a 180 accusing the prosecutors of not only trying to take down the president, but of trying to wield unfettered power. Now you may recall that in was in May of 2017 that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who signed an order to appointing Mueller special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters. Ironically, in the order, Mueller is authorized to conduct an investigation generated by director of the FBI, James Comey's House Intelligence Committee testimony. Isn't it curious that it was Rod Rosenstein who wrote the 2017 memo saying that Jim Comey should be fired, saying, \"The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage affecting the entire Department of Justice.\" Rosenstein adding, he doesn't understand Comey's refusal to accept the nearly almost universal judgment that he made serious mistakes in the handling of the collusion - or in conclusion of Clinton's email investigation. That Comey was, according to Rosenstein, a textbook example of what prosecutors and agents are taught not to do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He adds, \"The prosecutors from different eras and both political parties agree that Comey violated the rules and regulations, as well as the traditions of the FBI ending,\" ending with recommendation that ,\"The FBI is unlikely to regain public confidence and Congressional trust unless Comey is gone.\" And yet, in the most of blatant display of public corruption and personal cover your own butt, Rosenstein appoints both Comey and his friend, Mueller to begin an investigation generated from the disrespected tainted testimony of the same man that he wanted fired. But it gets worse, the so-called Russia collusion investigation is then secretly expanded by Rosenstein months later. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, why is this important? Because Rosenstein is adding more authority than we knew he initially gave. So, why does Rosenstein even have so much power? He has irrefutable power, more than the president himself some would say, because he convinced a dithering, unsure, insecure, uncertain spineless, timid attorney general just appointed by the president to back off and renege on his duty to run the Department of Justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Lo and behold, Rosenstein who has his own bias against Trump having just a day earlier then rejected by Trump to run the FBI, his interests though is far beyond that job. His interest is to protect this handling of the case, ultimately permitting Hillary Clinton to get approval to sell 20% of America's uranium to Russia interest. So, enter Judge Ellis, a take no prisoner judge who has seen it all. He tells Rosenstein's henchmen, \"Do you even have the power to indict Manafort? Aren't you overstepping your authority to investigate Russia collusion during the 2016 presidential election when you indict Manafort for actions 11 years prior to the election? What does 2005 have to do with the 2016 elections or the 2017 firing of James Comey?\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in their inimitable way, the arrogant, almighty Mueller team responds in an open courtroom to a Federal judge, \"We have additional powers. We cannot disclose them in this courtroom because of an ongoing investigation and because it will affect national security.\" The judge suggests Mueller's people are lying about the investigation and seeking the unfettered power to unseat our president, simply using Manafort to sing against Donald Trump; \"Come on, man, you don't care about Manafort, you really care about what information Manafort can give you to lead to Mr. Trump and an impeachment.\" The Mueller team then refuses to show their authority. Judge Ellis demands to see the Rosenstein secret memo, un-redacted of course. The one that House Republicans have sought for months, saying that information from 2015 is not within the scope of that investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We don't want anyone with unfettered powers, said the judge, making fun of and paraphrasing the prosecutors, the court sums up the Mueller team argument, \"We said this is what the investigation is about, but we are not bound by what we said and we were lying anyway.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By saying their authority is not judicially enforceable, the Mueller team is basically telling a United States federal judge that their authority cannot be challenged through the courts It's time to end the Mueller-Comey-Rosenstein cabal once and for all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And joining me now, attorney for President Trump and former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, thanks so much, Mr. Mayor for being on \"Justice.\"",

      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Hello, and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. Rudy Giuliani, the attorney for President Trump in the Mueller investigation and the Stormy Daniels case. Rudy is standing by live for an exclusive interview on \"Justice.\" I have a lot of questions for him in just a moment, but first my opening statement. If you ever doubted that the mission of special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation is to secure the scalp of a sitting president, then listen up. For the first time, real evidence not of Russia collusion, but of the Mueller team's all-out war on our president was played out in a Federal courthouse in Virginia. The judge, United States District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III took no prisoners in addressing the motivation and the intent as well as the underlying authority of the so-called special counsel. Judge Ellis, a well-respected jurist has handled some of the highest profile national security cases in this country. His politics had never been questioned. He was born in Bogota, Colombia, served in the United States Navy and graduated both Princeton and Harvard. The colloquy between this respected judge and prosecutor, Andrew Weissman whose ethics and integrity had been repeatedly attacked by Federal courts for years was astonishing even to a veteran of the courtroom like myself. You will recall that Manafort stands accused by team Mueller in two separate indictments of money laundering, bank fraud and lobbying crimes when he worked for the Ukrainian, not Russian government. Judge Ellis, no friend of Manafort threatened that Manafort was faced with a real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison. He told Manafort that given his financial means, as well as his international connections, that he pose a substantial a flight risk from justice. But, yesterday as Manafort's team sought dismissal of Mueller's indictment based on lack of jurisdiction, the court did a 180 accusing the prosecutors of not only trying to take down the president, but of trying to wield unfettered power. Now you may recall that in was in May of 2017 that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who signed an order to appointing Mueller special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and related matters. Ironically, in the order, Mueller is authorized to conduct an investigation generated by director of the FBI, James Comey's House Intelligence Committee testimony. Isn't it curious that it was Rod Rosenstein who wrote the 2017 memo saying that Jim Comey should be fired, saying, \"The FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage affecting the entire Department of Justice.\" Rosenstein adding, he doesn't understand Comey's refusal to accept the nearly almost universal judgment that he made serious mistakes in the handling of the collusion - or in conclusion of Clinton's email investigation. That Comey was, according to Rosenstein, a textbook example of what prosecutors and agents are taught not to do. He adds, \"The prosecutors from different eras and both political parties agree that Comey violated the rules and regulations, as well as the traditions of the FBI ending,\" ending with recommendation that ,\"The FBI is unlikely to regain public confidence and Congressional trust unless Comey is gone.\" And yet, in the most of blatant display of public corruption and personal cover your own butt, Rosenstein appoints both Comey and his friend, Mueller to begin an investigation generated from the disrespected tainted testimony of the same man that he wanted fired. But it gets worse, the so-called Russia collusion investigation is then secretly expanded by Rosenstein months later. So, why is this important? Because Rosenstein is adding more authority than we knew he initially gave. So, why does Rosenstein even have so much power? He has irrefutable power, more than the president himself some would say, because he convinced a dithering, unsure, insecure, uncertain spineless, timid attorney general just appointed by the president to back off and renege on his duty to run the Department of Justice. Lo and behold, Rosenstein who has his own bias against Trump having just a day earlier then rejected by Trump to run the FBI, his interests though is far beyond that job. His interest is to protect this handling of the case, ultimately permitting Hillary Clinton to get approval to sell 20% of America's uranium to Russia interest. So, enter Judge Ellis, a take no prisoner judge who has seen it all. He tells Rosenstein's henchmen, \"Do you even have the power to indict Manafort? Aren't you overstepping your authority to investigate Russia collusion during the 2016 presidential election when you indict Manafort for actions 11 years prior to the election? What does 2005 have to do with the 2016 elections or the 2017 firing of James Comey?\" And in their inimitable way, the arrogant, almighty Mueller team responds in an open courtroom to a Federal judge, \"We have additional powers. We cannot disclose them in this courtroom because of an ongoing investigation and because it will affect national security.\" The judge suggests Mueller's people are lying about the investigation and seeking the unfettered power to unseat our president, simply using Manafort to sing against Donald Trump; \"Come on, man, you don't care about Manafort, you really care about what information Manafort can give you to lead to Mr. Trump and an impeachment.\" The Mueller team then refuses to show their authority. Judge Ellis demands to see the Rosenstein secret memo, un-redacted of course. The one that House Republicans have sought for months, saying that information from 2015 is not within the scope of that investigation. We don't want anyone with unfettered powers, said the judge, making fun of and paraphrasing the prosecutors, the court sums up the Mueller team argument, \"We said this is what the investigation is about, but we are not bound by what we said and we were lying anyway.\" By saying their authority is not judicially enforceable, the Mueller team is basically telling a United States federal judge that their authority cannot be challenged through the courts It's time to end the Mueller-Comey-Rosenstein cabal once and for all. And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. And joining me now, attorney for President Trump and former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, thanks so much, Mr. Mayor for being on \"Justice.\""

I think the judge was rightfully confused about why did they give away Cohen, but not Manafort. So, I don't know, maybe they think Manafort is somebody they can flip faster. The fact is, this plays into what my client, the president of the United States has been saying for quite some time. The judge, in substance said, this is a witch hunt with a tremendous amount of government misconduct attached to it. And you're quite correct, Attorney General Sessions should step up and dismiss this entire investigation."

My concern is, when these prosecutors go before a Federal judge in a Federal district courthouse and basically say, we can't tell you, when the judge is the one deciding the propriety of that case and handling the case, where are we in terms of justice in this country and the power of the courts over unfettered power of the Special Counsel?"

I mean, they are way over the top. When you look at questions they propound - what do you think? What do you feel? It's like, come on in and commit perjury. There is no evidence of collusion with the Russians. Gone. There is no evidence of obstruction of justice. Everything the president did, he has perfect authority to do under Article 2. They want him to do a Martha Stewart for them, and I am sorry, people, he's not going to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

Can you please clear his up for us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "Sure, the end result is real simple and that's what we are interested in. The president of the United States did not in any way violate the campaign finance law. Every campaign finance expert - Republican and Democrat - will tell you, that if it was for another purpose other than just campaigns and even if it was for campaign purposes, if it was to save his family, to save embarrassment, it's not a campaign donation. And second, even if it was a campaign donation, the president reimbursed it fully with a payment of $35,000.00 a month that paid for that and other expenses. No need to go beyond that. Case over. That case should be dismissed by the Southern District of New York, at least with regard to President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, did you misspeak or did people not interpret what you were saying. Were you talking about the facts or were you talking about the law, Mr. Mayor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "I am talking about the law and the conclusion. The facts, I'm still learning. This is you know, 1.2 million documents. I have been in the case for two weeks, virtually one day in comparison to other people. So, I am not an expert on the facts yet. I am getting there. But I am an expert on the law, and particularly the campaign finance law, I have lived under it running for president. And the fact is, there is no way that there was campaign finance violation or any kind nor was it a loan. It was an expenditure, and this expenditure would have been made whether he was running for president or he wasn't running for president and we can show that from the history of these two gentlemen. Mr. Cohen has probably been the worst treated, and Mr. Manafort in this case. The rage on their house, Comey got really offended when I said it was storm trooper tactics. I think the judge basically said that maybe a little more eloquently than I did, but after all, I am a litigator in there fighting for my client, and some of the people around it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

I mean, when you juxtapose that against that against the so-called investigation of Hillary Clinton where she was basically given a warning, she deletes, she bleached - yes..."

We have turned over the documents after all, and I am in the process of getting through about a third of them so far. There is no evidence of any of the things you are talking about. The only evidence there is - the only crimes committed here have been committed by the government, which is why the judge, Judge Ellis is so outraged. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't dismiss this case the way the case of Senator Stevens was dismissed, unfortunately after the man died."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Right, right and that is part of the frustration we have here. But if a judge appears to be saying like, give me the reason for your - the basis for your jurisdiction, how it is that you go into a grand jury and get an indictment? If there is no power that is connected to the 2016 election or the firing of James Comey, then how can they possibly have the authority to indict Manafort? Why wouldn't Ellis dismiss this indictment?"

      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "Now, I don't know what the - some of the things, they won't share it with us either over at the White House counsel's office. I don't know what their authority was, but the judge has every right to see it, after all, this was not statutory authority. A US attorney like I was, has the statutory authority recommended indictment."

    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "So, you've got to get it from Rosenstein, well, they have a right to see it, and the judge also has a right to determine, they went beyond that even if Rosenstein attempted to give it to them. He also has a right to determine that by government misconduct, they have fatally tainted this case, and I believe in my heart that the Supreme Court will decide that. So, I think Judge Ellis probably is tough enough and strong enough to decide that himself."

But here, we don't have a crime here. We have no idea what the crime is because no one will tell us. And here is the danger with Manafort telling him he might spend the rest of his life in prison. My client, if Scooter Libby had the same situation when the same people - Comey and Patrick Fitzgerald - who is now a lawyer, went to Scooter Libby's lawyers and said, \"If you give us something about Vice President Cheney, this will all go away and you won't be indicted.\" Well, Scooter Libby is a strong man and an honest man, but not everybody is that strong when they are looking at spending the rest of their time in prison then they can do what Alan Dershowitz talks about, composing rather than singing what the facts are. It's very, very dangerous in this situation."

It is based on separation of powers, constitutional grounds like you're not going to have the President go in and report to a lower court, but also on policy grounds. The opinion said, the president is busy. You cannot take a criminal process and even an indictment. You cannot take a criminal process to the point where the President becomes incapacitated to run the Presidency.

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "utterance": "Yes, and like I always say, challenge yourself to consider the inverse. Challenge yourself to consider if they banned Taylor Swift's music because she supports Obama. It's saddening and it's disheartening to me that this is the reaction that he's getting from people that once loved him because he doesn't think the way that they want him to think. His mind is not his own. This is why I call this ideological slavery because that's exactly what it is. You're only - they only enjoy you to the extent that you celebrate their own ideas."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Interesting. I want to jump now because we don't have that much time. There is a mural of Trump on a Chula Vista school wall that sparks controversy. Do we have a photo of that? Okay, I guess it's so bad we are not going to show it. All right, so this is outside a school with an image showing an attack on the President of the United States."

      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "You know, it's unacceptable, but I don't blame the student, I don't blame the parents, I don't blame the artists. I blame the media. I blame the celebrities for making people think this is acceptable behavior. Every award show we watch, they are mocking the president. We have songs that are coming out that are mocking the president. We have Snoop Dogg releasing albums that show the president dead, where he is pretending to shoot the president. What do you expect the response to be? When they are watching people that they idolize see that this sort of behavior is okay. Of course, it's going to start to take place in a more molecular level, and that's exactly what is happening here."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, it reminds me of when, you know, they were taking a knee in the football - that whole thing going on, and kids at schools, high schools, younger, they are taking the knee, too. They kind of follow what they think is being taught to them or what is being imposed on them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Monkey see, monkey do is exactly what this is and it's sad, and it's dangerous because the slope is very slippery. Let's see if they get another president that is a Democrat, you can't then say that this behavior is unacceptable down the line."
