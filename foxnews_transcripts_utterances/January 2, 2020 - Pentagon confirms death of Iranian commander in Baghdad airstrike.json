He was the number two of Iran-backed militias known as the PMF. The PMF is blaming the United States. In total, Raymond, Iraq state TV reporting that seven people were killed. I want to read part of the statement from the Pentagon. It says, quote, \"At the direction of the president, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.

A U.S. airstrike, killing the leader of Iran's revolutionary guard who approved the New Year's Eve attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

      "utterance": "Raymond, the U.S. claiming responsibility for this attack. I am going to read the statement from the Pentagon in just a moment. Major General Soleimani was in charge of Iran's Quds Force and the Pentagon confirms that he was killed at the direction of President Trump after the airstrike hit his convoy near Baghdad International Airport. Soleimani joined the armed forces in Iran 1979, the year of the Iranian revolution. He played a major rule in arming Shia militias in Iraq that eventually killed U.S. troops during the Iraq war. Also killed was Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. He was the number two of Iran-backed militias known as the PMF. The PMF is blaming the United States. In total, Raymond, Iraq state TV reporting that seven people were killed. I want to read part of the statement from the Pentagon. It says, quote, \"At the direction of the president, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.\" Raymond, this comes amid tensions the United States and Iran. A New Year's Eve Iranian protesters stood outside the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Things got so out of control. U.S. forces had to come in. President Trump ordered approximately 750 soldiers in the region to deal with the unrest. Now, just today, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said, quote, \"the game has changed and we're prepared to do what is necessary to defend our personnel and our interests and our partners in this region.\" This comment came before the rocket attacks just several hours ago. But it is noted, also part of this statement, I'm looking here right now, it says, quote, \"the United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.\" This coming from the Pentagon just about 10 minutes ago, Raymond."

What does it mean and tell us about this general. This is a man responsible for 17 percent of the U.S. deaths in Iraq. Go on. Fill us in."

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely right, Raymond. What has happened tonight is stunning. This is a really pre-emptive national security strike by the United States against a network headed by Soleimani, who is in charge of Iran operations in four countries at least, if not beyond, who was preparing, according to reports, a series of attacks against U.S. diplomats, military and others, and who was coordinating with the heads of pro-Iran militias in Iraq, in Lebanon and other parts as well. So what we have done tonight, what the country has done tonight after the orders of the president and the commanders, was to save American lives and interests and allies in the region from what was prepared by these organizations."

It was there. We saw it. So, most of the actions against the Iranians -- I'm not saying all of the actions -- most of the actions by the U.S. against the Iranians were sort of delayed or were not taken because of the architecture of the Iran deal. We were negotiating with Iranian leadership. So in the middle of these negotiations, we're not going to be shooting right and left commanders of the Iranian regime unless it was really necessary, but we haven't seen much of those. Now, we have a different policy. That policy is to make sure that the Iranians and their allies are not going to pre-empt against us and take out American lives."

It was written under windows by these Iran-backed militia men at the U.S. embassy there in Baghdad. Does this draw a line, a connection between Soleimani and the attack of our embassy, Steve Scalise, and is this the right move?"

      "speaker": "REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA.",
      "utterance": "Raymond, this has been building for a long time, but President Trump took incredibly decisive action to take out the head of this major terrorist organization. IRGC has been a major terrorist organization. Soleimani himself is responsible for the deaths of over 600 of our men and women in uniform. This guy has been one of the major terrorists, most brutal terrorists in the world. This is on the same level of, you know, you can go down the line, but Al- Baghdadi, of course, the most recent, even when you look at where this ranks, this is right up there as one of the major attacks. Taking out one of the worst terrorists that has been a threat to the United States clearly, as the Pentagon has said, this was a defensive action because they were seeing other things getting ready to happen. And so it wasn't just taking out somebody for what happened at the embassy, but it was also -- he was probably getting ready to direct other attacks against Americans. And so this is a terrorist who has been responsible for the deaths of 600 plus Americans and probably getting ready to try to do more. He won't be able to kill anybody else because he's been taken out. President Trump, I think, has sent a strong message to Iran and any other terrorists around the world. This is serious business. If you come after America, we're going to come after you with lethal strength and overwhelming strength."

That mother organization has sub-organizations, controls organizations and militias in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and even in Yemen, the Houthis. But in Iraq, it has a high density of organizations, one of which is Kata'ib Hezbollah. Now, yes, that's true, that the pro-Iranian militias, because they are under the umbrella of the Iraqi government which is a big mistake, but because of this legality that they have, they've been fighting ISIS, but not because of us, not because of the Iraqi people, which they have killed over the past many weeks now, 700 Iraqis have been killed by that militia, not just Americans in the past and other Arabs, but including Iraqis, that organization has received orders to target Americans. That is the red line that we have been warning the president --"

Is there a concern -- particularly I am going to direct this to the congressman -- is there a concern over the last few years we have trained fighters in Syria, who later turned against our forces, and it seems we're seeing the same thing here, we trained this group, they helped us fight ISIS, and then they suddenly turn their guns and their training on our troops, are you concerned that we're moving into that same position again or into that place? I'll start with Congressman Biggs."

Some of them ended up turning out working with Osama bin Laden against the United States later. This is always part of the context within the Mideast, part of the real problem that we have. It's so complicated. When Dr. Phares starts talking about yes, this group was fighting against ISIS but they weren't fighting for the U.S., that's part of what we see, we see this overlay of different groups. It's almost impossible to really sort it out because of the way they structure it and they layer upon this one after another."

We spent a trillion dollars in Iraq to turn it into Iowa, or so we were told 16 years ago. It's obviously not that. You have the security guard there. That's who allowed this group of protesters who come and invade our embassy. It was the Iraqi government. Any concern that we don't have quite the hold there that we thought we did after all this time treasure and blood?"

      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Of course, we have seen that slipping away over the last few years. You've seen a stronger Iranian influence. President Trump was able to pushed ISIS out of the Middle East by and large, but then you've seen other actors come in. Iran is one of those. They had an involvement in Iraq. They're trying to take away the freedom from the people of Iraq. This is a major victory for the people of Iraq who want freedom. Frankly for Iranians who want freedom because Soleimani has been one of those people leading attacks against not just Americans, but against anybody who seeks freedom in that region and he is gone."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHARES",
      "utterance": "The Iranian regime is now in a state of shock. What they have seen now is the decaptation of the strategic leadership against the Americans. What is it that they're going to do later? They have to make a choice between escalating -- every time they escalate, they see the might of America which has changed big time, or they will say we're going to seek a ceasefire, we are going to now rethink the issues. Both are possible. Let me make one point that you asked about. Basically in Iraq, these militias are hated by the population. I think the situation in Iraq is better than what we generally think. The majority of the people, the majority of Iraqi youth, Shia, the majority of the Sunnis, almost all of the Kurds and the minorities are against Iran. So, we are in a much better position especially after the elimination of that threat."

Thank you for being here, Walid Phares. Congressman, I want to turn now to impeachment. It's more than two weeks since the House voted to impeach President Trump.

      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "She's been on a fishing expedition from the very beginning. The day that Donald Trump took the oath of office they were trying to impeach him. Frankly, Al Green again just said that it was before he was elected president that they wanted to take him out. So, if you look at where we are now, they had no case, there was no crime committed, but they impeached him anyway. They don't know what to do with it. They thought public opinion was going to be with them. They thought they were going to find crimes. Maybe she's still hoping something falls out of the sky. But this is a classic witch hunt. That is going to have a bad ending for Nancy Pelosi and for every Democrat who voted for that impeachment. That is going to have to go back home to people that aren't just radical socialists, who are saying, what did you do the last two years, you spent all your time carrying out a political vendetta against President Trump instead of lowering drug prices and doing other things that matter to our working families."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Congressman Biggs, CNN published a new op-ed and it's the case for letting senators vote secretly on Trump's fate. The author, Professor Robert Alexander from Northwestern University, argues, quote, \"A secret ballot would give the Senate what Alexander Hamilton described as confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve, unawed, and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality to render a fair trial.\" Congressman, are they so desperate that they are open to block transparency on impeachment? Is this even a possibility?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not a real possibility. You're right, Raymond. They are so nervous letting the truth come out. That's why we started off, remember, in the secret chambers of the House with Adam Schiff and closed door meetings, so most of us who were ultimately going to vote on this didn't get a chance to hear it. They do not want this to come forward. So I think the alternative ultimately is going to be, I've got to call on my friends in the Senate, particularly Lindsey Graham, they need to have a few witnesses come in so they can bring forward some of the evidence that the Democrats suppressed, which further undermines their case."

I mean, does she feel unsafe when she sees a law enforcement official walking down and patrolling a neighborhood with obviously a firearm and other things like tasers? I mean, this is the classic fear that liberals have of individuals owning guns. What they don't recognize is that criminals have guns and will use them against good innocent people. If you don't have somebody to counter somebody with a gun, it's not going to end well. In my case, I wouldn't be here if there wasn't somebody to counter that shooter in the case of the shooting at these horrible shootings at the church that we have seen. It was people multiple times that countered the shooter with a firearm, people that were trained. They knew what they were doing. You saw that in the case of the Texas church.

Though it's a good reflection of support, that's not why people vote for a candidate. I spent the afternoon talking to voters, OK? People support a candidate because they feel economically and personally secure. They vote based on how that candidate makes them feel. As regular viewers of this show, you know, in addition to politics, I always look at the cultural picture to see what is coming next. Given the cultural moment, the president may find himself ideally situated in 2020. Stay with me for a minute. There are a few people in the pop culture or politics willing to hit hard and not only speak truth to power, but do it with brass knuckles and a comic touch. There is clearly an appetite for this approach. Do you know what was the most watched comedy special on Netflix in 2019? It was Dave Chappelle's \"Sticks and Stones.\" And this is why."

New polling should have Democrats worried because Trump is trouncing them in key swing states. A new Mason-Dixon poll has Trump clobbering every Democrat candidate in Florida and Virginia except for Joe Biden. And even there Biden's lead in Florida is two points and in Virginia four points. Joining me now with insight is John McLaughlin, Trump's 2020 campaign pollster, and Scott Rasmussen, pollster at large at Ballotpedia. John, is the Trump campaign worried about that Mason-Dixon poll that shows Biden beating Trump in these two major parts, Virginia and Florida? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: You have got the impeachment backfire going on right now where President Trump is running as this tough guy who is changing Washington. And s the Democrats attacked him, he's gone up. Now, that Virginia poll is five points more Democratic that the 2016 exits. So we may be ahead of Biden if we have the same turn out as 2016."

They know they have nothing to beat him. They're holding on impeachment articles that they are never going to send to the economy. The economy is up. America is doing well. And more and more people are turning to Donald J. Trump for solutions. So what they're working on right now is what's the excuse going to be since we can't use Russia collusion again?"

I said I'm Joe Piscopo. He's a fan. I love it. Everybody has got to just settle down. The mantra on the radio show, if I mays, sir, AM 970, and the flagship station for Salem Media, with the greats like Seb Gorka and Mike Gallagher and Dennis Prager, and Larry Elder, my buddy. Everybody, you have to just settle down. And they're getting crazy for no reason. Maybe because I've known Donald J. Trump, citizen Trump, for over 30 years, worked for him. I saw him at immense and so many charity affairs with Melania. He would be there. And he was nothing but pleasant. So maybe because I know the man, I don't get upset.

Now it's very small what you can laugh at, what you can discuss, and what's permitted in speech code. Is Donald Trump the candidate to fill that moment?"

And when Donald Trump, because for eight years before Donald Trump, with no disrespect to anybody, we were lectured. The professorial tone. We were bad, we were racist. I was so tired of being told what to do. And all the folks that are following now, they follow on social media, they listen to our radio show on AM 970. We're all good people.
