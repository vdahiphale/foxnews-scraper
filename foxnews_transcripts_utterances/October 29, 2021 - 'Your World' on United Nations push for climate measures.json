      "sentences": "Scary, indeed, Neil. So we're looking at the fastest jump in consumer prices since 1991, 30 years ago, when prices went up as quickly. Headline, inflation, you're paying almost 4.5 percent more than you did a year ago. Now, if you strip out volatile food and energy, core inflation, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge on consumer prices, that still went up by more than 3.5 percent, still a three-decade high. And you have been hearing complaints from America's biggest companies about the high prices that they have to pay, and Starbucks being the latest today, with the stock having its single worst day in a year after the coffee giant said that they were making less because they have to pay more for raw materials and labor. So when these for-profit companies pay out more, they're going to be passing those costs on to consumers by hiking their own prices. And just this week, Caterpillar, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Colgate, Palmolive, Del Monte among the companies raising prices, and they join Nestle, time maker P&G, Danone, Chipotle, Verizon, AT&T that have also recently increased prices. So consumers are dealing with sticker shock when they go to their local supermarkets to buy groceries or when they fill up their gas tanks and booking vacations. Inflation, labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks are the main reasons right now holding back the U.S. economy, according to Wall Street. The U.S. economy only expanded a disappointing 2 percent in the summertime, with consumers not spending as much owing to higher prices and stalling jobs growth. Now, price pressures are just so high right now that even the happiest place on earth is more expensive. Disneyland in California just this week hiking single-day tickets by five to 10 bucks. And, Neil, when Mickey's raising prices, that's really saying something, no?",

But if you really want to look at a trade imbalance, take a look at this picture here. There are so many containers here, they are literally spilling over into nearby neighborhoods, leaving truckers without chassis needed to move the new containers, hence the logjam. Now, to solve that, the ports have imposed a $100 fee on each container not removed on time. And that escalates each day to $2, 600 each week. Now, there are 360,000 containers in Long Beach and L.A., import and export as well. And they fear that the prices are going to end up hurting consumers, that surcharge.",

If the Republicans managed to beat the equivalent of an incumbent in Terry McAuliffe, that's going to be a signal to everyone who studied elections over the last 25 years. Virginia is a bellwether. Virginia is a leading economic indicator in politics. If the Republicans can win there, despite McAuliffe's spending advantage, and despite him having already been governor of Virginia for four years, that tells me that we should be all running over to London to place bets on the Republicans in congressional races in 2022. Now, it is true that the dysfunction in Washington spills over to Virginia. It is also true that anywhere up to 25 to one-third of the Virginia vote works either in Washington or the suburbs of Washington. That said, this race, as McAuliffe says himself, is very much a local race. Education is playing a an outsized role there. And I'm watching the polls. One last point, Neil. The candidate that has the momentum is about 80 percent of the time that candidate that wins, and in every survey -- none of them have the margin that the FOX News poll has, but every survey shows Youngkin gaining over the last 10 days. That suggests he's probably got an 80 percent chance of winning this election.",

And what's really interesting about New Jersey is, any Democratic governor has tried to get reelected, the last time it's happened is back in 1977 with Brendan Byrne. And I'm wondering why that is.

Now, the problem here is that, yes, the votes, the margins have come down. But it is so hard in New Jersey for a Republican to get those last 3 or 4 percent. Virginia is a Democratic state and has been in presidential races for the last two decades. But, on statewide races, they still vote Republican. New Jersey does not do that.

And, by the way, Neil, it is going to be a wakeup call for Democrats that their spending is too much, their tax increases are too much, their programs are too much. Even though that's not been an issue in Virginia, there is a sense that people are fed up with the government, they're fed up with Washington, they're fed up with Richmond, they're fed up with their own government, and they want elected officials who listen to them for a change.

And we have got you covered, first off was Susan Li on the scare, certainly for shoppers, and then William La Jeunesse out of California on the bottlenecks that are driving, well, shoppers and shippers batty. We begin with Susan. Hi, Susan."

      "utterance": "Scary, indeed, Neil. So we're looking at the fastest jump in consumer prices since 1991, 30 years ago, when prices went up as quickly. Headline, inflation, you're paying almost 4.5 percent more than you did a year ago. Now, if you strip out volatile food and energy, core inflation, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge on consumer prices, that still went up by more than 3.5 percent, still a three-decade high. And you have been hearing complaints from America's biggest companies about the high prices that they have to pay, and Starbucks being the latest today, with the stock having its single worst day in a year after the coffee giant said that they were making less because they have to pay more for raw materials and labor. So when these for-profit companies pay out more, they're going to be passing those costs on to consumers by hiking their own prices. And just this week, Caterpillar, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Colgate, Palmolive, Del Monte among the companies raising prices, and they join Nestle, time maker P&G, Danone, Chipotle, Verizon, AT&T that have also recently increased prices. So consumers are dealing with sticker shock when they go to their local supermarkets to buy groceries or when they fill up their gas tanks and booking vacations. Inflation, labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks are the main reasons right now holding back the U.S. economy, according to Wall Street. The U.S. economy only expanded a disappointing 2 percent in the summertime, with consumers not spending as much owing to higher prices and stalling jobs growth. Now, price pressures are just so high right now that even the happiest place on earth is more expensive. Disneyland in California just this week hiking single-day tickets by five to 10 bucks. And, Neil, when Mickey's raising prices, that's really saying something, no?"

But there are issues here affecting price and availability. We expect 46 ships here in the next three days. That's a lot, 10 percent from Vietnam, 65 percent from China. But if you really want to look at a trade imbalance, take a look at this picture here. There are so many containers here, they are literally spilling over into nearby neighborhoods, leaving truckers without chassis needed to move the new containers, hence the logjam. Now, to solve that, the ports have imposed a $100 fee on each container not removed on time. And that escalates each day to $2, 600 each week. Now, there are 360,000 containers in Long Beach and L.A., import and export as well. And they fear that the prices are going to end up hurting consumers, that surcharge."

You have got a group that is -- quote, unquote -- \"functioning\" and thinking about the problem. That's a lot different than action.

The infrastructure bill, which is supposed to be paid for, actually adds $398 billion to the debt, and, frankly, has a lot of pretty questionable provisions. But it's the better of the two. The second bill, the reconciliation bill, is really way out there in terms of spending. It's changing every day. There's -- it's going to be a lot more expensive than the advertised cost. But progressives are trying to use a bill that they support, the infrastructure bill, to bludgeon more moderate members into supporting a bill that some of them don't support. So, it's really been turned into a sort of blackmail instrument inside the Democratic Party."

      "speaker": "COLE",

There's more than enough Democratic votes, if they will actually vote for something they support, instead of use it as a bludgeon against their own colleagues. In terms of the reconciliation bill, I think that's still a work in process. It's not going to be solved next week. The Senate -- the key senators that they need -- and that's Manchin and Sinema -- have not yet agreed to the deal. So I think, as long as they hold out, and they're still negotiating, you won't see the infrastructure bill. So I expect this to stretch for several more weeks."

Here's why the infrastructure bill is good. It's going to mean more money for ports. It's going to deal with supply chain disruptions. It's going to mean Internet for rural America. Here's why the Build Back Better bill is good. It's going to mean universal preschool for everyone. It's going to mean child care is covered. It's going to mean massive investments in solar and wind.

Senator Manchin, Senator Sinema are saying, let's continue to good faith have the negotiations, wrap it up. That's what progressives are saying.

It will be Vice President Kamala Harris here in the southeastern corner of the state in Norfolk, a Democratic stronghold. And they're going to try to get their voters out here. Some Democrats have said that the concept or the idea that the Congress could pass the infrastructure bill and the social spending bill could give a boost to the Democratic candidates here in Virginia and in that gubernatorial race in New Jersey. So we asked both Virginia candidates about this. McAuliffe told us that effect, he thinks, is overblown."

It's outside the poll's margin of error and also a flip from just two weeks ago, when McAuliffe was already ahead by five. Now, part of the dynamic here is, the state is reporting that there have been nearly a million votes already cast in this race. Early voting started in mid-September, back when the polls were much better for McAuliffe. In New Jersey, also an early voting situation there, but not quite as long as this one, that only started on September -- or October 23 on Saturday -- back to you, Neil."

If the Republicans managed to beat the equivalent of an incumbent in Terry McAuliffe, that's going to be a signal to everyone who studied elections over the last 25 years. Virginia is a bellwether. Virginia is a leading economic indicator in politics. If the Republicans can win there, despite McAuliffe's spending advantage, and despite him having already been governor of Virginia for four years, that tells me that we should be all running over to London to place bets on the Republicans in congressional races in 2022. Now, it is true that the dysfunction in Washington spills over to Virginia. It is also true that anywhere up to 25 to one-third of the Virginia vote works either in Washington or the suburbs of Washington. That said, this race, as McAuliffe says himself, is very much a local race. Education is playing a an outsized role there. And I'm watching the polls. One last point, Neil. The candidate that has the momentum is about 80 percent of the time that candidate that wins, and in every survey -- none of them have the margin that the FOX News poll has, but every survey shows Youngkin gaining over the last 10 days. That suggests he's probably got an 80 percent chance of winning this election."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

But what's fascinating about New Jersey and what's happening -- it's the bluest of blue states, but the governor has come down mightily from the 26- to 30-point advantage you have in the summer. And what's really interesting about New Jersey is, any Democratic governor has tried to get reelected, the last time it's happened is back in 1977 with Brendan Byrne. And I'm wondering why that is. The governors who have been reelected, at least in recent history, Chris Christie, Christine Todd Whitman, why is that? What's going on in New Jersey that we should watch, maybe not overthink? What?"

And so it is so hard for a Republican to do well. That Republican has to be different. Christine Todd Whitman brought over moderate voters. Chris Christie brought over blue-collar voters, working-class voters, and they have to have this ability to extend their appeal across the traditional Democratic lines. Now, the problem here is that, yes, the votes, the margins have come down. But it is so hard in New Jersey for a Republican to get those last 3 or 4 percent. Virginia is a Democratic state and has been in presidential races for the last two decades. But, on statewide races, they still vote Republican. New Jersey does not do that. It's been a long time since he jersey elected a Republican to the Senate."

      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "We will make a bigger deal of it, except that it is the greatest indicator. If Virginia goes Republican, you can -- you can't bet on it, but that is a great indication of what's going to happen in House races, because Virginia is three different states. It's Washington, D.C., it's Richmond, Virginia, and it's South Carolina. And if the Republicans get a majority there, it says that Republicans can win nationwide. And, by the way, Neil, it is going to be a wakeup call for Democrats that their spending is too much, their tax increases are too much, their programs are too much. Even though that's not been an issue in Virginia, there is a sense that people are fed up with the government, they're fed up with Washington, they're fed up with Richmond, they're fed up with their own government, and they want elected officials who listen to them for a change. And that's why I think this election is so important."

      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a great thing; 28 million children between the ages of 5 and 11 are out there; 25,000 pediatricians, hospitals, pharmacies, community centers, school clinics are all geared up to give the kids the shot. Fifty percent of children, you know, Neil, are asymptomatic, but they can still transmit the virus. So we're worried about Thanksgiving and Christmas, when the little ones get together with the big ones, and the big ones are all vaccinated and the little ones are not. So it could be a very interesting situation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAHITA",
      "utterance": "Well, we have always worried about this young population. And you know that these children have always been liable to be infected. They're usually asymptomatic. And teachers, for example, and people in schools are concerned that the kids can transmit the virus from one to another and certainly to their adult teachers. And if the teachers are not vaccinated, they're at significant risk. So, in week one, which is next week, 15 million children, using smaller needles and usually about one-third of the dose -- that's 10 micrograms, instead of 30, which is given to adults -- these kids will get these shots. Now, good luck and hoping that the parents come forward with them. About 30 percent are enthusiastic. And God knows what the rest of the population feels about immunizing little children."

      "utterance": "Well, in the wintertime, we worry about surges of this virus. It's very true that people gather in warm places. And we're -- we have a large number of people in our population who are vaccinated. And that's very comforting. Of course, like you mentioned, in Russia, they're having a tremendous spike right now of deaths, daily deaths, and other parts of the world where the vaccination rates are less than 30 percent. Here in America, we're over 75 percent vaccinated at this time, which is good news for everybody, particularly in the metropolitan areas. So I'm looking forward to a very healthy holiday season."

I mean, but don't leave out the one thing that we have abundantly in this country and now has us sort of begging with tin cup in hand for OPEC and OPEC Plus countries to increase their oil production. By all means, have at these alternatives, but not at the expense of these traditional energy sources that had put us in a pretty good position until the last few months now that has us in hock to some nefarious characters."

And the price of things like hydrogen, which you use in the fossil fuel process, is much cheaper as well. So compared to the rest of the world, we got it pretty good. The question is, how fast do you move? Because I'm like you. I mean, I think that if everybody had an electric car, and we had plenty of electricity at reasonable prices, it would probably be much better for global warming.

Probably on the back channels with Saudi Arabia and some of the other Middle Eastern allies of the United States, there's a lot of lobbying going on right now for additional oil. The question is, can they convince them? And will the producers, who can make tremendous profits right now overseas and in the U.S., will they get seduced by the numbers and increase production again? Right now, they have been very disciplined, but that discipline traditionally gives way to more robust production."

      "utterance": "Well, yes. I mean, I know my mom was like, hey, send me your Christmas list now, because there are supply chain issues. We look at Thanksgiving coming up. It's estimated to be our most expensive Thanksgiving in the history of the meal or the history of the holiday. And so, yes, I think that people are probably just looking at what's immediately in front of them. And that's Halloween, and then it's Thanksgiving, and then it's Christmas. So they're like, let's just go all out now, just in case that shipment doesn't come over to us because of the supply chain issues."

      "utterance": "You know, guys, if you don't mind me switching gears, this caught my attention. And I thought, boy, Abby and Jimmy would be all over this development. Major airlines are going to resume selling hard liquor as soon as next month. So, I'm thinking about that, Jimmy, and say, what could possibly go wrong? What do you think?"

      "utterance": "I have -- Neil, I have a contrarian take. I actually think bringing back booze is going to help us on flights in terms of violence. Here's why. Right now, they don't sell booze on the plane. So everyone does all of their drinking before they get on. It's like going to a college football game that doesn't sell beer, right, Neil?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Ah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "So everybody gets on the plane at a weapons-grade level of intoxication to hold them over to the flight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "If -- think about it, Neil. If you get on and just progressively get drunk on the way there, there's less exposure to toxic intoxication. And this is the thing. The real source of violence on planes, Neil, is not alcohol. It's not even mask mandates, as agitating as they are. It's that there's no dignity in flying coach anymore. You're not even flying coach, Neil. You're flying assistant coach."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "There's like 77 boarding classes. You know what I'm saying? There's no room in the aisle. You got a guy next to you trimming his toenails. But you don't say anything, because you don't want to piss off his emotional support llama. If they brought back the dignity to flying, alcohol is a nonfactor, Cavuto."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, Abby, let me ask you that. The one thing that ticks me, angers me is the guy who puts the seat back in front of you."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And then it's like in your lap and all that stuff. So that could set me off. But I'm wondering. This idea that people might drink less before getting on the plane if they know they will be able to get a drink on the plane, what if they don't? What if they just double-barreled it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HORNACEK",
      "utterance": "Well, I just want to say it's impossible to follow Jimmy Failla's logic right there. But, yes, I do think that this is a good point that he brings up. The only problem is that we get more and more flight delays because pilots aren't coming, people are going on protest because of vaccine mandates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "True."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HORNACEK",
      "utterance": "So there's more time in the airport ahead of time. But, to Jimmy's point, if they just sold alcohol on flights, like they have been since 1949, maybe people will be more responsible. I'm hoping that the basic humanity of people comes back, knowing that we're not in the height of this pandemic anymore. They're dealing probably with less syndrome of being cooped up."

    },
