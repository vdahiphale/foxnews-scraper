There are stories breaking all over the map tonight and we have you covered for the next hour. The media is freaking out about President Trump sending troops to the border. We will tell you what the real agenda is. And speaking of getting stories wrong, did the Obama administration put out a false narrative about the Pulse Nightclub terror attack? We will explain that a little later in the hour. Plus, a town in Illinois is trying to ban assault weapons. Is that what the left wants for the whole country?

Calling a three-hour impassioned debate, the Escondido City Council voted 4-1 last night to file a brief in support of the Trump administration's lawsuit challenging California's sanctuary laws.

In Texas and our budget as lieutenant governor we have put $800 million in each of the budgets to do the job that Obama didn't do. Thank God for Donald Trump. He campaigned on this. He knew what he was talking about. America reacted. America is supporting him today. I heard earlier your one guest said something about his approval rating. It's up over 50 percent. Republicans 85-90 percent. People get this president stands for Americans and not criminals coming to the country illegally. So, in terms of the National Guard, we welcome it.

Number one, in Texas only in the last seven years, we have put in our jails over 245,000 criminal aliens. These are the facts. We have charged them with 650,000 crimes either current or on the rap sheet. We have convictions for 566 murders, 274 kidnappings and when President Trump talks about rape, in Texas in the last seven years 3,244 sexual assaults, join that with 40,000 other assaults, 40,000 drug crimes. Thousands of gun crimes and thousands and thousands of gang members like MS-13 in this country committing crimes. I hear the mayor of Berkeley say sanctuary cities make us safety, that is nonsense. In Texas, we passed Senate Bill 4 last February early in session and it has been upheld by the court. We now give power to the police if they want to ask where you are coming from and ask to see your documents you can do it in Texas. Secondly, if Jerry Brown tried to pull a stunt in California which is anarchy, he is not upholding his oath. Look if oath Jerry Brown took is the same thing that I took, or Governor Abbott took except the state changes, the name. We swear an oath to the Constitution and uphold the laws of the country. Our state and Jerry Brown is not doing it. In Texas if any of the Democrats defy working with ICE, we number one can fine the cities and we can arrest those elected officials and run them out of the office.

PATRICK: Well, there is a lot in symbolism. First of all, and what you said, President Trump helped border crossing goes down by taking a stuff stance and waiting for Congress to step up with the funds for the wall and more border agents. Now, he is going from rhetoric to action because Congress (inaudible) and its time for Congress to give him the money for the wall. We need the wall. Not in every mile. There's some natural barriers and some you can do electronic, but in many areas particularly around our big cities where most people cross the border and get into these big cities and disappear into the population. We need walls around these major crossings. We have 19 alone in Texas with Mexico. So, having the National Guard sends a strong message.

But White House officials privately note this president had previously voiced support for other cabinet chiefs only to push them out shortly thereafter. In fact, today a White House spokesman seemed to give Pruitt soft backing by saying he could not speak to the administrator's future. CNN is reporting the president saw Pruitt's interview on FOX and was not happy with the answers. White House officials also spreading the word that told Pruitt not to do the interview but he did it anyway, much like he is accused of going around the White House to get big pay raises for those two close aides. In fact the 'Washington Post' reporting tonight that despite telling FOX he only found out about it this week that that's not true. Meanwhile, Pruitt is dealing with new problems.

An aide to Congresswoman Elise Stefanik saying the upstate New York lawmaker believes, quote, it's in the best interest of the EPA for Mr. Pruitt to resign. Though supporters of Pruitt are rallying to his defense. Rand Paul you can see tweeting Scott Pruitt is likely the bravest and most conservative member of the Trump's cabinet. We need him to help Donald Trump drain the regulatory swamp. And Kim Strassel, columnist for the 'Wall Street Journal' has noted that then President Barack Obama's EPA chief Lisa Jackson spent almost twice as much money on an official trip to China than was spent on a trip to Italy by Pruitt, who told FOX he believes the media largely gave Obama a pass.

The question becoming, why is the media so quick to mute or to erase the jihadi narrative? Is it because we want to be so politically correct and not marginalize the LGBT community here? Or is it because they truly don't want or want to ignore the real threat here which is that there are Americans who are being recruited who are pledging allegiance who live right here in the United States?

The residents have until June 13th to give them up, and if they refuse they will face fines up to $1,000 per day. Will other liberal strongholds soon try to follow in Deerfield's path?

But yet here we are with Deerfield, Illinois, not just banning assault rifles, which really is a loaded political term, we are talking about semi-automatic sporting rifles here, but a number of other accessories that they deem as military style.

There are stories breaking all over the map tonight and we have you covered for the next hour. The media is freaking out about President Trump sending troops to the border. We will tell you what the real agenda is. And speaking of getting stories wrong, did the Obama administration put out a false narrative about the Pulse Nightclub terror attack? We will explain that a little later in the hour. Plus, a town in Illinois is trying to ban assault weapons. Is that what the left wants for the whole country? We'll debate it. But first, the revolt against the sanctuary policies continues with yet another California city fighting back against the golden state's far left stance on immigration. Calling a three-hour impassioned debate, the Escondido City Council voted 4-1 last night to file a brief in support of the Trump administration's lawsuit challenging California's sanctuary laws. Escondido is the first city in San Diego County to pursue legal action against state laws that prohibit most cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents.

The folks at that contentious meeting 45 miles north of here felt it last night. Protesters were all over the place. Tempers were flaring. There were more than 60 people in communities speaking.

Well, with the new law, Katie, that is no more. That is why we spoke with ICE's regional field director, Greg Archambeault, here in San Diego, who 30 years ago was one of those ICE agents stationed inside the Escondido Police Department. Here is what he had to say."

We want to enforce immigration law and remove the threats from the community and the country. Now they can't do that. Now their hands are tied."

We saw this week Huntington Beach and San Juan Capistrano taking action.

I came this this country to keep my family safe. And I see myself here fighting for the safety of my family and the families of Escondido. I represent the 150,000 of our residents. Our relationship with ICE has worked perfectly. The ICE agents have made my case. And we have deported over 2,000 illegal criminals for from our city with our cooperation with ICE we focus on criminals only. Now the ICE agents are on their own and in the community, and in our neighborhood, at our stations picking up criminals and innocent people. As a result of our cooperation with ICE, the crime in Escondido went down by 33 percent. Escondido today as safe as it was in 1980. I was elected mayor to uphold the Constitution and also to keep my community safe. This resolution to fight the state sanctuary law is at the core of my mission."

The mayor of Escondido is saying they had 2,000 criminal aliens that they have deported from their community which would be on the street if Sacramento had its way by banning local law enforcement from working with the federal government. What do you have to say about that? Why should 2,000 criminal aliens still be in these communities?"

Are we talking about people that are violent criminals or people that are just the victims of a broken immigration system? And certainly, Escondido, they have a right to take positions on issues that are important to their community, but Escondido doesn't speak for Berkeley and they don't speak for the state of California. There are many cities throughout the bay area and the state of California that believe that sanctuary policies make communities safer. For example, in my city, crime has gone down in the last ten years. And even with the sanctuary policy, our police are still cooperating with federal agencies. There was an operation in my city a couple of weeks ago where Homeland Security investigations arrested an illegal immigrant who was engaged in drug crime –"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "The local police in Berkeley -- it's nice that the local police of Berkeley are trying to stop illegal criminal aliens with those crimes. If you want to get into the details of what defines as criminal, Governor Jerry Brown just pardoned five criminal aliens with violent records like domestic violence, theft, robbery, armed robbery, carrying out crimes with the handgun. I mean, Mayor Abed, what is your response to other municipalities allowing these criminal aliens to continue to operate inside California? Because they can just drive down to where you are. It's not like there is a border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABED",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I think this is a risk that not only Escondido but every city in California, and every state in the nation. This mayor is in denial. They want to give sanctuary to illegal criminals. Giving sanctuaries to illegal criminals and giving them more rights and protect the rights more than the citizens is just immoral, it's illegal and unconstitutional. We need to keep our community safe. SB-52, the sanctuary state will give the immigrants, the legal immigrants and illegal immigrants, less protection because ICE will be in our neighborhoods picking up everyone. This is just insane. This is immoral. I cannot understand who anybody, who anybody would give the illegal criminals protection from the law and more rights than giving to the citizens. It's just unbelievable. California is emotional. Governor Brown and the mayors, the progressive mayors and the legislators have lost sight of doing the right thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",

I want to pull up this map of other cities and municipalities, counties, who are looking at either pushing back against Sacramento or already have. There is almost more than a dozen of them at this point. So, clearly local communities are looking at that and saying we don't want to be part of these laws that don't allow the local law enforcement to work with the feds. But going back to Mr. Arreguin, for just a moment, what do you have to say to those who are victims of crimes of criminal aliens who are allowed to be out on the streets now because these new sanctuary state laws allow them to escape ICE and recommit crimes?"
    },

The man who is debating you tonight, Mayor Abed, did that. He did that for his country. So, for you to say that is impossible to get citizenship just is not on par with the facts. Mayor Abed, do you want to respond?"

      "speaker": "ABED",
      "utterance": "It's offensive. It's clearly offensive. You know, they are getting -- my two daughters went to the University of San Marcos. We paid for tuition. Illegal immigrants pay less tuition in the school system. They are given more rights. Not only educationally, financially, they are harboring them now. They are giving them more rights. They lost track, I think the Democrat, I think Sacramento, Governor Brown, and our mayor here on the show lost track. They are really emotional about the administration and the last election. Their emotion and this is clouding their good judgment of doing the right thing. There is a disconnect between them and their constituents. I think you will see a pushback. I think the number of the cities against the sanctuary state is going to grow and it is going to grow. I think there is a movement. I'm very proud to lead this effort."

While California welcoming criminals in the state, a judge is trying to protect people from coffee.

As they are doing this, those arguments are made and as you mention the governor had pardoned actually 70 criminals but five ex-convict illegal aliens including convictions for kidnapping, and all of that. Pardon so they can avoid being deported. In the meantime, a judge is now forcing coffee shops to post a cancer warning in anyplace that serves coffee. I could be the Starbucks or the 7-eleven so that you can at least be reminded that maybe it's your lifestyle that is the problem. But also, they are considering banning straws and plastic caps on bottles because we all love the oceans. We want to save the oceans. What we know about the plastic in the ocean the super majority over 90 percent is coming from China. So, banning straws in California is not going to save the ocean. So, the messaging here is, well, criminal illegal aliens are being embraced and protected, American citizens going about their regular business, having a straw, having a cup of coffee, the message is that you are the problem, your lifestyle is the problem and you are the ones who have to be controlled."

So, the messaging is the American citizen is the problem that has to be protected from themselves as they then effectively embrace criminals who we know have behavior that harm individuals and actually elevate them and embrace them. This is leftist message. We see it whether it's Los Angeles or London.

It's remarkable micro managing of your lives. While then ushering in directly dangerous frameworks in your lives and of course, it confuses people.

In Texas and our budget as lieutenant governor we have put $800 million in each of the budgets to do the job that Obama didn't do. Thank God for Donald Trump. He campaigned on this. He knew what he was talking about. America reacted. America is supporting him today. I heard earlier your one guest said something about his approval rating. It's up over 50 percent. Republicans 85-90 percent. People get this president stands for Americans and not criminals coming to the country illegally. So, in terms of the National Guard, we welcome it. I hope he leaves them here until hell freezes over or until the wall is built. It makes a difference. When Rick Perry called out the National Guard four years ago as he was leaving office, it made a difference. When you have men and women in uniform on the border it sends a message that we are serious about protecting the country. We are all in, in Texas with President Trump on this issue."

PATRICK: Well, let's just look at the facts. I hear Democrats and the liberals on Fox all the time and other networks decrying there are no crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Number one, in Texas only in the last seven years, we have put in our jails over 245,000 criminal aliens. These are the facts. We have charged them with 650,000 crimes either current or on the rap sheet. We have convictions for 566 murders, 274 kidnappings and when President Trump talks about rape, in Texas in the last seven years 3,244 sexual assaults, join that with 40,000 other assaults, 40,000 drug crimes. Thousands of gun crimes and thousands and thousands of gang members like MS-13 in this country committing crimes. I hear the mayor of Berkeley say sanctuary cities make us safety, that is nonsense. In Texas, we passed Senate Bill 4 last February early in session and it has been upheld by the court. We now give power to the police if they want to ask where you are coming from and ask to see your documents you can do it in Texas. Secondly, if Jerry Brown tried to pull a stunt in California which is anarchy, he is not upholding his oath. Look if oath Jerry Brown took is the same thing that I took, or Governor Abbott took except the state changes, the name. We swear an oath to the Constitution and uphold the laws of the country. Our state and Jerry Brown is not doing it. In Texas if any of the Democrats defy working with ICE, we number one can fine the cities and we can arrest those elected officials and run them out of the office. We are not putting up with this nonsense in Texas. America is with the president and Texas. That is why everyone wants to move to Texas."

What impact is the National Guard going to have in terms of really bolstering the efforts of border patrol to get back on the front lines and do what they need to do to stem the increase flow of illegal immigration that we've seen over the past couple of months? PATRICK: Well, there is a lot in symbolism. First of all, and what you said, President Trump helped border crossing goes down by taking a stuff stance and waiting for Congress to step up with the funds for the wall and more border agents. Now, he is going from rhetoric to action because Congress (inaudible) and its time for Congress to give him the money for the wall. We need the wall. Not in every mile. There's some natural barriers and some you can do electronic, but in many areas particularly around our big cities where most people cross the border and get into these big cities and disappear into the population. We need walls around these major crossings. We have 19 alone in Texas with Mexico. So, having the National Guard sends a strong message. Look, if you're from Central America, that's where a lot of the gang members are coming with Ms-13 and other gangs and you get to the border and you see men in military uniforms and women standing on the border, it sends a very strong message."

And the best news for him right now is the president seemed to respond to the case today by saying he still has confidence in Pruitt. But White House officials privately note this president had previously voiced support for other cabinet chiefs only to push them out shortly thereafter. In fact, today a White House spokesman seemed to give Pruitt soft backing by saying he could not speak to the administrator's future. CNN is reporting the president saw Pruitt's interview on FOX and was not happy with the answers. White House officials also spreading the word that told Pruitt not to do the interview but he did it anyway, much like he is accused of going around the White House to get big pay raises for those two close aides. In fact the 'Washington Post' reporting tonight that despite telling FOX he only found out about it this week that that's not true. Meanwhile, Pruitt is dealing with new problems. Another top aide, Samantha Dravis, has indicated she is resigning. Insiders say it's unrelated to the questions, but it comes at the time that other aides are looking to get out amid turmoil. A new memo from EPA ethics lawyer suggests he only OK'd the arrangement where Pruitt rented an apartment from a lobbyist based on federal gift rules but did not have all the facts to determine whether it presented a conflict of interest. And a third House Republican today called on Pruitt to go. An aide to Congresswoman Elise Stefanik saying the upstate New York lawmaker believes, quote, it's in the best interest of the EPA for Mr. Pruitt to resign. Though supporters of Pruitt are rallying to his defense. Rand Paul you can see tweeting Scott Pruitt is likely the bravest and most conservative member of the Trump's cabinet. We need him to help Donald Trump drain the regulatory swamp. And Kim Strassel, columnist for the 'Wall Street Journal' has noted that then President Barack Obama's EPA chief Lisa Jackson spent almost twice as much money on an official trip to China than was spent on a trip to Italy by Pruitt, who told FOX he believes the media largely gave Obama a pass.

We have a quote from Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan. He is backing the president's strong stance on China. He says we have entered a time of uncertainty over global trade. President Trump has begun to demand material changes in our trade agreements with many countries and nations, probably most importantly between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies. We should acknowledge many of the legitimate complaints about trade. It is not unreasonable for the United States to press ahead for more equivalency. One of the administration's best arguments is that negotiation alone has not worked. So we have seen a number of officials, including the Republican politicians criticizing the president for this, saying we need to punish China for intellectual property theft, but there are other ways to go about it. But then I'm not seeing a lot of offers on the table about how to actually go after China in this way. SEAWRIGHT: I think that will be up to the legislative branch to do it if they really want to get that done. And it should be done in a bipartisan way. None of this should be done in a partisan way because it will impact Democrats and Republicans alike. So I'm very disappointed that the president is taking the approach."

I think Donald Trump wants free trade. But at some point you have to address the problems that have plagued the United States for decades now. And I think Donald Trump, what his strategy is you use these tariffs as a cudgel, as a way of browbeating China at least to the table to discuss some of the things. And will it work? We don't know. But I do think politicians from both sides of the aisle have ignored this problem for decades. And it was a chief reason he got elected president in the first place."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "So my first question is why is it that whenever we have some sort of terrorist attack like this, God forbid on American soil, or overseas frankly, does the left and the media automatically go to finding a motive that has nothing to do with the actual situation? DAFTARI: Yes. That is the question here right now is to say we had plenty of evidence to know that this man pledge allegiance to ISIS. He said on Facebook and at other times that his actions were in retaliation for the bombings in Syria. Yet because this was at a gay nightclub it became a hate crime. The question becoming, why is the media so quick to mute or to erase the jihadi narrative? Is it because we want to be so politically correct and not marginalize the LGBT community here? Or is it because they truly don't want or want to ignore the real threat here which is that there are Americans who are being recruited who are pledging allegiance who live right here in the United States? And the answer to that is that if you are fearful of perhaps being insensitive to a small minority group, you are being more insensitive to the American people and really belittling them when you are not thinking of the largest security issue here."

    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "You bring up the narrative. I want to put up on the screen a couple of quotes from mainstream media members in the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting. 'Daily Beast' Tim Teeman said at the time 'Let's say it plainly. This was a mass slaying aimed at LGBT people. This was a homophobic act. 'New Republics' Jeet Heer also arguing the same thing. 'The Orlando Massacre was undeniably a homophobic hate crime.' Then here, 'U.S. News' James Robbins says numerous subsequent reports that Omar had strong homosexual urges paint the picture of a young man trying to reconcile his inner feelings with his strongly homophobic Muslim culture.' But now that we have been through the trial of the wife we are seeing that this had nothing to do with his actual motive. Explain that. When this attack first happened you had some in-depth reporting, exclusive reporting on the motive in this attack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAFTARI",
      "utterance": "Yes. Absolutely. And why the myopic view? Why does this need to check just one box? Why do we say workplace violence or the person was mentally unstable or whatever it may be? The answer here is that the person who does pledge allegiance to ISIS and does have this jihadi point of view does beat his wife, which we came to find out. He does probably hate gays which he randomly came upon this nightclub. So why this narrow view to shut out or discredit or preclude any kind of narrative? And now that we have like extracted the narrative that this was a hate crime, why was this, why was there a push to get rid of the real narrative, which is jihadism? The one thing I did report on right after this was an Al Qaeda media on their online news outlet, they put out this alert to wannabe jihadis, telling them if you are going to launch an attack, make sure that you don't do it on a minority group, because piggybacking off of this attack they thought Americans will only take blame themselves if it's a hate crime. So make sure if you are to launch an attack that it's in the name of jihad and it's only against white Americans so that they know that this was purely jihad. They want the credit. They want it to be branded. And we allowed them in this situation for two years to get away with a false narrative."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "We are running out of time. But just re-going over the case, it seems like looking at all the facts when the warning signs were ignored about jihadism by a number of law enforcement agencies, here we are now, as you mentioned, with the narrative for years on end being about a hate crime rather than addressing the real issue and trying to prevent it in the future. Final word? DAFTARI: Absolutely. And I think the false kind of thing that is coming out about this now, even in the 'Huffington Post' piece is that this is stuff that came to light after the trial. And that is absolutely not true. We knew all these pieces of evidence when the crime happened, that pledged allegiance to ISIS, that he was doing this to retaliate for the so-called crimes that America is committing in Syria. This was all really to just take away from the real narrative that this was jihad and this was Islamic terrorism."

Joining us now with reaction is Democratic strategist Joel Payne. Joel, we have been hearing for weeks that the left doesn't have an antigun agenda, they don't have an agenda of banning guns.

And they actually survived a couple of legal challenges that show that this is something that the court did not stand in the way of.
