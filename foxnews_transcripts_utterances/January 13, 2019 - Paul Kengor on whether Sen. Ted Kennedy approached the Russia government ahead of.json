You look at that period, then you look at the Reagan period where he was taking on the Soviet Union. He knew what he wanted to do. He really wanted to defeat them and they were pushing investigations and they pushed Iran-Contra. They wanted to take him out, too. And the media was part of that, of course. The media today which clearly from day one have wanted to take out this President and they're on it every day. They give a pre-speech analysis. The other day, he gives a speech about the border and the budget and then they give a post speech analysis. Now, they are fact checkers in order to conceal, I believe, their ideology.

It actually used the words \"Reagan's belligerence.\" And it says that this is due to Reagan's refusal to engage in any modification to his politics or policies.

So with the election coming up, and it's fascinating, Mark, there is actually a paragraph in here where you've got basically Kennedy and the soviets agreeing that Reaganomics is working. Inflation is down. Unemployment is great and so the only time you will ever see them acknowledge that Reaganomics is actually working. And that being the case - is there any vulnerability for Reagan in 1984? And yes, it is these questions of war and peace.

Even offers to help set up interviews between Soviet officials and American journalists and specifically named in the document are Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters, so they are specifically mentioned in there. So they would come to the United States and that way, they could go unfiltered directly to the American public, you know, communicate their beliefs. Kennedy would go over there and he would meet with Andropov, and the document ends with Chebrikov say, \"I shall await instructions.\" This is the offer that is being made and the final paragraph ends by talking about Kennedy's own presidential prospects and whether or not he would run in 1984 and definitely looking to run in 1988.

The document is real, so the document is real, but it begs the question - okay, what happened next? Did Kennedy go to Moscow? What was the next step? And frankly here is really what happened. Andropov got very sick. In fact, Andropov that Kennedy was very impressed with, KAL007, the 269 people who died in the Korean Airliner that was shot down by the Soviets in September 1983, Reagan even wrote in his diary, \"Word is that Andropov is very sick.\" So Andropov would be dead within a year of this offer, so maybe that happened, maybe because Andropov got sick, they dropped the ball on it.

I mean, the idea, which especially shocked American communists who were Jewish, the idea that Stalin would work with Hitler to sign a non-aggression pact, this was August 23rd-24th, 1939 where they agreed that they wouldn't go to war with one another, but they agreed that they would - that they would you mutually invade Poland. That happened one week later, September 1st, 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland that started World War II. Everybody forgets two and a half weeks later, September 17th, 1939, the Soviets invaded Poland from the east. And so American communists to learn, you know, most of them hated Hitler and so to see their boy Stalin and they swore a loyalty oath to Stalin's Soviet Union."

But he said that among the people who were the worst contacts within the United States government was a guy who worked for the State Department named Alger Hiss. And what he eventually accused Hiss of doing and this appears to be what Hiss indeed did, Hiss would leave his State Department office late in the evening and he would take papers with him. These are classified documents that weren't supposed to even leave the office. He would take them home to his wife, Priscilla, who at night with a typewriter would retype these documents verbatim, and then in the morning, he would bring the papers back. Now Chambers said that he was the courier of those documents from Alger Hiss to a Soviet agent by the name of Bicov (ph) and to give you an exact number to give you a sense of how egregious this was, Chambers estimated that at least 52 times, he acted as a courier of Hiss documents to the Soviets."

And it's not only this and we're not going to get into this today, but there have been books written about how the \"New York Times\" and other media -- big media -- basically downplayed the Holocaust because they had a Progressive mindset and for a whole bunch of reasons. You look at that period, then you look at the Reagan period where he was taking on the Soviet Union. He knew what he wanted to do. He really wanted to defeat them and they were pushing investigations and they pushed Iran-Contra. They wanted to take him out, too. And the media was part of that, of course. The media today which clearly from day one have wanted to take out this President and they're on it every day. They give a pre-speech analysis. The other day, he gives a speech about the border and the budget and then they give a post speech analysis. Now, they are fact checkers in order to conceal, I believe, their ideology. Is that the problem? Is that the problem? Have the media become devoured by the Progressive movement the way Hollywood has? The way Academia has for the most part? The way the Democratic Party has?

They debate whether or not he should be able as President of the United States to give a speech to the nation on our networks because he can't be trusted. He is a liar.

I mean, you remember, it's unbelievable the things that they said about Reagan and Reagan in the 1980s didn't have - he didn't have Fox. He didn't have the internet.
