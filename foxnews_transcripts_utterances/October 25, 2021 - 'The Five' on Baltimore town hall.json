I can't imagine how horrible he must feel in that situation for that to happen. It's got to be like he'll be known for this for the rest of his life. It's horrifying. But then bad Greg says if anyone of us had accidentally shot and killed someone or a police officer, he would be all over it. He would show no such compassion. We know that as a gun control activist that he's done that to police officers online. He would destroy us. That's bad Greg. So good Greg is going to say OK, this is about training. This is about violating the golden rules of handling guns. One, you always point it in the safe direction and number two, your finger is always off the trigger, and this all goes even in movies and you always keep the gun unloaded until you use it and treat all guns as though they're loaded. That's what I learned from my NRA training from Mark Centrillo, my trainer. I learned those things. And as a neurotic, I'm a very, very good gun owner. So, what might have caused this? Carelessness and probably comfort in the sense that you're in this land of make believe so you forget the protocols. It's a really interesting hypocrisy in Hollywood. There's a lack of respect for guns by the characters that the actors are playing. Right? There's never any recoil. They're always pointing the gun like this. This is not a realistic gun practice. So, the hypocrisy is, people in movies propagate unsafe gun practices while condemning the NRA, which pushes safe gun practices. So, you have this evil -- the evil prism of two ideas. You are either pro-gun control or you're evil and that prevents you from benefitting from your adversaries training. Training from the sworn enemy, the NRA, would have prevented this. If you had actual NRA training, this would not have happened. But I doubt Alec Baldwin had any NRA training. Having said that, I feel awful, I feel awful about it.",

And it appears as if there were certainly non-union workers filling in. So again, were the standard safety protocols being followed by the prop master, the arm work, the stunt coordinator and the like. But IATSE, that union is already in a huge contract fight with the studio. So, it does raise the attention and level of outrage based on those union members about what's going on. But speaking of gun control, when these horrible accidents happen, I always wake up and think, who is going to weigh-in on social media for their own benefit for attention to bloat their own ego, to feed their own narcissism? Guess who it was? Gun control advocates. They hit the tweets sphere almost immediately trying to exploit this tragedy for again, for their own agenda. This is a workplace accident. None of their ideas on restricting gun ownership or dismantling abolishing the second amendment would prevent this tragic accident from happening. It's negligence. Clear. Based on what we know it looks like negligence. But this just seems gross. And it's not going to change anybody's mind about gun control. But here's just one example of what I saw. Frances Fisher is one of the stars on this movie.",

I don't subscribe to the Daily Beast, so if that's what they're saying, they're wrong. Can you correct them?

Congresswoman Lauren Boebert also tweeted something disgusting that's definitely not any a time for any of that especially because this was a workplace accident. I'm curious to see what Alec Baldwin's role as a producer on this does in terms of complicating the situation for him. And I grew up going to movie sets a lot. My dad was a producer. And I noticed from the age of seven when I was kind of being cognizant of what was going on, how nervous the actors were around guns to make sure that everything was going to be fine because they aren't firearms experts. They are not people who have had training in this. And you rely on the people, whether it's the union folks or the private handlers that have been hired to ensure that it is going to be safe. And this idea of that there were real bullets in there and I understand that that can happen before and I think it was Brandon Lee was the last time someone died on the set, 1993 --",

We're getting brand-new information in a tragic mistake rocking Hollywood. Alec Baldwin accidentally shooting dead cinematographer Alina Hutchins and wounding the director after firing off the shot from a prop gun on the set of his movie in New Mexico. The actor seen crying right after the incident with witnesses saying Baldwin was asking people around him why he was handed a hot gun. Everybody now wondering how this could have happened. The prop master's union reportedly saying there was a live round in the gun Baldwin fired. And the L.A. Times reporting the prop gun misfired just days before the accident and the camera crew had previously walked off the set over unsafe working conditions. The actor tweeting out a statement saying there are no words to convey his shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident and that his heart is broken for the family of Hutchins. Baldwin was questioned by police and released without any charges being filed. The Santa Fe sheriff's office says the investigation remains open and active and witnesses are being interviewed. Greg, this is a crazy story obviously. A lot of protocols were not followed to have something like this happen. There's going to be a huge investigation and potential mammoth insurance pay-out afterwards."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Good Greg says -- and good Greg feels this. That I feel absolutely awful for the victim's family. I feel absolutely awful for Alec Baldwin. I can't imagine how horrible he must feel in that situation for that to happen. It's got to be like he'll be known for this for the rest of his life. It's horrifying. But then bad Greg says if anyone of us had accidentally shot and killed someone or a police officer, he would be all over it. He would show no such compassion. We know that as a gun control activist that he's done that to police officers online. He would destroy us. That's bad Greg. So good Greg is going to say OK, this is about training. This is about violating the golden rules of handling guns. One, you always point it in the safe direction and number two, your finger is always off the trigger, and this all goes even in movies and you always keep the gun unloaded until you use it and treat all guns as though they're loaded. That's what I learned from my NRA training from Mark Centrillo, my trainer. I learned those things. And as a neurotic, I'm a very, very good gun owner. So, what might have caused this? Carelessness and probably comfort in the sense that you're in this land of make believe so you forget the protocols. It's a really interesting hypocrisy in Hollywood. There's a lack of respect for guns by the characters that the actors are playing. Right? There's never any recoil. They're always pointing the gun like this. This is not a realistic gun practice. So, the hypocrisy is, people in movies propagate unsafe gun practices while condemning the NRA, which pushes safe gun practices. So, you have this evil -- the evil prism of two ideas. You are either pro-gun control or you're evil and that prevents you from benefitting from your adversaries training. Training from the sworn enemy, the NRA, would have prevented this. If you had actual NRA training, this would not have happened. But I doubt Alec Baldwin had any NRA training. Having said that, I feel awful, I feel awful about it."

I know Dagen can speak to this in greater detail. But I think this is going to be part of a huge union fight. Because the unions are going to say if you had more union involvement, this would be safer. Unions make everything better. We know that is not necessarily the case especially for things like teachers unions and every other public sector union. But I think that is going to be the thrust of a massive fight aside from the questions that are directly asked of this case."

And it appears as if there were certainly non-union workers filling in. So again, were the standard safety protocols being followed by the prop master, the arm work, the stunt coordinator and the like. But IATSE, that union is already in a huge contract fight with the studio. So, it does raise the attention and level of outrage based on those union members about what's going on. But speaking of gun control, when these horrible accidents happen, I always wake up and think, who is going to weigh-in on social media for their own benefit for attention to bloat their own ego, to feed their own narcissism? Guess who it was? Gun control advocates. They hit the tweets sphere almost immediately trying to exploit this tragedy for again, for their own agenda. This is a workplace accident. None of their ideas on restricting gun ownership or dismantling abolishing the second amendment would prevent this tragic accident from happening. It's negligence. Clear. Based on what we know it looks like negligence. But this just seems gross. And it's not going to change anybody's mind about gun control. But here's just one example of what I saw. Frances Fisher is one of the stars on this movie."

And Frances Fisher said these quotes are inaccurate. Our director is already out of the hospital. She had said he was in intensive care. I don't subscribe to the Daily Beast, so if that's what they're saying, they're wrong. Can you correct them? But again, it's this rush to make this accident, this death about gun control and it just raises the issue of like whatever happened to having some grace and just shutting the hell up? If you're not going to say thoughts and prayers, then don't say anything. Something that's roundly mocked by the left often."

Vance who is running for a senator from Ohio tweeted something absolutely disgusting about letting Trump back on. So, you know, Alec Baldwin who famously played him on SNL weekend end up more tweets. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert also tweeted something disgusting that's definitely not any a time for any of that especially because this was a workplace accident. I'm curious to see what Alec Baldwin's role as a producer on this does in terms of complicating the situation for him. And I grew up going to movie sets a lot. My dad was a producer. And I noticed from the age of seven when I was kind of being cognizant of what was going on, how nervous the actors were around guns to make sure that everything was going to be fine because they aren't firearms experts. They are not people who have had training in this. And you rely on the people, whether it's the union folks or the private handlers that have been hired to ensure that it is going to be safe. And this idea of that there were real bullets in there and I understand that that can happen before and I think it was Brandon Lee was the last time someone died on the set, 1993 --"

And OPEC saying screw you. We're going to see this thing go to $100 a barrel and we're going to get rich and Joe can go scratch. And he doesn't have any other answers. But he campaigned on this. He said we are going to, quote, \"get rid of fossil fuels.\" But here's the real problem. As the inflation goes up, gas prices and oil goes up. And a weaker dollar makes gas prices and oil go even further up. So, he's going to have high prices, high inflation and a weak dollar and sit around and have no answers for this.

That there was -- it was him talking to a journalist, people wanted him to get interviewed. He got interviewed. Obviously took questions from the audience. I don't think that this answer was sufficient for people because they're still going to be saying, well how can you -- you said that inflation would be a near term problem. Ron Klain also said that. That doesn't seem like it's going to be the case. What are we going to do? There was one thing that I thought was really great though in that he explained actually the mechanics of getting a bill passed.
