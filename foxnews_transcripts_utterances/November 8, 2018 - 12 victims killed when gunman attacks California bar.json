The problem is the loudest voices only offered two choices.  It's either you want more gun control or you want to arm everyone. We need to escape this prison of two ideas. Here's how. One, we need a system that works. We once had a process for dealing with people who had a known mental illness but the process is now paralyzed by fear. People don't want to be pegged as violating someone else's rights. Today, psychiatric hospitals house less than a tenth of the people they did in the 1950's.  Yet, our population has doubled. If we can't house them, then at least tag them so they can't get a gun. The shooter terrified his mom. That's what we call a red flag. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Two, we need an industry focused on hardening soft targets. A shooter's body count is limited by the time it takes for a second weapon to arrive.  Enhanced security can only reduce that time. Three, finally the media must limit the persuasive power of its coverage. Studies of suicides verify the copy-cat phenomenon. With mass shooting the spotlight is no help.  Religious and political terror has an ideology. Criminal homicide has a payoff, it's often revenge or profit. This is the only terror that exists as an end in itself. We can stop it but to do that, we need to open ourselves up to uncomfortable ideas, ones that take us out of our rigid teams. You know, Dana, when you look -- you see reoccurring red flags in these cases that are just -- kind of infuriating but you know that it is hard to find a needle in a haystack. But when a needle -- when the mother is terrified, when the person has been visited by experts because of psychiatric problems, you got to ask yourself how could this happen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And there are laws on the books in California for this man's family and any person's family to deal with this and get a gun or guns out of the hands of someone who is a threat to themselves or other people. There're multiple ways to do that in the state of California. One, if a person is taken into custody, evaluated by mental health professionals, and admitted to accounting mental health facility because that person was found to be a danger to themselves or others, it is generally prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms for five years in California. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then, the state of California was the first to introduced gun violence restraining orders four years ago to give a legal path to family members and even law enforcement officers to get a gun out of somebody's hands.  And this has been the case with potential suicide or violence to others, but there're mechanisms in place that in this case were not used.",

And I would also say, I think, it's very important to say that people who have mental illness are not of a greater proclivity to commit gun violence.

So I want to say gun violence, I mean, gun violence against others. The other thing that I think is really important is that there are points where we can agree as Americans and I wish we would get to that. It's overwhelming. If you ask Americans about background checks, universal background checks, Americans say yes, including gun owners. NRA members say yes, that's a great idea. Let's do it.

An angry group of criminal Antifa protesters showed up outside his home last night, the crowd chanting threats against him and his family. They vandalized his property. Tucker wasn't home at the time, but his wife was. When the group started banging on his front door, she hid in the pantry, called 911, thinking that she was about to be a victim of a home invasion.  D.C. Police are now investigating the incident as a hate crime. Dana, there are a lot more details in this. Apparently, there was one protester caught mentioning a pipe bomb among other details, and the front door being broken.",

And I know that if it was the other way around, that somebody on the left that had a talk show had this happen to them at their House, Tucker Carlson would be the first to defend them and defend them strongly. And hopefully, other people well. I do want to mention that FOX News, the CEO, Suzanne Scott, and the president, Jay Wallace, put out a statement saying how reprehensible it was. And that \"We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view and that recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful and inclusive national conversation.\"  And they say also that \"Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans to find common ground.\" That was their statement today.",

I think it gives people who support whatever you don't like about what Tucker is saying, it gives them ammunition then to redouble and to feel some moral superiority to you as the protester.

The people that disagree with him can't make that intellectual arguments, so what they do, they're reduced to surrounding his house and chanting.  And that is so uncivilized in this country.

She's been through two bouts of cancer and had a heart stent implanted. Ginsburg keeps going, though. She hasn't missed a day of oral arguments and selected clerks to work with her through 2020.

The problem is the loudest voices only offered two choices.  It's either you want more gun control or you want to arm everyone. We need to escape this prison of two ideas. Here's how. One, we need a system that works. We once had a process for dealing with people who had a known mental illness but the process is now paralyzed by fear. People don't want to be pegged as violating someone else's rights. Today, psychiatric hospitals house less than a tenth of the people they did in the 1950's.  Yet, our population has doubled. If we can't house them, then at least tag them so they can't get a gun. The shooter terrified his mom. That's what we call a red flag. Two, we need an industry focused on hardening soft targets. A shooter's body count is limited by the time it takes for a second weapon to arrive.  Enhanced security can only reduce that time. Three, finally the media must limit the persuasive power of its coverage. Studies of suicides verify the copy-cat phenomenon. With mass shooting the spotlight is no help.  Religious and political terror has an ideology. Criminal homicide has a payoff, it's often revenge or profit. This is the only terror that exists as an end in itself. We can stop it but to do that, we need to open ourselves up to uncomfortable ideas, ones that take us out of our rigid teams. You know, Dana, when you look -- you see reoccurring red flags in these cases that are just -- kind of infuriating but you know that it is hard to find a needle in a haystack. But when a needle -- when the mother is terrified, when the person has been visited by experts because of psychiatric problems, you got to ask yourself how could this happen."

You have to look at mental health, you have to look at security, and you have to look at soft targets, because California is probably one of the strictest gun control states out there. And the city, third safest city in California, so if this could happen there, this could happen anywhere. And if you think about what Dana was just saying, if you have multiple police contacts at the house, neighbors that were concerned, law enforcement concerned that he was terrorizing his mother, terrorizing himself. Possibly harming himself, one neighbor says. And there is thought of PTSD involved. If you go and send this guy to a mental health professional and the mental health professional then just checks this box, it's similar to what happened again in the Parkland shooter again."

And there are laws on the books in California for this man's family and any person's family to deal with this and get a gun or guns out of the hands of someone who is a threat to themselves or other people. There're multiple ways to do that in the state of California. One, if a person is taken into custody, evaluated by mental health professionals, and admitted to accounting mental health facility because that person was found to be a danger to themselves or others, it is generally prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms for five years in California. And then, the state of California was the first to introduced gun violence restraining orders four years ago to give a legal path to family members and even law enforcement officers to get a gun out of somebody's hands.  And this has been the case with potential suicide or violence to others, but there're mechanisms in place that in this case were not used."

      "utterance": "Yes. So I just want to pick up on the top of your monologue which was that we get locked in a box in terms of conversation that we have in this country, because I thought that was so important that people either say, oh, no gun control or gun control, right?  I just want to also point out, as Dana said, this man had been interviewed by health care professionals and found not to be a threat to himself or others, so it's not the case that there hadn't been attention. And I would also say, I think, it's very important to say that people who have mental illness are not of a greater proclivity to commit gun violence. There's no evidence between gun violence and mental illness in this country. So, to me, what's important is that we acknowledge we have too many guns in this country, and it makes for a problem not only for gun violence but for suicide, in particular. So I want to say gun violence, I mean, gun violence against others. The other thing that I think is really important is that there are points where we can agree as Americans and I wish we would get to that. It's overwhelming. If you ask Americans about background checks, universal background checks, Americans say yes, including gun owners. NRA members say yes, that's a great idea. Let's do it. Let's have a waiting period for people who get guns."

After a night at home, she's been admitted to George Washington Hospital for observation. You know she's the oldest member of the high court. Her current illness is the latest in a long line. She's been through two bouts of cancer and had a heart stent implanted. Ginsburg keeps going, though. She hasn't missed a day of oral arguments and selected clerks to work with her through 2020. Of course, political speculation about her health, will Donald Trump have a third nomination to the court? I say let's leave politics aside and just say get well to the Notorious RBG."

The guy was walking to the local train station when all of a sudden, wham!  A wild boar takes him out at the knees and then goes after his briefcase.  The pig also bit the guy and bored him with his tusks. Southern island of Kyushu Fuku (ph). It turns out the train station is about half a mile from a mountainous area. Authorities think the boar accidentally ran through the town. The man was hospitalized, needing a total of 13 stitches."
