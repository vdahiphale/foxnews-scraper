      "sentences": "All right, Tucker, great show. Good to see you. And welcome to “Hannity.” if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Buckle up, we start with a Fox News alert tonight. The president is now taking major action to secure our southern border, just moments ago, announcing a brand-new tariff on Mexico, pressing this country now to stem the flow of migrants that are overwhelming our entire immigration system. We'll have a lot more later in the program. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First though tonight, the deep state is in a complete panic mode. The walls are closing in. We are now only days away as we've been told by the attorney general from the release of major documents exposing the corruption at the highest levels of our government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, remember, the attorney general said that he expects the Inspector General Horowitz to report on FISA abuse any day. And then, of course, we have the other four devastating buckets that we keep talking about, exposing what is the real election scandal, to one robbing election and secondly undermine a duly elected president. But first, as we told you last night, the Russia hoax -- it's dead. It is buried. It's nonexistent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, just hours after his nine and a half minute statement fueling Democrats' hopes once again of impeachment and more hysteria and breathless reporting, Robert Mueller has a ready backtrack, because last night, the Department of Justice and the special counsel, they actually had to release a joint statement to correct what Mueller said. In other words, Mueller needed to walk back everything he said yesterday in a dramatic fashion because he totally contradicted everything that he had been saying. Now, clarification -- well, it wasn't exactly that, but it said this. For the OLC, Office of Legal Counsel's opinion, that Mueller would have found the president obstructed justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, the statement entirely consistent with the attorney general's previous remarks in spite of the media mob's coverage. Remember, Barr said that Robert Mueller told him over and over again and numerous other people heard it and explaining just weeks ago, Mueller stated three times to us in that meeting that he emphatically was not saying that but for the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion, he would've found obstruction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, the Justice Department policy of whether you can or cannot indict a sitting president, was never an issue, period. What does this mean? As the Attorney General Barr said today, Mueller could have reached a conclusion as to whether there was any criminal activity, but he chose not to. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

That means the attorney general is the final arbiter. He's made up his mind, along with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the nonpartisan Office of Legal Counsel. They were all crystal-clear. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the media mob -- let me spell it out for you. Zero findings that the president obstructed justice. None. And, by the way, it has nothing to do with some Justice Department policy. Not because of a legal, constitutional restriction, but because there was no evidence. Now, make no mistake. This is no cover-up, no case against the president, no collusion, no underlying crime, no intent, no obstruction. In other words, the opposite of Hillary. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, of course, the radical, extreme, socialist Democrats, the rage Trump media mob, though they refused to focus in on the truth on this major issue. Ask yourself this, why didn't the media mob report with the same intensity, the release of the clarifying remarks of Robert Mueller after he botched it yesterday morning? Why didn't they put the same passion in it as they did the night-and-a-half minutes of Robert Mueller? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's another question. Why are they so lazy, so predicable, so partisan, why are they fake news? Why do they feign moral outrage and then purposely fail to tell their viewers, as little as they are, the truth? How did they become so partisan? How did they become so political, so corrupt, that they refuse simple questions and inform their viewers? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That clarification of Mueller was massive. The correction was massive. So why do they choose to continue to peddle another round of lives and conspiracy theories and advance their hoax yet again? Why did they choose to act as partisan hacks instead of serious journalists? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, 99.9 percent of newsrooms in America, they all got it wrong. It was the talk show hosts, people like us, yes, we do straight news, we do investigative reports, we do opinion, but we're honest about it, and even sports and culture. They say they are objective. They are anything but. But why are they choosing to put fake news narratives over the facts that after two plus years of lying and choosing to relentlessly smear, slander, besmirch anybody who dares to question their lack of ethics and now objectivity? Look at this tonight. \"The New York Times\"? They are now scared, taking notice, and they are realizing, uh-oh, they've been duped by the conspiracy TV media mob. Look at this new report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } \"New York Times\" is warning editors and reporters against appearing on primetime shows on the fake news CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, why would the \"New York Times\", you know, not go on their favorite programs, who refused to ask tough questions to begin with, like, did Robert Mueller forget his previous statements in yesterday's remarks, or did he intentionally muddied the waters to fuel the Democrats' unrelenting impeachment rage psychosis? Now, the president is standing strong, not letting himself be a punching bag, taking direct aim at the former special counsel as he should, and his partisan witch hunt. Let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He had already been in that position for 12 years, I told him no back. The next day, he was named special counsel, a total conflict of interest. The president is right. But here's the big take away of all of this: Robert Mueller, I'm telling you, scared to death to testify. Why? Because you have to answer real tough questions from people like Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Mark Meadows, Congressman Devin Nunes, and others. By the way, Devin Nunes will be here in just moments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He would be afraid to answer questions like this to Mueller, when did you know there was no collusion? And, by the way, if you had all this time to investigate FARA violations, and taxi medallions, and loan applications, and decades-old tax returns, how did you have no time to investigate the origins of Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier that was used to commit a premeditated fraud on the FISA court, undermine a duly elected president after an attempt to steal an election? Oh, and, of course, disseminate the Russian lies to the American people and then spy on the Trump campaign, which as \"The New York Times\" reported, that dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the very beginning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, Mr. Mueller, why did you hire a team of partisan Democrats? Not a single Republican -- you couldn't find one? No one? Why would you ever hire a guy, your pit bull, by the name of Andrew Weissmann, a guy who has a horrific history of abuse of power? Remember, Sidney Powell's book, \"Licensed to Lie,\" withholding exculpatory evidence. Weissmann was at the Hillary Clinton's election night party, that never happened. Why would you hire the Clinton Foundation attorney Jeannie Rhee in a case like this? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, Mueller had a wide mandate. How did he in good faith ignore the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern political history which, by the way, had to do with the Russian lies and their attempt to steal an election in 2016? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, now, Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton, he is fighting back in a huge way. Tonight, he is calling for action on Mueller's attack on the rule of law for turning it on its head and abandoning long-held prosecutorial norms. And, by the way, don't forget, about his cozy relationship with the super patriot James Comey. Didn't like smelly walnut shoppers that like Trump like us. Of course, the hate Trump Democrats, they don't seem to care. They're still relying on the same lies, the same smearing, the same besmirchment. It happens every single second of every single minute of every single hour of every single day. Why? Because they're on a mission. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They want to take this president down at all cost. It doesn't matter how great of a job he's doing. It wouldn't matter if he cured cancer. To make every single waking moment a public trial against the president. The president has not only been successful, but under the worst conditions that any president has ever had to start their presidency under, regardless of facts, truth, reality. People who have no agenda to make us more safe, more prosperous, more secure. Has any Democrat talked about that recently? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They have no plans for America's future, for our kids, our grandkids.

They spend their time incoherently rambling about how much they hate the president and the New Green Deal that will eliminate, let's see, the combustion engine, oil and gas, cows and airplanes. Gee, can't wait. And everything else will be free. Their collusion hoax is dead. It is finished, in spite of all the noise you hear, it's done. Four separate investigations, four, and all of them found -- the FBI nine-month investigation, House intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, and the Mueller report, four of them, no conspiracy collusion. And we now know from Mr. Mueller's retraction, absolutely no consideration of the Department of Justice policy as it relates to whether you can or cannot indict a sitting president.

And remember, there's so much more evidence that we haven't seen yet, so much more information. So, they basically violated the law. There was malfeasance within the FBI.

This is not being framed as a trade battle, but rather an immigration battle, and the advisory says if Mexico does not act fast, the tariffs will continue to rise until they hit 25% on October 1. Some critics believe this could undermine the passage of U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. The move comes a day after more than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by border patrol agents near El Paso. That's the largest single apprehension of migrants ever. The group includes people from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Border stations are already overwhelmed with the influx of migrant families, and border patrol agents cannot patrol the border because they are feeding and caring for those families.",

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker, great show. Good to see you. And welcome to “Hannity.” Buckle up, we start with a Fox News alert tonight. The president is now taking major action to secure our southern border, just moments ago, announcing a brand-new tariff on Mexico, pressing this country now to stem the flow of migrants that are overwhelming our entire immigration system. We'll have a lot more later in the program. First though tonight, the deep state is in a complete panic mode. The walls are closing in. We are now only days away as we've been told by the attorney general from the release of major documents exposing the corruption at the highest levels of our government. Now, remember, the attorney general said that he expects the Inspector General Horowitz to report on FISA abuse any day. And then, of course, we have the other four devastating buckets that we keep talking about, exposing what is the real election scandal, to one robbing election and secondly undermine a duly elected president. But first, as we told you last night, the Russia hoax -- it's dead. It is buried. It's nonexistent. And, by the way, just hours after his nine and a half minute statement fueling Democrats' hopes once again of impeachment and more hysteria and breathless reporting, Robert Mueller has a ready backtrack, because last night, the Department of Justice and the special counsel, they actually had to release a joint statement to correct what Mueller said. In other words, Mueller needed to walk back everything he said yesterday in a dramatic fashion because he totally contradicted everything that he had been saying. Now, clarification -- well, it wasn't exactly that, but it said this. For the OLC, Office of Legal Counsel's opinion, that Mueller would have found the president obstructed justice. Well, the statement entirely consistent with the attorney general's previous remarks in spite of the media mob's coverage. Remember, Barr said that Robert Mueller told him over and over again and numerous other people heard it and explaining just weeks ago, Mueller stated three times to us in that meeting that he emphatically was not saying that but for the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion, he would've found obstruction. In other words, the Justice Department policy of whether you can or cannot indict a sitting president, was never an issue, period. What does this mean? As the Attorney General Barr said today, Mueller could have reached a conclusion as to whether there was any criminal activity, but he chose not to. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Right. He could've reached a conclusion, the opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could have reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity. But he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained. And I'm not going to, you know, argue about those reasons. But when he didn't make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as the heads of the department to reach that decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So, the attorney general, and, by the way, that's because Democrats like Jerry Nadler wanted to get rid of the old independent counsel statute. That means the attorney general is the final arbiter. He's made up his mind, along with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the nonpartisan Office of Legal Counsel. They were all crystal-clear. But the media mob -- let me spell it out for you. Zero findings that the president obstructed justice. None. And, by the way, it has nothing to do with some Justice Department policy. Not because of a legal, constitutional restriction, but because there was no evidence. Now, make no mistake. This is no cover-up, no case against the president, no collusion, no underlying crime, no intent, no obstruction. In other words, the opposite of Hillary. But, of course, the radical, extreme, socialist Democrats, the rage Trump media mob, though they refused to focus in on the truth on this major issue. Ask yourself this, why didn't the media mob report with the same intensity, the release of the clarifying remarks of Robert Mueller after he botched it yesterday morning? Why didn't they put the same passion in it as they did the night-and-a-half minutes of Robert Mueller? Here's another question. Why are they so lazy, so predicable, so partisan, why are they fake news? Why do they feign moral outrage and then purposely fail to tell their viewers, as little as they are, the truth? How did they become so partisan? How did they become so political, so corrupt, that they refuse simple questions and inform their viewers? That clarification of Mueller was massive. The correction was massive. So why do they choose to continue to peddle another round of lives and conspiracy theories and advance their hoax yet again? Why did they choose to act as partisan hacks instead of serious journalists? By the way, 99.9 percent of newsrooms in America, they all got it wrong. It was the talk show hosts, people like us, yes, we do straight news, we do investigative reports, we do opinion, but we're honest about it, and even sports and culture. They say they are objective. They are anything but. But why are they choosing to put fake news narratives over the facts that after two plus years of lying and choosing to relentlessly smear, slander, besmirch anybody who dares to question their lack of ethics and now objectivity? Look at this tonight. \"The New York Times\"? They are now scared, taking notice, and they are realizing, uh-oh, they've been duped by the conspiracy TV media mob. Look at this new report. \"New York Times\" is warning editors and reporters against appearing on primetime shows on the fake news CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC. Now, why would the \"New York Times\", you know, not go on their favorite programs, who refused to ask tough questions to begin with, like, did Robert Mueller forget his previous statements in yesterday's remarks, or did he intentionally muddied the waters to fuel the Democrats' unrelenting impeachment rage psychosis? Now, the president is standing strong, not letting himself be a punching bag, taking direct aim at the former special counsel as he should, and his partisan witch hunt. Let's take a look."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "The president is right. But here's the big take away of all of this",
      "utterance": "Robert Mueller, I'm telling you, scared to death to testify. Why? Because you have to answer real tough questions from people like Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Mark Meadows, Congressman Devin Nunes, and others. By the way, Devin Nunes will be here in just moments. He would be afraid to answer questions like this to Mueller, when did you know there was no collusion? And, by the way, if you had all this time to investigate FARA violations, and taxi medallions, and loan applications, and decades-old tax returns, how did you have no time to investigate the origins of Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier that was used to commit a premeditated fraud on the FISA court, undermine a duly elected president after an attempt to steal an election? Oh, and, of course, disseminate the Russian lies to the American people and then spy on the Trump campaign, which as \"The New York Times\" reported, that dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the very beginning. And, by the way, Mr. Mueller, why did you hire a team of partisan Democrats? Not a single Republican -- you couldn't find one? No one? Why would you ever hire a guy, your pit bull, by the name of Andrew Weissmann, a guy who has a horrific history of abuse of power? Remember, Sidney Powell's book, \"Licensed to Lie,\" withholding exculpatory evidence. Weissmann was at the Hillary Clinton's election night party, that never happened. Why would you hire the Clinton Foundation attorney Jeannie Rhee in a case like this? Remember, Mueller had a wide mandate. How did he in good faith ignore the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern political history which, by the way, had to do with the Russian lies and their attempt to steal an election in 2016? Well, now, Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton, he is fighting back in a huge way. Tonight, he is calling for action on Mueller's attack on the rule of law for turning it on its head and abandoning long-held prosecutorial norms. And, by the way, don't forget, about his cozy relationship with the super patriot James Comey. Didn't like smelly walnut shoppers that like Trump like us. Of course, the hate Trump Democrats, they don't seem to care. They're still relying on the same lies, the same smearing, the same besmirchment. It happens every single second of every single minute of every single hour of every single day. Why? Because they're on a mission. They want to take this president down at all cost. It doesn't matter how great of a job he's doing. It wouldn't matter if he cured cancer. To make every single waking moment a public trial against the president. The president has not only been successful, but under the worst conditions that any president has ever had to start their presidency under, regardless of facts, truth, reality. People who have no agenda to make us more safe, more prosperous, more secure. Has any Democrat talked about that recently? They have no plans for America's future, for our kids, our grandkids. They have no plan to grow the economy, create jobs, make us energy independent. No plans to solve the crisis at our border. No plans to make a stronger abroad. And you've got this pathetically weak field of 2020 radicals. They spend their time incoherently rambling about how much they hate the president and the New Green Deal that will eliminate, let's see, the combustion engine, oil and gas, cows and airplanes. Gee, can't wait. And everything else will be free. Their collusion hoax is dead. It is finished, in spite of all the noise you hear, it's done. Four separate investigations, four, and all of them found -- the FBI nine-month investigation, House intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, and the Mueller report, four of them, no conspiracy collusion. And we now know from Mr. Mueller's retraction, absolutely no consideration of the Department of Justice policy as it relates to whether you can or cannot indict a sitting president. Here with reaction, the Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton and FOX News contributor Sara Carter. Tom, we begin with you. Tell us what you are now looking for?"

And he took this approach that he may have committed a crime, I'm not sure. But I can't prove he's innocent, which turns the rule of law on his head, as you know. People like President Trump are presumed innocent and to suggest otherwise from the podium of the Justice Department is a wild abuse of power. That's the Alice of Wonderland approach to justice. Verdict first -- sentence first, verdict later. And he wants to sentence into impeachment? And this is inappropriate for the Justice Department to be doing, certainly an official of the Justice Department to be doing. And there needs to be an ethics investigation and what went on with that statement and, frankly, and ethics audit of the entire Mueller operation, because as you laid out, there are serious concerns about the way Mueller operated that team there and what they did in terms of the early morning raids --"

They absolutely know that President Trump did not commit a conspiracy, there was no obstruction. But they have to focus on that. They have to push everything in that direction because now the attorney general and the Department of Justice have a magnifying glass on all of these former Obama officials who basically violated the law from what we can see based on the evidence that's out there already, evidence that we've already seen. And remember, there's so much more evidence that we haven't seen yet, so much more information. So, they basically violated the law. There was malfeasance within the FBI. You have James Comey, John Brennan, Clapper, McCabe, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, others that were involved, and you have the group of bureaucrats. Remember this -- they are the ones that are done. They are no longer in their positions of power. But you have people that worked for them, people that were part of their group, that are still trying to protect them. And that's exactly what Mueller is doing. When Mueller went out and gave that nine-and-a-half minute rambling speech to kind of rally up the Democrats, he did that on purpose, because they are now fighting for their lives. They are fighting to stay afloat, because they know that they could be charged."

We know that because the lead investigator said so on text messages. He was so blatantly dishonest yesterday that he says, well, the Office of Legal Counsel says that you can't indict a sitting president. Well, he should have been gone after day two. He has no Russians, except for the Fusion and Clinton Russians, and possibly the dirty cop, the FBI's Russians, those are the only Russians that he has, to show connections to the Trump campaign. Clearly, the Clinton operation is heavily working with Russians or Russian disinformation. He didn't take time to look into any of that.

Are you telling that in August, these guys, they're sitting there looking at this very salacious and unverified information and not one of them sits there and says, where does this come from, Bruce Ohr? Where did this come from? Oh, my wife is doing it. My wife is working for Fusion GPS, that's working for the Democrats and Clinton campaign. That was a whole thing. It's laughable, but it's so serious that you have to trouble -- I mean, you want to laugh. But at the same time, you just hope that justice is actually served for these criminals."

We know that Bruce Ohr behind closed doors testified -- yes, he warned everybody that Hillary paid for it, Steele hates Trump. And, by the way, it's unverified. That was in August of 2016. Ten days before, a State Department official Kathleen Kavalec also warned them before Comey signed off on the first FISA application, it says verified but it's an unverifiable document, because Steele doesn't stand by his own words. Are those people going to be held accountable? Do you see any way they get out of what I would think is an indictment to commit fraud in a FISA court, an indictment to literally rig an investigation in their favorite candidate Hillary Clinton, and then to use Russian lies to take down a duly elected president? Can they get away with that?"

Breaking right now, the Trump administration just announced, beginning June 10, the U.S. will impose a 5% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, and the tariffs won't be removed until the Mexican government takes dramatic action to reduce or eliminate illegal immigrants crossing the border. This is not being framed as a trade battle, but rather an immigration battle, and the advisory says if Mexico does not act fast, the tariffs will continue to rise until they hit 25% on October 1. Some critics believe this could undermine the passage of U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. The move comes a day after more than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by border patrol agents near El Paso. That's the largest single apprehension of migrants ever. The group includes people from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Border stations are already overwhelmed with the influx of migrant families, and border patrol agents cannot patrol the border because they are feeding and caring for those families."

Mexico, up until fairly recently, had the most draconian laws about illegal immigrants from Central America. You either went to jail or they deported you. There was no in-between.

      "utterance": "Joining us with reaction, Fox News Contributor Emily Compagno and Former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Good to see you both. Pam, it's interesting, so when you go to San Francisco, a mile from the beautiful walled gated community of Nancy Pelosi and a mile on the other district to her office, you have people - well feces all over the street, needles everywhere, homelessness everywhere. And why wouldn't she, a multi-multi- multimillionaire, ask her millionaire friends to maybe build a shelter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Well, because she's behind her gated community, that she's against for our country, but behind her gated community. So no, Sean, it's going to hurt kids, kids are going to get hurt. She has to know that with hypodermic needles, with the drug issues, with the homelessness."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "What about that kid who slid into second base and slid into a needle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's unreal. And these poor people have mental health issues called dual diagnosis, and they take drugs to mask the symptoms. They need mental health counseling, they need drug treatment. She and all her rich friends can help build shelters, instead of putting bathrooms there to try to keep the feces off the streets. That makes no sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "How about a shelter that has bathroom, showers, two meals a day and maybe some mental health counseling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "A true shelter, exactly. They need drug treatment, they need mental health. And the city of Oregon, the Mayor gave $32 million in his budget towards it, well that's where it needs to go for, not just setting up bathrooms on the street where kids can - you know people with mental health issues could be dangerous to children."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And Emily, I always say this, liberals are very generous with our money. But when it comes to their own money, it's a mile away from Nancy Pelosi's house and office in the other direction, and it's always happening in these big cities, where is the compassion they lecture us about when they want every penny we make?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And the irony is that the war over this competing compassionate approach to the homelessness problem means that it's paralyzing these cities, right? It's wasting our tax dollars. And for example, Seattle spends $100,000 for each of its 12,000 homeless. As Pam just stated, the city of Portland is now allocating $32 million up from $15 million two years ago, but to what end. Here for example the police are discouraged from making arrests with any type of homeless related crimes. Obviously, the DA doesn't prosecute. But when a local journalist, a self designated socialist, by the way, brought up mental health institutionalization, mental health facilities, he was called a Nazi by a Seattle City Council member. So it's impossible to have any type of reasonable approach and the sufferers are not only those homeless, 80% of whom are drug addicted and mentally ill, but the constituents whose tax dollars are being absolutely wasted and who are unable to use their parks."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let's get your legal thoughts on what we now see happening with Robert Mueller yesterday and then the clarification because he outright lied in the nine and a half minutes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "I'm so glad you asked me that. There was no collusion, there was no crime. Had there been, he would've put it in his report. You know that, I know that, the President knows that, Rudy Giuliani knows that, and the American people know that. And for him to come out and say that at this point was really politicizing everything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Alright, good to see you. Thank you for being with us. Emily, thank you as always. When we come back, more “Hannity” right after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, we are literally now days away, because the Attorney General Barr said that the Inspector General any day now will be in fact releasing the investigation to FISA abuse. If we got to the truth, it'll be devastating. We also have the other four or five buckets that we've been talking about. We must hold these people accountable. They rigged an investigation, tried to rig an election, and try to overturn an election. And we'll get to the bottom of it. We'll never be the media mob. Thank you for being with us.
