The Baltimore Democratic machine has failed their city. After decades of doing what big city Dems do so well, running their cities into the ground. Baltimore is crime-ridden, drug-ridden, rodent-ridden, but now, the media really cares about Baltimore. Why? Because Trump tweeted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, what else is our racist president up to? Well, he's about to execute a white supremacist. He's trying to free a black rapper from a foreign jail. He's preceding over historic levels of low unemployment among minorities. He's pushing prison reform that directly benefits families of black men. He calls on absent leaders of a city where minorities are the main victims of crime and blight Wow.

Of course, what's racist is that kind of pandering. Was Trump's attack on Bill de Blasio, just days ago, also racist? As always, Trump's hits everyone, 600 targets on twitter alone. Still, the media claims he targets only minorities. I guess that makes the BBC racist, too. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The Baltimore Democratic machine has failed their city. After decades of doing what big city Dems do so well, running their cities into the ground. Baltimore is crime-ridden, drug-ridden, rodent-ridden, but now, the media really cares about Baltimore. Why? Because Trump tweeted. Meanwhile, what else is our racist president up to? Well, he's about to execute a white supremacist. He's trying to free a black rapper from a foreign jail. He's preceding over historic levels of low unemployment among minorities. He's pushing prison reform that directly benefits families of black men. He calls on absent leaders of a city where minorities are the main victims of crime and blight Wow. Trump really sucks as a bigot. But the press sees any criticism of a politician of color as racist. Of course, what's racist is that kind of pandering. Was Trump's attack on Bill de Blasio, just days ago, also racist? As always, Trump's hits everyone, 600 targets on twitter alone. Still, the media claims he targets only minorities. I guess that makes the BBC racist, too."

We know how to solve this problem. To pick up on what you're saying, we have heroes here. We will succeed. But when he talks about areas that are hard hit in urban America, especially Black urban America because I think it's important to note that Elijah Cummings comes from Maryland, which is I think one of the richest states in the union, and several parts of his district are way over the national average in income. Not only that, I think Columbia and Maryland is ranked at the safest place. So we're talking about inner city Baltimore, a section of his district.

How about illegal immigration? Undercutting the wages of black Americans, undercutting their labor or trade. Because you know what, Juan? One of the major issues facing Baltimore is the industrialization. They lost the steel. They lost the ship building. They lost the auto manufacturing. They lost all of that. And what is Trump come along and proposing? Hey, maybe you guys could get together and sign and pass the USMCA. Maybe a better trade deal with Mexico and Canada. But they have sat on the sidelines, the Democrats, and done nothing that would have helped all of these issues in Baltimore. Instead, they've used the race card to deflect attention from their failures when all of these things, the high crime, the rodents, the depopulation, all of those things have happened on their watch.

You don't have to listen to Donald Trump about what's going on there. She interviewed residents who were there about the problems that they've been dumping for years and years. And Bernie Sanders in 2015 calls it a third world country and doesn't get the same reaction. And the question about moving forward and how to change this, you know, get in the weeds of the wonkiness of D.C., but HUD led by Ben Carson is actually rewriting the rules right now about zoning and federal funding and deregulation so that a lot of these big cities which has sunken into these pits of crime and infestation of rodents and horrible living conditions, Juan, to reduce some of that stuff and actually build a better life for the people who are victim of the Democratic machine for 50 years."

PAVLICH: I don't know exactly what happened, but I do know is that the Italian police also have a track record of not doing things on par and framing people into murderers, especially Americans. So, I'm very skeptical of all of the facts in this case and I'm going to wait for more. But it certainly gives you a better appreciation for the American justice system, innocent until proven guilty. You have the right to remain silent. They tried to coax a confession out of these two and then they were saying, they know - they accuse each other of doing it. They took one back. And also, you know having an attorney. I mean they're getting blindfolded and having to answer questions under interrogation at the foreign police force without an attorney.
