They're moving to goalposts again, just as with 14 days to slow the spread, just as with 100 days of mask wearing. There is always a catch, right? The good news always comes with a big fat asterisk. So if you got vaccinated, let's say last month, and then you want to fly with your kids across country to see your parents you haven't seen in a year plus, not only do you need to be masked for five plus hours, but so do your two-year-old and your teenager. They need to be masked as well. In other words, the COVID bullies do not think you should get any freedoms back unless you check every one of their boxes. And by the way, corporate America, they're also ganging up on Americans who refuse to comply. Among those still mandating masks despite the vaccines and the ineffectiveness of cloth masks are these companies. Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Starbucks, and many others will join our favorite blue state tyrants to require vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike to continue wearing those filthy dreaded masks you hang on your gearshift and your car. Now, California's Newsom is still forcing his residents to wear them outside. That's how bad it is their. Governor Cuomo in New York says his office is reviewing the new CDC guidelines. I guess they're that complicated, which means in New York citizens are probably going to have to wait until next - now, the next sexual harassment allegation to be free of masks. Then Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey is just rejecting the guidance altogether tweeting, \"We've come much too far to backslide now. So we're keeping our indoor mask mandate in place in public settings\", and talk an opening for the New Jersey GOP gubernatorial candidate. What has been done to Americans by these people is disgraceful. Neither the science nor the common sense that we all should have by now have ever supported the Democrats COVID controls. The fact is that every issue from social distancing to masks to school closures, early treatments, \"Ingraham Angle\" viewers have received better and more accurate information than if you listen to any government COVID briefing.",

I mean, we were beating out news agencies that had a lot more manpower, a lot more resources than either the Daily Caller or somehow even any guys. And so that's why we appreciate Fox News allowing us to showcase our reporting, because we were often on the front lines. The Kyle Rittenhouse shooting is a prime example where it was literally the five of us, and there was no major news outlets at that time. And so in that example, we wouldn't have much harder picture of what went on if it wasn't for our cameras. And so, as opposed to why aren't they there?

And so it's left to them in order to do it. So then The Intercept steps in for two reasons. Number one, Antifa regularly attacks journalists physically. They assault them. I formed a press freedom group with Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg, and several other people, and we track it all the time. Antifa constantly attacks violently, journalists who cover their riots. This was an attempt to put Jorge and Julio, in particular, their faces out there to incite an encouraging Antifa to attack them so that they can no longer do their jobs safely. The other aspect of it, Laura, is that digital outlets, these millennial digital liberal outlets, like The Intercept, like BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, so many of them, they think that if you're a conservative, you're not really a journalist. They think that you're part of this crypto-fascist movement, that you're the enemy. And so they don't regard Julio and Jorge as journalists even though they're doing way better journalism than The Intercept on these issues. They see them as the enemy, which is why they did this kind of article dragging their faces into the light in order to endanger them.",

He is angry that people like Julio and Jorge have the courage to actually go on the ground and do risky journalism, something that most people at \"The Intercept\" and other digital outlets like it, millennials, would never do. They think mean tweets are traumatizing, must less putting yourself in risky situations. So I do think it's very important to understand what is going on here, which is that these outlets look at themselves as operatives on behalf of this movements. You can think that these movements, Black Lives Matter or whatever, have a just cause, but your job as a journalist is to inform the public of the damage that's left.

So if you got vaccinated, let's say last month, and then you want to fly with your kids across country to see your parents you haven't seen in a year plus, not only do you need to be masked for five plus hours, but so do your two-year-old and your teenager. They need to be masked as well. In other words, the COVID bullies do not think you should get any freedoms back unless you check every one of their boxes. And by the way, corporate America, they're also ganging up on Americans who refuse to comply. Among those still mandating masks despite the vaccines and the ineffectiveness of cloth masks are these companies. Target, Walmart, Home Depot, Starbucks, and many others will join our favorite blue state tyrants to require vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike to continue wearing those filthy dreaded masks you hang on your gearshift and your car. Now, California's Newsom is still forcing his residents to wear them outside. That's how bad it is their. Governor Cuomo in New York says his office is reviewing the new CDC guidelines. I guess they're that complicated, which means in New York citizens are probably going to have to wait until next - now, the next sexual harassment allegation to be free of masks. Then Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey is just rejecting the guidance altogether tweeting, \"We've come much too far to backslide now. So we're keeping our indoor mask mandate in place in public settings\", and talk an opening for the New Jersey GOP gubernatorial candidate. What has been done to Americans by these people is disgraceful. Neither the science nor the common sense that we all should have by now have ever supported the Democrats COVID controls. The fact is that every issue from social distancing to masks to school closures, early treatments, \"Ingraham Angle\" viewers have received better and more accurate information than if you listen to any government COVID briefing."

That's about 100 million people. You're going to tell 100 million people, you've got to get vaccinated again, even though you've had it. And if you don't, we're not going to let you travel. Look, I travel as part of my constitutional duties. I've had the disease. I don't plan on getting vaccinated until they show me evidence that people who have had the disease are getting it in large numbers and dying and that it's a serious illness that I might get vaccinated.

And so, I was actually kind of surprised something didn't happen like this sooner in terms of smearing our work and look, I stand by it. I have no regrets. And it's not our fault that the most of the people that were rioting, either last year, or even a little bit into this year, were of those types of groups. And so I'm going to continue covering riots. And personally, I don't care who it is. I just have a passion for doing it and I'm going to continue to do it."

      "speaker": "JORGE VENTURA, DAILY CALLER FIELD REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, the first rule of journalism is to hold the powerful accountable and tell stories that are being untold. And when this unrest happened in Philadelphia and the mass looting did occur, we just did our jobs as reporter and just reported the news. So it seems like now just reporting the news is a crime and this hit piece had no facts. They didn't have the decency to reach out to any of us for comment. And what's not talked about enough is in these riots and the civil unrest, the communities that are most affected are just working class, regular Americans and black and brown communities. These rights are not happening in Malibu and Calabasas, these are happening in areas where it's working class regular Americans, and no one was telling these stories. And it took a lot of courage from all of us to be on the ground. It takes a lot of risk. And the whole piece, there was no facts, like I said, they didn't even reach out for comment. Not even decency for that."

But this is - I've got to say, this is just, to me, an example of how low and how - it's unimportant. The so- called media really is today. I mean, where are they? Why aren't they covering this? I mean, they're all covering January 6, and as if it's happening every day. But, Julio, why, why don't they ever show up at these events? Where are they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSAS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's kind of the question, right? I mean, we became kind of a riot squad, because we became friends, because we were always going to these locations and it's also a safety in numbers aspect, because obviously these are very hostile situations that we find ourselves in. So it's nice to have someone that's close by that you know and can trust. And so, yes, and it felt to like the five or six of us to cover the whole country, when we were going through this very chaotic time. I mean, we were beating out news agencies that had a lot more manpower, a lot more resources than either the Daily Caller or somehow even any guys. And so that's why we appreciate Fox News allowing us to showcase our reporting, because we were often on the front lines. The Kyle Rittenhouse shooting is a prime example where it was literally the five of us, and there was no major news outlets at that time. And so in that example, we wouldn't have much harder picture of what went on if it wasn't for our cameras. And so, as opposed to why aren't they there? Well, clearly, because they have a narrative of that, \"Oh, BLM (inaudible)\". But they did, and so that was really unfortunate that it had to fall to the five or six or seven of us."

And I thought it was important to bring him on tonight to see what he thinks of his former publication. What it's become? Specifically, targeting these five individuals. Glenn, there are a lot of deficiencies, (inaudible) misreporting in this piece. But there's something more worrisome here. And that's why they chose to publish this. Is this an attempt to chill independent reporting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENN GREENWALD, CO-FOUNDER, THE INTERCEPT",
      "utterance": "I think it's two things. So first of all, when I was at The Intercept, I used to and still do follow both of their reporting, because there's very little of it, as they said, about Antifa and Black Lives Matters and the rioting and damage they do, because big media outlets are petrified to report on it because they'll be accused by their own journalists of being racist, or fascist, or sympathizers to white nationalism. And so it's left to them in order to do it. So then The Intercept steps in for two reasons. Number one, Antifa regularly attacks journalists physically. They assault them. I formed a press freedom group with Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg, and several other people, and we track it all the time. Antifa constantly attacks violently, journalists who cover their riots. This was an attempt to put Jorge and Julio, in particular, their faces out there to incite an encouraging Antifa to attack them so that they can no longer do their jobs safely. The other aspect of it, Laura, is that digital outlets, these millennial digital liberal outlets, like The Intercept, like BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, so many of them, they think that if you're a conservative, you're not really a journalist. They think that you're part of this crypto-fascist movement, that you're the enemy. And so they don't regard Julio and Jorge as journalists even though they're doing way better journalism than The Intercept on these issues. They see them as the enemy, which is why they did this kind of article dragging their faces into the light in order to endanger them."

      "utterance": "While the riot squad video journalists are still mostly unknown to people who are not addicted to Fox News, some of their faces have become familiar to left-wing activists. That's also prompted hundreds of supporters of the racial justice movement to livestream protests themselves, creating a real-time record of events. That can be used to counter distortions coming from the riot."

    {
      "speaker": "GLENN GREENWALD, PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST",
      "utterance": "That guy was the point of \"The Intercept\" vide. That guy Robert Mackey, he says in the video, it's the most hilarious but also repellent thing, I have covered the Arab spring and unrest in Iran. You know how he covered it? By sitting on his couch and live blogging it and aggregating tweets. He is not a journalist at all. He is angry that people like Julio and Jorge have the courage to actually go on the ground and do risky journalism, something that most people at \"The Intercept\" and other digital outlets like it, millennials, would never do. They think mean tweets are traumatizing, must less putting yourself in risky situations. So I do think it's very important to understand what is going on here, which is that these outlets look at themselves as operatives on behalf of this movements. You can think that these movements, Black Lives Matter or whatever, have a just cause, but your job as a journalist is to inform the public of the damage that's left. But just like Jorge said, the damage is happening in working class and minority neighborhoods, not in the rich white liberal neighborhood in Brooklyn, in San Francisco and Los Angeles where these journalists live, and therefore they just don't care, and they don't want it reported."

We really don't need to be wearing masks much anymore, but when you're outside you should wear a mask. And I was watching, what did you just say? You just contradicted yourself. You're word salading.
