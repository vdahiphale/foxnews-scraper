Finally, I want to address the bombshell that everybody is talking about, the lockdown, the tighter restrictions on the transcript. Why would they do that? Do you think it may be because two years ago people were leaking transcripts from the leader's conversations with Mexico and Australia, so they're putting this stuff in a separate code word system because it was being leaked.

And you're going to hear, also, requests for him to recuse himself from not only the Ukraine investigation but also the spy gate investigation. This is what this is all about. This is sick.

I talked to a couple of people today who deal with whistleblower complaints from the side of receiving complaints and putting on protections for people who issue these claims. And they said that it's highly unusual that a claim with second or third hand knowledge would ever be considered something that was legitimate because, specifically, the law protects people with first-hand knowledge. When you look at the complaint, there are multiple references to a number of White House officials who told me X. Well, if that is the case, and if it's so egregious that it requires executive privilege to be waived, and for the inspector general and the FBI to get involved, those White House officials have the protections to present this information firsthand. And the other big thing is that was detailed today by the acting DNI chief is that Congress wouldn't have gotten the information that they have with the complaint being released if President Trump hadn't released the transcript of the call because it got rid of the classification and it got rid of the executive privilege. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so, the only reason why Congress got this is because the president was transparent in doing an unprecedented move and releasing this call. And that is why the rest of the country has been able to read this complaint. And, to what you said, it's not consistent with what the transcript says. There's a lot in the complaint that doesn't add up to what the conversation --",

This isn't new prohibition, the drug war, opioids. When you eliminate availability of the legal substance, people often move to the illegal market, the street where safety is never guaranteed. Users many who took up vaping to quit smoking could end up dying, thanks to decisions that run roughshod over data, because vaping is far less harmful than smoking.

So the media cite as evidence -- cite as evidence media, right? They cite Politico, I guess ABC, George Stephanopoulos. So this complaint is a mixture of hearsay, falsehoods, media clippings. It's basically the Steele dossier less peeing and more lying. But they realize that they couldn't beat the transcript because those facts go against their story. Finally, I want to address the bombshell that everybody is talking about, the lockdown, the tighter restrictions on the transcript. Why would they do that? Do you think it may be because two years ago people were leaking transcripts from the leader's conversations with Mexico and Australia, so they're putting this stuff in a separate code word system because it was being leaked. Doesn't that kind of make sense especially when Trump releases the transcript, why would you release something you were hiding? It wasn't about trying to hide something. It was about trying to protect something from being leaked. That is common sense. But when you're flooded with cognitive bias you can't see the sense. You can only see what you want to believe."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I read the complaint and it reads like a thriller novel, and it reads like it was professionally teed up by conspiracy inside the White House trying to destroy the president before the president destroyed them. Remember the context about this. Bill Barr, Durham, and these investigators are about to blow up the entire spy gate cabal. They're about to name names. And this whole thing is about to unravel. So, before they do, this is the intelligence community again striking back at Bill Barr and Donald Trump. This is warfare now. Because, if you read the complaint, this is stuff that's so detailed and so comprehensive and so sophisticated and coming from so many different sources at so many different levels, this has to be an organized cabal of people inside selling this guy the bill of goods so then he gives it to the Democrats because it reads like a thriller. This doesn't come out of thin air. And there's no guessing why Bill Barr is specifically named in this whistleblower complaint. And it's because they need to discredit him before this thing is released. And you're going to hear, also, requests for him to recuse himself from not only the Ukraine investigation but also the spy gate investigation. This is what this is all about. This is sick. And it's no coincidence that Adam Schiff is running this operation again. He's been totally humiliated. Remember, he was on a phone call trying to get naked pictures of Donald Trump in a prank phone call before that was exposed? The networks took this live all day, interrupted regular programming. Huge mistake. The thing had no energy. And, remember, this guy Adam Schiff was the one that said he had proof that there was Russia collusion. And he never produced it. Now, he's saying he has proof that there is a quid pro quo. He still has not produced it. So now he has to fabricate quotes to sell this thing to the American people because he can't sell it on the substance."

But, one thing I think that's really important to continue pointing out. I talked to a couple of people today who deal with whistleblower complaints from the side of receiving complaints and putting on protections for people who issue these claims. And they said that it's highly unusual that a claim with second or third hand knowledge would ever be considered something that was legitimate because, specifically, the law protects people with first-hand knowledge. When you look at the complaint, there are multiple references to a number of White House officials who told me X. Well, if that is the case, and if it's so egregious that it requires executive privilege to be waived, and for the inspector general and the FBI to get involved, those White House officials have the protections to present this information firsthand. And the other big thing is that was detailed today by the acting DNI chief is that Congress wouldn't have gotten the information that they have with the complaint being released if President Trump hadn't released the transcript of the call because it got rid of the classification and it got rid of the executive privilege. And so, the only reason why Congress got this is because the president was transparent in doing an unprecedented move and releasing this call. And that is why the rest of the country has been able to read this complaint. And, to what you said, it's not consistent with what the transcript says. There's a lot in the complaint that doesn't add up to what the conversation --"

But I think it's interesting to look at the double standard of what this means for moving forward. The president is trying to expose that the political elite in Washington, D.C. have a double standard when it comes to who gets to make the $50,000 a month and who doesn't depending on whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, whether you're establishment or grassroots.

Those were very moderate people and their constituents were saying, no, we do not want it. But that has possibly changed. You might see a little bit change possibly because of media attention, possibly because now Nancy Pelosi has said, we are for this. And those freshmen are saying actually our constituents want us to hold this President accountable. That is why the spin machine for both sides mean so much right now because no matter how this turns out, it's not going to end in the next day or two.

What are you going to run on in 2020? What are you going to say you did in this Congress? What you going to say? You might have impeached Trump.

If Trump is the worst individual alive, the most corrupt, depraved leader in history, why are you so desperate to use a flimsy phone call based on hearsay and gossip.

So, in response to the effects of an illegal product, they target the legal, which if copied by other businesses could push users to the bootleggers. This isn't new prohibition, the drug war, opioids. When you eliminate availability of the legal substance, people often move to the illegal market, the street where safety is never guaranteed. Users many who took up vaping to quit smoking could end up dying, thanks to decisions that run roughshod over data, because vaping is far less harmful than smoking. Smokers who switched to vaping improve their health. Why? Because it's not the nicotine that kills in combustible cigarettes. It's the tar.
