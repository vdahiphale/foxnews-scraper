Your last slot was with CBS \"60 Minutes,\" but you've been with a lot of media -- important media companies. You've reported out of Afghanistan. You've reported the Middle East including Egypt. You've reported about Benghazi. You've reported about a lot of the big issues of our time.

He said the other day, \"I'm terribly concerned that when you talk about the \"New York Times\" these days, when you talk about \"The Washington Post\" we're not talking about the \"New York Times\" of 50 years ago, we're not talking about \"The Washington Post\" of 50 years ago, we're talking about organizations that I believe have in fact decided as organizations that Donald Trump is bad for the United States, that we have things appearing on the front page of the \"New York Times\" right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago; analysis and commentary on the front page.\" He also said, \"This perception that the establishment press is out to get him (meaning the President) doesn't mean the great journalism does nothing, but the notion that most of us look upon Donald Trump as being an absolute fiasco and he's not mistaken in that perception and he's not mistaken when so many of the liberal media for example describe themselves as belonging to the resistance.

Because when it's just me, I'm easy to crush, right? But when it's myself and it's Ted Koppel and there was a former managing editor at the \"New York Times\" who came out and said the same thing, they've become the paper of record against Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so what you're seeing is a growing number of figures and this restores my faith in journalism because I know these people are there. I know I'm not a lone ranger. I know I'm not the only one who remembers what great independent journalism is supposed to look like. I know I'm not the only journalist who's watching in horror as opinion and pejorative language is passed off as fact, where anonymous sources are given complete cover to do political assassinations without any regard for the consequences of what they're doing, where journalists are walking hand- in-hand with propaganda groups and pushing forward narratives that are not based in fact, that are not based in honest journalism, that are nothing more, you know, than political targeting thinly disguised as journalism today. And you know the best part about all of this, Mark? There's one set of people who are not fooled by any of it. They lack the context very often.  They lack a lot of the information to know exactly the extent of how they're being deceived and manipulated, but they know in their guts and that's the audience. That's the viewers. That's the readers. That's all the people in the length and breadth of this country in whether they're Democrats or Republicans, who are lining up to have this conversation right now, who know that something is not right and that's why they're turning away from the news and that's why they're not watching. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's why they're frustrated and that's why there's so little trust and faith in the media these days and responsibility and accountability begins with us.",

Nobody is challenging them.  Nobody is holding them to account for what they're reporting. We all go sailing along thinking we're doing such amazing outstanding work. There was an incredible reporter who said this once, Gary Webb, if anyone has seen the movie \"To Kill the Messenger.\" He was the guy who broke the story about the CIA's involvement in crack cocaine on the streets of America and their involvement in funding rebels, right, and using drug money to do so. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, Gary Webb won the Pulitzer and then he was destroyed.

He lost everything and then he lost his life. So when you stay inside the bubble and inside the narrative that dominates the media industry, it's a safe place to be because nobody's coming after you. These propaganda groups and one in particular, Media Matters for America, they're targeting Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham morning to night. They have an army of people who are paid to do this. That's their job. Every day when they wake up, they're looking for a way to destroy these people.",

Just because you vote Democrat doesn't mean you can't be a great journalist. Fortunately, for all of us, there are principles of great journalism that exist outside of the politics. But what all of us have is we're human and so we have things. We're all predisposed to believe people we agree with and like, more so than we do with the people that we think you know are -- we don't agree with. And so you have fertile ground for this propaganda to take root, and then on top of that, you have a lot of laziness, you have a lot of armchair reporters who are just happy to pick up a phone to report whatever a source tells them because it's the White House or it's the FBI or it's someone where their butts are covered, right, no one is ever going to hold them to account if they report nonsense because they've got an official source for it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But now what's happened, what's changed -- because that was always there, right, what's changed today is that you now have a press corps that is working hand-in-hand with propaganda organizations with a political agenda, and so what Ted Koppel was saying, people are part of the resistance.  That's exactly what I was talking about when I said too many journalists today are political operatives now. They've forgotten how to be journalists. They've forgotten what we're supposed to be as journalists and they've become political operatives. They have a predetermined outcome for all of their reporting. They want the removal of this President. They don't think he should ever have been elected. They don't like anything about him. You know what it's called?  Resisting the normalization of Donald Trump, it's a Media Matters mission statement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's Media Matters for America who put this out to their donors and their funders and their supporters that they will resist the normalization of Donald Trump and that means you're not allowed to look at any policy of this administration and evaluate that policy on its merits, you're not allowed to balance your reporting. You're not -- you know people say to me, \"Well, this President doesn't help himself with his style,\" and I say, \"I'm sure that's true.\" I mean, you know he rubs everybody up the wrong way at some point or another. Style is not his strength. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But my question is, how much would his style matter if we spent 50 percent of the time talking about his style instead of 98 percent of the time? And what if we had 50 percent of the time actually looking at the policies of the administration and seeing what works and what doesn't? Would we care so much about his style then? Part of the mission statement for this propaganda movement is that Donald Trump will be known forever as the least popular President in America. So that is going to be what -- that's a predetermined outcome that they want, and what disappoints me and actually what really, I find extraordinarily concerning to use Ted Koppel's words, I'm very concerned by is the number of journalists who've taken a political position and you still expect and demand the legitimacy of being objective and independent and being open and balanced and fair. These are not people who are open-minded. Your minds have become closed and until we recognize that, we're going to continue sowing the seeds of our own death and destruction and by the way, these propaganda groups don't want an independent robust press.

They were known because there were so few media outlets and people who watch the \"Nightly News\" and so forth, but with the 24/7 news, it looks like almost a drama class in high school where people are fighting to get at the front of the line and in particular, who comes to mind is Jim Acosta. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } CNN, you have Presidents for press conferences and to me, freedom of the press is about the American people learning what's going on, asking tough questions holding powerful people accountable, but not giving speeches and being disruptive and undermining the entire process.

And what I'm surprised by is how much of the news on their website is about their anchors and their reporters and their analysts attacking and destroying anything that the White House says and does and that to me is symbolic of the problem, but there is something actually much more significant about what you're seeing happen with the White House Press Corps. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Donald Trump has shown everybody just with his Twitter account that he's changing the way the President communicates in the United States of America today, which is completely consistent with what everybody is doing, right?  In the digital age, with all of this technology, we're all changing how we communicate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Media organizations are doing it. Political leaders are doing it. The Ayatollah of Iran has a Twitter feed, okay? So why is Donald Trump not allowed to do that? Why is he not allowed to change how the White House operates in terms of its communications and the rules of the White House Press Corps and how these things happen? He is not allowed to be seen as an instrument of change. That's a propaganda talking point of the progressive political movement. He is not allowed to be normalized as a President, so whatever changes he makes have to be resisted by the resistance and then on top of that, if you look at one of the things that Media Matters for America, a propaganda group gloats about in all their publicity is that they prevented Breitbart from getting a White House press credential, right? They used their rules to stop the White House from allowing Breitbart to attend any press conferences and be part of the White House press corps.  Why? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So if you change the rules, then people like Media Matters -- these propaganda organizations of the left, they won't be able to use those rules to their advantage. They don't want you to change the rules. Number two, if you -- if they can't use the rules, then they can't stop people like Breitbart getting access and being part of the conversation in America, and that's what they don't want. They don't want alternative points of view. They most especially don't want conservative points of view. They don't want to empower websites like Breitbart or Drudge or anybody else and more importantly than that, they don't want anyone to have the ability to communicate their message directly. They want it to be filtered through this network of propaganda organizations that are dominated by one political ideology and deliver their message. So you know, all this stuff about Jim Acosta is masking something much more sinister and really threatening to me as a journalist because what it effectively means is that we don't want a democracy. We don't want freedom of thought and freedom of discussion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So you know what I say is, as a journalist today in America, we're not free. We can't for example do a story interviewing scientists about who dispute the science on climate change, right, because if you do that story, if you're really just interested in the science and you want to understand this better and you're trying to figure out what's true, what's not true and you're trying to understand it for yourself, that's now a political -- that's a no-no. That's the end of your career. You talk to scientists and see they'll tell you the same thing. You can't get a research grant if you want to look at some of the -- if you're going to question any of that science, so that means that we're not free. We don't have the freedom to do whatever story we want to do and investigate what we want to investigate. We live in a society where people are telling us it's okay to have that conversation.

We have the morally superior position. We have the moral authority to talk about this, so if you deviate from our position at all, you have no moral authority, i.e., you're a terrible person. And that to me is what -- there are lots of journalists who know in their hearts that that's not right and who want to stand up against that and who just want to do honest, independent, journalism and the great thing about this is that now with Ted Koppel coming out and saying what he said, that I'm hopeful that more journalists will stand up because, really, you know the best journalist at heart where anarchists, right?

I'm a free woman from a free country and a free press and I'm here to do my job and that's how I approached it. And you know what I found, a lot of respect for that. I found that the people I dealt with respected that they knew who I was and they knew why I was there and they knew that I approached every story I ever did with an open mind and an open heart and I didn't bring a whole bunch of preconceptions and they respected that. In fact, what I found is that it's in many ways, I've been much more disrespected here in this environment as a woman than I ever was over there.",

The last person to speak to Chris Stevens when Chris Stevens was under attack, a terrorist attack in his compound, he called Greg Hicks and Greg Hicks looked at the Defense Attache and said, \"Well,\" and he said, \"I'm sorry, Greg, the cavalry ain't incoming.\" And Greg Hicks said, \"I felt sick in the pit of my stomach because those of us who go out on the end of the line for our country, we believe our country has our back,\" and in that minute, in that moment, I knew they didn't.

That was an Al Qaeda terrorist attack that was extremely well-planned timed for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 and those things, the substance of our reporting is what the Obama administration and the progressive political movement and Hillary Clinton's propaganda force. That's what they wanted buried, because it didn't suit them politically to have the truth out about that. And so they picked the least important person in the story. They took two things he said and they cast it into doubt. It was called into question and then they made the story disappear. It was erased so now you can't -- all of that propaganda you read about it.

Your last slot was with CBS \"60 Minutes,\" but you've been with a lot of media -- important media companies. You've reported out of Afghanistan. You've reported the Middle East including Egypt. You've reported about Benghazi. You've reported about a lot of the big issues of our time. Recently, at least for a lot of us, you did an interview with a gentleman by the name of Mike Ritland, a former Navy SEAL. You did a podcast and you gave your opinion of the media. I want to read you something that Ted Koppel recently said, and see if you agree with it or want to add to it or subtract from it. He said the other day, \"I'm terribly concerned that when you talk about the \"New York Times\" these days, when you talk about \"The Washington Post\" we're not talking about the \"New York Times\" of 50 years ago, we're not talking about \"The Washington Post\" of 50 years ago, we're talking about organizations that I believe have in fact decided as organizations that Donald Trump is bad for the United States, that we have things appearing on the front page of the \"New York Times\" right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago; analysis and commentary on the front page.\" He also said, \"This perception that the establishment press is out to get him (meaning the President) doesn't mean the great journalism does nothing, but the notion that most of us look upon Donald Trump as being an absolute fiasco and he's not mistaken in that perception and he's not mistaken when so many of the liberal media for example describe themselves as belonging to the resistance. What does that mean?\" What does that mean? Have you experienced this, too?"

Because when it's just me, I'm easy to crush, right? But when it's myself and it's Ted Koppel and there was a former managing editor at the \"New York Times\" who came out and said the same thing, they've become the paper of record against Donald Trump. And so what you're seeing is a growing number of figures and this restores my faith in journalism because I know these people are there. I know I'm not a lone ranger. I know I'm not the only one who remembers what great independent journalism is supposed to look like. I know I'm not the only journalist who's watching in horror as opinion and pejorative language is passed off as fact, where anonymous sources are given complete cover to do political assassinations without any regard for the consequences of what they're doing, where journalists are walking hand- in-hand with propaganda groups and pushing forward narratives that are not based in fact, that are not based in honest journalism, that are nothing more, you know, than political targeting thinly disguised as journalism today. And you know the best part about all of this, Mark? There's one set of people who are not fooled by any of it. They lack the context very often.  They lack a lot of the information to know exactly the extent of how they're being deceived and manipulated, but they know in their guts and that's the audience. That's the viewers. That's the readers. That's all the people in the length and breadth of this country in whether they're Democrats or Republicans, who are lining up to have this conversation right now, who know that something is not right and that's why they're turning away from the news and that's why they're not watching. And that's why they're frustrated and that's why there's so little trust and faith in the media these days and responsibility and accountability begins with us."

I want to be very clear about that, because I've been falsely labeled as being politically motivated in any direction, and none of that is true. So what bothers me is that one political ideology dominates all of your academic -- almost all of your academic institutions and that same political ideology dominates all of your newsrooms, almost all of your newsrooms I mean, let's face it, until Fox News, in television where did you go if you weren't liberally minded or moderate, if you like? If you wanted to hear an alternative point of view or a conservative point of view, where did you go in television? You didn't go -- there was nowhere to go. So Fox News to me is so successful because there are so many Americans saying, \"Hey, I want a different point of view. I want to hear something else.\" And most people will look at a little, you know, sample of all different kinds of media especially today."

Nobody is challenging them.  Nobody is holding them to account for what they're reporting. We all go sailing along thinking we're doing such amazing outstanding work. There was an incredible reporter who said this once, Gary Webb, if anyone has seen the movie \"To Kill the Messenger.\" He was the guy who broke the story about the CIA's involvement in crack cocaine on the streets of America and their involvement in funding rebels, right, and using drug money to do so. Well, Gary Webb won the Pulitzer and then he was destroyed. This man killed himself by, by the way shooting himself twice in the head, which is quite an achievement and he said, \"I was going, you know, to journalism colleges and I was giving speeches and I was getting awards and you know, I was being lauded and recognized by my whole profession and then I realized what it was really about. It wasn't because I was so great and because my work was so good, it's because I've never done -- I'd never written anything important enough to suppress.\" And that ended with Gary Webb having no career, no family. He lost everything and then he lost his life. So when you stay inside the bubble and inside the narrative that dominates the media industry, it's a safe place to be because nobody's coming after you. These propaganda groups and one in particular, Media Matters for America, they're targeting Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham morning to night. They have an army of people who are paid to do this. That's their job. Every day when they wake up, they're looking for a way to destroy these people."

Not all journalists -- just because you're a liberal doesn't mean that you can't be a great journalist. Just because you vote Democrat doesn't mean you can't be a great journalist. Fortunately, for all of us, there are principles of great journalism that exist outside of the politics. But what all of us have is we're human and so we have things. We're all predisposed to believe people we agree with and like, more so than we do with the people that we think you know are -- we don't agree with. And so you have fertile ground for this propaganda to take root, and then on top of that, you have a lot of laziness, you have a lot of armchair reporters who are just happy to pick up a phone to report whatever a source tells them because it's the White House or it's the FBI or it's someone where their butts are covered, right, no one is ever going to hold them to account if they report nonsense because they've got an official source for it. But now what's happened, what's changed -- because that was always there, right, what's changed today is that you now have a press corps that is working hand-in-hand with propaganda organizations with a political agenda, and so what Ted Koppel was saying, people are part of the resistance.  That's exactly what I was talking about when I said too many journalists today are political operatives now. They've forgotten how to be journalists. They've forgotten what we're supposed to be as journalists and they've become political operatives. They have a predetermined outcome for all of their reporting. They want the removal of this President. They don't think he should ever have been elected. They don't like anything about him. You know what it's called?  Resisting the normalization of Donald Trump, it's a Media Matters mission statement. It's Media Matters for America who put this out to their donors and their funders and their supporters that they will resist the normalization of Donald Trump and that means you're not allowed to look at any policy of this administration and evaluate that policy on its merits, you're not allowed to balance your reporting. You're not -- you know people say to me, \"Well, this President doesn't help himself with his style,\" and I say, \"I'm sure that's true.\" I mean, you know he rubs everybody up the wrong way at some point or another. Style is not his strength. But my question is, how much would his style matter if we spent 50 percent of the time talking about his style instead of 98 percent of the time? And what if we had 50 percent of the time actually looking at the policies of the administration and seeing what works and what doesn't? Would we care so much about his style then? Part of the mission statement for this propaganda movement is that Donald Trump will be known forever as the least popular President in America. So that is going to be what -- that's a predetermined outcome that they want, and what disappoints me and actually what really, I find extraordinarily concerning to use Ted Koppel's words, I'm very concerned by is the number of journalists who've taken a political position and you still expect and demand the legitimacy of being objective and independent and being open and balanced and fair. These are not people who are open-minded. Your minds have become closed and until we recognize that, we're going to continue sowing the seeds of our own death and destruction and by the way, these propaganda groups don't want an independent robust press. They're only too happy to see us bury ourselves because they're working on controlling the different levers. They don't -- if independent voice was what they wanted, if great journalists were what they wanted, if that was their problem with me with my journalism, then they would be so -- they wouldn't be doing."

They weren't known because of drama. They were known because there were so few media outlets and people who watch the \"Nightly News\" and so forth, but with the 24/7 news, it looks like almost a drama class in high school where people are fighting to get at the front of the line and in particular, who comes to mind is Jim Acosta. CNN, you have Presidents for press conferences and to me, freedom of the press is about the American people learning what's going on, asking tough questions holding powerful people accountable, but not giving speeches and being disruptive and undermining the entire process. Am I wrong?"

      "speaker": "LOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I've been a journalist for 30 years and I've been in many press conferences with many different Presidents in all different places.  I've been at the White House and I've been, you know, in Baghdad when you've had visiting Secretaries of Defense and all the rest. I've never seen the Press Corps behave the way they do today. So it stands out to me because it's a departure from what I've seen for throughout the last three decades and I will say that curious about that, I went on the CNN website as I frequently do when I'm looking across the landscape at all different media organizations and I constantly see headlines about CNN anchor takes a Trump adviser, CNN anchor destroys Trump this or that. And what I'm surprised by is how much of the news on their website is about their anchors and their reporters and their analysts attacking and destroying anything that the White House says and does and that to me is symbolic of the problem, but there is something actually much more significant about what you're seeing happen with the White House Press Corps. Donald Trump has shown everybody just with his Twitter account that he's changing the way the President communicates in the United States of America today, which is completely consistent with what everybody is doing, right?  In the digital age, with all of this technology, we're all changing how we communicate. Media organizations are doing it. Political leaders are doing it. The Ayatollah of Iran has a Twitter feed, okay? So why is Donald Trump not allowed to do that? Why is he not allowed to change how the White House operates in terms of its communications and the rules of the White House Press Corps and how these things happen? He is not allowed to be seen as an instrument of change. That's a propaganda talking point of the progressive political movement. He is not allowed to be normalized as a President, so whatever changes he makes have to be resisted by the resistance and then on top of that, if you look at one of the things that Media Matters for America, a propaganda group gloats about in all their publicity is that they prevented Breitbart from getting a White House press credential, right? They used their rules to stop the White House from allowing Breitbart to attend any press conferences and be part of the White House press corps.  Why? So if you change the rules, then people like Media Matters -- these propaganda organizations of the left, they won't be able to use those rules to their advantage. They don't want you to change the rules. Number two, if you -- if they can't use the rules, then they can't stop people like Breitbart getting access and being part of the conversation in America, and that's what they don't want. They don't want alternative points of view. They most especially don't want conservative points of view. They don't want to empower websites like Breitbart or Drudge or anybody else and more importantly than that, they don't want anyone to have the ability to communicate their message directly. They want it to be filtered through this network of propaganda organizations that are dominated by one political ideology and deliver their message. So you know, all this stuff about Jim Acosta is masking something much more sinister and really threatening to me as a journalist because what it effectively means is that we don't want a democracy. We don't want freedom of thought and freedom of discussion."

I had no idea that there would be such a reaction, that it would catch fire like that. I mean, it was trending on Twitter for two days apparently and that's a big deal. So you know in my world, I've learned very, very well to tune out anything that's negative. I just don't pay attention to the detractors because I know they come from a really bad place and when I -- you know, I was raised to live my life to be true to who I am and to stand up for what is right and that's all I'm doing. And actually, you know, what's really great? Is that all the journalists who have reached out to me directly or through other people, that's how bad it is, Mark, that journalists are afraid to send you a note -- some journalist -- on their work accounts because supporting what you're saying, because it's that threatening to their careers. So you know what I say is, as a journalist today in America, we're not free. We can't for example do a story interviewing scientists about who dispute the science on climate change, right, because if you do that story, if you're really just interested in the science and you want to understand this better and you're trying to figure out what's true, what's not true and you're trying to understand it for yourself, that's now a political -- that's a no-no. That's the end of your career. You talk to scientists and see they'll tell you the same thing. You can't get a research grant if you want to look at some of the -- if you're going to question any of that science, so that means that we're not free. We don't have the freedom to do whatever story we want to do and investigate what we want to investigate. We live in a society where people are telling us it's okay to have that conversation. That conversation is not allowed.  You cannot have that conversation. And the way they've done it is to claim the moral high ground on everything. We have the morally superior position. We have the moral authority to talk about this, so if you deviate from our position at all, you have no moral authority, i.e., you're a terrible person. And that to me is what -- there are lots of journalists who know in their hearts that that's not right and who want to stand up against that and who just want to do honest, independent, journalism and the great thing about this is that now with Ted Koppel coming out and saying what he said, that I'm hopeful that more journalists will stand up because, really, you know the best journalist at heart where anarchists, right? We're just a bunch of nosy people and we resist all forms of control.  That's who I am. I resist all forms of control. Just ask my husband."

And honestly, I got the same reaction in Campbell, California and in Portland, Oregon and in Pittsburgh and I believe that this is a non- partisan issue. This is not a left-right issue. It's misused by propaganda and it's dominated by one political ideology which makes it political, but it has another dimension to it that is just as significant and in fact even more powerful, and that is that it speaks to what's inside every single one of us who believe in freedom and that's what it's really about."

I've never encountered a White House that didn't control how they communicated with the media. In my experience as a journalist, whether it's the State Department or the White House or the Pentagon, they're always in control of how they communicate, so I've never seen this as a threat. I've never felt threatened by any of it as a journalist. I don't buy it -- I know what it is to be threatened as a journalist, okay? I know what it is when you're on a battlefield or you're in a very difficult situation with a hostage threat and you're just trying to survive. I know what it is to be targeted, I mean, geez, in Egypt when they declared journalists the enemy of the state, you know, I was gang-raped and sodomized and almost murdered.

I just -- I don't believe that those dots actually connect. That to me is propaganda. And I say to any journalist, it takes moral courage to do this job properly, to do it the way it's supposed to be done. It takes moral courage to stand against the tide and not just go with the flow. Maybe the flow is what where you honestly believe the story to be and that's fine if that's your honest, independent assessment, that's one thing, but you know, I have to say that I agree with you.

That was a failure of journalism.\" Okay, so that's the biggest joke of all because there was not a failure of journalism in that story and it's not good journalism that these propaganda groups went out there. They're not targeting you because they're worried about the standard of your reporting. They're targeting you -- their stated objective is that they're going to eliminate anything that they view as a threat to their political ideology."

The last person to speak to Chris Stevens when Chris Stevens was under attack, a terrorist attack in his compound, he called Greg Hicks and Greg Hicks looked at the Defense Attache and said, \"Well,\" and he said, \"I'm sorry, Greg, the cavalry ain't incoming.\" And Greg Hicks said, \"I felt sick in the pit of my stomach because those of us who go out on the end of the line for our country, we believe our country has our back,\" and in that minute, in that moment, I knew they didn't. And I looked at him and I said, \"We better tell the boys at the annex,\" and two of those boys died that night. That was an Al Qaeda terrorist attack that was extremely well-planned timed for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 and those things, the substance of our reporting is what the Obama administration and the progressive political movement and Hillary Clinton's propaganda force. That's what they wanted buried, because it didn't suit them politically to have the truth out about that. And so they picked the least important person in the story. They took two things he said and they cast it into doubt. It was called into question and then they made the story disappear. It was erased so now you can't -- all of that propaganda you read about it. You don't have the ability to tell whether it's even true or not because you can't watch the story and make up your own mind. And there was a lot of other significant reporting in there. Think of all those people trying to tear that piece to shreds and they were only able to cast out over two things one guy of three characters had to say, right, and what I learned - the lesson I learned is that they're not going to come after you for the things that matter. They're going to come after you and use the things that don't matter and they're going to use that to bury the whole thing and silence you."
