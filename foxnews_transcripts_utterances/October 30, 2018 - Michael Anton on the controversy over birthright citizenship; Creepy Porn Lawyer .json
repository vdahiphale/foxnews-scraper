Who gets to live here? What does citizenship mean? What kind of country do we want? These are not small incidental questions, which you are watching is not an argument about Russian Facebook ads or Stormy Daniels or her creepy lawyer or some other diversion designed to prevention from thinking clearly. These are core debates. These are the arguments that every functioning democracy must have and yet ours rarely does. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Consider the question of birthright citizenship. Under current interpretations of American law anyone born on our soil automatically becomes a U.S. citizen. Context is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if your parents were terrorists or illegal aliens or foreign saboteurs, if their plane was forced down to refuel and you emerged. It doesn't matter If you were born on our property, you are a citizen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a recent interview with Axios, President Trump suggested, this is not a great deal for America.

That's where people travel to the United States solely for the purpose of having kids and winning citizenship along with the many benefits that follow from that. We'll know more about it soon and of course we'll tell you when we do know. But nobody else in Washington is waiting for details. They hate it already. The very same people who have spent decades trying to gut the Bill of Rights are now lecturing the rest of us that the idea is brace yourself unconstitutional. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Paul Ryan for example, he is the outgoing speaker of the House.

Is it really \"obvious\" that the Constitution requires us to give citizenship to the children of illegal aliens. Paul Ryan has no idea. He just doesn't want to have a conversation about it. He wants you to be quiet. In fact, as a legal matter, it is an open question. The Supreme Court has never ruled on it.

The senator who wrote the citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment, Jacob Howard of Michigan explained the point of it on the Senate floor at the time. \"The Amendment will not of course include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.\" Again, the Amendment was designed to ensure that newly freed slaves would be treated as the American citizens they were. The point was to enfranchise African-Americans. The point was not to enable the rest of the world to scam our system, to abuse our generosity. Trump's proposal would get us closer to the purpose of the 14th Amendment. And for that he is being denounced naturally as a racist.

The Chinese are strongly overrepresented in this. One ad in China offers \"high end U.S. birth tourism specialists\" for just 20 grands, these experts navigate clients through the process of having a child in America. In return for that 20 grands, their kids gain the right to Social Security, Medicare and countless other federal programs. If they come back to the U.S. for college, they get in-state tuition, federally backed student loans, financial aid, all the benefits that ought to be going to actual Americans who are drowning in college debt.

President Trump hates this. We happened to know, he has often complained to people around him about the quagmire that Afghanistan has become. You remember that when he ran for president, one of Trump's central promises was to keep America out of pointless foreign wars like this one. Washington despised him for saying that because it implicated them and their failures, but voters appreciated hearing it. And yet somehow the war in Afghanistan has continued to this day fruitlessly. That's thanks almost entirely to bullying from our thoroughly discredited foreign policy establishment. They are happy to keep things the way they are. 17 years later though we as a country have almost nothing to show for what we spent there the lives and the money. The Taliban remains strong. The U.S. backed government controls barely half of that country. This spring the DOJ described Afghanistan as \"largely lawless, weak and dysfunctional.\" Most depressing of all, we're no longer even aiming at any kind of military victory. The best we can hope for is the sort of stalemate that keeps the Taliban partly in power. So, what is the point of all of this. Well, some people are getting rich from it. Drive through the DC suburbs some time and see for yourself. But most Americans derive no benefit at all. Some families are paying the highest possible price. Two years in, it's not too late for the president to deliver on a campaign promise, he once made and end this disaster. Tomorrow might be a good day to start with that. San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities to live in or do business in, could soon get even more costly. This Tuesday as city - the voters in the city will consider an initiative that would implement a new tax on businesses that money they say would be used to fight homelessness. If approved the tax is expected to cost businesses in San Francisco about $200 million a year.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Just a week to go from tonight until the midterms and Election Day is finally becoming a referendum on something that really matters, immigration. Who gets to live here? What does citizenship mean? What kind of country do we want? These are not small incidental questions, which you are watching is not an argument about Russian Facebook ads or Stormy Daniels or her creepy lawyer or some other diversion designed to prevention from thinking clearly. These are core debates. These are the arguments that every functioning democracy must have and yet ours rarely does. Consider the question of birthright citizenship. Under current interpretations of American law anyone born on our soil automatically becomes a U.S. citizen. Context is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if your parents were terrorists or illegal aliens or foreign saboteurs, if their plane was forced down to refuel and you emerged. It doesn't matter If you were born on our property, you are a citizen. In a recent interview with Axios, President Trump suggested, this is not a great deal for America. He pledged to change it with an executive order. As of tonight, it seems likely that order would abolish so-called birth tourism. That's where people travel to the United States solely for the purpose of having kids and winning citizenship along with the many benefits that follow from that. We'll know more about it soon and of course we'll tell you when we do know. But nobody else in Washington is waiting for details. They hate it already. The very same people who have spent decades trying to gut the Bill of Rights are now lecturing the rest of us that the idea is brace yourself unconstitutional. Paul Ryan for example, he is the outgoing speaker of the House. He announced his opposition to this immediately. The very idea he said is ridiculous. Listen."

      "utterance": "Well, you obviously cannot do that. You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well obviously, obviously. Note the phrasing. Obviously, that's what people say when they don't feel like making a rational case for their positions, usually because they can't. Is it really \"obvious\" that the Constitution requires us to give citizenship to the children of illegal aliens. Paul Ryan has no idea. He just doesn't want to have a conversation about it. He wants you to be quiet. In fact, as a legal matter, it is an open question. The Supreme Court has never ruled on it. But there is ample reason to believe the law does not apply to illegal immigrants or birth tourists. Birthright citizenship arises from the 14th Amendment that was passed just three years after the Civil War and it was passed to guarantee citizenship to freed slaves. The senator who wrote the citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment, Jacob Howard of Michigan explained the point of it on the Senate floor at the time. \"The Amendment will not of course include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.\" Again, the Amendment was designed to ensure that newly freed slaves would be treated as the American citizens they were. The point was to enfranchise African-Americans. The point was not to enable the rest of the world to scam our system, to abuse our generosity. Trump's proposal would get us closer to the purpose of the 14th Amendment. And for that he is being denounced naturally as a racist. Listen to some of the dumb people on TV."

And it's this issue of national identity versus internationalism, globalism if you will. So what Donald Trump is doing is he is mining that fault line. He is working it, whether it's birthright citizenship, whether it's sending troops to a border that's not under siege. We're no longer arguing serious issues about how to regulate our economies. We're no longer arguing serious issues say about how to fight the Cold War. We are arguing questions about national identity and that's not that far to get from that to issues of racism."

These people are total buffoons. In fact, there is no more serious debate than the debate over citizenship. And it's long overdue. Globally. birthright citizenship is the rare exception. It is not the rule. Canada and the U.S. are the only developed countries that have birthright citizenship. Not a single European country allows it. Out of the 54 countries in Africa, only two offer birthright citizenship. Are the other 52 racists? How about Harry Reid, is he a racist too? Watch the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader explain his views on birthright citizenship."

      "utterance": "With making it easy to be an illegal alien is enough. How about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant? No sane country would do that. Right. Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission to give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides and that's a lot of services. Is it any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer expense in country, county run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to illegal alien mothers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Now as a factual matter, that's tougher than anything Donald Trump has ever said. Keep in mind that just four years ago that man Harry Reid was the top Democrat in the Senate. Try saying that today, he'd be called Bull Connor and shouted off the stage. But the questions he raised are still fair questions. Is unlimited birthright citizenship helping this country or is it hurting this country? Under our current system, illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. and have children are eligible to receive tax credits, food stamps, other welfare benefits. Those are huge incentives. Not surprisingly, one in every 12 births in this country right now is to someone here illegally and that total does not even include birth tourism. Every year tens of thousands of foreign nationals come to this country on tourist visas solely to give birth to children. The Chinese are strongly overrepresented in this. One ad in China offers \"high end U.S. birth tourism specialists\" for just 20 grands, these experts navigate clients through the process of having a child in America. In return for that 20 grands, their kids gain the right to Social Security, Medicare and countless other federal programs. If they come back to the U.S. for college, they get in-state tuition, federally backed student loans, financial aid, all the benefits that ought to be going to actual Americans who are drowning in college debt. This is a scam. There is no other word for it. And by the way don't blame the Chinese or the Russians or the Salvadorans or anybody else using the system, we're the ones offering it. Why wouldn't they take it? The blame lies with us. No other country would allow itself to be relentlessly exploited like this for decades and no other leadership class would side with foreigners over its own people. And yet ours does every time and that tells you everything. Michael Anton is a former senior National Security official in the Trump administration, a lecturer at Hillsdale College and probably the first person in this generation to raise the question of whether birthright citizenship is indeed constitutional. Thank you very much Michael Anton. You wrote this piece, I think began this current conversation this past July and people were stunned to find out that this was not a settled matter, most believe this is etched on the bottom of the Statue of Liberty, but it's not."

And they base that belief on a misreading of the very first sentence of the 14th Amendment, which says all persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens. They leave out the part in the middle, subject to the jurisdiction thereof. They either leave it out or they say subject to the jurisdiction just means you have to obey the law. Well, everybody has to obey the law. If you're a tourist coming from England or Canada or anywhere, you have to obey U.S. law while you're in the United States."

We know this, because they said. You read the debates over the Amendment. They said, it means that you don't owe allegiance to any foreign power, to anyone else, you're subject to the complete jurisdiction in the United States. It means you're not a citizen of another country. So, it clearly doesn't apply to people who aren't citizens or who are born to people who aren't citizens, who are subject to the jurisdiction of another country. The Constitution is clear on that point. There is no statute that says otherwise. But decades ago, the executive branch agencies of the federal government just decided to apply this principle as if Well, we owe everyone birthright citizenship. Now why do they do that. Why do bureaucracies typically in our country anyway typically act without authority. Usually, it's to serve the interests of liberalism when the administrative state starts doing something that it's not authorized to do and that no one has ever told it to do, you can bet it's not doing so for conservative reasons or for reasons that benefit American citizens. It's doing so for reasons that benefit liberalism. And that's what happened in this case."

You had a controversy at the time where some states were saying, OK, you can free the slaves, but we have the power to make them citizens and we're not going to do it. So, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The same Congress, same year that drafted this Amendment that was vetoed by President Johnson. The veto was overridden. So, you get two-thirds of both houses saying, free black slaves, they are citizens. And that also says not subject to any foreign power. Well then, some of the Southern states came back with. OK, well 1857, the Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott that no black person, even a free black person could ever be a citizen of the United States. So, the reconstruction Congress said, OK, then we're going to put this in the Constitution, we're not going to let you get away with this.

So, I think it is a little bit more of a swing state than people give it credit for. But look Kyrsten Sinema didn't really start moderating her views until 2012. And so now she is trying to, ever since then she's been trying to present herself as more of a moderate. This is someone that in 2010 attended a Netroots Conference, which is where she said, Arizona is the meth lab of democracy. As you know Netroots is this uber progressive organization and conference. She has also called herself a Prada Socialist in the past and she's had these crazy left-wing ideas and policies on military in the past as well as border security and being part of this no deaths group. So, she is clearly made a calculated move to move to the center, because that's what it takes to win the state of Arizona as a Democrat and for the Project Veritas video, they edited that. We can't independently verify that at Fox News, but I think what it does show is that she's clearly trying to hide some of these past positions that she's had."

The Trump administration is focusing on urban communities and initiatives, so we have two things happening right now that are very, very exciting. Number one, African-American millennials those that kind of weather are motivated, those who can excel and are motivated and say, wait a minute, what have Democrats done for us. We first of all, the millennial does not buy this racism behind every rock narrative of the Democrat Party, because their friends are diverse, they've grown up in a society post-civil rights era. So, they don't know that world at all. But secondly, they're individuals. They like uniqueness. We can see that in the tattoos that they wear. And so, this whole idea of collectivism and big government doesn't work for them as well. But what's also happened is you had that baby boom black, the baby boom black is more traditional in their world view. So, now the Democrat Party has become so extreme to the left, so progressive that it's conflicting with that baby boom black's world view and values and they're concerned about their grandchildren of what they're learning in school. So, we'll see how it all plays out. We're looking very closely. Our group is looking very closely at Wisconsin, at Michigan when we're talking about the Senate seats, when we're talking about the governor seats, we should all be looking at Georgia. We should look at Florida and then even to some degree in Maryland. So, I'm very excited about the momentum."

We still have thousands of Americans in the country. So far this year, eight of them have been killed. President Trump hates this. We happened to know, he has often complained to people around him about the quagmire that Afghanistan has become. You remember that when he ran for president, one of Trump's central promises was to keep America out of pointless foreign wars like this one. Washington despised him for saying that because it implicated them and their failures, but voters appreciated hearing it. And yet somehow the war in Afghanistan has continued to this day fruitlessly. That's thanks almost entirely to bullying from our thoroughly discredited foreign policy establishment. They are happy to keep things the way they are. 17 years later though we as a country have almost nothing to show for what we spent there the lives and the money. The Taliban remains strong. The U.S. backed government controls barely half of that country. This spring the DOJ described Afghanistan as \"largely lawless, weak and dysfunctional.\" Most depressing of all, we're no longer even aiming at any kind of military victory. The best we can hope for is the sort of stalemate that keeps the Taliban partly in power. So, what is the point of all of this. Well, some people are getting rich from it. Drive through the DC suburbs some time and see for yourself. But most Americans derive no benefit at all. Some families are paying the highest possible price. Two years in, it's not too late for the president to deliver on a campaign promise, he once made and end this disaster. Tomorrow might be a good day to start with that. San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities to live in or do business in, could soon get even more costly. This Tuesday as city - the voters in the city will consider an initiative that would implement a new tax on businesses that money they say would be used to fight homelessness. If approved the tax is expected to cost businesses in San Francisco about $200 million a year.

The fire department alone and one of the fire commissioners here, we have recently did an audit and almost half of our calls are homeless related calls, 40 percent of our calls are homeless related calls. So, there are a lot of resources going into this issue and I think the mayor is right on this one. She has only been in office for about six months. She says no on C, which is the proposition you're speaking of. And I think she's right about it, because there is this institution that's been built around homelessness that if we keep feeding it money and it's not showing results, it's really just a practice of lunacy. And so, this mayor has said, she's dedicated to the number one issue of solving homelessness. So, for her to say that no on C is really a big deal because she personally sees where this money goes.

First, he failed to defame Brett Kavanaugh after accusing him of serial gang rape. Then he was exposed for failing to pay his taxes. His law firm is even being evicted for not paying rent. Failing on all sides, he has decided to do what they always do in Washington seek refuge and audacity. He's gearing up for a presidential run. Politico reports the creepy porn lawyer already assembled a team of veteran Democratic advisers, including Jack Quinn, who is quite a famous Democratic adviser here in Washington to help him raise money, craft a message and ultimately rule the land as president. Maybe, the creepy porn president will do better than the creepy porn lawyer has done. Tammy Bruce is radio host president of Independent Women's Voice. She joins us tonight.

It's so low, it's on the floor and you saw that the comments with your montage really remarkable, if this guy not only with the IRS having trouble losing a lawsuit from a former partner to the tune of over $4 million. His former client Stormy Daniels had been told by a judge that she has to pay Donald Trump's legal fees having lost part of a case against him, which is now like over $300,000. So, while creepy porn lawyer is elevating his profile using these people, she is probably going to have to go bankrupt. Julie Swetnick is, and he are under being referred for a criminal investigation by the Senate. She is going to have to get a different lawyer as well to defend her.

And that's a bad thing. Again, famous words spoken by President Obama. So, for whatever reason, we have become expendable and I think a part of that is because we don't have the numbers that you will find in more urban areas that can bring votes. And so, our interests aren't exactly of interest. And that's frankly the bottom-line is a political calculus that we are not as important as we once used to be, which by the way we're in a big time in the Senate. Right."
