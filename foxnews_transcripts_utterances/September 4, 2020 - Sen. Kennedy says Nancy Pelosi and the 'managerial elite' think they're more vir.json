Joe Biden doesn't, well, really have any original ideas. He never has. He's been in the swamp 50-plus years. It's 50 years of elect me and I'll do this. I'll do this. The president says all talk, talk, talk, no action. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden alone, 125 combined years of elect me and I'll promise this, this, and this -- nothing but 125 years of meaningless promises and unmitigated failure. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Oh, and on Biden's part, lots of plagiarism. Remember he was accused of plagiarizing a paper in law school. In 1980s, many of his speeches were plagiarized. He was accused of plagiarizing Robert Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, British MP Neil Kinnock. We played that for you last week. And the scary part is Biden has taken his cues from the most radical, the most extreme socialist, extremist that this party has ever embraced -- the Democratic, modern, socialist party. Look at the corrupt forgetful Joe Biden team. You've got Biden, Schumer, Pelosi -- that's 125 years of, well, failure alone. Now add to that Bernie Sanders, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Beto Bozo O'Rourke, gun czar. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } His latest policy proposals were literally authored by the devout socialist Bernie Sanders. And Joe even plagiarized Bernie's agenda literally in many instances word for word right out of Bolshevik Bernie's a socialist platform. Now, keep in mind, Bernie wants the government to control all means of production. He wants to nationalize industries like they did in Venezuela and Cuba. He has praised those regimes. And, by the way, honeymoon in the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, socialist Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she's in charge of Biden's climate task force and she wants to ban oil, gas, coal, air travel, and eventually even cows, says we have 12 years and it's all over. Her Green New Deal will cost $94 trillion over 10 years.

In other words, he's embraced the \"defund the police\" movement.

He has disbanded the uncovered, the most effective anti- crime unit in the city. He's banned all stop and frisk. Meanwhile, New York Governor Cuomo, well, he's the genius that let thousands of violent criminals out of jail every single time with his idiotic zero dollar bail policy. And as a result, what are we seeing? Shootings in New York City and New York state, they have more than doubled over the last year. On Monday, at least 17 people shot, that includes three drive-by shootings. At one point over the weekend, there was a shooting every single hour. And last night, we brought you Lawrence Jones' heart-wrenching interview with the family of that 1-year-old baby boy who was shot and killed. He was in a stroller. He was in a playground in Brooklyn. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this violence is unacceptable. It comes as police all over the country now are under attack. Since May, 12 police officers have now been killed in the line of duty. Two were murdered over the weekend in Texas while responding to a domestic disturbance call. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Over 1,000 other police officers seriously injured -- rocks, and bottles, and bricks, and Molotov cocktails, knives and guns being used against them. The chaos, the carnage in America's big liberal cities, it's out of control. And, by the way, if you want a preview of coming attractions, that will be America with Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Schumer, and Beto. That's your choice. We can't make it anymore clear. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You are the ultimate jury. So do you want in 112 days law in order to be restored or do you wanted to get worse? Because Biden wants to defund the police and abolish cash bail just like they did in New York. He's come a long way from calling people predators and, you know, while saying under incendiary things on racial issues, like he didn't want his kids in a racial jungle if we're talking about integration. He used those words. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Like I said at the top, this is now become the single biggest greatest choice election in our lifetime, on every single important issue that will impact your kids, your life, and your grandkids. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want Biden's plans for open borders, for amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America? The minute you get into America, you get absolutely free health care, free, free, free -- free schools for every illegal immigrant and amnesty. Or do you prefer border security? Four hundred miles of border wall will be built by Election Day. You get to decide. Do you want Biden's tax increases that he is promising? Or do you prefer lower taxes that Donald Trump is promising? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want Biden's Green New Deal madness or President Trump -- let's see, he's made this country energy independent for the first time in over 75 years.

Do you want that or do you want to ban coal and fracking and oil production? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want Biden's activist judges, legislating for the bench, do you want to stack the courts like, well, Democrats have been talking about, or do you prefer constitutionalist, those that believe that's the fundamental rule of law for the United States of America? Do you want socialized health care? Do you want to keep your private health care? How did Obamacare/Bidencare work out for you? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you want Hunter Biden making sketchy billion-dollar deals with the Bank of China, lining his own pockets or do you want a president who will actually stand up to China as this president did earlier today?

      "utterance": "If Joe Biden wins, he has the strength and stamina and mental alertness to do the job, if he implements the extreme agenda that he's now embracing, let me be clear -- America as you know it, we know it, will be destroyed. Our entire way of life will be flushed down the drain. If the issue of law and order security and safety, if that matters to you and to your family, if free-market capitalism matters to you and your family, if our Constitution, the rule of law matters to you, here's what you need to know -- in 112 days, you are the ultimate jury. Joe Biden doesn't, well, really have any original ideas. He never has. He's been in the swamp 50-plus years. It's 50 years of elect me and I'll do this. I'll do this. The president says all talk, talk, talk, no action. Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden alone, 125 combined years of elect me and I'll promise this, this, and this -- nothing but 125 years of meaningless promises and unmitigated failure. Oh, and on Biden's part, lots of plagiarism. Remember he was accused of plagiarizing a paper in law school. In 1980s, many of his speeches were plagiarized. He was accused of plagiarizing Robert Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, British MP Neil Kinnock. We played that for you last week. And the scary part is Biden has taken his cues from the most radical, the most extreme socialist, extremist that this party has ever embraced -- the Democratic, modern, socialist party. Look at the corrupt forgetful Joe Biden team. You've got Biden, Schumer, Pelosi -- that's 125 years of, well, failure alone. Now add to that Bernie Sanders, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Beto Bozo O'Rourke, gun czar. His latest policy proposals were literally authored by the devout socialist Bernie Sanders. And Joe even plagiarized Bernie's agenda literally in many instances word for word right out of Bolshevik Bernie's a socialist platform. Now, keep in mind, Bernie wants the government to control all means of production. He wants to nationalize industries like they did in Venezuela and Cuba. He has praised those regimes. And, by the way, honeymoon in the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, socialist Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she's in charge of Biden's climate task force and she wants to ban oil, gas, coal, air travel, and eventually even cows, says we have 12 years and it's all over. Her Green New Deal will cost $94 trillion over 10 years. That will turn America into a socialist bankrupt hellhole. And then, of course, there's Biden's gun-control czar, Beto Bozo O'Rourke, whose top priority is to literally take your guns away. This is what's at stake in 112 days. Take a look."

      "utterance": "OK. To recap, Biden has tapped Bolshevik Bernie, he's even plagiarizing him, to lead his economic policies. AOC will lead the Green New Deal climate task force. Beto Bozo, he's coming for your guns. And, by the way, he also has Schumer and Pelosi in Congress. This is his team? Right there? And Add Beto and add AOC. They win and you can start singing bye-bye Miss American pie because it's over. What's next? Is he going to tap -- let's see -- the ever incompetent Cuomo to, what, lead his coronavirus task force? Is he going to tap Comrade de Blasio, mayor of New York, as his law and order czar? After all, just last week, Biden in his own words, he agreed that yes, funds, should be diverted away from the police. In other words, he's embraced the \"defund the police\" movement. He's the guy that said last week, police have now become the enemy. In New York City, Comrade de Blasio, already slash the NYPD budget by a billion dollars. He has disbanded the uncovered, the most effective anti- crime unit in the city. He's banned all stop and frisk. Meanwhile, New York Governor Cuomo, well, he's the genius that let thousands of violent criminals out of jail every single time with his idiotic zero dollar bail policy. And as a result, what are we seeing? Shootings in New York City and New York state, they have more than doubled over the last year. On Monday, at least 17 people shot, that includes three drive-by shootings. At one point over the weekend, there was a shooting every single hour. And last night, we brought you Lawrence Jones' heart-wrenching interview with the family of that 1-year-old baby boy who was shot and killed. He was in a stroller. He was in a playground in Brooklyn. Now, this violence is unacceptable. It comes as police all over the country now are under attack. Since May, 12 police officers have now been killed in the line of duty. Two were murdered over the weekend in Texas while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Over 1,000 other police officers seriously injured -- rocks, and bottles, and bricks, and Molotov cocktails, knives and guns being used against them. The chaos, the carnage in America's big liberal cities, it's out of control. And, by the way, if you want a preview of coming attractions, that will be America with Biden, Pelosi, AOC, Schumer, and Beto. That's your choice. We can't make it anymore clear. You are the ultimate jury. So do you want in 112 days law in order to be restored or do you wanted to get worse? Because Biden wants to defund the police and abolish cash bail just like they did in New York. He's come a long way from calling people predators and, you know, while saying under incendiary things on racial issues, like he didn't want his kids in a racial jungle if we're talking about integration. He used those words. Like I said at the top, this is now become the single biggest greatest choice election in our lifetime, on every single important issue that will impact your kids, your life, and your grandkids. Do you want Biden's plans for open borders, for amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America? The minute you get into America, you get absolutely free health care, free, free, free -- free schools for every illegal immigrant and amnesty. Or do you prefer border security? Four hundred miles of border wall will be built by Election Day. You get to decide. Do you want Biden's tax increases that he is promising? Or do you prefer lower taxes that Donald Trump is promising? Do you want Biden's Green New Deal madness or President Trump -- let's see, he's made this country energy independent for the first time in over 75 years. And he's also made it for the first time in 75 years, we are now the world's number one producer of energy. Do you want that or do you want to ban coal and fracking and oil production? Do you want Biden's activist judges, legislating for the bench, do you want to stack the courts like, well, Democrats have been talking about, or do you prefer constitutionalist, those that believe that's the fundamental rule of law for the United States of America? Do you want socialized health care? Do you want to keep your private health care? How did Obamacare/Bidencare work out for you? Do you want Hunter Biden making sketchy billion-dollar deals with the Bank of China, lining his own pockets or do you want a president who will actually stand up to China as this president did earlier today? Do you want zero experience Hunter making millions more in Ukraine? Quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter, oh, it worked out perfectly, didn't it?

Because that's what Biden is now selling with his team of Pelosi, Schumer, AOC, Bernie and Bozo. Well, that's -- those are the stakes in the 112 days. You're the ultimate jury. You get to shock the world again and you get to stop what they want to do to this country from happening. You know, it would certainly be worthwhile just for the pure entertainment purposes to watch the fake news media mob in this country, I'm just thinking out loud. In 112 days, maybe early to 113 days, early in the morning, having to choke on the words \"we can now project that Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States.\" How do you think that's going to go over when you get the call that they -- we get to watch them make that call? That would be pretty amazing. We survived eight years of Obama. I don't want to go back. You know what, America was resilient. This plan is way beyond anything that's ever been proposed -- the most radical, extreme, socialist proposals in the history of this country. It will destroy the U.S. freedom that has created more wealth, more opportunity that we have used for human advancement around the world. That's all because of liberty and freedom. And every time you get a false promise of security, you give up your freedoms. Bernie Sanders is so pleased with this radical socialist lawless agenda he went on -- well, MSDNC, the conspiracy channel, Roswell Rachel Maddow's channel, last night to congratulate Biden on becoming the most progressive candidate in modern history.

Now we know what Biden meant when he wanted to transform America into Bernie's America. During the primary, most Democrats try to appease their radical base but then they moved towards the center in what's called the general election. Biden is different, he went hard left, stayed there, and is doubling down on even harder left and even more extreme policy. This isn't about bringing manufacturing jobs back or increasing wages. This is about full-blown extremism, socialism, redistributionism and the end of capitalism. And keep in mind, the 78-year-old Biden has been in elected office since the '70s. He served eight years as vice president. He gets zero tough questions from the mob and the media, why didn't he have any success in those eight years? Under President Trump, what have we witnessed? A boom in American manufacturing, the jobs they said weren't coming back. Now, it was Trump. It wasn't Barack. It wasn't Joe who brought those jobs back. Just like it was Trump who ushered in record after record after record after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and every demographic group we can think of. It was Trump who passed criminal justice reform and police reform. It wasn't Joe and it wasn't Barack. It was President Trump that created opportunities zones, that wasn't Joe, and that wasn't Barack. In five decades in the swamp, what the hell did Joe Biden do? But now, in order to please his far left handlers, Biden is now trashing law enforcement. Just this week, what did he do?

Apparently not on this issue. And, of course, your taxes, they will go through the roof. She's already plotting major tax hikes. So, let's keep track of this minor part of her radical agenda, Senator Harris would confiscate your private health insurance, your income, yep, it even says by executive fiat we are going to take away some of your guns, your plastic straws, your red meat and that list goes on. She wants the government to complete would dictate every aspect of your life.

I'm not a doctor, but he looks kind of fragile, tired, weak to me. And these -- well, constant embarrassments, they're beginning to raise a lot of serious questions. And people in the country are talking about it, whether the mob wants to cover it up or not. The confusion, the bouts of anger -- are you a junkie? Did you get tested for cocaine? Come on, man. Almost no one outside of this network even seems willing to seriously broach the subject. We will do our job. In fact, they are actively trying to cover up his apparent issues. Over there at state-run conspiracy television MSDNC -- well, they seemingly actually cropped out what appeared to be a written script of Biden and having a casual video conversation with Kamala Harris. And by the way, you can actually see Biden in that picture, he's holding the phone upside down. And ultimately the Biden campaign is hoping that Kamala Harris will bring a much-needed boost of energy, charisma, alertness, that Biden clearly lacks. That was those are fundamentals I think for the hardest job in the world and is one problem with that theory. Kamala -- well, she doesn't connect with voters. Her presidential bid was a massive failure, a flop. She dropped out in December before any primary or any caucus. She was pulling at a meager 2 percent or less, especially after Tulsi Gabbard's takedown. Even in her home state of California, she was pulling in single digits. They know her best. But fear not, the media mob, the cult that they are, that hates Trump 24/7, all they will do and say anything they can to help lift her up. Just take a look at today's front page, New York toilet paper \"Times\", it's worthless. Basically, it's as good as toilet paper. Compare it to their coverage in 2016 of Vice President Pence, Donald Trump's choice for a running mate.

We can't expect anything less from an American president. Well, the ever forgetful Joe must be confused yet again, because his day one was actually over 40 years ago. And he now has a track record that does not match his rhetoric. Now, way back in 1973, he was first sworn in as a U.S. senator. So, what did Biden do to end racism during his six terms in the U.S. Senate? His two terms as vice president of the United States? That is the subject of tonight's \"Hannity\" investigation into Biden and the issue of race relations 40 years of failure. We begin -- let's start in 1973. During a speech, then-Senator Joe Biden, he praised Southern Democrats and he said that the two-party system in the South was, quote, good for bleep, I can't say it. Around the same time, Biden was actively working with desegregationist in order to slow integration. He opposed school busing. According to NBC News, quote, he led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. In 1977, Biden worried that his children would grow up in a, quote, racial, his words, jungle if integration is not in a, quote, orderly way, whatever that means. And in 1993, he referred to inner city youth as, quote, predators on our streets, and he coauthored a very aggressive crime bill. Well, that ramped up prison sentences for dozens of crimes. We've got the video evidence, the videotape. Let's go to it."

They must be taken off the streets. We should focus on them now. Not out of a liberal instinct for love, brother and humanity, although I think that's a good instinct, but for simple pragmatic reasons.

This is the same guy that pretended to be a civil rights leader for years. After all, in 1987, he lied about marching in the civil rights protest. More recently, he lied about getting arrested by the apartheid South African government while on his way to see Nelson Mandela. A few weeks ago, he lied about his many political endorsements from the NAACP. They don't endorse -- they never endorsed him. And, by the way, what did he do to fix systemic racism? OK, it was under Barack and Joe's watch, Ferguson happened. Baltimore happened. Cambridge police happened. Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman happened. That was when he was vice president. So what did he do to fix the systematic racism in the ‘70s, the ‘80s, the ‘90s, the 2000s? In other words, does that sound -- does this what -- we're about to play -- he sound like a man who's particularly worried about racism to you? You decide. Take a look."

It wasn't Joe and it was not Barack who signed off on police reform. It was Donald Trump also doing opportunity zones, targeting mostly minority neighborhoods to help -- well, build the economies in neighborhoods that have been left behind by Joe and Barack. It was President Trump, not Joe, not Barack, who ushered in record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. Joe and Barack, they didn't do any of that. As a matter of fact, 13 million more Americans in food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate in, oh, since the ‘70s. Had a 51-year low in homeownership rate, and the worst recovery since the '40s. That's their eight years of failure.

I'm not a doctor. I don't know what's going on with Biden but it's obvious that something is off, very off. And even though he barely leaves his basement bunker, he looks exhausted. Kind of looks like he needs a hot cocoa and a little nappy every day. Now, given what we see, wouldn't it be a good idea for him to take that cognitive test? By the way, a comprehensive physical exam, share the results with the American people. President Trump has already done that and more. It's an honest question at this point, and before early voting starts, we the American people deserve an answer."
