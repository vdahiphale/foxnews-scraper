Now, tonight, we are inching closer and closer to real truth, real justice and holding those who abuse power at the highest levels accountable. For over two years on this program, we watched a political witch hunt like we have never seen in American politics before, based on lies and smears and outright conspiracy theories. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And just like we've been telling you all week, the Russia hoax has now completely unraveled. The Mueller report is over, it is dead, it is buried. We have now had four separate investigations. Oh, the FBI nine- month investigation, House Intel Committee, bipartisan Senate committee, and even the Mueller report -- no collusion, no conspiracy with Russia. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as we predicted, it's now boomeranging right on to those who did abuse power, did try to influence the outcome of an election and then overturn a duly elected president. Act 1 is over. The curtain is beginning to rise. Act 2 begins. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is a new sheriff in town and his name is Bill Barr.

We've uncovered, yes, the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern political history, maybe in all of our history. So, tonight for you, we have a special show. We have brought in together the all-star ensemble cast, those that have every step of the way been helping America get to the truth and exposing the spying scandal, this Russian conspiracy theory since the start. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, tonight, for the full hour, we're going to break it all down. We're going to do what we do night after night. We're going to stick to the facts and the truth. We're going to be honest, and when every one else, the 99 percent of liars that push hoax and conspiracy theories, the media mob, as they continue to be wrong, a rigged investigation into Hillary Clinton to save their favorite candidate, the dirty Russian dossier, FISA abuse fraud, literally, purposely misleading, committing a fraud on a court on multiple occasions, using spies and informants to deep state efforts to undermine a president-elected by you, the American people, after they first tried to steal an election. Tonight, we shine a spotlight on all of this and tonight, we're taking it apart piece by piece, because we are only days away from the release now that the classification has occurred of major documents that will all expose the real election scandal, the real efforts to spy on the Trump campaign, FISA applications, 302s, Gang of Eight intel material, exculpatory material. As I said, an avalanche is coming. The cascading down with truth for the American people. There's no stopping it now. It's not a matter of if. It is when this all becomes public, so the gig is up. For the hate-Trump media mob, their Democratic allies, they've been pushing lie after lie after lie for 2.5 years ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And also remember this which is really important, because how this all started, a phony investigation, it all started because Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero. And, by the way, if you voted for Donald Trump, you are a smelly Walmart voter. I like Walmart. And, by the way, you're an irredeemable deplorable that clings to your god, your guns, your bible and religion. That's what the Democratic Party thinks of us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A massive amount of top secret classified material was found on her unsecured private server in a mom and pop bathroom closet called and managed by Platte River Networks. Yes, that's a crime, 18 USC 793. She committed real felonies and she had a clear intent when she destroyed the evidence by deleting 33,000 emails, Bleach Bit on the hard drive, busting up devices with hammers and removing SIM cards. Where's all the Democratic and media hysteria about real obstruction, with a real crime, real intention? Oh, that's right. One standard for the Clintons, one standard for Democrats and one for everybody else. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at your screen. Look at what the violation is, 18 USC 793. We've talked often about it. So, why was Hillary Clinton cleared? Why did they rig that investigation? Why did Comey and Strzok -- you know, why did they change in May of 2016 before they ever interviewed Hillary or the other people involved? Why did they change it from the legal standard of gross negligence to extreme carelessness? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There was clear, overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence that this secret classified information was mishandled and put on a server which made it illegal, multiple felonies. Clear, incontrovertible evidence she destroyed the 33,000 subpoenaed emails and did all of the things to eliminate all the evidence. And remember, the Strzok and Ppage text about the Trump voters, remember, smelly Walmart people, Hillary, remember, win 100 million to zero. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, they were the lead investigators in this case and then immediately turned on Donald Trump. After Strzok who was the one that interviewed Clinton and actually allowed two other people in the room at the same time, that never happens. He was writing Hillary's exoneration in May, that didn't interview her until July 2nd of 2016, Comey cleared her on July 5th, 2016. But not before Cheryl Mills was granted immunity, not before the infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton and the attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, what did Lynch know? When did she know it? Because Strzok and Page also say that, oh, Loretta Lynch rigged Hillary's investigation. Horribly flawed, an injustice, and if we want to save this great democratic republic that we inherited, that so many sacrificed and died for, we must have equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws and we must be ever so vigilant to be a constitutional republic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } After Clinton lost, then the insurance policy kicked in. All roads lead back to the dirty Russian dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton, the DNC, with funneled money through her law firm, into an op research firm. And then, yes, a guy, a foreign national that put these Russian lies together. Then those Russian lies bulk of information as the Nunes memo, the Grassley-Graham memo says, to literally spy not only on Carter Page but a back door to spy on all things Trump campaign, all things transition team Trump, all things President Trump, put together by Christopher Steele who didn't even standby his own work, an interrogatory in Great Britain said, I have no idea if any of this is true. He was also being paid by Fusion GPS, but really paid by Hillary. And remember, DOJ official Bruce Ohr, at the time the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, he was warning in August of 2016. Steele hated Trump and Hillary paid for it and none is verified. Now even the \"New York Times\", of course, two years later in this show, says the dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the very beginning. And the State Department official, John Solomon, broke the story that Kathleen Kavalec was also sounding the alarm after meeting with Steele days, 10, 12 days before the first FISA application was signed by Jim Comey. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Night after night, we have literally been unpeeling the layers of this onion and ripping the mask off all of this corruption, trying to get to the truth to expose what has happened here. This was an attempt to literally fix a presidential election and destroy a duly elected president. There is a deep state. And now, the day of reckoning has come, and, by the way, the time for accountability is now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right.

This guy, Judicial Watch president, Mr. FOIA himself, Tom Fitton, is here, and Fox News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen, that sees his party imploding before his eyes and will admit it. First of all, and I mean this with all my heart. We wouldn't be here today, they probably would have succeeded had it not been for every single one of you. I applaud all of you for your deep digging and the hard work and the tough analysis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And you as a former liberal, really being fair and wanting our president to succeed.

We have experienced some of the most powerful people in our government, Comey, Clapper, Brennan, using the power of the United States government to prove that the candidate Trump, President-Elect Trump, President Trump was a traitor, was a spy for the Russians, was a person whose loyalty lay outside the constitution, outside of the United States, and had sold his soul to the neo-communist devil.

Right now, we have a team of investigators, detectives from the City of Virginia Beach being assisted by forensic technicians from the FBI and the state police in processing this most horrific scene. We're in the process of identifying victims and making notification to their families. I can tell you that we do have an additional victim to report. We now have 12. One victim succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. We also have four additional victims being treated at area hospitals, and we have reports that others may have self-transported. So, as we get more information on that, we will begin to release it. Our process is always to notify family members prior to releasing names. We do know who the suspect is. We have not been successful in notifying certain family members. Once we are able to do that, we will release his name once. We're going to mention his name once. And then he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families. I can tell you that when the initial call came out of an active shoot in building two. Building number two in our city houses information technology, planning, public works and public utilities, plus a printing operation. This building has a potential of having over 400 city workers at one time or other in the building. When the original call came out, immediately four officers responded. Two were seasoned veteran supervisors from the Detective Bureau and we have two K-9 handlers who were assigned to our special operations unit. They immediately made entry into the building. Due to the sound of gunfire, they were able to locate the floor on which the suspect was committing his crimes. They immediately engaged with the suspect. And I can tell you that it was a long gun battle between those four officers and that suspect. We recovered a .45 caliber handgun with multiple extended magazines that were emptied at the time. The suspect was reloading extended magazines in that handgun, firing at victims throughout the building and at our officers. I want you to know that during this gun battle, basically the officers stopped this individual from committing more crimes in that building. When the suspect went down due to his injuries, our officers then immediately rendered first aid, as they were removing him from the building to the waiting EMS personnel. I need to say that a second time. Even though he was involved in a long-term moving gun battle with these officers, when he went down, they did what cops do and they rendered first aid to this individual. He succumbed to his wound. We have found victims on all three floors of the building as well as one victim who was outside in a vehicle. Right now, as many as 90 people have sought support from the Family Assistance Center. And again, we are in the process. Our goal now is to identify everyone in that building as quick as we can, so we can make the proper notifications to the families of those victims.

Now, tonight, we are inching closer and closer to real truth, real justice and holding those who abuse power at the highest levels accountable. For over two years on this program, we watched a political witch hunt like we have never seen in American politics before, based on lies and smears and outright conspiracy theories. And just like we've been telling you all week, the Russia hoax has now completely unraveled. The Mueller report is over, it is dead, it is buried. We have now had four separate investigations. Oh, the FBI nine- month investigation, House Intel Committee, bipartisan Senate committee, and even the Mueller report -- no collusion, no conspiracy with Russia. And as we predicted, it's now boomeranging right on to those who did abuse power, did try to influence the outcome of an election and then overturn a duly elected president. Act 1 is over. The curtain is beginning to rise. Act 2 begins. There is a new sheriff in town and his name is Bill Barr. And earlier today, he weighed in on the origins of the Russia probe. Take a look at this."

      "utterance": "Things are not jiving. On this show now, we have been honest from the start. And in the process, over two years, we have been digging deep. We've uncovered, yes, the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern political history, maybe in all of our history. So, tonight for you, we have a special show. We have brought in together the all-star ensemble cast, those that have every step of the way been helping America get to the truth and exposing the spying scandal, this Russian conspiracy theory since the start. So, tonight, for the full hour, we're going to break it all down. We're going to do what we do night after night. We're going to stick to the facts and the truth. We're going to be honest, and when every one else, the 99 percent of liars that push hoax and conspiracy theories, the media mob, as they continue to be wrong, a rigged investigation into Hillary Clinton to save their favorite candidate, the dirty Russian dossier, FISA abuse fraud, literally, purposely misleading, committing a fraud on a court on multiple occasions, using spies and informants to deep state efforts to undermine a president-elected by you, the American people, after they first tried to steal an election. Tonight, we shine a spotlight on all of this and tonight, we're taking it apart piece by piece, because we are only days away from the release now that the classification has occurred of major documents that will all expose the real election scandal, the real efforts to spy on the Trump campaign, FISA applications, 302s, Gang of Eight intel material, exculpatory material. As I said, an avalanche is coming. The cascading down with truth for the American people. There's no stopping it now. It's not a matter of if. It is when this all becomes public, so the gig is up. For the hate-Trump media mob, their Democratic allies, they've been pushing lie after lie after lie for 2.5 years ago. And also remember this which is really important, because how this all started, a phony investigation, it all started because Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero. And, by the way, if you voted for Donald Trump, you are a smelly Walmart voter. I like Walmart. And, by the way, you're an irredeemable deplorable that clings to your god, your guns, your bible and religion. That's what the Democratic Party thinks of us. A massive amount of top secret classified material was found on her unsecured private server in a mom and pop bathroom closet called and managed by Platte River Networks. Yes, that's a crime, 18 USC 793. She committed real felonies and she had a clear intent when she destroyed the evidence by deleting 33,000 emails, Bleach Bit on the hard drive, busting up devices with hammers and removing SIM cards. Where's all the Democratic and media hysteria about real obstruction, with a real crime, real intention? Oh, that's right. One standard for the Clintons, one standard for Democrats and one for everybody else. Look at your screen. Look at what the violation is, 18 USC 793. We've talked often about it. So, why was Hillary Clinton cleared? Why did they rig that investigation? Why did Comey and Strzok -- you know, why did they change in May of 2016 before they ever interviewed Hillary or the other people involved? Why did they change it from the legal standard of gross negligence to extreme carelessness? There was clear, overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence that this secret classified information was mishandled and put on a server which made it illegal, multiple felonies. Clear, incontrovertible evidence she destroyed the 33,000 subpoenaed emails and did all of the things to eliminate all the evidence. And remember, the Strzok and Ppage text about the Trump voters, remember, smelly Walmart people, Hillary, remember, win 100 million to zero. Well, they were the lead investigators in this case and then immediately turned on Donald Trump. After Strzok who was the one that interviewed Clinton and actually allowed two other people in the room at the same time, that never happens. He was writing Hillary's exoneration in May, that didn't interview her until July 2nd of 2016, Comey cleared her on July 5th, 2016. But not before Cheryl Mills was granted immunity, not before the infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton and the attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch. So, what did Lynch know? When did she know it? Because Strzok and Page also say that, oh, Loretta Lynch rigged Hillary's investigation. Horribly flawed, an injustice, and if we want to save this great democratic republic that we inherited, that so many sacrificed and died for, we must have equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws and we must be ever so vigilant to be a constitutional republic. After Clinton lost, then the insurance policy kicked in. All roads lead back to the dirty Russian dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton, the DNC, with funneled money through her law firm, into an op research firm. And then, yes, a guy, a foreign national that put these Russian lies together. Then those Russian lies bulk of information as the Nunes memo, the Grassley-Graham memo says, to literally spy not only on Carter Page but a back door to spy on all things Trump campaign, all things transition team Trump, all things President Trump, put together by Christopher Steele who didn't even standby his own work, an interrogatory in Great Britain said, I have no idea if any of this is true. He was also being paid by Fusion GPS, but really paid by Hillary. And remember, DOJ official Bruce Ohr, at the time the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, he was warning in August of 2016. Steele hated Trump and Hillary paid for it and none is verified. Now even the \"New York Times\", of course, two years later in this show, says the dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the very beginning. And the State Department official, John Solomon, broke the story that Kathleen Kavalec was also sounding the alarm after meeting with Steele days, 10, 12 days before the first FISA application was signed by Jim Comey. Night after night, we have literally been unpeeling the layers of this onion and ripping the mask off all of this corruption, trying to get to the truth to expose what has happened here. This was an attempt to literally fix a presidential election and destroy a duly elected president. There is a deep state. And now, the day of reckoning has come, and, by the way, the time for accountability is now. All right. Joining us now, you look at this great panel we have. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, Fox News investigative reporter Sara Carter, investigative reporter, lead guy at \"The Hill\", John Solomon, former deputy assistant attorney general, Victoria Toensing, former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova, American Conservative Union chair, Matt Schlapp, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera. This guy, Judicial Watch president, Mr. FOIA himself, Tom Fitton, is here, and Fox News contributor, former Clinton pollster Doug Schoen, that sees his party imploding before his eyes and will admit it. First of all, and I mean this with all my heart. We wouldn't be here today, they probably would have succeeded had it not been for every single one of you. I applaud all of you for your deep digging and the hard work and the tough analysis. And you as a former liberal, really being fair and wanting our president to succeed. Thank you all. I give you all a big hand."

And doesn't that scare people? And when I was told over and over again by these lawyers, don't worry, there are people in place, I wonder who they were, that have the best interest of the country, they will always safeguard these programs and we will make sure people of sterling character get to make the final decision. And so, going back to what you said about Obama, Biden, Lynch, James Comey who I have a distinction of refusing his political check for his first job in the Bush administration. What did the AG said?

      "utterance": "Good evening. This is a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our hearts ache over the senseless violence that has been inflicted upon the Virginia Beach community today. My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning and will not return tonight. They were all someone's child, and many were someone's parent. They were heading into the summer weekend. That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy. Their families are facing painful loss and grief. They each leave a hole in a family, in their neighborhood, in this community, and in our commonwealth. We mourn with their loved ones, but sympathy doesn't fill that hole. We must take care of these families. These horrific tragedies test our souls. Grief doesn't pass quickly. It lasts far beyond these coming days, and these families will need support in the months and years to come. I'm also praying for those who were injured in this tragedy and hoping for their full recovery. Along with the pain of their own injuries, they face the loss of their co-workers and their friends. I want to commend the local and state law enforcement officers, the first responders, the medical teams, and all others who acted swiftly to respond to this situation. Their actions likely saved lives. And they have experienced scenes and injuries no one should ever have to face. My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families. To them and to the City of Virginia Beach, I offer the full support of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Tonight, we are all about Virginia Beach. I'd now like to turn the podium over to our Mayor of Virginia Beach, Mayor Dyer."

      "utterance": "Today is Virginia Beach's darkest hour. A senseless crime happened and imposed tremendous grief upon the people of Virginia Beach, the commonwealth and this country. When we get through the shock of it all and we get through the details that we must go through over the next day or two, I believe that our community, Virginia Beach, along with our neighbors and our other cities in Hampton Roads and our commonwealth and our country, we'll be there for not only the families, because that's when they're going to need us going forward, but we're going to show that Virginia Beach is a city of resolve and dedication. And we are going to be there for all the families, the friends and our community in a big way. And with that, I thank you, and I would like to turn this over to Chief Cervera for an update."

      "utterance": "As I said earlier this evening, as we are able to gather more information, we will give that information out. So this is the additional information that I have at this time. Again, it will probably change a little and it may increase as we move forward, as we're investigating this case. Right now, we have a team of investigators, detectives from the City of Virginia Beach being assisted by forensic technicians from the FBI and the state police in processing this most horrific scene. We're in the process of identifying victims and making notification to their families. I can tell you that we do have an additional victim to report. We now have 12. One victim succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. We also have four additional victims being treated at area hospitals, and we have reports that others may have self-transported. So, as we get more information on that, we will begin to release it. Our process is always to notify family members prior to releasing names. We do know who the suspect is. We have not been successful in notifying certain family members. Once we are able to do that, we will release his name once. We're going to mention his name once. And then he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families. I can tell you that when the initial call came out of an active shoot in building two. Building number two in our city houses information technology, planning, public works and public utilities, plus a printing operation. This building has a potential of having over 400 city workers at one time or other in the building. When the original call came out, immediately four officers responded. Two were seasoned veteran supervisors from the Detective Bureau and we have two K-9 handlers who were assigned to our special operations unit. They immediately made entry into the building. Due to the sound of gunfire, they were able to locate the floor on which the suspect was committing his crimes. They immediately engaged with the suspect. And I can tell you that it was a long gun battle between those four officers and that suspect. We recovered a .45 caliber handgun with multiple extended magazines that were emptied at the time. The suspect was reloading extended magazines in that handgun, firing at victims throughout the building and at our officers. I want you to know that during this gun battle, basically the officers stopped this individual from committing more crimes in that building. When the suspect went down due to his injuries, our officers then immediately rendered first aid, as they were removing him from the building to the waiting EMS personnel. I need to say that a second time. Even though he was involved in a long-term moving gun battle with these officers, when he went down, they did what cops do and they rendered first aid to this individual. He succumbed to his wound. We have found victims on all three floors of the building as well as one victim who was outside in a vehicle. Right now, as many as 90 people have sought support from the Family Assistance Center. And again, we are in the process. Our goal now is to identify everyone in that building as quick as we can, so we can make the proper notifications to the families of those victims. Do we have any questions?"

So when we talk about this kind of a situation, and many times when we talk about an officer involved in shooting situation, it may be minimal rounds by the suspect and by the police officers.

So we do train extensively, both on what we call table-top exercises as well as on all hands-on exercise in a building. So I could tell you that we do train extensively. And how many weeks or months prior, I can't give you the exact number.
