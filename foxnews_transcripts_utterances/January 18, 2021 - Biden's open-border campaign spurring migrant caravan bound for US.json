And President Biden needs to reinvigorate the FCC or else terrorism - the terrorism that we saw on January 6th, may be only the beginning rather than the end of the plot against America. Dinesh, the new authoritarians now want government censorship. After calling Trump it for years they are now the real fascists."

And fascism, which is one variation of socialism, is when the government works in collusion with private industry and private agencies to carry out the state's bidding. So this is basically what Boot is advocating. He's calling for the government through the FCC to muzzle the political critics, the most influential political organ that is critical of the Biden administration, and this is a pure undermining of the kind of give and take of criticism that is essential to the democratic process. Essentially Boot is advocating a new form of fascism."

Now they're trying to take that where they have no clear mandate, the country is evenly divided, and they're now trying to demonize and criminalize all the people who voted on the other side. They're trying to turn the opposition into a kind of captive population. And that's why all their analogies come from foreign wars. They talk about ISIS, they talk about Al-Qaeda, they talk about the Ba'ath Party. Well, basically, we deal with those people with bombs and with bullets, so they're acting like domestic critics.

And so today the government doesn't even need the tools, the FBI doesn't need those tools, they just need to make one phone call to their corporate allies at big tech and big tech will do it for them. We have seen the deplatforming of large groups of conservatives. And I'm not talking about fringe people, I'm not talking about QAnon supporters, I'm not talking about anybody crazy. I'm talking about mainstream conservatives. They're shutting down the means of communication. And this is what foreign governments do right before they crack down on their citizens as they jam the airwaves, they cut off the means of communication. So, we have already been having surveillance of our citizens for many years. And now that the Left is taking control of that information, we already have I think a politicized FBI. I think only bad things are going to come. And I wish I could say that Americans are going to rise up and Americans are going to be alert about this. But remember that our country was - people did not stand up as much as they should have against McCarthyism.

There are somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 National Guardsmen and armed soldiers in our city right now here in Washington, D.C. They're shutting down bridges everywhere we go. If you went down to the Florida State Capitol, for example on Sunday, which was heavily fortified, there were five protesters there, including the number of anarchists and an Antifa member. The police outnumbered protesters in every one of this city. At New York's Capitol where Cuomo had set up three realms of - three lines of security, there were no protesters, only journalists. And here in D.C. today the police were going around block to block, warning people in Downtown Capitol Hill that they had to evacuate their homes over some potential insurgent activity, when it turned out it was one of the homeless people.

So he knew his words during this campaign, the promises he made, he knew would cause a caravan. He knew it was causing - losing control at the border. But his quest for power and to satisfy the Far Left and get their votes meant more to him than the safety and security of this country, that's what's most alarming to me.

Now they're going to go down to 31,000, which they will fill those beds in a matter of two weeks when the surge comes. So what do we do with the hundreds of thousands that can come across the border in the next few months? They're going to be released in the United States. And they're going to wait and hide out long enough until the next amnesty comes along or the next DACA comes along. Let's remember the family crisis, the surge in FY '14 and '15 come on the heels of creating DACA, rewarding bad behavior and they're - we're going to do it again."

The Paris Climate Deal, one of the issues was that, nations like China didn't have to make big concessions in order to enter the deal. Put aside the fact this is a treaty that was never presented to the Senate for the ratification.

Reverse all of it or only - you only plan on reversing part of it. And as they were getting called out on the fact that ultimately that would mean a lot of people would end up with a tax increase, then they tried to wordsmith their answers as they were getting called out on it. But, you know what, Joe Biden basically every morning would get away with calling a lid on his day at 7:00 or 8:00 a.m. The media was really in the tank for him, so they were OK with the fact that they weren't able to ask the tough questions and work the accountability, because they wanted to get Donald Trump out of office. The first example you gave, the World Health Organization, this time last year the World Health Organization was lying to the United States and the rest of the world about what was going on with coronavirus. They were lying that there was no evidence whatsoever of human to human transmission, parroting CCP talking points. So as you go down that list, starting at the beginning with the Keystone XL pipeline, Paris Climate Deal, Iran nuclear deal, World Health Organization, the other examples that you gave, he might have gotten himself elected to this presidency, he might be taking the oath on Wednesday, but this is going to result in harm to our economy, to job growth, to national security, energy independence, and far more.

How else are people supposed to talk to their representative if not in person? Look, I'm not supportive of the incivility of this crowd and the name calling when they were yelling at the senators, both Lindsey Graham and Romney. But these voters are frustrated, Judge. They want answers. And this isn't unlike the reaction after the Obamacare decision which I covered years ago. Pelosi and company didn't like those Tea Party people outside the capital talking back either. But ignoring them and demeaning them and creating all of this chaos, it creates a political frustration that fueled the rise of Donald Trump. And they are seeding their own political destruction again. But my question, Judge, is it legal for Delta to just say you can't fly because you talked back to a senator, we didn't like it in the waiting room."

After that, a spokesman for Delta says no, they are not on a no-fly list. So they haven't figured out, which tells me they haven't figured out what the law is. But I suspect that, as a private airline, they can do what they want. But the hook, obviously, is where you have federal monies that have been saving them from being grounded. Yes, so that federal money. But you see, I am hearing about people who are being taken off of planes because they have a MAGA mask on, and then they're being told, well, you didn't have a mask covering enough of your face. And you, by the way, no doubt, speaking of masks, there are frightening things about the new strain of COVID. What do you hear is the truth now?"

We know that mutant strains are going to occur with virtually any pandemic, and the mutant strain coming out of the United Kingdom is showing that it's being neutralized by monoclonal antibodies, but the antibodies from people who recovered from COVID-19, as well as antibodies induced by the vaccine. So I think that the gloom and doom, Chicken Little, sky is falling thing is way overdone. And it's really unfortunate."

Last March he made some comment where we could end up having something more than 2.5 million people dead. He also has told us that hockey rinks are especially bad places for a virus to go. He's told us economically that we can pay for all of the lost wages for employees, small businesses, city, county governments. He's become an economist there. He said that perhaps we're at the bottom of the third inning with this pandemic. I would say we're in the middle of the seventh inning. In we're in the bottom of the third inning, we've got two more years of this, and if you look at the pandemic in 2009, that lasted 19 months. If you look at the pandemic I 1918, that lasted 26 months. I don't think this pandemic is going to last 36 months, but if you want to be gloom and doom, it certainly does paralyze people's ability to think for themselves."

Biden came out and said, we don't have to crush the economy. And Governor Cuomo said we have to open or there won't be anything left to open. At some point, some of these kinds of comments are literally just fearmongering noise. I don't think it benefits anything. We should be celebrating what's going on."

Of course, the WHO won't lift a finger to hold China accountable, and don't expect Joe Biden to hold their feet to the fire either. THE INGRAHAM ANGLE has documented many troubling ties between China and incoming Biden administration officials. And tonight, we have another. According to \"The Free Beacon,\" the man Biden has tapped for undersecretary of defense, Colin Kahl, works at a research center that is partnered with China's Peking University, a school intel officials have long considered a security risk. Joining me now is Steve Mosher, China expert and author of \"The Bully of Asia.\" Steve, how troubling is this association?"

And given the scrutiny that will be on Joe Biden himself and Hunter Biden and the rest of the Biden family, they won't be inking any sweetheart deals in China. They won't be inviting, I don't think, Hunter on Air Force One when Joe Biden visits China if he does, or if the secretary of state goes there. But I'm really worried about the second tier or the third tier people in the administration, because many of them have long-standing ties with China going back decades. And we go our policy wrong for decades. We finally have a clear-eyed policy towards China thanks to President Trump, thanks to Mike Pompeo, Peter Navarro, and others in the Trump administration. And it would be a shame to go to China with a great big reset button, remember the one that Hillary Clinton brought to Russia, and say we are going to completely reset our China policy and go back to the failed policy of the Obama/Biden administration, which really put China on a glide path to dominate the world. In 2016 people were predicting that by 2020, the Chinese economy would be larger -- the Chinese military would be as formidable as the U.S. military, or gradually creeping up to that. That didn't happen because of the tough- minded Trump policies."
