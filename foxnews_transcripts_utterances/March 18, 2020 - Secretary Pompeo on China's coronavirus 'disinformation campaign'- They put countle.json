Also, their lies, propaganda, their months-long cover-up is now causing death and destruction and carnage all over the world. They're now hurting this country and other countries. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, some, by the way, also tonight, we'll cover these people in the media mob unwittingly doing the bidding of China, spreading propaganda and, of course, blaming Trump and FOX News for murder, and even yours truly for the spread of all of this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These comments are so insane, inappropriate, over-the-top, out of line.

Now, this is a move that will massively ramp up the production and the distribution of very important medical supplies, ventilators, respirators.

Not just on a vaccine, but also treatments that will mitigate or even prevent the contraction of the virus, or the effects of the virus if you do get it. Hours ago, the president gave us a little preview of what we can expect tomorrow. This is getting interesting.

Three days later, on social media, top director at the Wuhan central hospital tried to warn the public about this dangerous new disease and how it was spreading from person to person. She was subsequently reprimanded and censored. Then on January 1st, eight other doctors who posted information about the disease online were called in for questioning, also censored. And January 7th, the president of China became directly involved in the response. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } January 11th, the Wuhan health commission insisted there were no new cases, which we now know is a blatant lie. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } January 14th, World Health Organization at this late date tweeting, quote, Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the virus. Really? And get this -- four days later, China hosted its annual Lunar New Year banquet. Guess where? In the city of Wuhan, where tens of thousands of people got together for a potluck supper. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It wasn't until January 20th that China admitted the disease can spread from person to person. The first person that we know had corona in America arrived on January 21st. Ten days later, the president's travel ban, the single best decision made to date by any country. He gave us time, saved countless thousands of Americans from contracting the virus, and likely many deaths. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, by the way, at that point, it was too late. COVID-19 had already spread to South Korea. A day later, the first case confirmed here. That's the 21st. I'm just talking about. Probably already multiple cases in Italy, which we now have discovered had direct flights from Wuhan, that province, and a large Chinese population working in their textile industry. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For weeks, China could have sounded the alarm. Instead, they lied, they tried to cover it up, and they had massive potluck celebrations at the epicenter of this disease. And now, China's government, now, they're spreading baseless conspiracy theories, blaming the U.S. military for the spread of the disease. There are even proliferating and insane talking point that using the word China or Wuhan virus to describe the Wuhan virus is racist. And, of course, many social justice warriors in the media mob, not particularly concerned that much about health. No, they want political correctness, even at a time like this, unwittingly echoing what is a Chinese propaganda talking point.

The death toll as of today stands at 118 and all of this taking place as Congress and the White House continue to move ahead on a series of aggressive aid packages which are really designed to help the American worker. Health officials are continuing to work at a rapid pace, they say, to combat the virus with new research and developments, and that is what the president teased earlier today when he said there would be some major news coming from the FDA.

I don't -- I'm not a doctor and I will not play one on TV, but you keep hearing about this malaria drug that has shown previously with SARS, which corona one, if you will, a corona-live virus that they've had a lot of success with, chloroquine phosphate, also talk about an Ebola drug that is showing some impact and other drugs that perhaps the president will be talking about tomorrow with the FDA I would assume rapidly moving forward with the process.

I mean, this is where America shines, big, audacious goals in the area of science coming out of our research universities and institutes. So, we've developed a vaccine that we're hoping to move into clinical trials over the next few weeks. There will be several other vaccines, but vaccines are going to take a while. That's probably at least a year, year and a half away, according to Dr. Fauci, and I think he's right. Maybe longer. But there's still a lot we can do right now, and one of them is new antiviral drugs, which the timelines could be a lot quicker. And you mentioned chloroquine, there's some promising data coming out of my colleague, (INAUDIBLE) who is out of southern France. And that could be potentially exciting if it holds up. And there's two reasons I'm interested by it. One, the drug itself can show to inhibit virus replication in the test tube. That doesn't mean it works and the person. But it also has some anti-inflammatory effects. So, those two combined to make it a very intriguing drug, and there are some preliminary data. So, we'll see how that moves along over the coming weeks in clinical trials. So, that's what I'm looking at. You mentioned some of the other antiviral drugs and also bringing on some antibodies, isolated from recovered patients and using that as a therapy.",

I think the good news here is what the president is going to say is that he got rid of a lot of those regulations and standard operating procedures that make it difficult to push drugs out. We're going to focus on drugs that are already out there, that are being used for other diseases. That's going to really expedite things, because these drugs are -- most of them have already been proven safe in humans, so it's just going to be a matter of time and the ones that work and not having to prove they are safe for human consumption.

So, it's very important that until we get those, which I think will be coming online at a relatively short period of time to compare to what it would normally take, that we do those things to try and keep each other from getting this virus.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, buckle up, we have a lot of ground to cover. We track multiple breaking stories tonight, and coming up, we will have a very serious message for China's hostile dictatorship. Also, their lies, propaganda, their months-long cover-up is now causing death and destruction and carnage all over the world. They're now hurting this country and other countries. Now, some, by the way, also tonight, we'll cover these people in the media mob unwittingly doing the bidding of China, spreading propaganda and, of course, blaming Trump and FOX News for murder, and even yours truly for the spread of all of this. These comments are so insane, inappropriate, over-the-top, out of line. We will call out the mob's despicable coverage. First, tonight, though, like every night, we want to start with facts that will help you and your family stay safe and secure without the fear, hysteria, and panic that others are peddling. Clearly, the U.S. response to this pandemic is unlike anything we have ever witnessed or ever seen. And today, the president invoked what is known as the Defense Production Act. Now, this is a move that will massively ramp up the production and the distribution of very important medical supplies, ventilators, respirators. This will include 500 million new N95 masks. The president also dispatched earlier today two Navy hospital ships, one to the East Coast, one to the West Coast. The Pentagon is now preparing mobile medical units to be deployed all over the country as they are needed, if they are needed. Meanwhile, America's brilliant medical researchers, scientists, doctors, health care workers, they have been working around the clock as usual. Not just on a vaccine, but also treatments that will mitigate or even prevent the contraction of the virus, or the effects of the virus if you do get it. Hours ago, the president gave us a little preview of what we can expect tomorrow. This is getting interesting. Take a look."

The FDA will be -- they've been working very, very hard, and I appreciate what they're doing, and I think we have some very interesting things that will be brought up tomorrow at the news conference. It will be set up around I think at around 11:00 or so. But we look forward to seeing you tomorrow."

There are now multiple antiviral medications being studied. Many have been tested. One that was previously used against Ebola. One anti-malaria medication developed decades ago showing a lot of promise. It has been used in the course of this particular coronavirus outbreak. And, of course, we do expect in the short term that the confirmed cases will dramatically increase. We've been preparing you for that. But again, if we all follow the rules laid out by the president's task force, they're not that difficult, were going to be helping every American, especially the most vulnerable. The elderly, with underlying medical conditions, compromised immune systems. In the meantime, we look forward to the coming announcement from the president and the FDA tomorrow. Without a doubt, we're the greatest country on Earth. Got to remember that. Yes, we will get through this. We've been through tough times and we always prevail.

It's going to have no place to go. And I just want to thank you. As president, I want to thank you for the incredible job you're all doing.

      "utterance": "This is an all-hands-on-deck moment and we're seeing the greatness of the American people on display every day, at every level. Once we beat back the virus, China must be held accountable. Their hostile government cares more about optics than the lives of not only their own citizens, but the world community. This massive cover-up and the critical early stages of this disease, frankly, unforgivable. It is an indisputable fact that China lied. People all over the world suffering and dying as a result of these lies. Axios really put together what is a comprehensive timeline that you need to see. We'll start on December 10th, 2019, last year. That's when one of first known coronavirus patients becomes ill. Then on December 27th, Wuhan health officials determined a new type of coronavirus was spreading. Three days later, on social media, top director at the Wuhan central hospital tried to warn the public about this dangerous new disease and how it was spreading from person to person. She was subsequently reprimanded and censored. Then on January 1st, eight other doctors who posted information about the disease online were called in for questioning, also censored. And January 7th, the president of China became directly involved in the response. January 11th, the Wuhan health commission insisted there were no new cases, which we now know is a blatant lie. January 14th, World Health Organization at this late date tweeting, quote, Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the virus. Really? And get this -- four days later, China hosted its annual Lunar New Year banquet. Guess where? In the city of Wuhan, where tens of thousands of people got together for a potluck supper. It wasn't until January 20th that China admitted the disease can spread from person to person. The first person that we know had corona in America arrived on January 21st. Ten days later, the president's travel ban, the single best decision made to date by any country. He gave us time, saved countless thousands of Americans from contracting the virus, and likely many deaths. Now, by the way, at that point, it was too late. COVID-19 had already spread to South Korea. A day later, the first case confirmed here. That's the 21st. I'm just talking about. Probably already multiple cases in Italy, which we now have discovered had direct flights from Wuhan, that province, and a large Chinese population working in their textile industry. For weeks, China could have sounded the alarm. Instead, they lied, they tried to cover it up, and they had massive potluck celebrations at the epicenter of this disease. And now, China's government, now, they're spreading baseless conspiracy theories, blaming the U.S. military for the spread of the disease. There are even proliferating and insane talking point that using the word China or Wuhan virus to describe the Wuhan virus is racist. And, of course, many social justice warriors in the media mob, not particularly concerned that much about health. No, they want political correctness, even at a time like this, unwittingly echoing what is a Chinese propaganda talking point. Take a look."

That's named after a river in Africa. And there's the Spanish flu, and then the Middle Eastern respiratory system known as MERS, and we can go on and on. Ultimately, the facts are clear. The Chinese government tried to cover it up. Recently, they kicked out all American -- well, I have to say so-called because I don't exactly trust fake news. The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, but I do want them there. And now, because of China's actions, thousands around the world are dead, millions others are suffering, and China must be held accountable. Here with a lot more on this and so much more, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, great to see you. Thank you for being with us.

This disinformation campaign which began when we began to call out this -- this risk that was created not only for the Chinese people but now, we can see people all across the world, where (ph) the Chinese government knew about this risk, had identified it, they were the first to know, and they wasted valuable days at the front end, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to leave Wuhan, to go to places like Italy, that's now suffering so badly. They tried to suppress this information. We talked about the means by which they did it.

You'll recall early on, we offered to have America's finest experts to travel there to assist them, to assist the World Health Organization. We weren't permitted in. These are the kinds of things that the Chinese Communist Party has done that had put the world and the world's people at risk. They haven't been sufficiently transparent, and the risk, Sean, that you find, where if we don't get this right, if we don't get to the bottom of this, is this could -- this could be something that's repeatable, maybe not in this form, maybe not on this way, but transparency matters. That's why when we see them forcing journalists out, when we see people who've been talking about this, Chinese citizens who have been talking about this no longer having access to the Internet, no longer able to speak openly and freely, there's risks, there's questions. And it's important, as a -- America's most senior diplomat, we have an obligation to try and help make sure that we get this information from the Chinese Communist Party so we can help our medical professors (ph) here -- professionals here in the United States get this right and save lives for Americans and for people all across the world."

President Trump says that both ships will be launched and ready by next week. Now, these are the largest hospital ships in the world. Each one has 1,000 hospital beds but they won't be used to treat COVID-19 patients, at least not in the beginning. Instead they will be used to help trauma patients were normal hospitals fill up. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says hospitals being at capacity is inevitable. He points out that New York has 53,000 hospital beds and 3,000 ICU beds, but within 45 days, in a worst-case scenario, there could be 110,000 people hospitalized with 370,000 needing ICU. We should note that -- 37,000 rather. We should note, at Rikers Island, we are learning both an inmate and a corrections officer have tested positive for coronavirus. This facility holds thousands of inmates. And finally we should note that the Westchester County, the man that's called patient zero, the 50-year-old lawyer, linked to the spread of the virus in New Rochelle which led to that containment zone is now out of his medically induced coma, and he said to be recovering -- Sean."

So, this is where we are based on the Johns Hopkins University global map, 216,000 cases confirmed around the world, Sean, 8,700 deaths. This is an impressive number here, 83,000 were covered so far. We want that number to go much higher. A moment ago, you mentioned Italy. There was a stunning headline that came out of Italy today. At the moment they're dealing with about 36,000 cases. They've had nearly 3,000 people die so far in the headline from Italy today, they have the highest death rate in a single day to date. More than 470 Italians lost their lives there today. On this map over here, Sean, I want to show you where we are tonight here in the United States. As of about five hours ago, this is our number of cases, 7,374. Just watch that number. I will take you back and show you where we were two weeks ago, at 129. Again, tonight, more than 7,000. New York state has the most, 2,480 cases. Washington state, about 1,000. In California, 718 after that. And again, two weeks ago, I show you, New York was at six. Tonight, we are at more than 2,400. You hear the medical officials tell you that you want to be like South Korea. The South Korean model and now, unfortunately, like the Italian model. I will show you why that is here on this graph behind me. This yellow line is Italy. It's going not due north but pretty close to it. The blue line is South Korea. You see how that levels off here? We are the green line down here just coming off the baseline and trending toward the marker in South Korea.

A legal analyst suggesting that President Trump was guilty of negligent homicide because of his coronavirus response. Oh, you mean the first case in America, January 21st? Oh, he called for the ban January 31st, 10 days later. He was called a xenophobe and fearmongering by quid pro quo Dr. Joe. This is beyond a disgrace. MSNBC news, are you proud of yourself? Segment Joy Reid's -- well, pretty despicable comments on her show. Not by her, by a guest, suggesting that children of Trump supporters are a threat to your children.

We call what they're doing, trying to bludgeon the president outcome of their politicizing of this virus -- well, predictable, despicable, repulsive, all of the above. Look at this list put together by John Nolte -- media lied about the president's comments on ventilators, the media lied about the fake news about a nationwide curfew, they lied about Trump shutting down the CDC's pandemic department, and I could go on and on. All the lies they've told in the last three years accumulated. One of the ever going to say they're sorry, change, admit they are wrong? We were right on this program. The I.G. report vindicated our reporting. They were pushing Russia, Russia, Russia, four investigations later, nothing. Ukraine, Ukraine, but they ignore quid and pro and quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. Yes, you're not getting a billion dollars unless you fire the prosecutor investigating my zero experience son, they never touch that. Hillary's dirty dossier, no. FISA, premeditated fraud, abuse, nothing. They were fermenting hysteria for political gain. We're calling for calm, but we were calling them out and we will continue to call them out. Hannity.com, the timeline is there, all the appropriate tape and we have a lot more new waves coming. Stay tuned. Now, you'll see, by the way, we praised the president's bold move. A single one biggest thing that was done to protect the American people here. January 21st, the first person identified with coronavirus in America. Ten days later, January 31st, the president's travel ban from China followed by the quarantine. We rightly praised that decision. We'll never be able to calculate that decision and how many Americans in fact were in many ways saved from contracting the virus. We praised all of that. And anyway -- and also the quarantines.

They respected him, they admired him, and they made concessions to him in the trade talks, but now this idea that President Trump has botched -- words the Chinese are using -- he's botched the handling of the virus, this is being spread all over the world by China. They have a lot to hide themselves. They are very nervous about reporters coming to find out about their so-called wildlife, wet markets. That's where the virus is a shed from live animals to others. It's probably how it got started. They didn't want that to come out. So it's a surprise to me.

This is beyond corrupt, what they've done. They've hurt the entire world with their actions, their lies, their propaganda. Yes, there's whole of the media thing going on. What we've seen for three long years, and that is, oh, well, it's the Trump virus. If you are feeling awful, blame Trump early on. \"New York Times,\" Trump's Katrina. Oh, Trump's Chernobyl. Oh, Trump's, whatever they can use to bludgeon the president. Why is it that we've now gone through three years of this? When did these liars in the media, those with agendas that have propagandized and ripped people -- ramped them up into hysteria time and time again, only to be proven wrong time and time again. When do we get at some point some accountability from them?"

And it is really disgusting to think that they care more about how the president calls it a Chinese virus or a Wuhan virus as opposed to what the president did, because when it was not politically correct to shut down those traveling from China into the United States, the president did that. Nobody can even point to Wuhan on the map in that media room that you see, the Brady Room, they could even point to it on the map and yet they were criticizing him. This is what I love about Donald Trump, he takes bold, decisive action. We have 450 airports, we have 2.2 million travelers, the Democrats have always prohibited us from having an entry-exit program in this country and Donald Trump has tried to locked on the southern border, help us on the northern border and implement that travel ban. And the Democrats and these media talking heads have thwarted that every single step of the way and I think the American people will realize that."

That we are on war footing and we've got people in the White House in front of the commander-in-chief, the leader of the free world, the main one organizing the pushback on this invisible enemy, and that's all they think about, kind of moving the Chinese rhetoric, the Chinese argument, and the reason the Chinese are upset about this is because they must be held to account, and they know that if they can obscure this in the minds of people around the world, that maybe they will escape being held to account. The fact of the matter is very first victims of this were the Chinese people, were the Chinese individuals who then flew off to enjoy vacations around the world. They have been dying. We do not know how many have died in China. So, they must be held accountable, even just for the nature of what's been going on in their own country regarding this, let alone what has been, of course, moved across the world. But for the American people to facilitate this tells you how corrupt the left has become, and how bitter and really destructive operating with hate for years. And, by the way, they've been telling the American people for years, the American media, that Donald Trump cannot be trusted, and now they wonder why young people aren't following certain requests and orders involved with this letter issued by the White House. You see with the media can do when it comes to the negative impact of how we are supposed to operate as a country. So, yes, the American people will be the ones to make a determination about who will be rewarded for their behaviors. This is Donald Trump's finest hour, and he will prevail. But we've really got to hunker down and reject the people who promote this kind of awful approach and negativity."

This could possibly be a very huge development. LARA LOGAN, HOST OF \"NO AGENDA WITH LARA LOGAN\" ON FOX NATION: Thank you, Sean. Yes, it could be. We will learn more from the president tomorrow, as you said. Tonight, nearly 8,000 Americans are infected with the coronavirus. The death toll as of today stands at 118 and all of this taking place as Congress and the White House continue to move ahead on a series of aggressive aid packages which are really designed to help the American worker. Health officials are continuing to work at a rapid pace, they say, to combat the virus with new research and developments, and that is what the president teased earlier today when he said there would be some major news coming from the FDA.

And he's a brain surgeon in his own right, Dr. Peter Constantino, is with us. Thank you all. Dr. Hotez, let me go to you. You've been making it very fascinating, interesting comments. I don't -- I'm not a doctor and I will not play one on TV, but you keep hearing about this malaria drug that has shown previously with SARS, which corona one, if you will, a corona-live virus that they've had a lot of success with, chloroquine phosphate, also talk about an Ebola drug that is showing some impact and other drugs that perhaps the president will be talking about tomorrow with the FDA I would assume rapidly moving forward with the process. What can you tell us? Should we put hope in this? Some are saying, it would act almost like a prophylactic, protect people from getting it, or if they have, studies have shown that, in fact, it will reduce the symptoms more quickly and less hospitalization time."

I think what you are going to see in coming months is you're going to see the full horsepower of American science applied to this epidemic in the way of new vaccines, new drugs, new diagnostics, new innovative approaches. I mean, this is where America shines, big, audacious goals in the area of science coming out of our research universities and institutes. So, we've developed a vaccine that we're hoping to move into clinical trials over the next few weeks. There will be several other vaccines, but vaccines are going to take a while. That's probably at least a year, year and a half away, according to Dr. Fauci, and I think he's right. Maybe longer. But there's still a lot we can do right now, and one of them is new antiviral drugs, which the timelines could be a lot quicker. And you mentioned chloroquine, there's some promising data coming out of my colleague, (INAUDIBLE) who is out of southern France. And that could be potentially exciting if it holds up. And there's two reasons I'm interested by it. One, the drug itself can show to inhibit virus replication in the test tube. That doesn't mean it works and the person. But it also has some anti-inflammatory effects. So, those two combined to make it a very intriguing drug, and there are some preliminary data. So, we'll see how that moves along over the coming weeks in clinical trials. So, that's what I'm looking at. You mentioned some of the other antiviral drugs and also bringing on some antibodies, isolated from recovered patients and using that as a therapy."

I think the good news here is what the president is going to say is that he got rid of a lot of those regulations and standard operating procedures that make it difficult to push drugs out. We're going to focus on drugs that are already out there, that are being used for other diseases. That's going to really expedite things, because these drugs are -- most of them have already been proven safe in humans, so it's just going to be a matter of time and the ones that work and not having to prove they are safe for human consumption. So I think that's going to be a big part of it, and I think there's a lot of drugs out there on the horizon right now, there's a lot of companies that are out there looking at it and we're going to find something good, we're going to find something that works."

And, you know, dovetailing upon what your previous expert said, I think it is very, very promising going forward that we don't just have one possible solution to this virus relative to controlling it and those who contracted it, but we have multiple possible solutions in the forms of drugs, antibodies, plasma therapy. So, it's very important that until we get those, which I think will be coming online at a relatively short period of time to compare to what it would normally take, that we do those things to try and keep each other from getting this virus. When I say each other, not just ourselves. And if you look at the human body from a practical standpoint, there is a five doorways where this virus gets in and they're all located in your head. And as a head neck surgeon, the reality of it is, if you keep it out of your eyes come out of your nostrils and out of your mouth, you're not going to get the virus. It doesn't come through your skin. And people of had a lot of misconceptions about masks. The surgical masks do almost nothing. They are actually designed to keep bacteria in to surgeons and keep it from getting to their patients.

The Senate today passed a major House coronavirus bill. And the Trump administration, they are looking at even bigger measures, including up to $1 trillion emergency aid package that would include two rounds of checks for, keyword, qualifying Americans. Those that deserve it need this money. Now, this is serious money we're talking about and we will be there for our fellow Americans. This is something that could happen to any of us. So, why is more than a billion dollars earmarked for other countries? The coronavirus supplemental bill passed earlier this month, why? This is now the time to take care of American needs, American workers, American industries. And all that money doesn't mean we can let China, by the way, off the hook. Joining us now with more on this, front and center on this issue with more, Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, let's first start with the money. Why are we spending hundreds of millions of dollars on international relief efforts? International, you know, committees, when we -- really, the American worker needs help. Industries need help.

The Senate is now taking a lead to pass the next legislation that will come in the days ahead. That will be focused very directly on workers who have been displaced by this terrible China virus, and on the businesses who are going to struggle to make ends meet and keep workers on their payrolls for the next two, four, six weeks as we get through the worst of this. So, we're going to be working very hard in the days ahead to make sure that the legislation, which no doubt will have a big price tag because of the scale the crisis our country faces will be focused directly on all the affected workers and their families and businesses in this country."

What we want to make sure do is that businesses can get access to cash they need to keep their workers on their payroll, and then get back on their feet on the back side of this crisis.

We are in this all together as Americans, and they do have big platforms to do a lot of good. Instead of being angry and vitriolic towards people who they clearly hate, they could be holding, I don't know, the Chinese communist party of China accountable for what they've done to the rest of the world. They could be tweeting about how -- the good things people are doing, upholding people's spirits. But instead, they're going after these petty attacks and doing things that are unproductive with the platforms that they have.
