      "sentences": "You've just been listening to a press conference by Governor Greg Abbott of Texas who talked about being livid at the fact that he says he was misled by the officers and about the officers' response to the Uvalde shooting. And we heard him talk about his investigation by the Texas Rangers and the FBI. As soon as that information is gotten, they will give the information to the families about the result of that investigation. He also talked about what strategies, what best practices have to be employed, what mistakes, if any, were made here. He was very strong in his opinion that they should have eliminated the killer and rescue the children. And in response to a question about 18- year-olds being allowed to get a long gun or a rifle, the Texas -- the governor was very clear that in Texas for the last century and a half, 18- year-olds have been able to get long guns. And it's only in the last decade or so that we been hearing about school shootings. So, I guess that, Greg, I'll start with you. We've got a livid governor. Justifiably livid. As I think everyone at this table is tonight with the fact that we have been misled as to what the facts were.",

We only get to the scene of the story after it happens and we should address every variable, every step that gets you to that crime. Whether it is mental illness, schools, family, red flags. The fact that he said that this is a new thing in a decade and a half, that kind of points you in the direction of where the answers are. Why are these things happening more and more in this kind of society? Is it something that has to do with not simply the availability of guns because they have been available? Social media. It's a decline in education, it's a breakdown of the family. But these are a lot of things that we don't want to talk about because we've avoided these problems for so long. We have avoided these problems for 50 years. I think you can say the governors livid. And you can say well, maybe the police were incompetent or they were afraid or they were adhering to a doctrine that prevented improvising. But that is not my place. That's his place. And that is the place for the investigators to let them investigate fully to tell the story, which is necessary. You need the scrutiny. Because there is going to be a next time and the information you glean from this time will help you in the next time. That's why it's important. And it isn't Monday morning quarterbacking for investigators, or law enforcement, or family, survivors to question these variables. That is entirely their right. However, I feel like as the media we have to be very careful because we have Monday morning quarterback five days a week. And we assume -- and it's amazing to me how we all become experts on every -- you know, it's amazing. And I didn't go to school for any of this but somehow, I can have an opinion. So, I think be humble. Let them do the job. Let them talk about what the police did or didn't do and try to -- try to keep your -- again, let the story grow. Let the facts pile up.",

But it does take time to get there. And Greg, as you touched on, we cannot pretend like our society has not broken down at the family level, at the community level, at the church level. That we have done things that have actively ripped those institutions apart and then wonder why when there is a young man who is bullied, who made fun of, his family is estranged and a complete mess that he devolves further and further into these online communities where people find toxic relationships and ideologies. That they want a sense of self-esteem and a sense of being in all of those places they could've found it before are being ripped away. We cannot act like not examining that and passing a bunch of laws is going to make these young men better. And Charles Krauthammer had a fantastic piece in 2012 that he wrote after the Sandy Hook shooting. I wish he was still with us to make sense of this if he could.

Two, when he talks about the responses, I think he is talking about two responses. The response of the officers on the ground which obviously was a devastating disaster. A fatal disaster. And then two, what I think he was equally livid at, I heard in his voice, and heard in his words, that he was lied to about law enforcement afterwards.

We are political beings and we have to just accept that there is a modicum of that in the conversation. So, we've got to talk about schools and what has to happen. You touched on it yesterday, Judge. There's eight school in that district, we learned, and there are four security resource officers. That needs to change. The question around minors and mental illness and whether or not -- you know, we've had mental illness in our society forever. We have had evil since the introduction of mankind. Australia has evil but they haven't had a mass shooting since 1996. Do we look at what other countries are doing? I think we have to put all of that on the table. But I was most impressed with this press conference because the governor and the mayor, this has been two or three days here. In two days, they have talked, they let facts guide this conversation and the response on the scene, a disaster, a fatal disaster. And what I'm equally if not in a weird way more disturbed by, it seems like law enforcement then lied to the governor and lied to the police deputy, the Texas Department of Public Safety leader and lied to the mayor.

Listen, one thing I hate about, this is not about how you get to the movie theater or even how you get to work for millions of Americans, this is how you work. For people that drive a truck for a living, for people that own a lawn maintenance, right? Gas goes into everything on that trailer they're going to use on your lawn and make $20.00 today. This is not just about convenience, it is about livelihood. And when you sit there and say, well, I really wish they would --- they would produce more, you ran on a -- on a campaign of bankrupting oil and gas, taking investment away from them, and now you've pretend that's not a factor in this. I don't care how many leases they have. A lease is only as good as the oil underneath the ground. And when this administration took office, there was a run on land leases because for small oil companies, that's the only collateral you have to get investments. So, you go out and lease 1000 leases. If 10 of them produce all your good, it's those leases that are your collateral to get Joe Billionaire to invest in you. And guess what Joe Billionaire is not going to invest in you if there's not an atmosphere of return on investment, so that's a problem. But even beyond all that, you can go back to nuclear, the cleanest energy that exists -- Three Mile Island was long time ago. As a matter of fact that technology is not what we do anymore. We have micro reactors, we have residential reactors. We have plants or reactors to power a neighborhood. And you know who finally got the United States government to open up its material and facilities for people who have designed these? The Republicans did, which I appreciate that. I'm not blaming Democrats, I'm just saying, I know the person that helped write that piece of legislation and get it passed. That's what we need to speed up. That's what we need to make happen.

And we heard him talk about his investigation by the Texas Rangers and the FBI. As soon as that information is gotten, they will give the information to the families about the result of that investigation. He also talked about what strategies, what best practices have to be employed, what mistakes, if any, were made here. He was very strong in his opinion that they should have eliminated the killer and rescue the children. And in response to a question about 18- year-olds being allowed to get a long gun or a rifle, the Texas -- the governor was very clear that in Texas for the last century and a half, 18- year-olds have been able to get long guns. And it's only in the last decade or so that we been hearing about school shootings. So, I guess that, Greg, I'll start with you. We've got a livid governor. Justifiably livid. As I think everyone at this table is tonight with the fact that we have been misled as to what the facts were."

We only get to the scene of the story after it happens and we should address every variable, every step that gets you to that crime. Whether it is mental illness, schools, family, red flags. The fact that he said that this is a new thing in a decade and a half, that kind of points you in the direction of where the answers are. Why are these things happening more and more in this kind of society? Is it something that has to do with not simply the availability of guns because they have been available? Social media. It's a decline in education, it's a breakdown of the family. But these are a lot of things that we don't want to talk about because we've avoided these problems for so long. We have avoided these problems for 50 years. I think you can say the governors livid. And you can say well, maybe the police were incompetent or they were afraid or they were adhering to a doctrine that prevented improvising. But that is not my place. That's his place. And that is the place for the investigators to let them investigate fully to tell the story, which is necessary. You need the scrutiny. Because there is going to be a next time and the information you glean from this time will help you in the next time. That's why it's important. And it isn't Monday morning quarterbacking for investigators, or law enforcement, or family, survivors to question these variables. That is entirely their right. However, I feel like as the media we have to be very careful because we have Monday morning quarterback five days a week. And we assume -- and it's amazing to me how we all become experts on every -- you know, it's amazing. And I didn't go to school for any of this but somehow, I can have an opinion. So, I think be humble. Let them do the job. Let them talk about what the police did or didn't do and try to -- try to keep your -- again, let the story grow. Let the facts pile up."

And we are all furious and we are all heartbroken and we always want quick answers because as human beings we want to try to make sense of this and we cannot make sense of this. But it does take time to get there. And Greg, as you touched on, we cannot pretend like our society has not broken down at the family level, at the community level, at the church level. That we have done things that have actively ripped those institutions apart and then wonder why when there is a young man who is bullied, who made fun of, his family is estranged and a complete mess that he devolves further and further into these online communities where people find toxic relationships and ideologies. That they want a sense of self-esteem and a sense of being in all of those places they could've found it before are being ripped away. We cannot act like not examining that and passing a bunch of laws is going to make these young men better. And Charles Krauthammer had a fantastic piece in 2012 that he wrote after the Sandy Hook shooting. I wish he was still with us to make sense of this if he could. And it talks about a culture of violence and how we have just broken things down and we cannot pretend those things don't matter."

The chief of police, (Inaudible), he was convinced that, again, I want to go back and say, you know, he was convinced at the time that there was no more threat to the children and that the subject was barricaded and they had time to organize with the proper equipment.

Two, when he talks about the responses, I think he is talking about two responses. The response of the officers on the ground which obviously was a devastating disaster. A fatal disaster. And then two, what I think he was equally livid at, I heard in his voice, and heard in his words, that he was lied to about law enforcement afterwards. So, I understand and we can all accept in a painful way how mistakes can be made.

We are political beings and we have to just accept that there is a modicum of that in the conversation. So, we've got to talk about schools and what has to happen. You touched on it yesterday, Judge. There's eight school in that district, we learned, and there are four security resource officers. That needs to change. The question around minors and mental illness and whether or not -- you know, we've had mental illness in our society forever. We have had evil since the introduction of mankind. Australia has evil but they haven't had a mass shooting since 1996. Do we look at what other countries are doing? I think we have to put all of that on the table. But I was most impressed with this press conference because the governor and the mayor, this has been two or three days here. In two days, they have talked, they let facts guide this conversation and the response on the scene, a disaster, a fatal disaster. And what I'm equally if not in a weird way more disturbed by, it seems like law enforcement then lied to the governor and lied to the police deputy, the Texas Department of Public Safety leader and lied to the mayor.

Go study the Navy Yard, four violent incidents, two of them involving a gun, none of them made it to the point that they went on a record. So, he went not only did one of these and got a gun, but got a top-secret security clearance."

Listen, one thing I hate about, this is not about how you get to the movie theater or even how you get to work for millions of Americans, this is how you work. For people that drive a truck for a living, for people that own a lawn maintenance, right? Gas goes into everything on that trailer they're going to use on your lawn and make $20.00 today. This is not just about convenience, it is about livelihood. And when you sit there and say, well, I really wish they would --- they would produce more, you ran on a -- on a campaign of bankrupting oil and gas, taking investment away from them, and now you've pretend that's not a factor in this. I don't care how many leases they have. A lease is only as good as the oil underneath the ground. And when this administration took office, there was a run on land leases because for small oil companies, that's the only collateral you have to get investments. So, you go out and lease 1000 leases. If 10 of them produce all your good, it's those leases that are your collateral to get Joe Billionaire to invest in you. And guess what Joe Billionaire is not going to invest in you if there's not an atmosphere of return on investment, so that's a problem. But even beyond all that, you can go back to nuclear, the cleanest energy that exists -- Three Mile Island was long time ago. As a matter of fact that technology is not what we do anymore. We have micro reactors, we have residential reactors. We have plants or reactors to power a neighborhood. And you know who finally got the United States government to open up its material and facilities for people who have designed these? The Republicans did, which I appreciate that. I'm not blaming Democrats, I'm just saying, I know the person that helped write that piece of legislation and get it passed. That's what we need to speed up. That's what we need to make happen. One of the big actors hears defense industry. Defense industry lobbies every day for nuclear technologies to the civilian sector for security reasons. So, you got to hit all the players that make this worse. Nuclear is the way to go. I fully support nuclear myself."

We have to build batteries. We have to innovate. We have to drill. We have to frack. What the war has shown us is the vulnerability and how we are how we are squeezed by a person whose country we thought was largely irrelevant in a global economic conversation. They approve and now to insert themselves into conversation in a way that forces us all to reset how we think not only about the moment but the future. I think in terms of the moment, it was reported last week, and we talked on the show that Chevron was in conversation with Venezuela, and there are Democrats and Republicans who were upset about that, who said how could you dare do that. Now, if we are serious about trying to alleviate consumers and lower those prices from $6.00 to $5.00, to $4.00, to $35.0 to $2.50, then we're going to have to make some uncomfortable choices.
