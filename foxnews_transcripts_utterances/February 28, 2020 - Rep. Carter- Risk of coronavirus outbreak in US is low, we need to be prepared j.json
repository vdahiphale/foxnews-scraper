      "sentences": "Neil, it's been, I guess to say an exciting day, but ending a little bit more positive from those session lows, the Dow closing -- at one point, it actually hit more than 1,000 points lower. So we did come back at the end of the day in what we call bottom-feeding. So we're talking about the Dow did close lower. The S&P 500, I wish I could say that there was one sector that did well, but all 11 sectors did close in the red. If you take a look, though, just over the past week or so, it's just been a really, really tough week for our 401(k)s, as well as for a lot of traders out there, essentially, the worst week since the financial crisis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The month, though, the month is that -- we are heading into a weekend and we are closing a lot of positions. That's what a lot of hedge funds do right now. They close. They rebalance. So you did see what we call a lot of liquidity in the markets, so a lot of people selling and buying every time we saw a dip. And so it did create a lot of movement today, and that adds to the whole closing of the month. But it doesn't always have to be doom and gloom. If we look back historically, and if you're patient, you could reap the benefits in the market. And what I mean by this, if you look back at when we had the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, when the first occurrence happened, if you held stocks in the S&P 500, you held onto it for six months, you would have seen a gain of roughly 14.59 percent, if -- and, again, if you don't believe that, what about Ebola? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So when Ebola hit the markets and that created a pandemic across the globe, what we did see is, if you held stocks in the S&P 500, that would climb to about 5.34 percent six months later. And both -- if you were really, really patient and you wanted to hold the hold these stocks quite long for past 12 months, with SARS, you would have seen your gains up over 20 percent, and, with Ebola, you would have seen your gains up over 10 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So it does pay to be patient.

We got to a record low on interest rates, a 10-year note barely hovering a little bit more than a single percent. That will translate into fixed-rate mortgages that will be under 3 percent, maybe get down to 2.5 percent. Couple that with the fact that the slow down fears are igniting interest in mortgage refinancing applications and first-time mortgages.

You can hear the helicopter on the South Lawn just behind me. The president coming out to go to North Charleston, South Carolina, tonight for a political rally. We may hear from him on the way out the door. Earlier this afternoon, for about 45 minutes, we heard from the Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, conducted a pen-and-pad briefing, as the World Health Organization warns of a possible worldwide spread of the coronavirus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Azar told us that, at the moment in the United States, there is 63 cases of coronavirus virus, no new cases in the past two weeks, other than that one case of suspected community transmission in California. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Centers for Disease Control is actively conducting contract tracing to find out -- try to find out how that woman contracted the virus. Azar says they do not believe that it is connected to the quarantine of people at Travis Air Force Base -- the woman lived near there -- a short time ago. Talks also about the $2.5 billion emergency supplemental are accelerating. Azar says he hopes that Congress will pass it early next week, so that the president can sign it by the week after. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And amid increasing criticism from Democrats of the White House's response to the coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence a short time ago defended the early actions that President Trump took to address the virus.

He said, yes, they are thinking of doing that, Neil, but he says he doesn't see the need at the moment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it is something they're keeping in their back pocket.

We paired that dramatically. So we closed actually on a -- kind of a better level of the day. Now, a lot of people will go through this like chicken entrails and tea leaves here, look at those type of developments which could be potentially constructive. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Having said all of that, we told you about how the markets have all corrected, in other words, gone beyond 10 percent from their highs, to these new levels. Now, some of them are flirting in bear market territory with this loss today from these all-time highs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Dow is down about 14 percent, Nasdaq about 13 percent, S&P 500 about 13 percent. It takes 20 percent from highs to define what they call a bear market. Now, we got as close as a 19.8 percent drop in the market, particularly the S&P 500, around Christmastime in 2018. And we just came back from those levels. But we have not seen a bear market, one that would meet sustained, with a 20 percent or more drop, in that time. So we dodged that bullet so far. And some are interpreting what happened today as a sign that maybe we can dodge it going forward. Way too early to tell. I only pass that along to you because, while others are obsessed with this, you might remember we had General Honore here, of course, the Ragin' Cajun, who was the face and force behind fixing things after Hurricane Katrina back in 2004, who is not taking too kindly to Wall Street and its temper tantrum. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look.",

You mentioned kind of the hints of what the promise may be on the close today is that the SOX index, which is the semiconductors index, so think about the chips that go into your computers and phones, that was up all day long. Tech was up on the day as well. So other Nasdaq stocks, like Microsoft and Apple, as a conglomerate, were up.

He has been talking to reporters as they gather in Charleston, South Carolina, for a campaign event he's going to. But he did say that they are making progress working on a vaccine. He's very optimistic in that regard. He was talking about that he is spending a great deal of time on this issue, along with the vice president, Secretary Azar, Dr. Fauci and all. They're all watching. They don't want any bad surprises. He didn't answer a question as to whether this constituted a crisis. He's looking at the possibility of extending a travel ban of countries with disproportionate numbers. Simply hasn't made up his mind. So we're getting some dribs and drabs out of what he's saying to reporters, presumably on the South Lawn, as he boards Marine One and heads over to South Carolina tonight.

It might have been hard for you to hear, but the president taking another slap at the Federal Reserve, referring to the fact that they screwed up a lot -- I'm paraphrasing here -- and these rumors that the Fed was going to get involved, and these people who are betting on the fact that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, maybe sooner, rather than later, as soon as next month. That seems to be the betting on the markets, even though, officially, the Fed is kind of pooh-poohing or pouring cold water on that talk. The president is saying that other countries are doing that. Germany and a host of other countries are putting and flooding a lot of money at this to deal with this. And the equivalent of that would be that the Federal Reserve should do the same. Republican Louisiana Senator, medical doctor, by the way, Bill Cassidy on all of that. Senator, thank you for taking the time. What did you make of his reference to the Federal Reserve and this growing talk that it do something? The talk seems to center around another rate cut. Do you think that's warranted?",

This 342-point hit in the Dow, bad, but it was looking about three times that, the worst week, though, for stocks since the financial meltdown in 2008. The S&P 500 entering its fastest correction ever. The Dow and the Nasdaq going right along for the ride. And all of this at a time every one wonders what's next. The Fed is vowing to use its tools to deal with economic risks that come from the coronavirus. Now, traders didn't know what to make of that. Where they are at least an agreement on now is, thank God the week is over. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And more swings on Wall Street, but the trend still remains down, as these virus fears continue to flare up. Here are some of them. Word now that a Google employee in Zurich has tested positive for the virus, as Amazon is telling its workers to defer all nonessential travel. But get this. That includes the continental United States. Chicago monitoring hundreds of recent travelers for the virus. Meanwhile, the big Geneva auto show canceled, as Switzerland vows big events. And all this as the World Health Organization raises its risk assessment to very high. We are all over these fast-moving developments with Kristina Partsinevelos at the Nasdaq on the stock shock, and John Roberts at the White House on how they're absorbing all of that shock. We begin with Kristina -- Kristina."

      "utterance": "Neil, it's been, I guess to say an exciting day, but ending a little bit more positive from those session lows, the Dow closing -- at one point, it actually hit more than 1,000 points lower. So we did come back at the end of the day in what we call bottom-feeding. So we're talking about the Dow did close lower. The S&P 500, I wish I could say that there was one sector that did well, but all 11 sectors did close in the red. If you take a look, though, just over the past week or so, it's just been a really, really tough week for our 401(k)s, as well as for a lot of traders out there, essentially, the worst week since the financial crisis. The month, though, the month is that -- we are heading into a weekend and we are closing a lot of positions. That's what a lot of hedge funds do right now. They close. They rebalance. So you did see what we call a lot of liquidity in the markets, so a lot of people selling and buying every time we saw a dip. And so it did create a lot of movement today, and that adds to the whole closing of the month. But it doesn't always have to be doom and gloom. If we look back historically, and if you're patient, you could reap the benefits in the market. And what I mean by this, if you look back at when we had the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003, when the first occurrence happened, if you held stocks in the S&P 500, you held onto it for six months, you would have seen a gain of roughly 14.59 percent, if -- and, again, if you don't believe that, what about Ebola? So when Ebola hit the markets and that created a pandemic across the globe, what we did see is, if you held stocks in the S&P 500, that would climb to about 5.34 percent six months later. And both -- if you were really, really patient and you wanted to hold the hold these stocks quite long for past 12 months, with SARS, you would have seen your gains up over 20 percent, and, with Ebola, you would have seen your gains up over 10 percent. So it does pay to be patient. There's still a lot of uncertainty in the market. But we did come off of those session lows today -- Neil, back to you."

By the way, one of the reasons why we did get to that sort of comeback level -- and I put comeback in, I guess, italics, parentheses, you name it. We got to a record low on interest rates, a 10-year note barely hovering a little bit more than a single percent. That will translate into fixed-rate mortgages that will be under 3 percent, maybe get down to 2.5 percent. Couple that with the fact that the slow down fears are igniting interest in mortgage refinancing applications and first-time mortgages. That's the hope, at least. Meanwhile, the president is getting ripped over his administration's handling and response to all of this. John Roberts on how the White House is responding to that. Hey, John."

You can hear the helicopter on the South Lawn just behind me. The president coming out to go to North Charleston, South Carolina, tonight for a political rally. We may hear from him on the way out the door. Earlier this afternoon, for about 45 minutes, we heard from the Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, conducted a pen-and-pad briefing, as the World Health Organization warns of a possible worldwide spread of the coronavirus. Azar told us that, at the moment in the United States, there is 63 cases of coronavirus virus, no new cases in the past two weeks, other than that one case of suspected community transmission in California. The Centers for Disease Control is actively conducting contract tracing to find out -- try to find out how that woman contracted the virus. Azar says they do not believe that it is connected to the quarantine of people at Travis Air Force Base -- the woman lived near there -- a short time ago. Talks also about the $2.5 billion emergency supplemental are accelerating. Azar says he hopes that Congress will pass it early next week, so that the president can sign it by the week after. And amid increasing criticism from Democrats of the White House's response to the coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence a short time ago defended the early actions that President Trump took to address the virus.

Azar said that team typically does refugee repatriation. He says HHS takes the complaint seriously and is investigating to determine that complaint's validity and what steps they could possibly take in the future to ensure that there are no other problems. Azar was also asked about Japan's possible plans to close schools for a month and whether something like that could happen here, Azar saying that they have a full continuum of possibilities and that everything is on the table. But there was no suggestion that we're about to close schools here in the United States. Azar was also asked by me about whether HHS could use what's called the Defense Procurement Act to ramp up production of things like personal protection equipment, those N95 masks, Tyvek suits and other things. He said, yes, they are thinking of doing that, Neil, but he says he doesn't see the need at the moment. But it is something they're keeping in their back pocket. That's typically ramped up or used during times of war to shift production of certain things. It hasn't been done for a while, but Azar suggesting that could be in the offing in the next few weeks."

      "utterance": "All right, John Roberts, thank you very, very much. Again, I want to take a look at the corner of Wall and Broad, because you might not think of this as a stunning or significant development, but the fact of the matter is, we were down about 1,000 points today. We paired that dramatically. So we closed actually on a -- kind of a better level of the day. Now, a lot of people will go through this like chicken entrails and tea leaves here, look at those type of developments which could be potentially constructive. Having said all of that, we told you about how the markets have all corrected, in other words, gone beyond 10 percent from their highs, to these new levels. Now, some of them are flirting in bear market territory with this loss today from these all-time highs. The Dow is down about 14 percent, Nasdaq about 13 percent, S&P 500 about 13 percent. It takes 20 percent from highs to define what they call a bear market. Now, we got as close as a 19.8 percent drop in the market, particularly the S&P 500, around Christmastime in 2018. And we just came back from those levels. But we have not seen a bear market, one that would meet sustained, with a 20 percent or more drop, in that time. So we dodged that bullet so far. And some are interpreting what happened today as a sign that maybe we can dodge it going forward. Way too early to tell. I only pass that along to you because, while others are obsessed with this, you might remember we had General Honore here, of course, the Ragin' Cajun, who was the face and force behind fixing things after Hurricane Katrina back in 2004, who is not taking too kindly to Wall Street and its temper tantrum.

As a money manager, as somebody who invests money for clients, what we have been doing is finding total return in bonds and dividend or yield in stocks. And that is, in a word, messed up. I mean, that shouldn't be that way. It should be the other way. Yield should be in bonds, and total return should be in stocks. But, frankly, as you pointed out, that's the way it is. And so I will tell you that -- well, I will give you three things that were really good today. You mentioned kind of the hints of what the promise may be on the close today is that the SOX index, which is the semiconductors index, so think about the chips that go into your computers and phones, that was up all day long. Tech was up on the day as well. So other Nasdaq stocks, like Microsoft and Apple, as a conglomerate, were up. And gold, which is a fear trade, which is something that we still own, mind you, because we like it, because it doesn't correlate to the markets, was down big today. So three good reasons today to be somewhat optimistic about next week."

And, Peter, one of the things I noticed, not only that we closed off our worst levels of the day, but there was this dramatic improvement in the rate environment. By that, I need much lower. That could support the consumer, coupled with much lower energy gas prices and all for the consumer, at least, whether he or she is in the market or not.

I don't -- I don't go along with the trade that things are that much better.

So, Peter, what you said, the fact that this was one of the fastest corrections on record for the market, and the fact that it eased up a little bit -- and I said we're still down 357 points, to your point. So you're still -- you still got your worries going forward?"

Literally, 15 minutes, 10 minutes before the close, we were down 950. So, my gut is that there was a big push on the short side. And basically people didn't know. The Fed -- during the day, the Fed did come out. Powell said that he would use the tools necessary to support the market, if possible, that the economy was still strong. And that sort of took the real fear out of the market for the moment. But I think that the sell side into the 350 posting, with $3.5 billion for sale, basically, people didn't want to go home with the idea that maybe the Fed would say something, maybe things aren't as bad as they seem. And I kind of think it was more of a short cover. I don't think the anxiety is off the table. I think that gold trade is one where people wanted to be in cash. Maybe some people decided to buy something into the weekend. But I didn't feel that."

Now, even though a number of district presidents and Fed officials here and elsewhere have been sort of pooh-poohing that talk, I think people who bet money on this are seeing a 100 percent possibility the Fed funds, the overnight bank lending rate, is cut. Do you see that?"

After House lawmakers were briefed today, you had Republicans like Doug Collins of Georgia saying the importance of the American people remaining calm, saying, if you have symptoms, you should go to the doctor. The CDC is providing new guidelines all the time. Meanwhile, we have had some Democrats come out and say they feel like the Trump administration should show a greater sense of urgency, Dan Kildee of Michigan emphasizing the point that this could be a big deal, and so the federal government needs to respond and respond swiftly. Meanwhile, bipartisan lawmakers and the White House are negotiating a coronavirus emergency response package estimated to be $6 to $8 billion. It's interesting to note that number has grown steadily throughout the course of this week. There will likely be action on it next week in the House. And then I should also note, in that bipartisan briefing today, Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro got up and blasted the Trump administration's response.

Not only did we learn that today, but when we had the hearing earlier this week with Secretary Azar in the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, he gave us that same message, that we need to be prepared. We're doing everything we can to make sure that we are prepared, but there's no need to panic. It was made clear today by Dr. Redfield and by others that the risk of an outbreak here is still low, but we need to be prepared in case it does happen."

Then I get news out of Iran that it's got 143 more cases of those with the infection, South Korea, 571 more. It's over 2,000 right now, outbreaks in Africa, Nigeria, of course, the first of the region to declare such cases, more cases in Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Britain.

They're growing and they will grow. But we can prevent a lot of this just by common sense, washing our hands, staying healthy, making sure you are sleeping right, making sure you're eating right, making sure you're practicing good hygiene, making sure that, if you are sick, you stay home. It's OK. You can afford to lose a day or two. Don't worry about that. But if you're sick, don't be spreading it.

But you are seeing some people take precautionary measures. As we get further into this pandemic, you're going to see less impact on canceling those events because it's going to be everywhere to begin with. So it's going to kind of be hit or miss with how this happens over time. I wouldn't be canceling those types of things now, especially in the United States, especially in countries where they don't have a lot of community spread. But, eventually, that may become a reality, and we're going to have to deal with them on a case-by-case basis whether or not they're warranted or not."

It's not so much we're dealing with a virus like this, but what it could change into, mutate into, whatever. Is that a fear that you have or that, if you can't define it or how it's passed along, that that is what increases the worry level? Or what's your view of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "There's definitely uncertainty about this virus. And that uncertainty centers on the case fatality ratio. What actually is the rate of people that die from this illness? And we know that in places like Hubei province, it's 2 percent. But outside of Hubei province in China, it's less than 1 percent. So we don't know really where that falls. And most people believe that it is going to fall much below 1 percent, once we actually start testing mild cases. And a lot of these types of social distancing, this -- the social distancing procedures, these cancellation of events, all of that is really premised on a high fatality rate of 1 or 2 percent. And it may be much lower than that, and we may not need to think about it in that same manner. So, once we understand how fatal this disease is, and where it sits, and can come up with a risk stratification, we may see some of the panic die down and some of these measures kind of fade away."

    },

      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "It does. I think that there is a lot of panic. There is a lot of uncertainty. And we're hearing a lot of mixed messages from different public health agencies. What is true is that this virus is going to be disruptive. It's going to be akin to what we had during 2009 with the novel influenza virus that originated in Mexico, that there was disruption, and we had to cope with it. But we did cope with it. And we didn't have this type of economic disruption occurring. Hopefully, people will come up with ways to mitigate this impact, and we won't have as much of an economic disruption. But it seems to me that that's going to be a hard -- a hard challenge to meet, because of all of the rhetoric going on about this and the uncertainty and what's happened in China."

Yes, we're looking at this interesting number here, where 56 percent of voters think Trump will be reelected. That's a big increase since October. Another number that's interesting in our new poll is that we asked if voters thought that -- if they would vote for him if the election were today, and there, we had 42 percent saying, yes, they would vote for him, 52 percent saying someone else, which doesn't sound very good.

I -- the ballot tests that we did, we show some Democrats up by seven, eight points, others closer. In my view, any of the candidates in this race could beat Trump, any of them could lose to Trump.

Of course, this whole issue of the coronavirus and how the president is handling it, he has not left yet for South Carolina. He has been talking to reporters as they gather in Charleston, South Carolina, for a campaign event he's going to. But he did say that they are making progress working on a vaccine. He's very optimistic in that regard. He was talking about that he is spending a great deal of time on this issue, along with the vice president, Secretary Azar, Dr. Fauci and all. They're all watching. They don't want any bad surprises. He didn't answer a question as to whether this constituted a crisis. He's looking at the possibility of extending a travel ban of countries with disproportionate numbers. Simply hasn't made up his mind. So we're getting some dribs and drabs out of what he's saying to reporters, presumably on the South Lawn, as he boards Marine One and heads over to South Carolina tonight.

The CDC's three tier- list alert system lists China and South Korea at its most severe level. It says to avoid those countries when it comes to all nonessential travel. Italy, Japan and Iran are level two. The CDC cautions older people and those with chronic conditions should reconsider travel. And because of the coronavirus, fewer people are flying. A U.S. travel agency says that ticket sales are now down more than 9 percent. United, Delta, and American continue suspension of all flights to China. And United today suspended some flights to Japan. Major U.S. carriers are waiving, canceling change fees to Italy. And JetBlue, in what that airline describes as a confidence-building measure, it's doing away with all cancellation and change fees regardless of the destination.

And then, on Tuesday, you have a very big day, so it will be interesting to see. We're at the same number. A lot of people are getting better. Very much better. The 15 number. Plus we took in, as you know -- from Japan, we took in some great American people and citizens and they're getting better very rapidly. They're doing very well. All of them are doing well. The 15 people, likewise, we have them down to a much lower number. They're in good shape. Most of them are in really good shape. One of the people is -- I wouldn't say not doing well, but it's very -- she's very sick. But she's hopefully getting better. But we're at the same number. We've only -- so, it -- essentially, we've only had 15. And a lot of that is because we called it early. we were -- we made a decision very early to close up our borders to certain areas of the world and we did that. And so we are hopefully getting lower from that number, but let's see what happens into the future. Some countries are doing well. Some countries are not doing well. You can see that for yourself. And a lot of things are happening. We're very well organized. We have great talent, great doctors, great -- great everyone. There's tremendous spirit. A lot of spirit. And, as you know, with the flu, on average, we lose from 26,000 to 78,000 people a year -- even more than that, in some cases, some years. We haven't lost anybody yet. And hopefully, we can keep that intact. We -- there have been no deaths in the United States at all. A lot of that is attributable to the fact that we closed the border very early. Otherwise, it could be a different story. So we'll -- we'll just keep doing a good job. We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of -- a lot of elements that, frankly, we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical. We are working on cures and we're getting some very good results. As you know, they're working as rapidly as they can on a vaccine for the future. And, with that, I think I can head out."

We think we're going to win easily, but you never know. It's an election. I don't think that's helping. But I think that, basically, it's the unknown a little bit.

And some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths. The fact is, I made one decision that was a very important decision and that was to close our country to a certain area of the world that was relatively heavily infected. And because of that, we're talking about 15 -- who seem to all be getting better. One is questionable. And, had that decision not been made, it could be a much different story.

But I hope the Fed gets involved and I hope they get involved soon. If you look at Germany, they're putting in a lot of money and they're probably lowering rates still further. You look at other countries; they're all stuffing the till. They're all going in there. They're putting a lot of money. And our Fed sits there, doesn't do what they're supposed to be doing.

It might have been hard for you to hear, but the president taking another slap at the Federal Reserve, referring to the fact that they screwed up a lot -- I'm paraphrasing here -- and these rumors that the Fed was going to get involved, and these people who are betting on the fact that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, maybe sooner, rather than later, as soon as next month. That seems to be the betting on the markets, even though, officially, the Fed is kind of pooh-poohing or pouring cold water on that talk. The president is saying that other countries are doing that. Germany and a host of other countries are putting and flooding a lot of money at this to deal with this. And the equivalent of that would be that the Federal Reserve should do the same. Republican Louisiana Senator, medical doctor, by the way, Bill Cassidy on all of that. Senator, thank you for taking the time. What did you make of his reference to the Federal Reserve and this growing talk that it do something? The talk seems to center around another rate cut. Do you think that's warranted?"

If you think of how consumer -- consumer spending drives much of the world's GDP, if people are no longer going to Italy, and people from Germany are now staying at home, and then -- I can go on -- you can imagine that would impact world GDP. So it may be that we, being the engine that pulls the rest of the country - - the rest of the world, would need to do something."

So, when the president is saying he's got this or that we're doing a good job, could that be or does it risk being premature?"

And she said, I would never vote for -- normally would never vote for President Trump, but when I see who he's running against, those folks would kill my small business. I'm voting for President Trump. Now, here's someone who, frankly, doesn't find the president very tasteful, but she's got provide for her family, and she's afraid that those folks will destroy her ability to provide for her family. I think there's a lot of that out there. Frankly, I think it's valid."

We need to be prepared. But if we start hunkering down, not living our normal -- normal life, the virus wins, even without ever infecting a bunch of people. I would just say, live your life. Now, at some point, it may be that there will be a disruption in our life. But you don't plan better for that disruption by acting now so fearfully. I'm all with the president."

My main group that I follow the most are the semiconductors, because it's in everything, was up 2 percent today, and that drove the market into the clothes. I suspect there's a chance that central bankers around the globe may make an announcement over the weekend. That's why I think Powell made his little paragraph the announcement today.
