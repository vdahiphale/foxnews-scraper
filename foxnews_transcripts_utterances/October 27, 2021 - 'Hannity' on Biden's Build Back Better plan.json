Tonight, as inflation rises, the economy stalls, the border spiraling way out of control in the middle of a pandemic and COVID-19 mandates -- now there's talk tonight, oh, we may have to push that back, the recognition that there are tens and tens of thousands of crucial workers that have decided they're not going to agree with it. Regulations having no end in sight, Biden's poll numbers plummeting to the mid-30s, and now yet another all-time low. According to Gallup, since taking office in January, Biden's approval rating has now plummeted a whopping 27 percent with independents. Other polls have his approval rating in the mid 30s. There's not a single thing that Joe Biden and his administration can claim as successful for you the American people. And now, we have a frail and a weak and a cognitive mess, and a deeply unpopular president desperately trying to sell his insane Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism that he claims falsely that won't cost a single penny. Needless to say, it's not going particularly well. Take a look.",

And yet, here we are listening to the same long B.S. for the fifth time here and, of course, the Biden administration they have no problem lying about anything and everything. Remember, Mayorkas, yeah, the DHS secretary lying about the border crisis calling the mass migration. This is only a seasonal problem. Jen Psaki circling back with the lie about the border crisis. Migrants don't need to be tested for COVID, they're not planning on staying here very long and then she lied about, oh, well, yeah, we're dispersing people all over the country at 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. in the middle of the night. That's not the middle of the night. That would be called an early morning flight. I've flown a lot. That's actually not true. And Biden lying about COVID-19, declaring that he could beat the virus as president, told that lie a lot, also lying about leaving Americans behind in Afghanistan, 13 days before he did it, lying again about the number of Americans he abandoned. We have a full report tonight coming up on that. But, of course, Biden is also lying about his Build Back Better/New Green Deal social spending proposal by saying the $3.5 trillion price tag actually cost zero dollars. I'm not sure what calculator he's using. That's about the biggest lie of all, also promising not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. Well, that's actually a couple, so it's $200,000. And according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the original Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism would hit Americans making under $50,000 a year the hardest, with a sneaky provision targeting those who deposit small sums of money into their own bank accounts, so they can spy on you. Now, Democrats have come up with a new idiotic tax scheme, a levy on unrealized gains. In other words, phantom money -- money that you might make in the future after you finally -- you get money, your money is taxed, you invest your money, you buy stocks or some type of other asset. But don't worry, the Biden administration is promising that only the super wealthy will be affected. This is another lie. Take a look.",

He's not mentally or physically capable of conducting a lengthy presser. Forget about late afternoon, if you ever tried it at night, it would be an unmitigated disaster. You don't need a medical degree from Harvard to figure this all out. Biden is also desperately trying to avoid being held accountable for all of these many self-inflicted crises that he caused. Remember the economy is a disaster, because of him. Gas prices are spiking dramatically because of him. Energy dependence is back because of Joe. Not good for national security, not good for the economy. There's a massive worker shortage all because of Joe Biden. There are nationwide supply chain disruptions because of Joe Biden. The Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster one that could easily have been preventable same with the southern border in chaos because of him. Every single one of these crises easily preventable, but Joe Biden and his minders on the radical left are either unwilling or unable to do the right thing. And coming up, a new report on the latest migrant caravan yep, they're -- they're making their way right to our border just to be processed in and dispersed in an early morning 4:00 a.m. flight as Jen Psaki says and we have a shocking new development tonight out of Afghanistan. Pay attention to this, we'll have it in a minute.

Americans want safety and security, they want lower taxes, not higher taxes. Americans want more freedom, not more government control, and you can see this day in and day out by their absolute rejection of what is coming down the pipeline from the Biden administration and in these numbers that we are seeing come out that show his just pathetic poll numbers day after day.

He certainly did a much better job on COVID. I would say, if the president would just lead -- just let Joe continue to make the case for him and probably lead election integrity reform efforts like signature verification, illegals can't vote like I guess in counties in Vermont, signature verification, voter ID, chain of custody, updated voter rolls, partisan observers get to observe, if those -- if those changes were put into the system, I'd say probably Joe's handing them the keys to the White House every day if he wanted to run again.",

Well, the difference now is you don't need to tell people that wages are going down. You don't need to tell people that prices at the grocery store are going up, that gas prices are going up, that Afghanistan was a failure. That was a moral scar on the country that will never be forgotten. You don't have to tell people, you don't even have to make a case. You simply have to let Joe Biden be the absolute incompetent buffoon that he is admitting he won't take questions because he can't answer them, he can't cover the govern the country, he's not a successful commander-in-chief.

We'd also have Bagram and it was conditions-based anyway. The chaos at the border we know wouldn't have occurred. The president got us energy independence, he wouldn't have given that up, and that means inflation would be down considerably because everything we now buy costs more, buck more a gallon just to fill up our tank, heat and cool our homes, every product we buy. That adds to the massive spike in inflation. I don't think you'd see the hostilities of China, North Korea, Iran and Russia either that we're now seeing.

Our economy was booming. Our border was secure. We were actually being tough and pushing back against China and other countries who had been taking advantage of the United States for far too long. And under Joe Biden, they know not only is he not capable of running this country, but he's not capable of standing up to any other country either. And so, they're walking all over him and it's the reason everything he touches he ruins. And not only do I agree that if he continues down this path, he's handing over the keys to President Trump, but he's also giving Republicans back the House, the Senate, and I sure hope that we take a number of governor's offices as well because we're going to need strong conservative governors across this country, pushing back against this president for a long time.",

It's 56 days since your president even mentioned all the men women and children that he deserted and completely abandoned to Taliban terrorists. In September, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, he said fewer than a hundred Americans remain trapped. And, apparently, Lloyd Austin was either lying or was being lied to. In fact, the Biden administration just told Congress that, in fact, hundreds of U.S. citizens today remain in Afghanistan, 72 days later. Joe's turned the page. His press secretaries in the media mob also have abandoned any mention of their fellow Americans. And that's not all. According to the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, there are still, quote, thousands of U.S. green card holders, yup, trapped behind enemy lines in Afghanistan, people that have a legal right to live in this country, thousands along with their families.

A new bipartisan letter from two dozen lawmakers pressing Fauci for answers following new evidence that his NIH-funded sick and cruel dog torture experiments in Tunisia. Now, according to the claims from the group White Coat Waste Project, Fauci's NIH funded a whopping $375,800 grant to, quote, drug beagles lock their heads in mesh cages filled with hungry sand flies so that the insects could eat them alive. Okay? True, that would be sick, repulsive, disgusting and just one of the many failures that Fauci needs to be held accountable for. We've reached out to the NIH for comment. They responded in a statement in part that said: The goal of the research was to determine if the experimental vaccine prevented dogs from becoming infected in a natural setting. Developing a vaccine to prevent a serious parasitic disease is an important research goal. In this case, the researchers are supported through multiple different funding sources. The NIAID grant ended in July of 2021. They also added viral images of caged beagles in an academic manuscript were not part of a federally funded experiment. We are continuing to follow the story and remember Fauci is still under fire for appearing to lie about whether or not the NIH funded gain of function research, including to Congress, because look at this, the group EcoHealth Alliance which received U.S. taxpayer dollars from the NIH and subcontracted with the Wuhan virology lab on coronavirus gain of function studies is calling out Fauci. Quote: these data were reported as soon as we were made aware in our four -- in our year four report in April of 2018. Undercutting the NIH's claims that the disclosures were sent two years late and undercutting suggestions that Fauci knew nothing about any of this.

He has tried to cancel football games, has told us we can't have parties, has tried to cancel holidays. Now, he's telling us he doesn't even know if we can have Christmas again this year. And then you look at this experimentation on the beagles and they use beagles, by the way, because of their temperament, because they don't generally fight back as much as other dogs, whenever they're put through this torturous process. These dogs were first debarked which means, they cut their vocal cords so that they couldn't cry out in pain when they were being tortured to death.

Tonight, as inflation rises, the economy stalls, the border spiraling way out of control in the middle of a pandemic and COVID-19 mandates -- now there's talk tonight, oh, we may have to push that back, the recognition that there are tens and tens of thousands of crucial workers that have decided they're not going to agree with it. Regulations having no end in sight, Biden's poll numbers plummeting to the mid-30s, and now yet another all-time low. According to Gallup, since taking office in January, Biden's approval rating has now plummeted a whopping 27 percent with independents. Other polls have his approval rating in the mid 30s. There's not a single thing that Joe Biden and his administration can claim as successful for you the American people. And now, we have a frail and a weak and a cognitive mess, and a deeply unpopular president desperately trying to sell his insane Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism that he claims falsely that won't cost a single penny.

And yet, here we are listening to the same long B.S. for the fifth time here and, of course, the Biden administration they have no problem lying about anything and everything. Remember, Mayorkas, yeah, the DHS secretary lying about the border crisis calling the mass migration. This is only a seasonal problem. Jen Psaki circling back with the lie about the border crisis. Migrants don't need to be tested for COVID, they're not planning on staying here very long and then she lied about, oh, well, yeah, we're dispersing people all over the country at 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. in the middle of the night. That's not the middle of the night. That would be called an early morning flight. I've flown a lot. That's actually not true. And Biden lying about COVID-19, declaring that he could beat the virus as president, told that lie a lot, also lying about leaving Americans behind in Afghanistan, 13 days before he did it, lying again about the number of Americans he abandoned. We have a full report tonight coming up on that. But, of course, Biden is also lying about his Build Back Better/New Green Deal social spending proposal by saying the $3.5 trillion price tag actually cost zero dollars. I'm not sure what calculator he's using. That's about the biggest lie of all, also promising not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. Well, that's actually a couple, so it's $200,000. And according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the original Build Back Better/New Green Deal socialism would hit Americans making under $50,000 a year the hardest, with a sneaky provision targeting those who deposit small sums of money into their own bank accounts, so they can spy on you. Now, Democrats have come up with a new idiotic tax scheme, a levy on unrealized gains. In other words, phantom money -- money that you might make in the future after you finally -- you get money, your money is taxed, you invest your money, you buy stocks or some type of other asset. But don't worry, the Biden administration is promising that only the super wealthy will be affected. This is another lie. Take a look."

And, by the way, what would happen if an asset that they say is a capital gain eventually depreciates or your stocks go down -- I mean, the market could have an adjustment at any point, right? Will the government hand out billion dollar checks to billionaires during a recession? Even \"The Washington Post\" is trashing the plans, saying, quote, Biden's latest Tax the Rich scheme would be an unworkable and possibly unconstitutional mess. That's to say the least. Now, it raises a ton of questions but don't expect any coherent answers from Joe, because today, he bragged to a group of preschoolers about his strategy -- always avoid answering the press's questions, which he probably is the one thing you could say he's successful at.

He's not mentally or physically capable of conducting a lengthy presser. Forget about late afternoon, if you ever tried it at night, it would be an unmitigated disaster. You don't need a medical degree from Harvard to figure this all out. Biden is also desperately trying to avoid being held accountable for all of these many self-inflicted crises that he caused. Remember the economy is a disaster, because of him. Gas prices are spiking dramatically because of him. Energy dependence is back because of Joe. Not good for national security, not good for the economy. There's a massive worker shortage all because of Joe Biden. There are nationwide supply chain disruptions because of Joe Biden. The Afghanistan withdrawal was a disaster one that could easily have been preventable same with the southern border in chaos because of him. Every single one of these crises easily preventable, but Joe Biden and his minders on the radical left are either unwilling or unable to do the right thing. And coming up, a new report on the latest migrant caravan yep, they're -- they're making their way right to our border just to be processed in and dispersed in an early morning 4:00 a.m. flight as Jen Psaki says and we have a shocking new development tonight out of Afghanistan. Pay attention to this, we'll have it in a minute. But first, joining us now with reaction to our top stories, Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Sanders, the author of the new bestseller \"For Such a Time as This\", \"Outnumbered\" co-host Kayleigh McEnany. Sarah, we start with you. You know, I just go back to the time that all -- you and Sean Spicer and Kayleigh, boy, if one little I was not dotted or T not crossed, boy, the media was there to rip your head off. You know, $3.5 trillion won't cost a penny, oh, a 4:00 a.m. flight is an early morning flight when they're dispersing illegal immigrants, you know, how many more lies can they tell and the media just keeps going along with?"

People are sick and tired of his weak and incompetent leadership and they are completely rejecting his socialist agenda. Americans want secure borders, not open borders. Americans want safety and security, they want lower taxes, not higher taxes. Americans want more freedom, not more government control, and you can see this day in and day out by their absolute rejection of what is coming down the pipeline from the Biden administration and in these numbers that we are seeing come out that show his just pathetic poll numbers day after day. And it's because even though the American media isn't covering it, the American people are paying attention to it and they don't want it and they are tired of what this administration is delivering."

We'd still be energy independent. We wouldn't have soaring prices for energy. We wouldn't have chain supply issues. We wouldn't have a crisis at the border. He certainly did a much better job on COVID. I would say, if the president would just lead -- just let Joe continue to make the case for him and probably lead election integrity reform efforts like signature verification, illegals can't vote like I guess in counties in Vermont, signature verification, voter ID, chain of custody, updated voter rolls, partisan observers get to observe, if those -- if those changes were put into the system, I'd say probably Joe's handing them the keys to the White House every day if he wanted to run again."

Well, the difference now is you don't need to tell people that wages are going down. You don't need to tell people that prices at the grocery store are going up, that gas prices are going up, that Afghanistan was a failure. That was a moral scar on the country that will never be forgotten. You don't have to tell people, you don't even have to make a case. You simply have to let Joe Biden be the absolute incompetent buffoon that he is admitting he won't take questions because he can't answer them, he can't cover the govern the country, he's not a successful commander-in-chief.

We'd also have Bagram and it was conditions-based anyway. The chaos at the border we know wouldn't have occurred. The president got us energy independence, he wouldn't have given that up, and that means inflation would be down considerably because everything we now buy costs more, buck more a gallon just to fill up our tank, heat and cool our homes, every product we buy. That adds to the massive spike in inflation. I don't think you'd see the hostilities of China, North Korea, Iran and Russia either that we're now seeing. So all of it's preventable and Joe seems checked out. The American people see that, do you think?"

And right now, they're all laughing at us because Joe Biden has continued to fail and every single thing he touches he screws up. We were doing incredible under President Trump. Our economy was booming. Our border was secure. We were actually being tough and pushing back against China and other countries who had been taking advantage of the United States for far too long. And under Joe Biden, they know not only is he not capable of running this country, but he's not capable of standing up to any other country either. And so, they're walking all over him and it's the reason everything he touches he ruins. And not only do I agree that if he continues down this path, he's handing over the keys to President Trump, but he's also giving Republicans back the House, the Senate, and I sure hope that we take a number of governor's offices as well because we're going to need strong conservative governors across this country, pushing back against this president for a long time."

Day 85 since Biden promised that he would not leave any American behind. It's 56 days since your president even mentioned all the men women and children that he deserted and completely abandoned to Taliban terrorists. In September, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, he said fewer than a hundred Americans remain trapped. And, apparently, Lloyd Austin was either lying or was being lied to. In fact, the Biden administration just told Congress that, in fact, hundreds of U.S. citizens today remain in Afghanistan, 72 days later. Joe's turned the page. His press secretaries in the media mob also have abandoned any mention of their fellow Americans. And that's not all. According to the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, there are still, quote, thousands of U.S. green card holders, yup, trapped behind enemy lines in Afghanistan, people that have a legal right to live in this country, thousands along with their families. And meanwhile, U.S. soldiers stationed in Syria were recently attacked by Iranian drones, carrying explosive charges. Thankfully, no American casualties. Tonight, it is unclear whether the Biden administration plans to respond in any way. Here now with more, former secretary of state, FOX News contributor Mike Pompeo. Let's skip around the globe a little bit. Let's start in Afghanistan. They told us it was under a hundred. Now, we know it's hundreds. Now, we know it's thousands of green cardholders.

Our government has done almost nothing to bring them back. That this is worse than just incompetence. This is an absence of caring about Americans and those who have a right to come to the United States of America. We've completely abandoned them. The president won't even talk about these things. We are not serious. We -- on our State Department Twitter feed today, we're talking about intersectionality and pronouns when we've got Americans behind enemy lines in Afghanistan.

If the Iranians get a nuke, others are going to want one too, Sean. This is serious business, again, and that it all comes back to an absence of strength. President Biden has demonstrated weakness. Remember, with respect to Iran, the Iranians launched missiles into Israel within days of them taking office. They would have they would not have done that when we were there.

This is the typical stuff that Democrats throw at the end of every election. This is the heir to voter ID is racist. They say now that the Republicans are trying to suppress the vote. Let me remind Barack Obama that under Donald Trump in 2020, 159 million Americans voted. When Barack Obama ran in 2012, only 129 million Americans voted. So turnout surged under Donald Trump because of the interest on both sides in that election. So don't give me this Republicans are suppressing.

They're a Jim Crow talking point, and that's not the issue in Virginia. The issue in Virginia are based on American issues -- education. These parents are fighting for their kids and the Democrats won't touch this because they're on the wrong side. Critical race theory is evil, it's wrong. Parents across the country don't want this. Virginia is the bellwether state. On critical race theory, they reject. On the fact that they conceal a sexual assault, this goes to the heart and soul of Americans, children, and parents who are fighting back. That sound piece that you played at the outset is a reflection of parents fighting for their kids and that's why you're going to see a red wave starting in Virginia because what's happening on the Republican side is they're putting children first.

So Terry's task is to turn the momentum around. I hardly see how bringing Joe Biden and turns anything around. So this race has been following a pattern that's been moving in the Youngkin direction for a while. The implications, Sean, aren't going to be as deep as when Scott Brown took Massachusetts under Barack Obama, but will almost be as deep. And that's because Virginia is just not as blue as Massachusetts, but the shock to the Democratic system particularly after bringing in all those heavyweights is going to be serious. It's a real canary in the coal mine for the trouble the Democrats are likely in in 2022."

Now, according to the claims from the group White Coat Waste Project, Fauci's NIH funded a whopping $375,800 grant to, quote, drug beagles lock their heads in mesh cages filled with hungry sand flies so that the insects could eat them alive.

And I also have a beagle named Charlie. What a horrific thing to see happen to any living creature. And as though we needed any more reasons to dislike Dr. Fauci, as though we needed another reason that he probably shouldn't have his job. I mean, this guy has flip-flopped on everything COVID from the very beginning. Remember, the very beginning of COVID, he told us no masks were required and then he went to two masks, three masks, masked mandates, vaccine mandates. There's a lot of question as to whether or not taxpayer-funding went to gain of function research, as you were just referencing at the Wuhan Institute of Virology where likely the COVID pandemic originated. He has tried to cancel football games, has told us we can't have parties, has tried to cancel holidays. Now, he's telling us he doesn't even know if we can have Christmas again this year. And then you look at this experimentation on the beagles and they use beagles, by the way, because of their temperament, because they don't generally fight back as much as other dogs, whenever they're put through this torturous process. These dogs were first debarked which means, they cut their vocal cords so that they couldn't cry out in pain when they were being tortured to death. And then as you just describe, horrifically put in a box with sand flies to eat them alive. Now, I don't know anywhere else other than Washington, D.C. full of a bunch of swampy people, where you cannot perform well in your job and keep your job as Dr. Fauci has for so long, but if there was any reason we need to get rid of this guy, it has Republicans, Democrats and everybody in between outraged as rightly so.

Dr. Fauci misled us on that for the past year and a half. Then we have what happened last week that you point out. He misled us about the NIH funding gain of function research through EcoHealth at the Wuhan lab. And, of course, now, we have this terrible disgusting story where our tax dollars were used to fund research that tortured animals. So, again, this is a -- this guy has got to go.

According to court records, Baldwin did not know that the weapon contained a live round. Hutchins was killed while Baldwin was rehearsing a scene that involved him pointing the weapon at a camera lens. And here to explain more, FOX News legal analyst Greg Jarrett, along with weapons master, Bryan Carpenter, is with us. Brian, guys -- I want to go -- I just want to go through some of what we got here. We got a chief electrician laying blame on the accident on the armorer and producers. Then we've got reports of at least two accidental gun discharges on the set of this movie and the days leading up to this fatal shooting of the cinematographer, and the discharges on October 16th, you know, prompted a complaint to a supervisor about safety practices, crew members asked you know not to be named. And you had union members walk off the job as a result of a lack of safety on the set, and then you've got you know other information that we're finding out too that there is a possibility of an involuntary manslaughter charge. You know, Bryan, let me ask you what is the proper handling of a firearm on a set like this and how did a live round get in that gun?"

      "utterance": "You know, there's so many levels of safety protocols before it even gets to an actor. You start off with the weapon has been cleared before it's even put into the safe, which is usually on the props truck. It's moved from the safe to the armorer's cart or bag, depending on how many guns are being used that day. It's cleared then. It's then moved on to the set, generally locked in a cart on set waiting for the scene to be filmed. At that point in time, it's checked a third time, and this is just all within, you know, the time of you're getting ready for that morning shoot. And then prior to handing off to an actor or an actress before the scene starts, you're going to get a double verification at that point. In other words, you're going to take the weapon, you're going to call for the AD, first AD, DP, director, key grip sometimes, definitely all the actors. They're going to all check this weapon make sure it's safe. Depending on your relationship you have with the crew, it could be one, it could be all, but at least two. And that's just before even things standing off."

And Alec Baldwin himself, if any, I don't think he purposely set out to kill this woman, and I don't even like the guy but I'm just being honest.

Failure to do so can result in a criminal charge against him. You've got an inexperienced armorer --"
