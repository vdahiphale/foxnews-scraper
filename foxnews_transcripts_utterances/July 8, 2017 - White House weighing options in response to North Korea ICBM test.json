      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Right. I think the premise of efforts both to negotiate with and pressure North Korea over the years have been grounded on the notion that you could change the behavior of the regime. And adding pressure to China to increase their pressure on North Korea to change North Korean behavior falls for the same reason. The North Koreans see a deliverable nuclear weapons capability as essential to regime survival, the ability to project power and, quite frankly, to sell or rent that technology to countries like Iran and even terrorist groups."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Right, but China is basically North Korea's patron. I mean, if China weren't assisting in doing business and buying its minerals and buying its coal and selling it, you know, goods and needs, North Korea could not survive. So why not put pressure on China to say, look, this is not your national interest here. You don't want a nuclear North Korea on your border. That is not helping you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "China's economic connection to North Korea is unquestionably essential to the North's regime survival. That is why my approach would be to convince China it's in their interest to merge the two Koreas to reunite them. But consider the arguments of that putting pressure on China to put pressure on North Korea. We are going to name a few Chinese banks, individuals. These pinprick sanctions never work because once you name the A, B, C Corporation to sanction it, amazingly, the X, Y and Z Corporation springs up to do business. So if you want to put pressure on China you have got to put big pressure on a big economy. Are we willing to cut off access to the American market to all Chinese banks to get their attention? That is where the idea breaks down."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

They are talking now about, at least beginning with tariffs on steel as early as next week, Chinese steel. What do you think -- how effective would that kind of economic pressure be on China?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "I don't think it would be terribly effective as regards North Korea. I could see a Trump administration imposing those kinds of sanctions on China for purposes of trade negotiation leverage. I can easily see that. And I do think Donald Trump really, if you focus down on key issues for him, the nuclear weapons programs of North Korea and Iran are two issues very central to his administration. So I think he is fully prepared to be tougher than the Obama administration, the George W. Bush administration or the Bill Clinton administration. But the issue is how much pressure do you need to put on China? I don't think, when he listens to his economic advisors, it would be enough. That is why I think this premise that we are -- all of these actions are intended to change the behavior of the North Korean regime ultimately fail. I think you need to change the regime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right. You need to change the regime. How do you do that? Robert Joseph, who was a colleague of yours in the Bush administration, talked about a comprehensive strategy aimed at precisely that. So you would ramp up the members of proliferation initiative. You stop them from selling goods or being able to get goods in for the nuclear program. You start to spread the real truth to the North Korean people from the south and elsewhere to try to maybe develop some opposition inside North Korea. And you really squeeze their cash flow. Although, it is harder to do that entirely because of China. What else would you need to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Bob's right. I would do all that. But what you need to do fundamentally is persuade China. Contrary to the policy that they pursued for many years, that it is in their best interest ultimately to reunite the two Koreas and eliminate the North Korean nuclear weapons program. The Chinese say they don't want North Korea with nuclear weapons. Why? Not because they are a potential target, but because, ultimately, they fear Japan will get nuclear weapons. And that is a real threat to China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "I do not believe that is the way to go. I think that would simply encourage a much wider nuclear arms race worldwide. I think it really is - - in China today, there is a debate among the older leadership and the younger leadership. Those are relative terms in China. The younger Chinese leaders, I think, by and large, see North Korea as a pretty ugly piece of baggage. There is a way to make a deal here. The Chinese historically have feared American troops on the river. We do not want to be on the river. We want to get the southern tip of the peninsula. And here is the main point to China I think. At some stage, North Korea will be threatening enough that an American president will really have to consider the use of military force. And if that happens, there could be chaos on the peninsula. That has to be to China's disadvantage. So, China, you can do this the easy way or you can it the hard way."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

The president tweeting, quote, \"Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter. So much for China working with us. But we had to give it a try!\" So it is there room for negotiation? Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; editorial board member, Mary Kissel; and columnist, Bill McGurn. So, Dan, you heard Ambassador Bolton. Do you share his urgency here and what do you think Trump will do? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: I do share his urgency, Paul. But, you know, the question is, how have we arrived at this point of urgency? I mean, you know, back during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, when we had that nuclear standoff, there was a lot of serious thinking around the idea about deterrence, nuclear deterrence."

And as John Bolton was suggesting, it is not just North Korea. The nuclear genie is out of the bottle. Iran now, almost assuredly, is pursuing nuclear capabilities. There is the possibility that terrorists could get their hands on a small nuclear weapon. And I think that the time has come to start recommissioning the sort of people who can think about gradually deterring this sort of thing u sing convention weapons, maybe even tactical nuclear weapons. But you run the risk here --"

Now, if Iran were to, say, get close to what North Korea is able to do -- and they do have a very sophisticated missile program -- does anyone think that the Israelis are going to sit there and simply allow a situation of acceptance to exist? It is inconceivable. So I think the idea that we could acquiesce at this point is simply giving up and that we need a lot more intelligent thinking about what we can do to deter getting to the point where we have no option, as I was suggesting, other than a first strike.

We want to make it better. And we have failed to do that, to say why this isn't working for you. I mean, I think that -- we would see it later with the governors having flexibility to improve the program and so forth.

Let's face it, these Republicans moderates are talking like Democrats, right? You raise taxes on the wealthy, or at least these people with upper incomes to pay for other programs. That is what they did with the 3.8 percent tax originally. The idea that it is a tax cut for the rich simply jumps over the fact that when Obamacare was passed they slapped this capital gains tax on people making $250,000 to pay for it.

I think he would have the same credibility as a businessman to give that address on, say, corporate tax cuts, to say, this is a way to make us more competitive and not give companies an incentive to go relocate in Ireland and so forth.

Two things that Donald Trump mentioned, stop destabilizing Ukraine and stop supporting authoritarian regimes in Syria. I do not think that is going to happen anytime soon. In so far as the Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border, and as Putin has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve in the Middle East.

Still ahead, one group of immigrants facing deportation here in the U.S. could be a target of ISIS if they are sent back to their homeland. We look at the fate of Iraqi Christians under close watch by the feds."

Fourteen hundred Iraqi Christians, some of them in the Detroit area, were recently detained by immigration agents. Their status is now in legal limbo."

      "utterance": "In June, there was an immigration sweep in Detroit. It ended up catching a lot of Iraqi Christians who were living there. And what this really dates back to is, for years, Iraq wouldn't take people back. It wouldn't allow you to deport them. Under Donald Trump's travel ban, that changed. Iraq agreed to take them back. So you have people who committed petty crimes, in some cases, decades ago. Have built lives, have built families, who are now eligible for deportation back to Iraq."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "It kind of runs the gamut. So on one extreme end, you've got the head of a mafia, someone that had a murder conviction. On the opposite extreme, you have people who served probation for drug charges but have not committed crimes since. You have people that have committed misdemeanor fraud."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Even misdemeanors?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Even misdemeanors. What this means is you can come to the United States legally, but once you commit that crime, your immigration status is eligible for deportation. In a lot of cases, they had these decades since the crime occurred, have not committed repeat crimes, but they are now eligible for deportation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "But otherwise, they have green cards. They have visas. They're legal -- these people are not illegal immigrants. These are people here legally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "They came here legally. They're status is eligible for deportation now, which is kind of a legal gray area."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. And under U.S. immigration law, if you commit a crime and you have that status, even if you have legal status but you're not a citizen, then you are subject to deportation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. And this is where it gets complicated, I think, for both progressives and the Trump administration. So because these are Iraqi Christians, if they are sent back, they will face persecution. You've seen Mike Pence saying, for instance, that Christians are subject to genocide in Iraq."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "In Iraq? Remember, these are -- they're not going back to Syria. Iraq has a functioning government. It has police and so on. But you're still saying the record is they will face persecution in Iraq?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. And if you look at what happened to the Christian community there in the last 15 years, it was 1.5 million in 2003. Four- fifths of them have left. So the U.S. government has acknowledged that as a genocide. They view that threat as very real. There is also concern about where in Iraq they will be sent back to, places like Irbil would be less insecure for them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK, so what is the legal recourse now? And the Trump administration said -- Donald Trump has said that he pays particular attention to persecuted Christians in the Middle East. Does he have to step up and do something? Can he do something?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "It's very tricky. Basically, the burden of proof is on the immigrants. They have three real options. They can apply for relief under the Convention of Torture at the U.N. They can look for a pardon for the original crime, either from the president or from the governor. Or they can argue that this is going to pose extreme hardship to their citizens, spouse or children. All of those are very difficult to prove. And there is also a jurisdictional question. So you have the Eastern District of Michigan saying, we're not even sure if we can answer this. It might have to be handled administratively. It is very complex right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And it almost does suggest that, given the challenge that these immigrants have, the government in the United States is going to have to say, you know what, we do think you will face persecution under the Geneva Convention on Torture and, therefore, we are going to make a special dispensation here. Is that, ultimately, what you think should happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "It is. But I think it is a tricky one for progressives because they positioned themselves as the main defender of the immigrants. What this brings --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "-- is a religious question. In this case, the persecution is explicitly because of religion. But if you apply religion here, why not with the travel ban? Why not with prioritizing Christians for refugee status over Muslims from Iraq? It opens up a lot of questions both for the administration and for its progressive opponents."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "You can argue also there is a problem in other places, so you might -- I see what you mean. It is a slippery slope argument that you would have to allow in a lot more people. What do you think will happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "It is up for grabs right now. I think this is a case that is very politically charged and emotionally charged. I think, uniquely, American's have sympathy for Iraqi Christians. I think that may put some pressure on the administration."

Charlie's parents want to take him to the United States for experimental treatment. But the British courts are refusing, ruling his doctors in the U.K. should take him off life support and that Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity.

The wording of the European court about that the parents have rights, overriding control is vested in the court, exercising it's independent and objective background. I mean, this is just chilling. And this is what it comes down to when you have a government-run health care. These questions come down to not what is to be done. I don't know what treatment the child should get. But who gets to make that decision?"

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

Are they saying that if Charlie Gard can go home, if his parents can say -- or sent him to the U.S. for treatment, that somehow other parents want to take terrible cases, people on life support, people with diseases that are probably not going to recover, we can't let -- everyone will want that kind of treatment then."

Better for Charlie to be taken off a ventilator. And we know what is best for Charlie. And that is what should scare people because it's setting precedent --"

      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, they do sound like a death panel. But, look, Paul, there are a couple of things going on that are very European that Americans ought to be watching this. Euthanasia is much more popular in Europe than it is here. The Netherlands has an aggressive policy of euthanasia. And it applies generally to elderly people. But the argument is extend it as well to the mentally disabled and now to infants. I mean, it is a concept known as a duty to die. And I think the other thing that we have to be aware of is that most of Europe have these nationalized health care systems that are under tremendous economic pressure. And cost-containment is an idea that sits beneath a lot of these decisions not to treat people. Because it is just too expensive. And that is the sort of thing United -- you know, that we should be aware of right now as we debate whether we want to go towards more of that kind of national-provided health care."

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, it is one of those consequences, because you get to the point where your cost, especially among elderly people, are so high that you say, these people have a duty to die because we simply cannot afford to pay for them. And especially with Charlie Gard, that will be expensive treatment. But still, in the United States, where we do have the best neonatal care in the world, we can experiment and try to find a way towards helping infants like that. But under the cost-containment environment, you simply don't do that, Paul."

Do we really want a government bureaucracy making these decisions about our children? In this case, because they raised the money, as you say, we don't have the issue of someone claiming that the state should spend three or four million to keep someone alive at the end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Also, allowing the state to make that decision allows them to make future ones. Right now, it is Charlie Gard and this very rare disease. But who is to say somewhere down the line it is not the state saying a child with Down's syndrome don't have quality of life? We shouldn't help them either. We do not want it. It is terrifying."

I mean, we all know how electric cars are supposed to be so desirable for saving the planet that they are sold with huge tax breaks for buyers. Well, apparently, that generosity doesn't quite extend to saving the roads. Because a lot of states like California and Michigan are now imposing fees on electric cars, EVB's, to pay for the repair of roads and bridges. At least 13 states have these EVB's now. Obviously, what the state giveth with one hand, it taketh away with the other."

I don't mean that in a good way. We found out this week that homelessness in New York is up almost 40 percent, the highest rate in more than 12 years. So while our trains are derailing and we've got public urination in the streets and the homeless everywhere, where is Bill de Blasio? He's off to Germany to protest at the G-20."

This is nonetheless a miss to Sweden that decided the organizers of its biggest music festival, have decided that the way to answer this is to have a man-free concert series going forward. Men will simply not be allowed to attend. There has to be some better way of dealing with sexual assault, maybe policing or something, than banning half of humanity from listening to good music."

A spokesman for the Constantine (ph) family that endowed it said it was appropriate that his alma mater recognize him. Justice Scalia once said that he wrote for law students. So this is a great example of his legacy. The opinions are what really matters. But a tip of the hat to Harvard for honoring a son whose views weren't always popular on that campus."
