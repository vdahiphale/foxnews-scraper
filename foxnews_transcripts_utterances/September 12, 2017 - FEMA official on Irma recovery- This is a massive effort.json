When he gave his -- when his book came out and he gave his interview, the president of Dartmouth to his credit said that's not the way we operate. We operate in the marketplace of ideas, civil discourse. Well, a hundred members of the faculty at Dartmouth wrote a letter on whose support do you suppose they took? They took the support of the faculty member, not the president.

He thought about that, put pen to paper and put that out, which is absolutely appalling. His statement was outrageous. But quite, frankly, what I found outrageous is this famed liberal, you know, anguish over the DACA decision. Donald Trump is pro-dreamer. He said from the very beginning, before the inauguration, he wants to work something out to help the dreamers stay. DACA is unconstitutional, OK? Even Barack Obama admitted he doesn't have the authority to suspend deportations as the president of the United States with executive action. So it was being challenged by attorneys general that we're going to sue and it could have been overturned in the courts. So what Donald Trump has done, he could have just gotten rid of it and started then, and let the chips fall where they may, instead he gave congress six months to do its job and to pass some legislation. He said that he wants to work with congress, wants to work with Nancy Pelosi. I don't see what's evil about that, Richard. It's time for the resistance to grow up. The president of the United States had reached out his hands to Democrats and said let's work something out to help the dreamers.

No more thumb print. So this is good news for teenagers, it is bad news for parents. And you know what I mean. The cost, $999, you know people are going to pay up. As Apple CEO Tim Cook puts it, in our quote of the night, no other device in our lifetimes has had the impact on the world that the iPhone has. That is the truth. For better or worse, folks.

Those are the Florida straits, absolutely gorgeous. But when Hurricane Irma slammed down the Cudjoe Key, the winds there: 130 miles per hour; the winds here, probably, 120. Those were devastating enough. But the storm surge here was six to eight feet, pushing everything that was closer to the ocean side way up here into Darryl Potter's trailer, crumbling it as well as all of their stuff. Of course, you see the sign up on the pole. It was Potter's paradise. Won't be that again for weeks, months, maybe even longer, if ever. Look at all the debris just ruined about kitchen sinks, they're over there, washers, dryers smashed up, personal belongings, golf carts upside down. Just absolute devastation and a heartbreak for residents coming in this morning to check out the damage. Now, just up the street here on U.S.-1, we met with Clay Cotter -- Clay Crocket, rather. He came in with us at 7:00 a.m. when the road block opened up in Florida City after being evacuated, stuck in Boca Raton for a week. Well, when he looked at his place, he saw debris damage, devastation everywhere. Foliage totally gone. His home, his little bit of paradise, totally lost.

This is the date they searched for a body. This is what they found inside, zero. To date, no bodies have been found in the keys. But the true story is down in the lower keys, the lowest 20, 25 miles of the keys down to Key West, search and rescue teams are still just now getting in there. The damage and destruction are just devastating down there. In fact, just moments ago, FEMA estimates that 25 percent of all homes from Key Largo to Key West, that's a nearly 100-mile stretch, 25 percent of those homes are now gone -- totally destroyed.

The president is trying to deal with tax reform this evening. In fact, right now, he's hashing out a plan over dinner with these six individuals -- three Democrats, three Republicans at the White House tonight. It comes as Fox confirms that the president will go on a cross-country tour to build national momentum for the tax reform plan. There is no bigger item on the agenda right now for the Trump White House. 13 states, seven weeks, many of them are states that he won in November, and where Democrats are facing very tough races ahead."

      "speaker": "CORKER",

And every military leader that we have tells us that, again, that's our greatest threat. Countries, great countries like ours over time, fall if they don't deal with these types of issues -- the fiscal issues, the economic issues. On tax reform, what I hope we're going to be able to do and I'm glad the meetings are taking place tonight at the White House and today here in the capital. What I hope we're going to be able to do is generate growth that will help generate income that will help deal with some of these fiscal issues. But we've got to get it right when we do it. I'm all for pro-growth tax reform. We need to make sure when we do it, we are taking into account the deficits, and what we do over time reduce those. But I'm glad the president is reaching out and going to be putting out the effort."

    {

And, you know, we're going to be looking at some follow-up numbers over the next couple of days to see, you know, if the assumptions that are being made will work relative to also not increasing the debt. But, Martha, you just hit the nail on the head. There's just no appetite here to deal with the spending side. 70 percent of what we spend, Martha, is not even part of the budget; it's called mandatory spending. And if you show up, you get it. The fastest growing line item is, believe it or not, with these low-interest rates, it's the interest on the debt. And so, we're not really -- we're not in any way dealing with these issues."

But it really says to Americans is there's an easy way out of this. All we have to do is cut the wasteful spending in Washington. Well, the fact of the matter is, Martha, 70 percent of the spending that we do is, again, mandatory spending. It has nothing much at all to do with the waste. It has to do with the fact that we've got this huge demographic group of people coming through the system that is participating in this.

So, I know people refer to that in tweets. I just have no sense whatsoever that would be the case. The president and I have an unusual relationship. It's very frank. We know each other very well.

Clinton admitting that having a private e-mail server was a dumb mistake, though, she claims it was also a dumb scandal because she thinks it was blown out of proportion. Clinton allowing that her messaging was off because voters were so angry about the financial crisis and all she did was offer a series of plans when they \"wanted me to share their anger.\" Clinton also acknowledging her comment that she wanted to put coal miners out of business is the one she regrets the most. Because without context, she says, it sounded heartless. Now, the coal controversy is one of many difficult moments from that campaign where the candidate tried to explain it away. And that's why the White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders today said she thinks it's sad that Clinton is releasing this and trying to prop up book sales."

So many people -- other people have been out there writing books, writing articles. Pundits have been on television devising reasons why they think that she lost. So, she has more than earned her right. She does take a lot of the personal blame in this. She talks about the fact that we had a very difficult time breaking through the noise in terms of our message. She talks about how that she wishes she used two different e-mail devices, and that she didn't have a private e-mail server. She goes into a lot of that. But she also, and I'm so happy that she did this, because, again, a lot of us on the campaign wanted to know what was going through her head during a lot of these pivotal moments. She talks about Russia, she talks about, a lot about James Comey reopening the investigation 12 days before the campaign without any context. So, I'm glad that she's talking about this.

Look, Al Gore, who lost an incredible race and had an incredible thing happen with him with the Supreme Court, no book. John McCain, no book. Mitt Romney, no book.

In the 70's, Martha, before you were born, I was voted one of the most repressive college administrators in the country by a group called the revolutionary communist youth party. They were very fringe. The problem with Antifa is not just Antifa itself, it's that they're getting some measure of broader support. I notice the nation magazine kind of blessed them. Slate looks -- smiled on a couple of their violent incidents. And now you have this faculty member at Dartmouth who is all for Antifa. When he gave his -- when his book came out and he gave his interview, the president of Dartmouth to his credit said that's not the way we operate. We operate in the marketplace of ideas, civil discourse. Well, a hundred members of the faculty at Dartmouth wrote a letter on whose support do you suppose they took? They took the support of the faculty member, not the president. So, if you've got 100 faculty members at a so- called leading ivy-league university saying, you know, we're with this Antifa guy, that violence is fine against people with whom you disagree, then you've got a problem that is spreading. Not only is the doctrine noxious, the support of it in some circle is noxious. And what constitute fascism in their view? That's seems to be a creeping definition as well."

You know, another thing that Bill Ayers said in this interview was, well, because fascism is on the rise in this country. White supremacy is on the rise. The Ku Klux Klan is on the rise. The Nazis are on the rise, he says. And then you've got this comment from an ESPN reporter, anchor, Jamila Hill, let's put up what she said. Donald Trump is a white supremacist who largely surrounds himself with other white supremacists. And here's the ESPN statement on this, the comments on twitter from Jamila Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN, your thoughts?"

You remember this is the company that, ridiculous as it may seem, said a man name Robert Lee couldn't do the football game at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville because of his name. He's an Asian. This is the company that fired Curt Schilling, the Red Sox pitcher, because he said, I think, boys ought to go to boys rooms and girls ought to go to girls rooms. But on this one they just said she made an error. But again, she talked about Donald Trump being a white supremacist. Put the two stories together, Martha. If he's a white supremacists and all those around him are white supremacists, according to the doctrine of Antifa violence can be used. Indeed, violence can be recommended.

Then the Supreme Court said we're going to keep the travel ban in place except for people from the six countries that the president wants to bar who have, quote, bonafide relationships, closed quote, with Americans. Justices, Thomas Alito and Gorsuch said, wait a minute, guys, who are we to rewrite the president's executive order? And what does bonafide relationship mean? Well, the DHS interrupted bonafide relationship to mean that much, and a federal judge in Hawaii interpreted bonafide relationship to mean that much. And the ninth circuit increased it even more.

So the decision tonight, which is unsigned and we don't know what the vote is, let's stay in place the hole that the Supreme Court wrote in the president's executive order which was expanded by the Hawaii federal judge to include relationships like a job offer or a college admission.

And that is in one person's hands, or however you want to put it, and that's President Trump, right? President Trump was the person who made the decision to repeal DACA. And I think the president regrets that decision.

So I don't know what's so evil about saying that we're going to take it off the books and we're going to come up with a solution. And you're saying it's evil, evil, evil."

      "utterance": "Oh, no doubt. And look, that statement from Congressman Gutierrez, that wasn't like an off the cuff remark that he made in a fit of anger, that was a written statement he put out. He thought about that, put pen to paper and put that out, which is absolutely appalling. His statement was outrageous. But quite, frankly, what I found outrageous is this famed liberal, you know, anguish over the DACA decision. Donald Trump is pro-dreamer. He said from the very beginning, before the inauguration, he wants to work something out to help the dreamers stay. DACA is unconstitutional, OK? Even Barack Obama admitted he doesn't have the authority to suspend deportations as the president of the United States with executive action. So it was being challenged by attorneys general that we're going to sue and it could have been overturned in the courts. So what Donald Trump has done, he could have just gotten rid of it and started then, and let the chips fall where they may, instead he gave congress six months to do its job and to pass some legislation. He said that he wants to work with congress, wants to work with Nancy Pelosi. I don't see what's evil about that, Richard. It's time for the resistance to grow up. The president of the United States had reached out his hands to Democrats and said let's work something out to help the dreamers. Do you people hate Donald Trump so much that you're not even willing to do that?"

So eventually you have to say, and then after that point, we will not allow people to come in, you know, illegally into this country, and they will not be grand fathered in if they came in with their parents. I mean, at some point the legislation has to articulate where the boundary is on this program. Or else you might as well not have any boundaries at all. Mark first."

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "That's what needs to be negotiated. That's why we need six months for congress to do something. By the way, Donald Trump even gave away his leverage and said that if we don't work it out in six months we'll revisit the issue. I mean, his hand is outstretched to work something out that is constitutional unlike this executive action. That will be sustainable and that will help the dreamers. So, you could go on and on, Richard, as much as you want about George Bush and the Republican congress. You've got a Republican president right now saying let's work together."

      "utterance": "So today, breathlessly, Apple announced the newest iPhone, it's the iPhone X, I said it first, but don't say that. It's the iPhone 10. It's a Roman numeral. So what happened to number 9? There's no Apple -- iPhone number 9. So the big feature of this thing is that it relies on facial recognition. You have to stare at it to open it. No more home button. No more thumb print. So this is good news for teenagers, it is bad news for parents. And you know what I mean. The cost, $999, you know people are going to pay up. As Apple CEO Tim Cook puts it, in our quote of the night, no other device in our lifetimes has had the impact on the world that the iPhone has. That is the truth. For better or worse, folks. So also tonight, we want to congratulate Eric and Lara Trump on the birth of their first child. Eric tweeted out today that he was excited to announce son, Luke. Grandpa now has 9 grandchildren. Good night, everybody. See you tomorrow. END Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
