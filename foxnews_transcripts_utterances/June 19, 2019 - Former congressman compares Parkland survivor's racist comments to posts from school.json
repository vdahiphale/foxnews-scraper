And as you said she won season 13 on \"The Bachelor.\" A few years ago, she went down to the Dominican Republic with her family and stayed at Nickelodeon Resort in Punta Cana. On her second day in the D.R., Rycroft got an upset stomach but it quickly passed, and she went on to say how much fun she had even posting on social media that she made memories of a lifetime. But for when she got home, Rycroft said she got severe cramping and was miserable for days. Last Friday she went to the doctor and posted this, quoting, \"After a really rough week I had been put on a liquid diet and given meds for my severe cramping. Fingers crossed this goes away in three days. Doc says next step is parasite testing, it doesn't.\" Then yesterday she posted this, quoting. \"More blood work done today. Blood pressure was 90 over 50, so they're monitoring it, but new meds are making me feel so much better. Test results by Thursday at the latest, but this is good progress.\" We should find out more about her mystery illness tomorrow. She assumes it was some foodborne illness but nobody else in her family got sick. And of course, over the past year, nine American tourists have died in the D.R. and they share some very unusual common links like drinking alcohol from their hotel minibars and all of them died from heart attacks and/or water on the lungs. In fact, one couple died of the same thing at the same time, at least five dozen others have gotten sick but recovered including a Colorado couple who eventually tested positive for pesticide poisoning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating at least one of the cases and the FBI is viewing the toxicology results of those who died to see if they can better explain exactly what's going on.

What we're actually talking about, and what we should be talking about is progress. I think what you saw today was a political show around reparations to create an atmosphere again in this country that I think is polarizing and divisive. What we should be talking about is a way forward that it's quite inclusive. Education, making sure that every single zip code in this country has a high-quality education. We should be talking about the opportunity zone legislation signed by President Trump that brings back billions of dollars to the most distressed communities in America. We should be talking about criminal justice reform done by the Republican Party that will create opportunities for returning citizens to not recidivate. There are a lot of topics that we should have.

He suggested that there is a way forward, and this country has been evolving in the direction of progress. And as a point, in fact, recognizing the progress this nation has made, we the nation, elected President Barack Obama, that was a sign of progress. It was not to be conflated with his comments around reparations."

And if we're going to open this door, are we going to look at everybody who had some type of grievance? Are we going to look at Native Americans who certainly got a (INAUDIBLE)? What about Southerners, whose homes were burned down?"

Is it limited solely to African Americans who, by the way, were enslaved largely because of policies put forth by Democrats? It was Republicans who fought slavery who sought to create a freedom.

Now, if you break that down to Democratic primary voters, a majority do support reparations in some form and that's what you're hearing Kamala Harris and others calling for reparations in some form.

I think a lot of people are looking at this whole reparations thing as another swarm of social welfare. They're looking at it as a handout, and that's not what it is. This is the United States trying to make, you know, amends for its sins of the past. And I would say --"

It was Lincoln and his Congress that decided that free blacks should receive the 40 acres and a mule. And when he was assassinated, Johnson overturned that. So, it's surprising to me, it's so here, Republicans come out and say, we're, we're the party of Lincoln and we, we freed the slaves. But then, when it turns around to say, well what about reparations for those people, it's oh no, let's not do that. And the United States has done this in the past."

I mean, you would really have to go into a person's history and into their DNA to really determine -- you know, in fact, who is a descendant of a slave, people bring up Barack Obama. Barack Obama is not a descendant of a slave. His father is from African -- from Africa, and his mother is white.

You look at the Democratic frontrunner Biden, Sanders, $6 million in their first 24 hours. $25 million, that's a lot of support and a lot of enthusiasm out of the gate, Ari."

The big picture still is mixed for the president. He goes into the reelection with two big favorable, one is the economy and a second his status as an outsider. But it's his very status as an outsider that also has made so many people now rise up against him thinking he's too much of an outsider he doesn't fit. In so many ways, what's going to be tested in 2020 is whether the Trump campaign can deliver first-time voters, people who gave up on politics, people who hate politicians, but they're going to come out because they love Trump, versus what we heard for two or three years that Trump is terrible, Trump is not the what we want as a representative of this country, that he's over the top. And it's that rhetoric that allowed the Democrats to do well in 2018 in the House. Now it gets put to the test in 2020."

But the polls, Ari, some are quick to discount them because of what we saw happen in 2016, but the polls are telling a different story showing in potential matchups frontrunners like Biden and Sanders beating the president. The President's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale took that on and made this bold forecast. BRAD PARSCALE, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: The abilities that we have to turn out voters, it's not -- the polling can't understand that. That's why it was so wrong in 2016. It was 100 percent wrong. Nobody got it right and not one public poll. And the reason why is it's not 1962 anymore. I think we went in electoral landslide as of today."

And if you're Donald Trump, you want to be winning in those polls right now against a person like Biden. Now, I will say that Democrats have the advantage of generally being generic Democrats at this point. The president hasn't beat them up yet. He hasn't defined them as the Socialist, as the Liberals, as the spenders, as the out-of-touch people that is invariably going to happen in a very concrete way, but be careful on the polls. For the President's people, the president's team, the polls really weren't that far off, Sandra. The final real clear average of polls in 2016 predicted Hillary would win by 3.2. She won the popular vote by two point one. They're only off by one point one percentage point. That is pretty darn close. The difference was the President threaded the needle in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and did indeed defy the state polls in those three states to pull off the narrow victory having lost the popular vote. But still those polls are good indications of general direction, and the general direction should get better for the president if he's going to win."

In fact, I just want to contradict what Dan said because I think Nancy Pelosi is under pressure from Democrats who say, forget the politics as to whether or not it helps us going into 2020 or doesn't, the Congress has a responsibility under its constitutional obligation as a first member of the government, you know, the three branches of government to hold the executive accountable and future presidents if they see this guy's behavior might behave even worse."

But at the same time Harvard could do what it wants. There has no obligation to accept this kid, you can rescind it for any reason. You have a Harvard man, you know, it's a character school, it's an elite school, do you want to associate yourself with someone throwing the n-word around. He's a high-profile young man, obviously a very bright man but I don't think it does Harvard any good to bring someone that has that kind of inflammatory profile into the community. I understand redemption and I forgive him even though I'm in no position to forgive him, but sometimes life is about facing the consequences for what you do. I'm sure he'll be extremely successful later in life."

He included the phrase killing all expletive Jews. The Washington Post has to call him out, basically sort of taking the other side here, taking the side of the student, saying Harvard has betrayed its mission to educate. In that piece it writes, \"The decision to bounce an apologetic student over a sophomoric mistake betrays a lack of intellect -- intellectual confidence in that original mission. It's not the job of Harvard College, properly understood to certify a relative handful of perfect human specimens and train them in the proper expression of approved ideas. Education is about improvement. It is rooted in the faith that errors can become resources, ignorance can be enlightened, horizons can be expanded, improvement is the value from which learning thrives its moral character.\""

But Harvard is its own university, it doesn't have to fall into any sort of pressure situation. The real issue is, what kind of snake for political purposes went and then took these comments off of this internet situation and then leaked it to damage this kid Kyle for partisan reasons.

She is a former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader contested on dancing with the stars. And as you said she won season 13 on \"The Bachelor.\" A few years ago, she went down to the Dominican Republic with her family and stayed at Nickelodeon Resort in Punta Cana. On her second day in the D.R., Rycroft got an upset stomach but it quickly passed, and she went on to say how much fun she had even posting on social media that she made memories of a lifetime. But for when she got home, Rycroft said she got severe cramping and was miserable for days. Last Friday she went to the doctor and posted this, quoting, \"After a really rough week I had been put on a liquid diet and given meds for my severe cramping. Fingers crossed this goes away in three days. Doc says next step is parasite testing, it doesn't.\" Then yesterday she posted this, quoting. \"More blood work done today. Blood pressure was 90 over 50, so they're monitoring it, but new meds are making me feel so much better. Test results by Thursday at the latest, but this is good progress.\" We should find out more about her mystery illness tomorrow. She assumes it was some foodborne illness but nobody else in her family got sick. And of course, over the past year, nine American tourists have died in the D.R. and they share some very unusual common links like drinking alcohol from their hotel minibars and all of them died from heart attacks and/or water on the lungs. In fact, one couple died of the same thing at the same time, at least five dozen others have gotten sick but recovered including a Colorado couple who eventually tested positive for pesticide poisoning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating at least one of the cases and the FBI is viewing the toxicology results of those who died to see if they can better explain exactly what's going on.

For 75 years K.T. carried Janine in his heart even saving this photo of her assuming they would never cross paths again.
