      "sentences": "Happy Tuesday, everyone. So this is crazy. On Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the FBI would investigate a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers and staff. A disturbing spike. Are we talking about legitimate charges or Trey Gowdy's hair? In the memo they decry threats of violence. But is it actual terroristic activities or parents trying to get to the bottom of a lousy education, which in the long run is more of a national threat than China, Russia and Iran combined. But the school board and the law want you to think that parental concern is now a domestic terror threat. That's right. A mom yelling at school board members at a public meeting is the same as her donning an explosive vest and blowing up a school. Demanding quality schools is now like crashing the plane into the Pentagon. They've taken the most necessary debate one could have, how to teach your kids and recast it as the perfect left-wing fantasy. Rogue educators battling a mob of Pitchfork wielding heathens all wearing mom jeans and fanny packs. And those are just the dads. Garland published the memo right after the National School Board letter demanded help from the White House because our public schools and its education leaders are under immediate threat. First, can you imagine asking Joe Biden for help on anything other than how to use Metamucil? Did you not see the Kabul airport evacuation? Asking Joe for help it's like asking Ted Bundy for a ride home.",

Teachers and parents will get into shouting matches, which isn't good. But it's understandable. Given the insane teachers unions, the brainwash, they call education, the utter disregard for difference of opinion. They don't care if our schools are dead last, they only care about preventing you from having a choice of schools or a say in the matter, which couldn't be why the NSBA suggested that these acts of malice could be the equivalent to domestic terrorism. Domestic terrorist now more watered down than Kat's court ordered urine sample. But the school board actually learned something that if you claim something is domestic terror, it's in the eye of the beholder. And no one can tell you that you weren't terrorized. So you can use it on anyone except of course rioters or looters. Just angry parents. And just you wait that harmless coworker of yours will be next.",

Parents were upset with mask mandates being imposed on their kids not to mention critical race theory. In a normal world that would be considered both physical and mental abuse. But this is a Joe Biden world and it's considered good instruction. So rather than engage the other side smeared the left hates open debate almost as much as they love open borders.

So while they target parents, you can still follow a woman into a bathroom and film her and the President will defend it. Not only will he defended, he'll probably ask what kind of shampoo she uses. You can brutalize anyone or steal anything in New York and be back on the streets in hours. You could torts businesses and permanently ruined cities like Minneapolis and never see jail time. But the FBI needs a cup of mom because she raised her voice to a transitioning social studies teacher with a rainbow tattoo on her neck. Yes, Antifa is just an idea but mom and dad are deadly. That's the world we live in. Where your speech is redefined as violence and their violence is redefined as Justice. Well done, Joe. You really are a unifier because we all think you're nuts.",

It's the worst exposure for TV journalism since Charlie Rose left his bathrobe open. In her new memoir, going there, Katie trashes almost everyone she's encountered and confesses to treating other women terribly. The book's content was enough for CBS to ban her for promoting it on their air. It's an unflattering inside look and that's saying a lot about a woman who televise her own colonoscopy. From saying she loved to piss off Diane Sawyer and admitting to purposely mistreating Ashley Banfield. She mistreated Ashley Banfield. Oh my God! Her bridge burning has many asking why she would publish something like this. But I totally get it, people love gossip. In fact, I just completed my newest tell all, it's called \"Spilling His Gut.\" In it, in it, I dish on all the seedy things some Fox hosts have done over the years. For example, did you know originally the idea for \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" was to have two anchors and an actual Fox host the show. But the animal ended up mauling Brian Kilmeade. So, they killed the idea and the fox. And Brian remains severely disfigured to this day. Look at that. So brave man for coming out like that. The makeup can only hide so much, Susan. Also, how about this: Julie Banderas' real name is Julio Canderas. She changed both her name and her gender in the 90s to avoid arrest for her participation in a murderous drug ring. Don't let her, I'm just a casual mom having wine fool you. She'll cut your heart out with a nail file. You won't believe this one. Peter Doocy is actually Steve Doocey's father. Turns out, turns out Peter is 78 years old, and Steve is 24 but has spent way too much time at a tanning bed. That boat will be going on sail shortly.

I'm going to be a rocket man.\" At 90 years old, Shatner is set to become the oldest person ever in space, aside from this. And Shatner will share the ride with three other space tourists. It's my favorite villain from Star Trek. The flight is only 10 minutes but Shatner thinks it's going to be a long, long time. So, good luck, Bill, may the force be with you. You know? Right?

On Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the FBI would investigate a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers and staff. A disturbing spike. Are we talking about legitimate charges or Trey Gowdy's hair? In the memo they decry threats of violence. But is it actual terroristic activities or parents trying to get to the bottom of a lousy education, which in the long run is more of a national threat than China, Russia and Iran combined. But the school board and the law want you to think that parental concern is now a domestic terror threat. That's right. A mom yelling at school board members at a public meeting is the same as her donning an explosive vest and blowing up a school. Demanding quality schools is now like crashing the plane into the Pentagon. They've taken the most necessary debate one could have, how to teach your kids and recast it as the perfect left-wing fantasy. Rogue educators battling a mob of Pitchfork wielding heathens all wearing mom jeans and fanny packs. And those are just the dads. Garland published the memo right after the National School Board letter demanded help from the White House because our public schools and its education leaders are under immediate threat. First, can you imagine asking Joe Biden for help on anything other than how to use Metamucil? Did you not see the Kabul airport evacuation? Asking Joe for help it's like asking Ted Bundy for a ride home."

Teachers and parents will get into shouting matches, which isn't good. But it's understandable. Given the insane teachers unions, the brainwash, they call education, the utter disregard for difference of opinion. They don't care if our schools are dead last, they only care about preventing you from having a choice of schools or a say in the matter, which couldn't be why the NSBA suggested that these acts of malice could be the equivalent to domestic terrorism. Domestic terrorist now more watered down than Kat's court ordered urine sample. But the school board actually learned something that if you claim something is domestic terror, it's in the eye of the beholder. And no one can tell you that you weren't terrorized. So you can use it on anyone except of course rioters or looters. Just angry parents. And just you wait that harmless coworker of yours will be next."

Parents were upset with mask mandates being imposed on their kids not to mention critical race theory. In a normal world that would be considered both physical and mental abuse. But this is a Joe Biden world and it's considered good instruction. So rather than engage the other side smeared the left hates open debate almost as much as they love open borders.

Right after we raid the home of this mouthy soccer mom at dawn and arrestor in front of her kids because she had her own thoughts about how our kids should be educated. So while they target parents, you can still follow a woman into a bathroom and film her and the President will defend it. Not only will he defended, he'll probably ask what kind of shampoo she uses. You can brutalize anyone or steal anything in New York and be back on the streets in hours. You could torts businesses and permanently ruined cities like Minneapolis and never see jail time. But the FBI needs a cup of mom because she raised her voice to a transitioning social studies teacher with a rainbow tattoo on her neck. Yes, Antifa is just an idea but mom and dad are deadly.

From saying she loved to piss off Diane Sawyer and admitting to purposely mistreating Ashley Banfield. She mistreated Ashley Banfield. Oh my God!

In fact, I just completed my newest tell all, it's called \"Spilling His Gut.\" In it, in it, I dish on all the seedy things some Fox hosts have done over the years. For example, did you know originally the idea for \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" was to have two anchors and an actual Fox host the show. But the animal ended up mauling Brian Kilmeade.

I'm going to be a rocket man.\" At 90 years old, Shatner is set to become the oldest person ever in space, aside from this. And Shatner will share the ride with three other space tourists. It's my favorite villain from Star Trek. The flight is only 10 minutes but Shatner thinks it's going to be a long, long time. So, good luck, Bill, may the force be with you. You know? Right?
