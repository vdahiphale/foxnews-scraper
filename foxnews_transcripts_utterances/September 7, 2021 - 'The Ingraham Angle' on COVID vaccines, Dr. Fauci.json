And it was evident in stadiums across the country that America is ready to move on from COVID and the fear mongers who want to keep us apart and afraid. Now, check out this attendance chart. More than 109,000 in Michigan; almost 100,000 at Texas A&M; nearly 86,000 in Nebraska; close to 72,000 in Atlanta for the Alabama Miami game. We have endured 18 months of varying degrees of lockdowns, capacity restrictions, mask rules, business closures, churches and schools being shuttered, concerts and sports canceled. 75 percent of adults have now gotten at least one jab. Untold millions have been naturally immunized through exposure to the virus. Yet of course, they're still treated like pariahs if they don't submit to being vaxxed. And we've known for most of this pandemic that Americans who are older and compromised need to be really careful that those with high BMI, diabetes, COPD, other chronic conditions are more likely to suffer from it. And that kids are more likely to get severely ill from the flu than they are from COVID. We also need that we need to do a better job at taking zinc and vitamin D on a daily basis. And that getting in better shape is something we cannot put off any longer as a country. But we also know that we can't let the government to terrify us into isolation. Thank God for the red states that have helped save this economy. Because if you thought Friday's jobs numbers were horrifying, and they were, imagine how much worse that be, if states like Florida and Texas had followed the COVID rules of New York and California. So at this point, knowing all of this, I think everyone is census over the weekend that everyone's just trying to have fun again, which, of course, makes the left really angry.

Well, my guess is that he's going to talk about boosters and maybe we're going to see more, I don't know, celebrity tiktokers pushing the vaccine. But as usual, Biden but kind of reminds me of the guy rushing to get in front of a parade that's almost over. Think about it this way. 150,000 more Americans that have died of COVID since Inauguration Day, that's with vaccines available for at least a good chunk of that time. The number was around 400,000 when Trump left office, when vaccines were only beginning to be rolled out. Well, that's a devastating number. It's been awful. But more awful is losing America to a new normal, which is a medical police state essentially. So in the end, it's kind of earth to Joe. We're done. We're on to the - I think you're seeing, they're on to the sick, twisted game that the public health sector has been playing on America. We get it now, we see it. We know that the blue states COVID policies didn't really work and they wrecked their economies. We know that liberal governors terrify their residents over a virus that has almost a 99.97 percent survivability for those under the age of 70. And we know when they know that the fallout from this and his other screw ups has caused Biden to suffer huge, huge in the polls. Perhaps that's the reason why some liberal publications like Vox are realizing, it's time to move beyond the COVID-control state. One problem. Smart governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida; Kristi Noem, South Dakota, they already beat you to it. Same with Bill Lee in Tennessee; Brian Kemp in Georgia, they knew from, what, May of 2020, that to save the state that they have to govern, they were going to have to learn to live with COVID as difficult and as horrible as it is. It's the experts who wasted the last 18 months moving goalposts only to pretend that we can somehow reach COVID zero. But now that COVID is starting to hurt Biden in the polls, the media is beginning to change its tune. The \"Angle\" predicted this. Today, we're moving on to the new crisis. Of course, it's climate change, and justice with COVID, the remedy, means you'll be poorer and less free. And there's always a declared consensus with dissenters villainized and canceled. Same playbook for a power grab. More on that later in the show. But for now, we can expect the usual gnashing of teeth before and after this weekend's games. They're going to be home games at Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Michigan State, Notre Dame, Clemson, Ohio State and Penn State. That's a lot of people. Millions of Americans will be happy. Many will be returning to campus after years away. [ph] Alarms. They're going to be tailgating, seeing old friends, singing their college songs, cheering as loudly as they can. Just being together as humans. That's what we need to do. We're not meant to be alone, to be cocooned off from one another. So it's time to start living again, smartly with common sense. If the rest of you prefer to stay home and shot in, be triple masked with latex gloves, that's your choice. But we're exercising our right to make a different one. And that's the \"Angle\". Joining me now is Jason Whitlock, host of \"Fearless with Jason Whitlock\" on Blaze TV. Jason, great to see you. What was it like this weekend for the country, and for those people, their students and alums and other fans that gathered in stadiums across the country to just celebrate, in the sense, being together? JASON WHITLOCK, \"FEARLESS WITH JASON WHITLOCK\" HOST: For me, Laura, and I played college football. I'm a huge college football fan. What we saw this weekend was heartening. It gave me hope. The American people are starting to wake up. They're tired of being trapped in this game of fear and control that's being played by Fauci and a lot of politicians on the left. And they - the American people are starting to wise up that they're smarter and wiser than corporate media. They're smarter than politicians that play politics with every crisis and every issue, and we're getting back to normal and people are getting comfortable with the fact. There's no denial of the impact of COVID. But there is that growing reality, we're going to have to learn live and deal with COVID, not live in fear of COVID. So I was very happy to see this. We got to remember these college football stadiums are outside our urban core, in cities, major cities that are more Democratic-controlled. And so, basically, Laura, and I hate to politicize it, but it's just true. You saw Trump America out in full force at college stadiums. People like Fauci and the people on the left know that college football is a representation of Trump America. And they want to demonize those people, autistic on them. They're not wearing masks. Why are they gathered in large groups? And, Laura, we've seen it a million times. Every protest, every rioting, looting deal, that was done in the summer of 2020, none of it was - COVID concerns were all disappeared. And that was perfectly fine. But going to a football game and supporting some of our best and brightest athletes, oh, this is terrible. This isn't a good idea.",

And it studied the risk of bat coronavirus emergence in Wuhan. Now, part of the proposal admits how dangerous all of it was. Saying, \"Fieldwork involves the highest risk of exposure to SARS, or other coronaviruses, while working in caves with high bat density overhead and the potential for fecal dust to be inhaled.\" Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright summed it up saying, \"The materials confirm that the grant supported the construction in Wuhan of novel chimeric SARS-related coronaviruses that combined a spike gene from one coronavirus with genetic information from another coronavirus, and confirmed the resulting viruses could infect human cells. The documents make it clear that assertions by Collins and Fauci that the NIH did not support gain-of-function research or potential pandemic pathogen enhancement at Wuhan are untruthful.\" That's a mouthful.

They had no idea when they got there at the time that they were going to be trapped behind enemy lines and eventually hunted, basically, by the Taliban and ISIS and abandoned by their own government. But that's exactly what happened. I found out about it about two weeks ago when the father called my office and told us what was going on. We started frantically trying to call the State Department to find out what we could do with this. We were getting literally nowhere. They were getting nothing from the State Department, no actionable, no useful information that could get them out of there. They were basically being told like everybody else via text message and whatever else, just go to the gate. And if you get to the Taliban checkpoint, just tell them that you are an American citizen. They're going to let you through. They did this repeatedly every single day for two weeks they went to the gate. It got more and more dangerous every day until eventually, like you said, she had a gun put to her head, the uncle was beaten severely, the 15- year-old was struck in the head. They were fearing for their lives. They were told if come back that they would be killed. And so once the Americans left, and at one point they were 200 feet from the gate and we could not get the Americans, the embassy to go out and identify them somehow and just get them inside the gate. So it became really obvious that they weren't going to get out of there after the Americans left. It was getting really unsafe. Luckily, the team that we had on the inside, there were Afghan SIV applicants that had worked with our American troops and security contractors for years, and we had a relationship -- when I say we, I mean the civilian team that we had on the ground. They reached out to them. They moved them around to safehouses every night to keep them home because they found out that their neighbors were being asked where they were at. The Taliban was looking for them. So we moved them up north. We got them up north on a treacherous route, a 10 hour drive up north, multiple checkpoints, and these --",

MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, AUTHOR, \"APOCALYPSE NEVER\": That's right. It has turned out that climate change means that you never have to say you're sorry for having failed to do the things that would have prevented lives from being lost. So we have seen this now around the United States. We have seen the governor of California blame the forest fires, which were caused by forest mismanagement, on climate change. We've seen now the mayor of New York and other officials blaming climate change for the floods in New York, even though better infrastructure preparedness, better evacuations would have prevented those deaths. And we are seeing it on hurricanes. And we see the frequency of hurricanes going down actually. No significant increase in the intensity of hurricanes.

      "utterance": "On Saturday and Sunday and even last night with the Ole Miss game, millions across our country were riveted by a sport that tends to bring us all together, talking about college football. And it was evident in stadiums across the country that America is ready to move on from COVID and the fear mongers who want to keep us apart and afraid. Now, check out this attendance chart. More than 109,000 in Michigan; almost 100,000 at Texas A&M; nearly 86,000 in Nebraska; close to 72,000 in Atlanta for the Alabama Miami game. We have endured 18 months of varying degrees of lockdowns, capacity restrictions, mask rules, business closures, churches and schools being shuttered, concerts and sports canceled. 75 percent of adults have now gotten at least one jab. Untold millions have been naturally immunized through exposure to the virus. Yet of course, they're still treated like pariahs if they don't submit to being vaxxed. And we've known for most of this pandemic that Americans who are older and compromised need to be really careful that those with high BMI, diabetes, COPD, other chronic conditions are more likely to suffer from it. And that kids are more likely to get severely ill from the flu than they are from COVID. We also need that we need to do a better job at taking zinc and vitamin D on a daily basis. And that getting in better shape is something we cannot put off any longer as a country. But we also know that we can't let the government to terrify us into isolation. Thank God for the red states that have helped save this economy. Because if you thought Friday's jobs numbers were horrifying, and they were, imagine how much worse that be, if states like Florida and Texas had followed the COVID rules of New York and California. So at this point, knowing all of this, I think everyone is census over the weekend that everyone's just trying to have fun again, which, of course, makes the left really angry. Dr. Fauci did not approve of all the whooping and hollering."

But the fact is, for the past year and a half, it was only a tiny sliver of elites and other professionals who were able to collect their salaries while working remotely. For regular workers, it was kind of business as usual, whether it was grocery store clerks, or people in construction, some retailers, health care workers, obviously. They didn't get to go off to the Caribbean to an island and do Zoom meetings every day and pretend they were in their home office. No, no, the regular folks worked.

Well, my guess is that he's going to talk about boosters and maybe we're going to see more, I don't know, celebrity tiktokers pushing the vaccine. But as usual, Biden but kind of reminds me of the guy rushing to get in front of a parade that's almost over. Think about it this way. 150,000 more Americans that have died of COVID since Inauguration Day, that's with vaccines available for at least a good chunk of that time. The number was around 400,000 when Trump left office, when vaccines were only beginning to be rolled out. Well, that's a devastating number. It's been awful. But more awful is losing America to a new normal, which is a medical police state essentially. So in the end, it's kind of earth to Joe. We're done. We're on to the - I think you're seeing, they're on to the sick, twisted game that the public health sector has been playing on America. We get it now, we see it. We know that the blue states COVID policies didn't really work and they wrecked their economies. We know that liberal governors terrify their residents over a virus that has almost a 99.97 percent survivability for those under the age of 70. And we know when they know that the fallout from this and his other screw ups has caused Biden to suffer huge, huge in the polls. Perhaps that's the reason why some liberal publications like Vox are realizing, it's time to move beyond the COVID-control state. One problem. Smart governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida; Kristi Noem, South Dakota, they already beat you to it. Same with Bill Lee in Tennessee; Brian Kemp in Georgia, they knew from, what, May of 2020, that to save the state that they have to govern, they were going to have to learn to live with COVID as difficult and as horrible as it is. It's the experts who wasted the last 18 months moving goalposts only to pretend that we can somehow reach COVID zero. But now that COVID is starting to hurt Biden in the polls, the media is beginning to change its tune. The \"Angle\" predicted this. Today, we're moving on to the new crisis. Of course, it's climate change, and justice with COVID, the remedy, means you'll be poorer and less free. And there's always a declared consensus with dissenters villainized and canceled. Same playbook for a power grab. More on that later in the show. But for now, we can expect the usual gnashing of teeth before and after this weekend's games. They're going to be home games at Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Michigan State, Notre Dame, Clemson, Ohio State and Penn State. That's a lot of people. Millions of Americans will be happy. Many will be returning to campus after years away. [ph] Alarms. They're going to be tailgating, seeing old friends, singing their college songs, cheering as loudly as they can. Just being together as humans. That's what we need to do. We're not meant to be alone, to be cocooned off from one another. So it's time to start living again, smartly with common sense. If the rest of you prefer to stay home and shot in, be triple masked with latex gloves, that's your choice. But we're exercising our right to make a different one. And that's the \"Angle\". Joining me now is Jason Whitlock, host of \"Fearless with Jason Whitlock\" on Blaze TV. Jason, great to see you. What was it like this weekend for the country, and for those people, their students and alums and other fans that gathered in stadiums across the country to just celebrate, in the sense, being together? JASON WHITLOCK, \"FEARLESS WITH JASON WHITLOCK\" HOST: For me, Laura, and I played college football. I'm a huge college football fan. What we saw this weekend was heartening. It gave me hope. The American people are starting to wake up. They're tired of being trapped in this game of fear and control that's being played by Fauci and a lot of politicians on the left. And they - the American people are starting to wise up that they're smarter and wiser than corporate media. They're smarter than politicians that play politics with every crisis and every issue, and we're getting back to normal and people are getting comfortable with the fact. There's no denial of the impact of COVID. But there is that growing reality, we're going to have to learn live and deal with COVID, not live in fear of COVID. So I was very happy to see this. We got to remember these college football stadiums are outside our urban core, in cities, major cities that are more Democratic-controlled. And so, basically, Laura, and I hate to politicize it, but it's just true. You saw Trump America out in full force at college stadiums. People like Fauci and the people on the left know that college football is a representation of Trump America. And they want to demonize those people, autistic on them. They're not wearing masks. Why are they gathered in large groups? And, Laura, we've seen it a million times. Every protest, every rioting, looting deal, that was done in the summer of 2020, none of it was - COVID concerns were all disappeared. And that was perfectly fine. But going to a football game and supporting some of our best and brightest athletes, oh, this is terrible. This isn't a good idea."

And Joe Biden represents that part of politics that's doing that. And there's a lot of anti-Joe Biden sentiment among, I think, college football fans. I don't think those are one offs. And I think they know that we're going to see a lot of that across the country during this college football season, because that fan base is a bit different than the fan bases of professional teams."

Fauci did lie to Congress, because new documents obtained by \"The Intercept\" show that taxpayer money from Fauci's [ph] NIH ID was funneled to the EcoHealth Alliance run by Peter Daszak. And it studied the risk of bat coronavirus emergence in Wuhan. Now, part of the proposal admits how dangerous all of it was. Saying, \"Fieldwork involves the highest risk of exposure to SARS, or other coronaviruses, while working in caves with high bat density overhead and the potential for fecal dust to be inhaled.\" Rutgers molecular biologist Richard Ebright summed it up saying, \"The materials confirm that the grant supported the construction in Wuhan of novel chimeric SARS-related coronaviruses that combined a spike gene from one coronavirus with genetic information from another coronavirus, and confirmed the resulting viruses could infect human cells. The documents make it clear that assertions by Collins and Fauci that the NIH did not support gain-of-function research or potential pandemic pathogen enhancement at Wuhan are untruthful.\" That's a mouthful.

Kids have lost a year, now going on a second year of their education; weddings have been postponed; jobs have been lost; businesses have been close, and Tony Fauci all along has been lecturing you while hiding the fact that without proper notification to his political superiors in the executive branch, funded this reckless dangerous research in a Chinese communist lab. And then went to great lengths to try to excuse them. I always wondering why early on in the pandemic, Tony Fauci insisted there's no way this virus could have come from that lab. It's not just obvious common sense. It broke out just blocks away from the lab where they're studying the coronavirus, where the lady in charge is nicknamed the bat lady. Yet he always insisted, it couldn't be possible. Well, now we know it was to cover his own tracks. It was to conceal what he had done with your tax dollars in incredibly reckless research and a Chinese communist lab."

And the stipend you mentioned, once people are set up as refugees, which is what most of these people will have to come in as, they get interest free loans from the U.S. government to resettle here. Resettlement agencies get paid, so they have a financial interest in getting these people into the refugee pipeline. They get paid to help resettle them.

But now we're talking about bringing people here and this is a totally different story. And people need to understand that this is not that unusual, what you're describing. Now, I'm not saying it's most relationships, Laura. But it's also, as observed by Military members who've been there during the last 20 years, it's also not rare in Afghanistan.

An Afghan American woman and her three children went over to visit extended family. The husband stayed back to work here. They got over there. They had no idea when they got there at the time that they were going to be trapped behind enemy lines and eventually hunted, basically, by the Taliban and ISIS and abandoned by their own government. But that's exactly what happened. I found out about it about two weeks ago when the father called my office and told us what was going on. We started frantically trying to call the State Department to find out what we could do with this. We were getting literally nowhere. They were getting nothing from the State Department, no actionable, no useful information that could get them out of there. They were basically being told like everybody else via text message and whatever else, just go to the gate. And if you get to the Taliban checkpoint, just tell them that you are an American citizen. They're going to let you through. They did this repeatedly every single day for two weeks they went to the gate. It got more and more dangerous every day until eventually, like you said, she had a gun put to her head, the uncle was beaten severely, the 15- year-old was struck in the head. They were fearing for their lives. They were told if come back that they would be killed. And so once the Americans left, and at one point they were 200 feet from the gate and we could not get the Americans, the embassy to go out and identify them somehow and just get them inside the gate. So it became really obvious that they weren't going to get out of there after the Americans left. It was getting really unsafe. Luckily, the team that we had on the inside, there were Afghan SIV applicants that had worked with our American troops and security contractors for years, and we had a relationship -- when I say we, I mean the civilian team that we had on the ground. They reached out to them. They moved them around to safehouses every night to keep them home because they found out that their neighbors were being asked where they were at. The Taliban was looking for them. So we moved them up north. We got them up north on a treacherous route, a 10 hour drive up north, multiple checkpoints, and these --"

      "utterance": "I liked it better when Schumer was dancing. Well, of course what he is talking about is the big green power grab that we've been expecting. Check out how this chart, though, shows that the truth about global disasters is much different. That is the death rate through the 20th century until today. As you can see, it barely registers. Joining me now is Michael Shellenberger author of \"Apocalypse Never.\" Michael, your response to today's messaging from Biden and company, the storms were really awful, lots of damage, loss of life in the northeast, and thus we have a climate crisis, which means the government has to spend a lot more money. MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, AUTHOR, \"APOCALYPSE NEVER\": That's right. It has turned out that climate change means that you never have to say you're sorry for having failed to do the things that would have prevented lives from being lost. So we have seen this now around the United States. We have seen the governor of California blame the forest fires, which were caused by forest mismanagement, on climate change. We've seen now the mayor of New York and other officials blaming climate change for the floods in New York, even though better infrastructure preparedness, better evacuations would have prevented those deaths. And we are seeing it on hurricanes. And we see the frequency of hurricanes going down actually. No significant increase in the intensity of hurricanes. But it means that policymakers can get away with really doing nothing and using climate change to advance an agenda to actually make our economy more dependent on weather dependent energy sources like solar and wind which simply don't function during extreme weather events."

      "utterance": "That is so bad. That's so bad. I just recently wrote an essay called \"Why I am no longer a progressive\" because I reject this idea of learned helplessness where somehow we're all victims of the weather. As you pointed out, death from natural disastrous have declined over 90 percent over the last 100 years. We're more resilient than ever. The United Nations when it put out its report a few weeks ago said that nobody is safe. That's absurd. We are safer than ever. We are suffering from safety- ism. A big part of our cultural and political problems stem from this coddling that we have had where we're so safe that we expect that hurricanes can slam into us with no consequences. The fact of the matter is after Katrina in 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers reconstructed the levees. The levees held really well in New Orleans during the last hurricane. The electrical grid is what needed the backup. And if the focus of Democrats had been more on making our electrical grid more resilient, rather than less resilient to extreme weather, then you would have actually been able to have an electrical grid."

Now, state workers who don't get it by October 16th could lose their jobs. No jabs, no jobs. This isn't just, though, happening in Oregon. It's all across the country. Joining me now exclusively is Trooper Kowing along with his attorney, Dan Thenell. Dan is also leading this suit, by the way, against the governor.

However, the cases that people are citing as that contrary authority are quite distinguishable. They are also quite old. Many people toss around the 1905 Massachusetts case as an opposition to the positions we have taken, but the factual precursors to that suit and the harm to the liberty is quite different in that case versus our case. There are many, many differences, and frankly, I think one of the strengths of our case is the unique aspects of Oregon statutory law and Oregon constitutional law, which no cases have discussed before."

However, I do expect them to follow rules, policies, and laws.\" I assume not every rule, to play devil's advocate here, probably not every rule you are thrilled about having to follow as a trooper given how your hands are tied in various ways because of a long history of jurisprudence, but do you see her point?"

It's about telling someone you're going to this vaccine or you're going to lose your job. My hope is that this is replicated. In fact, it will be replicated next week. As you know, the Oregon Fraternal Order of Police was the first entity in Oregon to file this suit. It will be replicated next week by two other groups that I represent. I really hope the governor and her people will agree to sit down with us and come out, come up with some alternatives to the too drastic ends of this executive order, either get medicine that you don't want to get, or you're going to lose your career. Many of these people will not just lose their jobs. They will lose their career. And I really hope the governor and her people will sit down with us and come up with another two alternatives for these people. There are thousands of Oregon workers who, I believe, will walk off of the job over this. And --"

According to this new \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll that came out a few days ago, 70 percent of people who are unvaccinated in the workforce say that they will lose their jobs rather than take the medicine. They will walk off of the job. That is 70 percent. If that is anywhere accurate, we have a nursing shortage. We have a police shortage. We have a teacher shortage across this country.
