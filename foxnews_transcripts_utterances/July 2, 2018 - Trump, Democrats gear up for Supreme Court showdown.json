Well, Affirmative Action is a big deal for the Supreme Court, and they set the rules for how schools can consider young people, especially young people coming from underprivileged conditions.

And that's what riled up conservatives about this issue for a long time is that decision itself was one that they would look back and say that was not decided well.

I just knew Roe v. Wade kind of based on the general idea of what I knew growing up, but I'd never gone to law school and I was getting all these questions about the right to privacy. And I remember going to the staff secretary at the time, happens to be Brett Kavanaugh, and saying can you help me understand. I thought this was supposed to be about abortion rights. Everyone is asking me about the right to privacy. And he said it's a great question. Let me walk you through it. And that's how -- that's when I first understood how the decision was actually made. I do think there's a lot of hysteria around it. However, it doesn't mean that people don't feel extremely passionately. And, of course, it's going to rally up the president's base but it will rally up the liberal's base as well. And I think that the president is right, and he will probably be cautious, and he will say this over and over that I'm not going to ask the nominee how he or she would rule specifically on this issue.

Overwhelmingly, Americans don't want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned. That's not -- that's a 2 to 1 margin. And even a majority among men. So, the hysteria here is -- it's damaging because nobody is saying that. The way that abortion -- the way that access to elective abortions has been rolled back in the United States hasn't been by an effort, I'm telling you, you're the lawyer. Hasn't been rolled back through big -- we're going to knock it over. It's going to be kaput. Instead, what happen is states have found ways, conservative states, have found ways to put different notations on access to abortion in Texas, in Alabama. There are 20 states or so in which getting an abortion is almost impossible. It's extremely difficult where states have matched the voters in those places and done it. And none of that has had to do with overturning Roe v. Wade. It's had -- it's been about taking a long trackback. Conservatives started this 30, 40 years ago, a long track back to before Roe when -- how can we make this a federal issue? How can we make this for the states? How can federalism apply here? And that's what's happening. But you've heard and what I've read from Jeffrey Toobin and other people that have said that African-Americans will no longer be welcome in elite universities. That all of this stuff is worse even in stuff I've heard when Robert Bork was the nominee many, many, many moons ago. And it's not good for the discussion, number one. Number two, they're creating a problem for Democrats. They create this monster. They say this terrible, evil human being is going to rise up out of the belly of the swamp and come and ruin your lives. And then this person is going to walk out and you know what they're going to say? Oh, he seems all right. He seems nice. And that's what happened with Roberts, that's what happened with Gorsuch, these heinous expectations are met with a nice, competent person and people go, OK."

      "utterance": "Well, I could make the same argument, you know, going back to Merrick Garland. He was well respected, highly rated, and never given the opportunity to have even a hearing, much less a vote. But I think the big point here is that we live in different times, Kimberly. I was talking with Abby Huntsman today on Outnumbered, and she said to me, she said she had Justice Scalia's son on Fox & Friends, and that he said to her, you know, his dad was approved 98 to nothing. Now, you think about this, 98 to nothing. He's a qualified, competent jurist with a long record and a clear conservative, and yet not one so-called liberal Democrat voted against Justice Scalia. But in 2018, we live in a situation that's far different in terms of how polarized our country is. And we have a far different president. So, my colleagues here on this panel say, oh, but you could be a nice guy. And, of course, Neil Gorsuch was a nice guy. And don't worry about it. They make -- they have all these terrible things. My pal, Chris Stirewalt, comes from D.C. and he says, well, what's all this black people won't be in elite institutions. Well, Affirmative Action is a big deal for the Supreme Court, and they set the rules for how schools can consider young people, especially young people coming from underprivileged conditions. But the larger point to my thinking is this that what you're looking at now is approving a fifth conservative justice in polarized political times potentially creating a rubber-stamp in the Supreme Court for a conservative agenda. And people say, well, but, you know, President Trump says he's not going to ask about abortion. It's not a litmus test for the conservatives. So let me read you a quote that comes from Donald Trump. He says, that all happen automatically in my opinion because I'm putting pro-life justices on the court. It will go back to the states, and the states then can make the determination. So, this is not a secret to liberals and it's not a secret to conservatives. He wants justices who will undo Roe v. Wade."

      "utterance": "Also, yes. That's what you -- so, going back to what he said during the campaign, look back to Gorsuch, look back to the way that was handled. The president -- he has no problem turning up the temperature on issues. But on this issue, I think he approaches things in a fairly normal establishment kind of way. He's appointing people that I think most people -- he's going to appoint people that most people are comfortable with. And he's probably going to get a pass. It's not going to be 98 to nothing, but he'll probably get it done. And I'm not even concerned by the kinds of things that Susan Collins says. The kind of judges that get appointed now are not the kind of judges, like in the Judge Bork days that were advocates for overturning Roe v. Wade. Most of them keep kind of mum on their personal views on these things. And so, I think it's going to be noncontroversial."

Neither of those issues are actually on the table, but that is what people will use. So, we can be like calm about like the types of judges that are getting out there and how they might rule, but the spin going to be what it is. But the formidable infrastructure around conservative nominees I think is really in place because of how Robert Bork was treated in the 80's. And conservatives figured it out that they're not going to let this happen to another nominee. The Democrats had to do the same thing for Elena Kagan and Sotomayor during the Obama administration. And the judicial confirmations have been a real bright spot for conservatives with this administration. And so, I think that, you know, the timing is everything in politics, and President Trump seem to have great luck when it comes to."

So, very decisive, which means that you don't overturn things without cause is going to ho. But what did we see from Gorsuch? You say he's highly praised, Kimberly. He came on -- and I think it was a week or two ago, Chris? He just voted to overturn a 40-year law that -- with have regard to how unions were able to collect so-called agency fees or dues from people who may disagree with their political agenda.

So now it's the Republicans turn to -- they're going to try to take it back say, see, all of you people, which, of course, is like a tiny fraction of Democrats feel this way.

And I do think it is so polarizing, so off the charts that they're actually alienating people who were there trying -- base, and there's those who are like, OK, they want to leave the party because it's becoming and sounding to fringe, to extreme, even from rhetoric from people like Kristen Gillibrand or Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi.

And I would just recommend -- I would say this, and maybe I'm only saying this because I started as a small-town newspaper guy, but I'm an enormous believer in local, local news. The most local news is probably, no offense, the most important. So my encouragement to you -- I say this is a veteran of The Wheeling Intelligencer, The Charleston Daily Mail, da, da-da, da-da, subscribe to your local -- the most local news source that you can. Support it. Support those reporters. That's a great way to honor the sacrifices of the people at The Capital Gazette, but it's also good for the country. So maybe give it a shot. That's all I'm saying. All I'm saying."
