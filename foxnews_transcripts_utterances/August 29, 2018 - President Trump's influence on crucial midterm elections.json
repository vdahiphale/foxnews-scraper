I want to turn to the races that you all chose, and as we look at the balance of power in the Senate, Republicans 50, 49 Democrats, one vacancy obviously that will be filled. Democrats need to gain two to gain control in the Senate. In the House Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to gain control of the House, just to keep us honest here. Matthew, your pick for interesting race."

He faces Marine aviator Amy McGrath. If she can take this seat on election night, it bodes very ill for Republican changes to hold the House."

This is a prototypical suburban district, and Romney won it by eight, and Clinton won it by seven. So Trump is toxic there. And Roskam usually wins easily, but he's in a real race this time."

However, he is a money raising dream. He is basically the national excitement of Democrats. If he were to win this race or even come close, he's atop the list for Democrats of 2020 contenders, no doubt. They are hoping for the next Barack Obama. This will be hard for him. He is interestingly behind where Hillary Clinton was in a state with his numbers with Latinos. He would really have to surge with them to take on Cruz. But he's in a dead heat with him according to the latest Emerson poll. So it's something for Cruz -- it's not impossible for this man to beat Ted Cruz. It's going to be an interesting --"
