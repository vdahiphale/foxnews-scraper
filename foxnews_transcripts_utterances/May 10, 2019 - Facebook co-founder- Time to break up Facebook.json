      "sentences": "Hello there, Bret. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. And breaking tonight, China and the United States are in a faceoff. A battle for the ages. When the next war comes between superpowers, it is likely to be first over money and technology. For example, whoever controls 5G is going to have an enormous strategic advantage in the future. Then, you've got the issue of cyber. And then, and we hope not, perhaps, a military option. But the first stage is likely what we are watching play out right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.” This is a description of a book called China's Vision of Victory. \"Someday we may -- we may say that we never saw it coming. After 75 years of peace in the Pacific, a new challenger to American power has emerged, on a scale not seen in generations. Working from a deep sense of national destiny. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Chinese Communist Party is guiding a country of 1.4 billion towards what it calls the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

But it bounced back late in the session. The president tweeted almost all day about this ongoing battle and the effort to solve it. He said at one point, \"Tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier and quicker to do. Our farmers will be better, faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to a new source.\" Went on to say this, \"Tariffs will make our country much stronger, not weaker. Just sit back and watch. And meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the United States at the last minute. This is not the Obama administration or the administration of sleepy Joe,\" says President Trump, who let China get away with murder!\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, candidate Joe Biden just recently said this about this whole issue with China. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

President Trump early this morning tweeted that he was upset, he was annoyed with what was going on, \"We have lost $500 billion a year for many years on crazy trade with China. No more!\" He then fired off several more tweets, but later in the day, Martha, his tone change. He said, \"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries.

Nearly 4,000 British troops were killed on that front. And the Germans were still able to occupy the neutral Scandinavian country. In London, it had been announced that Winston Churchill would take over and lead a coalition government. Two days prior, his majority plummeted in a vote of confidence in the comments during a debate on the war. But Churchill prevailed, rallying the nation in defiance of Hitler.

      "utterance": "Hello there, Bret. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. And breaking tonight, China and the United States are in a faceoff. A battle for the ages. When the next war comes between superpowers, it is likely to be first over money and technology. For example, whoever controls 5G is going to have an enormous strategic advantage in the future. Then, you've got the issue of cyber. And then, and we hope not, perhaps, a military option. But the first stage is likely what we are watching play out right now. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.” This is a description of a book called China's Vision of Victory. \"Someday we may -- we may say that we never saw it coming. After 75 years of peace in the Pacific, a new challenger to American power has emerged, on a scale not seen in generations. Working from a deep sense of national destiny. The Chinese Communist Party is guiding a country of 1.4 billion towards what it calls the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. And with it, the end of an American-led world. Will this generation witness the final act for America as a superpower?\" The book is by Dr. Jonathan Ward, who joins me in just a moment along with Steve Hilton and Charlie Hurt. Now, the market sold off on jitters early this morning. But it bounced back late in the session. The president tweeted almost all day about this ongoing battle and the effort to solve it. He said at one point, \"Tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier and quicker to do. Our farmers will be better, faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to a new source.\" Went on to say this, \"Tariffs will make our country much stronger, not weaker. Just sit back and watch. And meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the United States at the last minute. This is not the Obama administration or the administration of sleepy Joe,\" says President Trump, who let China get away with murder!\" Meanwhile, candidate Joe Biden just recently said this about this whole issue with China."

      "utterance": "Hey, Martha. Good Friday evening to you. Busy day here at the White House. Things are finally slowing down right now that, that Chinese delegation left town. It appeared that things were in somewhat of a stalemate with those talks ending a little bit early today after a few hours. But state media in China, Martha, has just reported in the last few minutes that U.S. officials will actually be heading to Beijing at some time soon to actually finish those talks and continue those trade talks. President Trump early this morning tweeted that he was upset, he was annoyed with what was going on, \"We have lost $500 billion a year for many years on crazy trade with China. No more!\" He then fired off several more tweets, but later in the day, Martha, his tone change. He said, \"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.\" Now, the talk which began yesterday ended today with no sign of a deal, 12:01 a.m. this morning, those tariffs went into effect. Up 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of goods. You can see some of these goods right here, clothing, electronics, furniture, even perfumes, and colognes. Now, President Trump went on further and tweeted, the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25 percent on the remaining $325 billion in Chinese goods. That's something that we could see here in the future. Last night, Liu He, the man China sent to negotiate with the United States, left the talks, less than impressed with the entire situation. Listen."

He said talks would continue and they went fairly well. Now, President Trump was at an event with the first lady just a couple hours ago for military spouses here at the White House. The president did not say anything about tariffs. Now, Martha, last night Liu He, the vice premier of China, said that both presidents, President Xi, and President Trump would need to speak directly about this. President Trump, said yesterday that he got a nice warm letter from President Xi. They would be speaking sometime on the phone. A White House official, says they have not spoken yet, but Chinese state media reporting right now, it looks like those talks will continue in Beijing, and you have to also remember that China is promising retaliatory action against the United States for what happened.

And Steve Hilton, host of \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\". Gentlemen, thank you very much. I don't think you can understate the importance -- you know, you look back at the beginnings of World War II, for example. There was an oil embargo. You know, Japan was under pressure not suggesting that we're heading towards World War II.

There's an economic competition shaping up with China, their basic objective is to surpass us economically. Only at that point, can they really build in the military infrastructure that -- you know, puts in place what they would think of as a Chinese sanctuary. Their goal is by the year 2049, which is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by the Chinese Communist Party, by 2049, they would become the undisputed world power really (INAUDIBLE) with no other rival. They are turning points on this road, they see 2035 as a turning point -- they see 2021. But the next decade is what matters because that's when the technological contest, the industrial contest, the military contests are all really coming to fruition."

Then, it feels like it goes the deal goes back to China, they look at it, they say, \"No, there's no way. We're not doing any of this stuff on any of these pages. Go back to Washington and tell them this is where we stand.\" And the president just said, \"Deal over. Done.\" Is it -- was that a good move, Jonathan?"

Essentially, their means of siphoning off from the United States and from the rest of the developed world. The tools for industrial and ultimately military power. And I think they've just said, \"You know what, we're not going to do that. We don't have to.\" And I think it tells us a bit about the sense of confidence in China. I mean, also in the economic side there, they've just unveiled -- you know more stimulus -- you know, lower interest rates, all of this may give them a sense of short-term confidence."

They've told us what that is, and that's really their gift to the United States, as they've told us their broader strategy, how they're going to do this, how they're going to surpass us, how they're going to take this position in the world that they seek?"

      "speaker": "STEVE HILTON, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Martha, I just want to really say what a great thing that you have set up this news story about the tariffs in the way you have without long-term historical context. And with Dr. Ward's excellent points. I couldn't agree more. This is an incredibly important historical moment we're in. And actually, I think we really need to recognize that President Trump has done something, truly historic in overturning a consensus. For the last 50 years or so that has said, look, if we're nice to China, if we open up to China, if we give them the Olympics, if we overlook their bad behavior and raise it with them behind closed doors, they will change their behavior. That has not happened. Exactly, the opposite has happened. They've gone further and further towards this goal of world domination. They're on the brink of that now. And finally, we have a president -- the first western leader actually, who said, \"No, we could not challenge you.\" Now, he's using the weapon of economic terrace, I think that is a smart choice because as we've seen since he started doing it, it's been hurting China. But it hasn't hurt our economy. Our economy is booming, it's roaring ahead."

    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "It will continue to do so because actually, our trade with China, even though it's important, it's really a pretty small part of the giant U.S. economy. And we can afford to pursue this economic war for a long time yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Interesting. You know, Charlie, you saw that tweets that we put up. Basically, the president's suggestion was we have a $500 billion trade deficit with China. So, why don't we just basically take that on the chin, and we will buy -- we'll make it up to the farmers here in the United States, and then, we will still have money left over to give some of that food away to poor countries, and we can build infrastructure with the rest of it? What say you?"

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES HURT, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It so interesting because -- you know, for going back in numerous administrations, they have ignored this issue, they have ignored this problem. President Trump, a major, major reason, he got elected is because of his campaigning on China. I think it's probably after immigration and was the biggest campaign platform that both parties had ignored for so long."

And so, and I think, Steve is exactly right. Finally, you have somebody who standing up to China, and -- you know, we have one advantage, and that is they are a communist system. And we know that communism, in the long run, doesn't work out very well. We are a free and open system, and we know that, that -- you know, I have faith in that system, that, that system can prevail. But I think that President Trump -- you know, that you could not ask for a more --he's like a pig in the slop. He loves the situation. It's the biggest deal on earth, it's on the biggest stage, and he is clearly willing to use every weapon at his disposal to -- in order to try to win this. And I think that what you see with those tweets and stuff. Is he is making it clear to China that he's perfectly happy not making a deal? And that has to scare the hell out of China."

He was the guy who was presiding over the investigation of Hillary Clinton and took the authority that he did not have to make the decision as to whether or not she should be charged. That was up to the Attorney General not the Director of the FBI but he made that determination, and he did so before he even interviewed her. And then after he decided that he was not going to charge her, which again was not his is his right to make, that was the Attorney General's responsibility, he then trashed her which we do not do in this country. If you decide not to indict, you shouldn't be out to trash her. And then he intruded at the end of the election. And then he presided during the election over an FBI that we now know in retrospect was staffed with people like Peter Strzok who were vehemently anti-Trump and were involved in sensitive matters involving the investigation of the Trump campaign. So look, this guy messed it up. Why he thinks that we want to listen to him now is beyond me. This guy has done enough to offend Republicans and Democrats alike.

And then you're going to see this giant -- you see a giant hole in the hole, and this one is taking on water. Early reports say there could be as many as 25,000 barrels of chemicals leaking into the ship channel. Those chemicals are called reformate. They're flammable, they are toxic to sea life. There have been reports from some of the nearby towns that they are starting to get a strong petroleum smell that is wafting off the water likely the result of this accident. We also just got video of what we believe could be the ship that crashed into the barge. You can see the damage on the front of its hall. At this point, it is still afloat but we will keep you posted if we get more out of Houston tonight. In the meantime, how about this in Baltimore. The entire city government has been held hostage to cyber terrorists since Tuesday. They are still trying to find answers here as employees are getting this message on their computer screens.

They're using a program called Robin Hood and the hackers according to the local CBS station, they are now being investigated by the FBI. Ransomware attacks are named because they're akin to ransom kidnappings except with computers, the hackers demand payment to either turn the computer systems back on or give you your data. You showed the computer screens of a couple of the employees and this is who is affected. The hackers want $76,000 but the mayor says they are not paying it. This is the mess that it's causing. The police e-mail system isn't working. The e-mails and voice mails for the city council aren't working. The public works department has suspended late fees on water bills because of problems paying and taking those bills. The mayor there has put out the statement. He said that people were able to get their cars at towing yard, come in and pay in cash or money orders so they can mail the payments in. So, the city is functioning according to the mayor, talking to the CBS station. We're doing it a different way that the citizens of Baltimore are not being affected. Some folks might dispute of having to come into the city and do things manually is not being effective, but this highlights ransomware attacks around the country. Last year, the FBI reported nearly 1,500 ransomware victims who lost a total of $3.62 million. Those are the people who paid. The city of Atlanta, they got hot in a similar way to Baltimore. The city there refused to pay just like in Baltimore. It cause of $17 million to recover the data in Atlanta. Specific to the Atlanta attack, the DOJ indicted two Iranians.

Because for me, the definition of feminism, if you want equality, I don't think equality is asking for the government to come in and dictate the terms of your employment with increased equal pay legislation before Congress. To me, that's not feminism. I think equality is having an equal playing field and I don't want the government to come in and dictate the terms. But someone on the left would say feminism is additional equal pay legislation."

I think we cannot presume that my definition is universal nor is it society -- accepted among various societies across the globe. And I think being a feminist, you can call it whatever you want. I still believe in equality. I may not call myself a feminist. It's a definition that we can all debate about till --"

      "utterance": "So, before with history, this was “The Story” on today, May 10, back in 1940, Hell Roars in Europe. Winston Churchill is premier as Neville Chamberlain quits. The news coming shortly after the Germans invaded France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and midway through a failed attempt by Chamberlain to keep them out of Norway. Nearly 4,000 British troops were killed on that front. And the Germans were still able to occupy the neutral Scandinavian country. In London, it had been announced that Winston Churchill would take over and lead a coalition government. Two days prior, his majority plummeted in a vote of confidence in the comments during a debate on the war. But Churchill prevailed, rallying the nation in defiance of Hitler. He was the only man for this hour, a view shared by the overwhelming majority of the British people."

      "utterance": "Never gave in, never, never, never in nothing, great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "The sheer force of his personality helped to cement the Big Three Alliance between Russia and the United States. Churchill's determination was vital to the eventual victory. He served as prime minister of the United Kingdom until 1945 as the war ended and then again from 1951 to 1955. We will see you back here on Monday night at 7:00.
