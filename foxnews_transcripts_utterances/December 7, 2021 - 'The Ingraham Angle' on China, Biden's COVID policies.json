Now, under Biden we find ourselves trying to play catch up with, or blocking the CCP in their efforts to expand their power base across the globe. According to 'The Wall Street Journal', \"Classified American intelligence reports suggest China intends to establish its first permanent military presence on the Atlantic Ocean in the tiny Central African country of Equatorial Guinea, a threat that is setting off alarm bells at the White House and the Pentagon\". Well, the alarm bells should have gone off, I don't know, 20 years ago. Since trade opened between Red China and the West, the communist regime has grown richer and more powerful year after year. It now has the largest number of active military personnel in the world with a 2.1 million troop size compared to our 1.4 million. By 2024, it's poised to have the biggest economy in the world, which has our elites, frankly, just licking their chops. The CCP basically owns big business in America. Today, shocking new documents obtained by the information detail a secret $275 billion deal struck five years ago between China and the Apple CEO Tim Cook. Well, now we know why Cook became such a CCP apologist and how Apple recently became the top selling smartphone in China. \"The company owes much of that success to CEO Tim Cook, who laid the foundation years ago by secretly signing an agreement with Chinese officials promising Apple would do its part to develop China's economy and technological prowess through investments, business deals, and worker training.\" Anything else? Well. Well, and that's not all the CCP got from Cook, who has a huge influence operation in Washington. Apple lobby to water down key provisions of an anti-Chinese slave labor bill, which would hold U.S. companies accountable for using Uighur forced labor. Now, most American billionaires dismiss criticisms of China using words like, how it's counterproductive and destabilizing to do so. And sometimes it's hard to tell the American elite from Chinese top propagandists. Enter investor Ray Dalio.",

We know exactly what he said and why he said it. His hedge fund just raised one and a quarter billion dollars for its China Fund. Can't let a few hundred thousand people being tortured in camps get in the way of that windfall. But it's one thing to buy off Wall Street. They aren't policymakers after all. Their allegiance is to their investors and stockholders. What's truly disturbing is the spell the CCP has cast on our political class. Just months ago, we learned that a Chinese front group called the China- United States Exchange Foundation handed $5 million to a foundation that was founded by George H.W. Bush's son Neil Bush. Axios reported back in June that the funding was meant to bolster the Bush China Foundation's efforts to promote a bilateral relationship that is functional, constructive, commercially robust, mutually beneficial, and politically sustainable. Now, this isn't surprising given the Bush's overly optimistic and warm relationship with China. George W. Bush is the one, remember, who granted permanent normal trading relations with China back in 2001. And how's that worked out for us? Well, of course, it hasn't worked out for us, about as well as the war in Afghanistan. But to be fair, every president except Trump misunderstood China's ambitions, or at least chose to look past their brutal crackdown on human rights. Given this sordid history, no one should be surprised that so few are willing to deny President Xi and his global propaganda victory in hosting the Winter Olympics. For the most part, elites and both parties just don't care.",

What the CCP wants is a world where almost everyone is afraid to criticize President Xi for his murderous, genocidal policies. Now, here on Fox News, you can still hear commentators who are willing to tell the truth about China. But how many Fortune 500 companies are going to let their officers tell the truth? How many universities flush with Chinese cash would allow their professors, or administrators to really expose the CCP's ruthless past, present and future plans? What about the NBA or other major American sports leagues? Where's Hollywood's epic takedown of Mao? Will we ever see, I don't know, a James Bond light character go up against the CCP?

As more Americans are silenced or just self censor, we'll soon realize that the whole notion of free speech here becomes meaningless, just like President Xi wants. This is the real crisis of American democracy. The Constitution prevents Americans from accepting titles of nobility from foreign governments, because the founders wanted Americans including our elites, to be loyal to this country. But the CCP doesn't need to use titles. It has enough money to bribe almost anyone it wants. The American collaborators are the cheapest dates around. And that's the 'Angle'.

Perhaps two-thirds of Americans have had COVID, mostly asymptomatically. It's not going to be fertile ground here to spread against Delta.

Here now is Matt Walsh, host of \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" Matt, first we have to note that walrus awareness week is happening now, apparently, so the book's meteoric rise is really well-timed. Why is this being gobbled up? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, we didn't even try and coincide it with walrus awareness week, so I think just everything, it was fated to be in a lot of ways. I think people are buying the book because we need a little sanity and our culture and especially in children's books. Any parent, I'm a parent, myself, and we know that you go to the children's section at Barnes & Noble and you look at all the titles, it's like being at an Antifa rally or something with all just the leftwing propaganda. And to have something that's a response to that I think is resonating with people. And, by the way, I should mention that Amazon, they did this on their own. They listed it as an LGBT book. And right now, currently for the last few days, I've had the top-selling, not just one of the top-selling books on Amazon, but one of the top-selling, or the top-selling LGBT book.

      "utterance": "The biggest threat facing our democracy and our way of life is the Chinese Communist Party. Now, under Biden we find ourselves trying to play catch up with, or blocking the CCP in their efforts to expand their power base across the globe. According to 'The Wall Street Journal', \"Classified American intelligence reports suggest China intends to establish its first permanent military presence on the Atlantic Ocean in the tiny Central African country of Equatorial Guinea, a threat that is setting off alarm bells at the White House and the Pentagon\". Well, the alarm bells should have gone off, I don't know, 20 years ago. Since trade opened between Red China and the West, the communist regime has grown richer and more powerful year after year. It now has the largest number of active military personnel in the world with a 2.1 million troop size compared to our 1.4 million. By 2024, it's poised to have the biggest economy in the world, which has our elites, frankly, just licking their chops. The CCP basically owns big business in America. Today, shocking new documents obtained by the information detail a secret $275 billion deal struck five years ago between China and the Apple CEO Tim Cook. Well, now we know why Cook became such a CCP apologist and how Apple recently became the top selling smartphone in China. \"The company owes much of that success to CEO Tim Cook, who laid the foundation years ago by secretly signing an agreement with Chinese officials promising Apple would do its part to develop China's economy and technological prowess through investments, business deals, and worker training.\" Anything else? Well. Well, and that's not all the CCP got from Cook, who has a huge influence operation in Washington. Apple lobby to water down key provisions of an anti-Chinese slave labor bill, which would hold U.S. companies accountable for using Uighur forced labor. Now, most American billionaires dismiss criticisms of China using words like, how it's counterproductive and destabilizing to do so. And sometimes it's hard to tell the American elite from Chinese top propagandists. Enter investor Ray Dalio."

He said, that the United States is a country of individuals and individualism. And China, it's an extension of the family. As a top down country, what they're doing is they behave like a strict parent."

      "utterance": "Yes, just like the strict parent. That's what they say they are. Now, he tried later to walk it back, but you can't walk back those marks. We know exactly what he said and why he said it. His hedge fund just raised one and a quarter billion dollars for its China Fund. Can't let a few hundred thousand people being tortured in camps get in the way of that windfall. But it's one thing to buy off Wall Street. They aren't policymakers after all. Their allegiance is to their investors and stockholders. What's truly disturbing is the spell the CCP has cast on our political class. Just months ago, we learned that a Chinese front group called the China- United States Exchange Foundation handed $5 million to a foundation that was founded by George H.W. Bush's son Neil Bush. Axios reported back in June that the funding was meant to bolster the Bush China Foundation's efforts to promote a bilateral relationship that is functional, constructive, commercially robust, mutually beneficial, and politically sustainable. Now, this isn't surprising given the Bush's overly optimistic and warm relationship with China. George W. Bush is the one, remember, who granted permanent normal trading relations with China back in 2001. And how's that worked out for us? Well, of course, it hasn't worked out for us, about as well as the war in Afghanistan. But to be fair, every president except Trump misunderstood China's ambitions, or at least chose to look past their brutal crackdown on human rights. Given this sordid history, no one should be surprised that so few are willing to deny President Xi and his global propaganda victory in hosting the Winter Olympics. For the most part, elites and both parties just don't care."

What the CCP wants is a world where almost everyone is afraid to criticize President Xi for his murderous, genocidal policies. Now, here on Fox News, you can still hear commentators who are willing to tell the truth about China. But how many Fortune 500 companies are going to let their officers tell the truth? How many universities flush with Chinese cash would allow their professors, or administrators to really expose the CCP's ruthless past, present and future plans? What about the NBA or other major American sports leagues? Where's Hollywood's epic takedown of Mao? Will we ever see, I don't know, a James Bond light character go up against the CCP?

As more Americans are silenced or just self censor, we'll soon realize that the whole notion of free speech here becomes meaningless, just like President Xi wants. This is the real crisis of American democracy. The Constitution prevents Americans from accepting titles of nobility from foreign governments, because the founders wanted Americans including our elites, to be loyal to this country. But the CCP doesn't need to use titles. It has enough money to bribe almost anyone it wants. The American collaborators are the cheapest dates around. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Florida Senator Rick Scott, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The fact is that the transmissibility index has been studied by a very smart professor in France, Jacques Fantini, who calculated that its transmissibility is comparable to the alpha and beta variants. And it's about a third of what Delta is. So it's less transmissible than delta. And in fact, we have a lot of herd immunity in the United States now. Perhaps two-thirds of Americans have had COVID, mostly asymptomatically. It's not going to be fertile ground here to spread against Delta. So as much as we might want it, because it's so mild to use as virtually and infectious vaccine, it's not going to do that. It very likely will not take over Delta, but it will just be on its own."

And so now they're getting their care, they have conditions, that's why they're in the hospital. And they're tested and they're found to have COVID. So they're not there because of the COVID.

These are about three different areas. But all of these judges are saying that President Biden's exceeding his authority. That he's using these powers to achieve indirectly what he couldn't do directly, and that is to impose a national mandate on the country. Now, if you recall, President Biden is going back and forth. He suggested that he did have that authority, then eventually he admitted that he didn't have the authority. And then his chief of staff retweeted a statement that they found a \"workaround\". And he announced this to the country and said, we have a workaround where we'll be able to achieve a national mandate without the authority effectively.

They're letting people come in, if they show anything that could conceivably look like a vaccination card or proof. But it really doesn't address the underlying problem, which is, you have a very significant number of people who don't have vaccinations, a very high percentage in minority populations. And you're tightening and tightening the circle making it more and more difficult. You're going to have greater evasion. We've already seen this black market of vaccination cards.

But should we be surprised that their friends - that the White House, Joe Biden's friends in the media are going to bat and lying to the American people when they put a five-year payroll tax cut in the Build Back Better bill for so-called journalists. So they've already bought them off, now they're holding secret meetings with them to spend Americans who lied to them. Nobody's surprised by this."

Their friends in the media are always going to go to bed for them, and this is another example of why. This is the kind of stuff that happens in Russia and China where the media is controlled by the state, controlled by the powers and the influence that run the government. So they bought them off again, a five payroll tax cut in the Build Back Better bill for the media. This is absurd. Nobody's buying it. Everyone is laughing at claims like this.

Now the NCAA says it's totally fair for Thomas to compete against women because he underwent hormone suppression for at least a year. But what about the biological women who have to compete against them? Joining me now is Beth Stelzer, founder of Save Women's Sports. Beth, this is total insanity. Why not have a separate transgender category of swimming, and then that maybe would be more fair? But how does this make any sense?"

But that was set by a man. Let's be honest with our language here. The emperor is not wearing clothes. And it's time for everyone to step up.

And right on cue, there is something remarkable happening in the world of publishing. \"The Daily Wire's\" Matt Walsh has written a book called \"Johnny the Walrus\" which humorously captures the cartoonish nature of this entire transgender debate. And right now it's ranked I guess number 10 now on the Amazon bestsellers list, number four in children's books. Here now is Matt Walsh, host of \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" Matt, first we have to note that walrus awareness week is happening now, apparently, so the book's meteoric rise is really well-timed. Why is this being gobbled up? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, we didn't even try and coincide it with walrus awareness week, so I think just everything, it was fated to be in a lot of ways. I think people are buying the book because we need a little sanity and our culture and especially in children's books. Any parent, I'm a parent, myself, and we know that you go to the children's section at Barnes & Noble and you look at all the titles, it's like being at an Antifa rally or something with all just the leftwing propaganda. And to have something that's a response to that I think is resonating with people. And, by the way, I should mention that Amazon, they did this on their own. They listed it as an LGBT book. And right now, currently for the last few days, I've had the top-selling, not just one of the top-selling books on Amazon, but one of the top-selling, or the top-selling LGBT book. So I am an LGBT author, and I'm, I think, one of the leading LGBT voices in the country right now according to Amazon, and I embrace that."

      "utterance": "Yes, and a lot of it, we look at the indoctrination, a lot of it, there's a lot of the racial indoctrination, anti-racist baby, Critical Race Theory, that kind of thing. But so much of it is gender ideology being foist on kids of very young ages. And gender ideology is so absurd that they realize that if they want to convince people of it, they have to get to them when they're very, very young and they are not able to distinguish between fantasy and reality and make these kinds of commonsense judgments. And that is why it is so important for them to brainwash the kids, and it's why it's important for us to protect our kids from that brainwashing."

They want to limit people's speech, their First Amendment liberties. We see it across, we see it with Fauci, we see it at colleges and universities, we see it with the entire left and the entire cancel culture mob out there who are hiring folks like this whose sole purpose, it seems, is to go after conservatives who want to speak out and speak the truth.
