We got to talk straight here with all the good news, also a word of caution. Every time Mr. President you come in with the latest Michael Cohen tape or every time you spar with low lives like Brenna or Avenatti or any of them, I think what you do sometimes, you end up giving oxygen to the stories advanced by your political opponents to distract from the most important story.

At the same time ICE is doing its job ensuring that illegals gunning down cops are brought to justice, like this man, 29-year-old Wisner Desmaret, a Haitian national, who faces eight felonies for shooting a Fort Myers, Florida, police officer in the head over the weekend. ICE slapped a detainer on Desmaret who is suspected to be illegal immigrant. So do you really want to protest this kind of work? The officer is still in very, very serious condition. We should note that, of course, Officer Jobbers is in critical condition tonight, and a great sign that he has begun to breathe on his own, and our prayers are with his family and him. It's a horror deal that he has gone through. Joining me for reaction is John Torres, former acting director of ICE during the George W. Bush administration, and immigration attorney Allen Orr.

After demanding transparency from President Trump on his alleged relationship with porn star Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti somehow convinced a federal judge to block the media from covering his testimony about his law firm's bankruptcy. His firm has defaulted on millions of dollars in debt and has fallen way behind on payroll taxes, so the closing question tonight is, what are you trying to hide, Mikey? We are going to keep searching for the answer. Was he born with a microphone coming out of his chest? Was that a genetic condition? That's all the time we have this evening.

Even his former GOP foes have had to concede the obvious. Here's Marco Rubio on Trump's interactions with China. SEN.

But remember China already has a $23.2 trillion economy which is almost four trillion more than our own. But with tough tariffs and blunt talk, he has now brought China to the negotiating table, that is a very good thing. And just today the president met with the EU Commission president to discuss trade after Trump boosted tariffs on certain EU goods to create fair situation for American manufacturers, the EU retaliated with tariffs of its own but today they're all singing a different tune."

But today the market responded closing at its highest level since January. And this kind of advance wouldn't have been possible if Trump hadn't raised the issue of and raised the ante with the EU all along. The market is soaring, wages are beginning, ever so slowly, to rise. In fact 213,000 jobs have been added here just last month due to Trumps' policies. GDP growth is strong with an expected huge number this Friday. Bottom line, it is a great time to be an American. Someone who's working, wants a job and to top it all off, the president's 'Hire American' initiative has started to produce results. There was a 41 percent increase in denials of high skilled H1B visa applicants between the third and fourth quarter. That helps American citizens over foreign workers in the job market, it's about time. And the president is doing all of this while battling the deep state, the unfair media, of course all the international bureaucrats we've come to know and love and establishment politicians here in Washington. And there are some congressmen, who despite all this great news, just refuse to get the memo that the Bush era is over. PAUL RYAN, R—WISC., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I don't support tariffs, I think tariffs are taxes. And I think there are better tools that we can use to hold abusers of trade laws and countries that perpetuate unfair trade practices. I think there are better tools to use to get them to play fairly."

Let's remember what some other experts on congress were recently saying about the tariffs. SEN. CHRIS COONS, D—DELAWARE: A wildly swung bat that is hitting our closest allies in a way that harms our national security, harms our chance at better trade deals. SEN. RON JOHNSON, R—WISC.: I just think there's so much collateral damage that needs a very risky and dangerous strategy. SEN. BOB CORKER, R—TENN.: This is an abuse of presidential authority, it's just an abuse of presidential authority."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well once again, guess what? They're wrong. Trump stood for America with a tool that every president has used in form or another and our economic competitors ended up doing the thing that he'd predicted they'd do. They came to the table, they started listening and they made concessions, more are coming by the way. So rather than taking hot shots at the president, Republicans should be celebrating and promoting this approach to trade in the economy, the Trump agenda. It's also their clearest path to victory in the midterms which reminds me by the way. A word of caution for this president at the same time. We got to talk straight here with all the good news, also a word of caution. Every time Mr. President you come in with the latest Michael Cohen tape or every time you spar with low lives like Brenna or Avenatti or any of them, I think what you do sometimes, you end up giving oxygen to the stories advanced by your political opponents to distract from the most important story. That's America's economic resurgence and a restoration of our place in the world. So Donald Trump should be taking a victory lap almost every week. In a different way, shape or form, things are awesome right now. The more the president and his party focus on that story, the more the Stormy, Muller, Michael Cohen side show is diminished. The media attempt to distract voters from a lived experience of the Trump economy but I'm telling you it's not working. My radio listeners tell me every day, \"We don't care about these stories, what's in my bottom line?\" Trump's approval, by the way, today at 48 percent according to a new American Barometer Poll. The voters know reality and they're tuning out the rest of this stuff. It's kind of white noise, background noise to them. They can see the impact of this presidency. Every day they can feel the impact in their book, they feel it in their lives, and that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is Dan Bongino, host of the Dan Bongino Show podcast, Dave Bossie, former deputy campaign manager of President Trump's campaign and co-author of 'Let Trump be Trump', and of course Richard Goodstein a Democratic Strategist and former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, great to have all of you on. Richard your reaction."

You're going to say that but listen for just a second. You see him up there with EU Commissioner right? You guys were out there saying that this thing was going to tank, that the tariffs was going to tank things. He stood up there with the EU Commissioner and they stood together and they said, \"We're going to work together, we're going to lower tariffs\" That was a victory and for anyone Democrat or Republican or Independent to claim anything other than that was the president standing up for America is false and fraudulent so I hope you're not about to do that on this show tonight, I don't care about your Quinnipiac."

Hey listen folks here's the deal, new rules OK, new rules. The Democrats for eight years attacked us with the most vicious identity politics known to man. Nobody gives a crap about Michael Cohen, nobody gives a damn about this president's personal behavior. Here's the new rules. Now it's about winning, it's about winning on taxes, it's about winning on your business, it's about winning on a prolife judge agenda, saving infants in the womb. It's about saving your healthcare, it's about saving the education system, it's about doing the right thing for once with this government. You wat to focus on a tape recording with a sleazy lawyer who taped his client. You go right ahead, knock it out, we'll be looking at a landslide in 2020. But make no mistake, the new rules are here, it's about winning. And again, for all the never Trumpers out there, \"Oh we're sacrificing our principles here\" No BS, this is the first president since Reagan actually in the White House fighting for our principles so spare me the crap moral lectures.

A group of republican congressman have filed articles of impeachment against Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein arguing that the D.O.J has not complied with the nine months of oversight requests for documents tied to the investigation. Joining us now exclusively to tell us what's next, Congressmen Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows who are spearheading the effort. We're also joined by Fox News anchor and author of the new fantastic book big bestseller `The Russia Hoax\" Gregg Jarret. Congrats Greg on the book, great to have you on. Congressman Meadows let's start with you. What are accusing Rod Rosenstein of specifically? REP. MARK MEADOWS, R—N.C.: Well really for nine months we've asked for documents and that's all we want are the documents and what we found is not only have subpoenas been ignored but information has been hidden. The efforts have been made and stonewalled. And for us it's about transparency so the American people can judge for themselves. And so they may be able to ignore congress but they can't ignore the American people."

They're not Obama holdovers, they're Trump appointees. If they're defying congress it's because the president is permitting them to do so. The president is empowered to give his subordinates a direct order to comply with congressional demands and to fire them immediately if they fail to do so.\" He's kind of looking down on this idea. Congressman. REP. JIM JORDAN, R—OHIO: We've sent a letter to the president, Mark myself and Congressman Desantis saying declassify the information, get us all the information."

We've got the department of justice hiding information, redacting information that they should not have redacted. We know that Rod Rosenstein threatened House Committee Intel staffers, threatened them chilling impact when they were trying to do our job of doing the congressional oversight of what we're supposed to do. And we all know what the Justice Department did with the dossier. Never forget Rod Rosenstein signed the third renewal, signed that which was based on the dossier which we know parts of it came from Bruce or a high ranking official, through his wife, we know the whole ordeal Nelly, the whole ordeal. So we're tired of the Justice Department giving us the finger and not giving us the information we're entitled to do our constitutional duty.

This is a guy who has been covering up from the very beginning for nine long months the origins of the Trump Russia hoax. As I argue in my book, he and others never had any evidence of collusion. There was no evidence of crimes or intelligence to justify a counter intelligence probe. Rosenstein is the guy who put his signature on a document to renew the wiretap warrant application and he knew that that was a fabricated phony document. He didn't present new evidence as the law demands and he vouched for his authenticity when he knew it was unverified and fabricated and that is a fraud on the court and abuse of power."

That is the kind of guy that Rod Rosenstein is. He is presiding over an investigation in which he is a key witness and refuses to disqualify himself even though it's mandatory.

At the same time ICE is doing its job ensuring that illegals gunning down cops are brought to justice, like this man, 29-year-old Wisner Desmaret, a Haitian national, who faces eight felonies for shooting a Fort Myers, Florida, police officer in the head over the weekend. ICE slapped a detainer on Desmaret who is suspected to be illegal immigrant. So do you really want to protest this kind of work? The officer is still in very, very serious condition. We should note that, of course, Officer Jobbers is in critical condition tonight, and a great sign that he has begun to breathe on his own, and our prayers are with his family and him. It's a horror deal that he has gone through. Joining me for reaction is John Torres, former acting director of ICE during the George W. Bush administration, and immigration attorney Allen Orr.

Right now ICE has been concentrating on those individuals such as the one you've talked about in the police case. They are doing low-hanging fruit. They are arresting people who are appearing in court, testifying in a crime, or people appearing to their ICE hearings or people who are just going to work day to day.

They're doing admin arrests, criminal arrests. John, you were doing it. I get very emotional about this. I'm always as a criminal defense attorney, always suspicious of prosecutors. That's kind of my background. But when a police officer, a child, a woman, domestic abuse, child abuse, human trafficking, the things that we've seen done, I can't countenance, I can't abide by it.

And the police department ignored an ICE warrant, an immigration detainer, and let the person walk out of their jail. That same person later on goes and shoots a police officer. And next thing you know, we are getting calls from the city saying can you come in here and set up cooperation with us. We want to work especially on the criminals with you. Let's talk about those criminals. Last year, ICE arrested almost 33,000 people on criminal charges. They rescued or identified over 500 child victims, predators. They arrested -- I mean they identified or rescued almost 1,000 people related to human trafficking. Not talking about even the thousands of gang members that they arrest every year or the million pounds of illicit narcotics that they seize every year, or the nearly half a billion dollars that they seize in illicit financing.

Already a billionaire, Mr. Liu is dubbed by the Chinese, as the Chinese Elon Musk for his efforts to send people into space and his work on cutting edge projects like jet-powered surfboards. Sounds like a creative guy. Where is he getting all these ideas?

One of the things, obviously if you're a professor who is taking government money or taking money from DARPA or DOD to do research, you obviously need to be very careful of who you accept even on work and projects that are not funded by DAPRA, because your computer system --"

After demanding transparency from President Trump on his alleged relationship with porn star Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti somehow convinced a federal judge to block the media from covering his testimony about his law firm's bankruptcy. His firm has defaulted on millions of dollars in debt and has fallen way behind on payroll taxes, so the closing question tonight is, what are you trying to hide, Mikey? We are going to keep searching for the answer. Was he born with a microphone coming out of his chest? Was that a genetic condition? That's all the time we have this evening. But have no fear, I've got my wand. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team are up next. Shannon?"
