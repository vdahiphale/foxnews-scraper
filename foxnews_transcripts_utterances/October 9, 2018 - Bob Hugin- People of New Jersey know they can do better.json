      "sentences": "Yes, the big news here at the White House today, Neil, of course, Nikki Haley stepping down as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. That will be effective at the -- effective, rather, at the end of the year.  The president just spoke on the South Lawn, as you mentioned. He was talking about this and specifically some of the possible contenders to replace Nikki Haley. And he mentioned his daughter Ivanka Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, just to put a pause on that for a second, there's been some speculation as to whether or not Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner could potentially fill that role. However, the president today, just a little while ago, as you will see on the video, said that Ivanka Trump would be wonderful in that role. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But there are anti-nepotism laws in play that would most likely prevent that. So it appears as if the president is potentially sidelining that possibility for the moment. Another person that President Trump brought up was Dina Powell. She was here at the White House for about a year or so, left at the very, very beginning of 2018. She wasn't only an economic adviser to the president, but also a deputy national security adviser. The president apparently saying that she is under consideration. So, too, we are told, Neil, to keep an eye on Ric Grenell, who is the U.S. ambassador to Germany -- Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

When we have the president speaking and it's not covered live, you have got a pool feed tape. He is done taking questions back and forth for press members who were greeting him as he was heading off to Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews and Air Force One, will be taking off tonight for that big trip to Iowa. All of this on the same day we had Nikki Haley surprising pretty much the entire political world, and keeping it a secret, no less, that she wants to step down as our ambassador to the United Nations. This would take place at the end of the year. So she's given the president plenty of time to find that replacement here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What shocked a lot of people is how few she told.

And that is notable, because Nikki Haley, as the president himself acknowledges and mentions, is not someone that supported the president in the primaries. She's someone that has actually, I think, done a good job expressing her disagreement with the president over the course of the administration when she does disagree with him. So it's not as though these two have always been on the same page. But there are two people who have found a way to get along in this administration, two people with different views often, who have found a way to get along in this administration. She's one of the most successful people within the president's inner circle there, who has managed to do that while she has -- to maintain a good relationship with the president and with the public.",

The White House got Haley's resignation, or at least some within the White House, on October 3. That was when her resignation letter was dated. It appears, Neil, as if maybe they waited until the end of the Kavanaugh proceedings to officially unveil this earlier today. But the big question is, who now will replace Nikki Haley? The president says he wants to name her successor within the next two to three weeks.  Keep in mind she's on the job through the end of the year. And then this will have to go to the Senate for confirmation. One thing that we learned from President Trump there on the South Lawn is that Dina Powell is indeed under consideration. She was a deputy national security adviser here at the White House for about a year or so. She announced her departure in December of 2017, left in January of 2018. And it was pointed out to me earlier today, Neil, that one of the things that might hold back the possibility of Ivanka Trump potentially filling that role is the anti-nepotism laws. And indeed the president spoke about that on the South Lawn, saying, while she is highly qualified, in his estimation, to go potentially up to the U.N., it might not necessarily fit under the nepotism laws that are currently in place. By the way, one other name to keep in mind here, when you think about this list -- I think I mentioned this off the top speaking to you a little while ago -- Ric Grenell, who is very well known, not only within this White House, who is liked by this president, but also has a history as well serving many years as a spokesperson for the U.S. at the U.N.",

But what we're looking at right now is the path where we're going to jump from a Category 2 storm up to a Category 3 storm. You see it strengthening. When will this be making landfall? Well, we're talking about a landfall probably around tomorrow morning, at least beginning to see those early conditions tomorrow morning, perhaps 8:00 a.m., but landfall itself maybe closer to lunchtime. That's when it begins to weaken. But there's still a little bit of indecision with this current track as we follow anywhere here off towards the eastern edge of it, maybe Apalachicola, farther off to the western edge of this, closer to Panama City. That's where a lot of these models are taking this. And we remember the front right quadrant, that's where you see the worst of this. What will it ultimately bring? Well, we could see anywhere from eight to 12 inches of rain if this storm continues to move this way. I think one of the larger things we're going to see is the storm surge, especially there in the Big Bend. There's not a lot of places for this water to go, eight to 12 feet of storm surge with this. Neil, the one thing that we really pay attention to, also, a much faster moving storm with this one. Remember Florence. It -- we saw it, for one thing, a week or week-and-a-half out.

Now, I do have to tell you that the cap on $10,000 on state and local tax deductions was bad for New Jersey, because that's going to really put a pinch on the middle-class property values in terms of sharing more of the real estate burden, the real estate tax burden on the middle class. So we have got to do something to alleviate that over time. But, remember, Neil, when TPP was up, I was in the Roosevelt Room with President Obama explaining why we thought that was a bad deal. And we helped stop that in the life science industry because it was bad for American consumers. It was bad for American intellectual property. So we have been engaged on economic issues. I have been engaged on economic issues for a long time. Fair trade is important. Free trade helps the consumer, helps the economy, helps job creation. Tariffs are not a good idea. They're bad for the economy, bad for consumer, bad for job creation. But if they're a negotiating ploy, then we have got to give the president time.

Of course, he's been on a campaign run here where he's bringing up a number of issues, not the least of which is the improving economy, the Kavanaugh situation, where he is now sitting on the Supreme Court of the United States, in fact was listening to his first case today. Before we get to any of that, before the president left the White House, he did stop momentarily to talk to the reporters, we're told actually for more than just a couple of questions, maybe 10 to 15 minutes' worth. Once that tape is available, as Shepard just told you, we re-rack it and we start playing it. To Blake Burman first at the White House with now the look for a replacement for Nikki Haley, I guess, huh, Blake?"

      "utterance": "Yes, the big news here at the White House today, Neil, of course, Nikki Haley stepping down as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. That will be effective at the -- effective, rather, at the end of the year.  The president just spoke on the South Lawn, as you mentioned. He was talking about this and specifically some of the possible contenders to replace Nikki Haley. And he mentioned his daughter Ivanka Trump. Now, just to put a pause on that for a second, there's been some speculation as to whether or not Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner could potentially fill that role. However, the president today, just a little while ago, as you will see on the video, said that Ivanka Trump would be wonderful in that role. But there are anti-nepotism laws in play that would most likely prevent that. So it appears as if the president is potentially sidelining that possibility for the moment. Another person that President Trump brought up was Dina Powell. She was here at the White House for about a year or so, left at the very, very beginning of 2018. She wasn't only an economic adviser to the president, but also a deputy national security adviser. The president apparently saying that she is under consideration. So, too, we are told, Neil, to keep an eye on Ric Grenell, who is the U.S. ambassador to Germany -- Neil."

He is done taking questions back and forth for press members who were greeting him as he was heading off to Marine One en route to Joint Base Andrews and Air Force One, will be taking off tonight for that big trip to Iowa. All of this on the same day we had Nikki Haley surprising pretty much the entire political world, and keeping it a secret, no less, that she wants to step down as our ambassador to the United Nations. This would take place at the end of the year. So she's given the president plenty of time to find that replacement here. What shocked a lot of people is how few she told. She did let the president know about this some time ago, the president sitting on it for a while to find the right opportunity to address that. And, unlike other departures that sometimes have been announced via tweet - - for example, Rex Tillerson over at State before Mike Pompeo came on -- this was a very, very different case. Let's look at this from moments ago, the president addressing reporters and their questions."

She's someone that has actually, I think, done a good job expressing her disagreement with the president over the course of the administration when she does disagree with him. So it's not as though these two have always been on the same page. But there are two people who have found a way to get along in this administration, two people with different views often, who have found a way to get along in this administration.

I guess what I'm going to ask you is, is it your sense now that a lot of the chaos that was associated with the administration and people leaving and all has, in fact, actually died down considerably this year? I know books have been written and are still churning out bemoaning a White House in disarray, but that might have been the case in the first year, but it is slowing down right now."

And it wasn't an easy adjustment. But I do agree with you. I think we have settled down a little bit. I think that process is out of the way. That being said, I think there's -- things are still chaotic, more than they would be under other presidents, people who have served in government their whole lives.

The White House got Haley's resignation, or at least some within the White House, on October 3. That was when her resignation letter was dated. It appears, Neil, as if maybe they waited until the end of the Kavanaugh proceedings to officially unveil this earlier today. But the big question is, who now will replace Nikki Haley? The president says he wants to name her successor within the next two to three weeks.  Keep in mind she's on the job through the end of the year. And then this will have to go to the Senate for confirmation. One thing that we learned from President Trump there on the South Lawn is that Dina Powell is indeed under consideration. She was a deputy national security adviser here at the White House for about a year or so. She announced her departure in December of 2017, left in January of 2018. And it was pointed out to me earlier today, Neil, that one of the things that might hold back the possibility of Ivanka Trump potentially filling that role is the anti-nepotism laws. And indeed the president spoke about that on the South Lawn, saying, while she is highly qualified, in his estimation, to go potentially up to the U.N., it might not necessarily fit under the nepotism laws that are currently in place. By the way, one other name to keep in mind here, when you think about this list -- I think I mentioned this off the top speaking to you a little while ago -- Ric Grenell, who is very well known, not only within this White House, who is liked by this president, but also has a history as well serving many years as a spokesperson for the U.S. at the U.N."

I do want to take Weather 7. For the folks in the control room, that's what I'm going to need. But what we're looking at right now is the path where we're going to jump from a Category 2 storm up to a Category 3 storm. You see it strengthening. When will this be making landfall? Well, we're talking about a landfall probably around tomorrow morning, at least beginning to see those early conditions tomorrow morning, perhaps 8:00 a.m., but landfall itself maybe closer to lunchtime. That's when it begins to weaken. But there's still a little bit of indecision with this current track as we follow anywhere here off towards the eastern edge of it, maybe Apalachicola, farther off to the western edge of this, closer to Panama City. That's where a lot of these models are taking this. And we remember the front right quadrant, that's where you see the worst of this. What will it ultimately bring? Well, we could see anywhere from eight to 12 inches of rain if this storm continues to move this way. I think one of the larger things we're going to see is the storm surge, especially there in the Big Bend. There's not a lot of places for this water to go, eight to 12 feet of storm surge with this. Neil, the one thing that we really pay attention to, also, a much faster moving storm with this one. Remember Florence. It -- we saw it, for one thing, a week or week-and-a-half out. It took a long time to get there.  People had a chance to prepare. But then it sat there and spun and spun and spun."

The Kavanaugh fury that it created among Republicans, who felt that the judge was treated poorly, now a Supreme Court justice, is going to resonate in November, four weeks from today, as a matter of fact. Our next guest hopes to be a beneficiary of all of that, and in New Jersey, no less. He is the Republican candidate who is taking on the incumbent Democrat, Bob Menendez. But here's the thing in this bluest of blue states. Normally, the Democratic candidate is up by double digits. And little more than a few weeks ago, Bob Menendez was. Right now, it could be considered a tossup, depending on the poll, anywhere from five to seven points. The man who is leading that charge for the Republicans joins us right now, Bob Hugin.

And let's remember, I called for an FBI investigation, one of the first Republicans to call for one. And I continue to call for the FBI report to be released, so that when there's no corroboration that's justified, the FBI does great work, and we should support them. And so I think we're going to be very good, because the issues we're talking about resonate with all New Jerseyans, all race, all religion.  Everyone in New Jersey knows they have been so underserved. We're 50 out of 50. We get the least back from Washington. And we have a senator who the only bipartisan act he has been involved in is getting the Senate Ethics Committee to say that he violated federal law, abused the power of his office, disgraced the Senate.

As a senator, there's only so much you can do on those state moves, but how do you feel about those efforts, when polls do bear the governor out that, at least for those average New Jersey voters, he has their support?

Families can't stay together, with grandparents leaving the state, 18-to-34-year- olds out migrating at the fastest rate in the country. The state is overtaxed. It's unaffordable. And I have to tell you, when I'm elected, I'm not going to worry about whether it's a city, a state, a federal issue, a county issue. I'm -- there's only two positions, the two senators and the governor, that every New Jerseyan gets to vote on. I'm going to speak out on every issue, shine the light of day on all issues.

I think all people of New Jersey recognize we're a great state, diverse, but we share the same interests. We want safe communities, good education system. We went economic opportunity. And I have to tell you, all New Jerseyans want those same things. And, Neil, I have to tell you, the deregulatory reforms that have -- under way have really unleashed the economy. I go all across the state. I just -- I think the economy is doing so well generally. Obviously, New Jersey's is tough because of the affordability issues. But we have got to contain this momentum.

We were eight years always looking over our shoulder of taking risk and being penalized for taking risk and doing the things to create jobs. So lots of things have to be continued. Now, I do have to tell you that the cap on $10,000 on state and local tax deductions was bad for New Jersey, because that's going to really put a pinch on the middle-class property values in terms of sharing more of the real estate burden, the real estate tax burden on the middle class. So we have got to do something to alleviate that over time. But, remember, Neil, when TPP was up, I was in the Roosevelt Room with President Obama explaining why we thought that was a bad deal. And we helped stop that in the life science industry because it was bad for American consumers. It was bad for American intellectual property. So we have been engaged on economic issues. I have been engaged on economic issues for a long time. Fair trade is important. Free trade helps the consumer, helps the economy, helps job creation. Tariffs are not a good idea. They're bad for the economy, bad for consumer, bad for job creation. But if they're a negotiating ploy, then we have got to give the president time.

But there is that 5 percent that is very ideological. And that's what everybody is waiting for."

She said, was that an act of violence? So, when you can bring -- help bring that levity, A, you submit your relationship to the other justices. B, you have played the appropriate role. C, you have zeroed in on the issue. What is an act of violence? Congress enhanced punishment for certain acts of violence, but it didn't define violence. The government, of course, wants an expansive definition.  And Justice Kavanaugh was questioning how expansive that definition could logically be."

      "utterance": "No, we haven't. And I have been harshly critical of it. It was a Republican political rally in the White House, under the guise of a ceremonial swearing-in.  That the justices should sit there while the president called his opponents evil and perpetrators of a hoax was highly inappropriate and, in my view, shouldn't have happened."

It's entirely another thing for him to be in the White House after he is a sitting justice and for them to treat him as he's little Brett."

And it was complied with by -- I'm going to guess -- because I think I know his thinking -- Chief Justice Roberts, who basically said, we have got to show some unity, guys. I know it's a Monday night. I know it's a holiday weekend, but we got to show up and we got to show some..."

      "utterance": "Well, the latest from the White House, President Trump approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration, feds, state and local authorities all working together to coordinate. According to the Department of Defense, they think Florida at this point is as prepared as it needs to be. But there's a lot of people ready to deploy search-and-rescue type operations. All this plywood went up this morning, in anticipation of storm surge up to 12 feet. Sandbags line this whole street. This is Water Street. And the local say, if it goes as high as 12 feet, all of this will be underwater where we are. Gasoline stations around the Panhandle and the Big Bend area, they had long lines all day. Oftentimes, they ran out of gas. And also you had traffic evacuating all day yesterday. Most people in this town of Apalachicola, the southern point of the Big Bend, they're gone. They're certainly not out on the streets. A lot of people did leave town. And you can see right here this is city hall, and relatively a main street, and just hard to find anybody around here at all. Shelves are empty at all the stores. Basically, if you're a resident and you're not prepared yet, this is exactly the last moment you have -- back to you, Neil."

It's taking aim at Florida, as Phil was saying, 300 miles of coastline already under hurricane warning, 35 Florida counties under a state of emergency, not like Florence that sat around and stayed a while.
