In Iowa, still big, in New Hampshire, not that big over Sanders. And Warren has been surging as of late.

I think for this group, even though we've gone from 20 candidates now to 10 candidates, I think the real fight for the people in the bottom of the pack is fighting the perception that there really is just three candidates now.",

A lot of people looking at Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, the top three. As you look at the latest polls, national, Iowa, New Hampshire, the average polls, you can see that Biden still holds a lead, especially nationally, but let's see that poll again -- there you go. In Iowa, still big, in New Hampshire, not that big over Sanders. And Warren has been surging as of late. Let's bring in our panel here in Houston, Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics, and Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" OK, Mo, your thoughts as the stage is set here? What are people looking for at this debate?"

      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS",
      "utterance": "It's the first time Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have shared the stage. They are emerging as the two frontrunners. And she's been ascendant. She's been moving. She's the only one who's had sustained momentum. So how that dynamic plays out is number one. Number two, the dynamic between Warren and Sanders who sort of occupy the same space in the Democratic field and are really preventing each other from taking Biden had on, do they start to mix it up? They've been lockstep up until now. And then the third dynamic, people like Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, who seem kind of stagnant, can they finally have their breakthrough moment that they can then sustain coming out of this?"

      "utterance": "I talked to John Delany earlier in the show, Byron. The moderates are largely off the stage except for Joe Biden. Maybe you can put Amy Klobuchar in that bucket. So it changes the dynamic. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Absolutely. Amy Klobuchar just barely got in, as a matter of fact. Going to that poll you mentioned just a moment ago, Biden does have a 9.5 percentage point lead, but on September 1st, it was 13.5 percent, and on July 1st it was 15.5 percent. It actually is getting smaller. I think for this group, even though we've gone from 20 candidates now to 10 candidates, I think the real fight for the people in the bottom of the pack is fighting the perception that there really is just three candidates now."

      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "He's still the frontrunner, and frontrunners don't often go on offense, but he might. She really has been ascendant. The challenge that Warren has is if she wants to go after Biden, how does she do that? Everyone that has gone right at him up until now in a debate has faltered. Why? Because Democrats still like Joe Biden. And so they kind of react badly when someone has gone right at him."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "The one thing we don't know about the gaffes, we get all excited about them. We don't know how much they really affect voters. We do know he is still leading. I think one thing that strategists and other candidates would want to do is use the gaffes. It's kind of a proxy for whether he's too old to be president, that he's kind of forgetting things, he's slowed down a bit. He can't pull a fact to mind immediately like younger candidates do. Whether they're going to go there or not, I don't know. But they have to break out of this idea that it's only Sanders -- Biden, Sanders, and Warren, and nobody else."

The problem is not in what they are doing. The problem is in what they're calling it. If this is like a quintessential messaging problem the have right now were some of them want to call impeachment, some of them don't want to call it impeachment. Both of them wanting to do that for very different political reasons. My argument to Democrats is just pick one. You are doing the thing, just pick what you want to call it and stick to it."

They immediately started impeachment. The House voted for an impeachment inquiry, and by December the House voted to impeach him. It would be very hard to see, given the state of Democrat disarray on this right now, see them doing that."

And then the House Judiciary Committee, good idea or bad idea, and it's 51-41. Nadler making the case that they're going to make the investigation stand on their own, but what are the exactly the impeachment articles, and how this all goes out doesn't seem to be set in stone. Does it become a problem for the 10 people on the stage tonight? I assume they can't not address this, or ABC can't not ask it, right?"

So that's what they want to focus on. The Democratic candidates for president want to focus on making the electoral argument against them, not this argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "But haven't they really been off balance since the Mueller Report? So many of them thought this was going to be it, it's going to be handed to us, tied up in a bow, and then we can impeach him, and everybody will agree. And it just didn't happen. And they've not been on their feet since then."
