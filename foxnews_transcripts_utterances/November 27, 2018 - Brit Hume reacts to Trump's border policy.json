Hyde-Smith had been ahead despite missteps. A win would bring the GOP Senate to 53, and the Democrats to 47.  But who knows what's going to happen, and we will see how this thing unwinds. Also tonight, Brit Hume on the president's brand new comments moments ago on plan B for the wall. And how Brit says, the president proved his critics wrong on this issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the president versus Robert Mueller. Could we be getting close to the end of this saga? Both sides appear loaded for bear. The president slamming fired these tweets off today. Saying this and more, \"The phony witch-hunt continues, but Mueller and his gang of angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other. Wait until it comes out how horribly and viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, the big question is when Robert Mueller shows his cards, what will we see? George Papadopoulos the center of lots of intrigues now in jail, but he will only be there for a couple of weeks. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And despite an explosive story that says Manafort met secretly with Julian Assange. He says this, \"This story is totally false and deliberately libelous. I never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him.\" As another character in the saga says that he refused a deal, saying that he simply would not lie about something he didn't do and that he would rather \"rot in jail\". if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Our panel here on all of that in just a moment.

      "sentences": "Hi, Martha. If you look at the major players, Robert Mueller is focusing on the common denominator appears to be WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, with the questions being who knew Assange and who was in cahoots with Assange? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's begin with former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, who the Guardian newspaper says, met with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and most importantly in 2016, just months before WikiLeaks released the hacked e-mails of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Manafort denies he ever met with Assange. But now, Robert Mueller's investigators claim, Manafort violated his plea deal by lying to them repeatedly though they did not say about what. Manafort denies lying, but could soon be sentenced to decades in prison for his recent tax and bank fraud convictions. Then, there's Jerome Corsi, a conservative author, and associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone. The special counsel reportedly has evidence that Corsi knew WikiLeaks had John Podesta's e-mails two months before they were released. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Mueller is examining whether Corsi passed that information along to Roger Stone. Remember, that's critical because the Podesta e-mails went public on October 7th, 2016 just hours after the Access Hollywood tape went public, where Donald Trump bragged about groping women. Special counsel wants to know if there was coordination between Roger Stone and Julian Assange about when to release Podesta's damaging e-mails.  Jerome Corsi, says he didn't have insider information. Instead, he connected the dots and theorized that Assange had Podesta's e-mails. Finally, there is low-level Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, who is serving a slap on the wrist, two-week prison term in Wisconsin for lying about his interaction with Russian contacts concerning among other things, the hacked Podesta e-mails. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And today, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz doubled down on his belief that Mueller won't be fair.

President Obama -- I hate to do what about-ism but President Obama when he claimed that we were going to leave and he put a timeline, he emboldened the Taliban, he emboldened the enemy because these are people that are fighting a generational war. They knew they just had to outlast us. Sending the message and meeting that which I think the president is doing now that we are going to win. We don't get defeated on the battlefield against the Taliban or Al Qaeda or ISIS or anybody. Where we get defeated is in our will. And it's tragic that we've lost 13 people and it's awful but we have the best fighting force, it's inflicting significant damage on the enemy and not on ourselves. And the other thing to keep in mind, is the Afghan people, we are popular in Afghanistan, and they have stood up and have sacrificed to defend their country. There is a lot of work to do and I think we are going to be there a while.

All it does is return it back to the decision of the states. No in some states, like my home state of Arkansas, abortion would be abolished because there is a constitutional amendment that bans it. That would happen in several states. In other states, there actually could be more abortions. My guess is, states like New York and California would likely see an uptick in the number of abortions because those dates would likely end any restrictions whatsoever. Ultimately, this is the decision, we've seen incremental changes and the way people approach it legally at the state level. But ultimately, it's got to be decided by personhood. This will be resolved when we determine that an unborn child is a person. That moment is when that child will be protected by the fifth and 14th amendments that says that you can't deprive somebody of life or liberty without due process, and in an abortion, there is no due process.",

But unlike Alabama's special election, where top Republicans kept the controversial candidate at arm's length and the closest President Trump got to Alabama during election week was Florida. The GOP cavalry has been here in full force. President Trump twice yesterday, Senators Lindsey Graham and Roger Wicker, the governor, Bill Bryant, the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel, all with Cindy Hyde-Smith, appealing to voters, and a big part of their argument is just give Mitch McConnell a little bit of cushion so that senators who sometimes take a long time to decide how they want to vote in D.C. lose leverage when it comes time for a close vote on something like immigration or a Supreme Court justice.

Hyde-Smith had been ahead despite missteps. A win would bring the GOP Senate to 53, and the Democrats to 47.  But who knows what's going to happen, and we will see how this thing unwinds. Also tonight, Brit Hume on the president's brand new comments moments ago on plan B for the wall. And how Brit says, the president proved his critics wrong on this issue. But first, the president versus Robert Mueller. Could we be getting close to the end of this saga? Both sides appear loaded for bear. The president slamming fired these tweets off today. Saying this and more, \"The phony witch-hunt continues, but Mueller and his gang of angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other. Wait until it comes out how horribly and viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie.\" So, the big question is when Robert Mueller shows his cards, what will we see? George Papadopoulos the center of lots of intrigues now in jail, but he will only be there for a couple of weeks. And despite an explosive story that says Manafort met secretly with Julian Assange. He says this, \"This story is totally false and deliberately libelous. I never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him.\" As another character in the saga says that he refused a deal, saying that he simply would not lie about something he didn't do and that he would rather \"rot in jail\".

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. If you look at the major players, Robert Mueller is focusing on the common denominator appears to be WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, with the questions being who knew Assange and who was in cahoots with Assange? Let's begin with former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, who the Guardian newspaper says, met with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2013, 2015, and most importantly in 2016, just months before WikiLeaks released the hacked e-mails of Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. Manafort denies he ever met with Assange. But now, Robert Mueller's investigators claim, Manafort violated his plea deal by lying to them repeatedly though they did not say about what. Manafort denies lying, but could soon be sentenced to decades in prison for his recent tax and bank fraud convictions. Then, there's Jerome Corsi, a conservative author, and associate of Trump confidant Roger Stone. The special counsel reportedly has evidence that Corsi knew WikiLeaks had John Podesta's e-mails two months before they were released. And Mueller is examining whether Corsi passed that information along to Roger Stone. Remember, that's critical because the Podesta e-mails went public on October 7th, 2016 just hours after the Access Hollywood tape went public, where Donald Trump bragged about groping women. Special counsel wants to know if there was coordination between Roger Stone and Julian Assange about when to release Podesta's damaging e-mails.  Jerome Corsi, says he didn't have insider information. Instead, he connected the dots and theorized that Assange had Podesta's e-mails. Finally, there is low-level Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos, who is serving a slap on the wrist, two-week prison term in Wisconsin for lying about his interaction with Russian contacts concerning among other things, the hacked Podesta e-mails. And today, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz doubled down on his belief that Mueller won't be fair. Listen."

Papadopoulos essentially became hostile to them, even as a cooperating witness to the point that Mueller tried to increase his sentencing which the court rejected. Corsi, refused to accept the deal according to his own accounts because he felt that he was being told to lie. This is fairly rare. Usually, these are witnesses who are desperate for deals and really would not risk ticking off a prosecutor. So, clearly, Mueller is not getting what he wants. The question is, is he getting enough to get him where he wants to go."

I attach zero significance to these written statements that Donald Trump has submitted. What they say though is that he has acceded to Robert Mueller's jurisdiction, that he basically -- you know it's a legitimate special counsel. That's it. If Robert Mueller is either got -- look, if Donald Trump is innocent, why doesn't he sit down, put himself under oath, and say whatever he knows to Robert Mueller?

So, there is a video of Paul Manafort either going in or not going into the Ecuadorian embassy. So, that is a knowable fact as to whether he went into the Ecuadorian embassy and met with Julian Assange. So, we will -- that is something that Robert Mueller, a good Mueller, or somebody can find out. And but the question is, is not did, did Paul Manafort meet with Assange, did Jerome Corsi meet with Assange? It's -- the question is, is did -- was Donald Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia? Was he connected? It doesn't matter, if Corsi, was connected to WikiLeaks, it matters if Donald Trump was connected to WikiLeaks.

The key line here, legally is whether Mueller can establish that any hacking of the e-mails was done before the fact with knowledge of Trump associates or whether they became some type of accomplice after the fact. The mere allegation that political operatives wanted to access to these e- mails from WikiLeaks is not a crime. And indeed, the status of WikiLeaks in getting this material is of greatly debated question. WikiLeaks insists that they're more of a journalistic organization than the alternative, and that may have to be litigated. But in order to really get a clear shot at the president, they need to start with a foundation in the Criminal Code. And that's going to require either an accomplice before the fact or after the fact, but not someone who simply wants to get access to information they've been reading about for political purposes."

So President Trump has made it clear in no uncertain terms. He wants $5 billion for an expanded wall in order to keep that campaign promise to secure the border. He needs Democrats help and votes to do so. He told The Washington Post though tonight that he is considering Plan B if that doesn't happen saying this. \"There are other potential ways that I can do it. You saw what we did with the military and with the barbed wire and the fencing and various other things.\" While some are criticizing his decision to send troops to the border and the recent tear gassing of some migrants as they tried to force their way into the United States, his critics also seem to have a bit of selective memory on this issue according to Brit Hume our Fox News Senior Political Analyst. Brit, good evening. Great to have you with us. Hi, Martha."

      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, that's certainly correct, Martha. And of course the -- his near hysteria over this episode of the border over the weekend where tear gas was used to repel these people who are trying to rush the border in some numbers was really a remarkable example of what we find all the time with Mr. Trump. Things that are that that that are done under his administration are considered outrageous and you know, violations of human rights and violations of chemical weapons treaties in the eyes of one Hawaiian Democratic Senator Brian Schatz. Although he later took that down but it turns out you know this has been going on for some time. And one specific incident, Martha, was I guess November 27th, 2013 when at that very same entrance point at San Ysidro on the Mexican border near San Diego, a group of migrants rushed the border were repelled with tear gas and pepper balls in the same way that the group was over this weekend and nobody ever said much of anything about it. I don't remember even receiving any national attention. It turns out according to a report in The Washington Times today that the Trump -- that the Obama administration regularly used tear gas to repeal migrants attempting to cross the border. So we -- as we often find out with things that Mr. Trump does, they're not so unusual or strange as people would have you believe."

And his promise to halt the flow of illegal immigrants into this country it's a perfectly reasonable thing to promise. Now, you get into a question of whether we should have a better immigration policy to handle things like this attempt by people to get asylum, we obviously need that."

And the reason to look for that of course, Martha, is there's not any trust on both sides. The Republicans all think that Democrats want the -- want the immigrants to come in because they want them as voters and the -- and the Democrats think the Republicans don't want to let them in because they're racists. So --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And I think the American people will cross the land would just like to have a solution and these people are pawns in that entire situation and people really would like you know, just an orderly process. That's all everybody is looking for, an orderly process here. So that's my last question to you on the politics side of this. The President wants, you know, $5 billion over several years for border security. He's already told Democrats he would give them 1.8 million DACA recipients who could stay. That deal ultimately got shot down. Any hope that he can accomplish anything on this front before the end of the term?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, that -- well, there's a deal to be had in which you get border funding in exchange for dealing with the -- with it with the DACA issue.  That's the, you know, the young immigrants who came here as children and never have lived anywhere else. And I think most people think that it's reasonable to have them stay. But under current law, they're really not supposed to. So that's a deal that's there to be had. The question is you know, whether either parties is willing to make it.  And so far that hasn't proved to be true. But the -- but the situation is worsening and I think the case for Mr. Trump's border wall has improved. I mean that situation you see in Tijuana with all his people stacked up there causing all kinds of stress on the -- on the government down there is real as was what the incident happened over the weekend in which the tear gas was used. So this caravan which a lot of people said was a myth and was not really meaningful and pose no threat turns out to be pretty real and pretty serious. So there may be a moment here where everybody kind of wise us up but having seen what I've seen over the last couple years, I wouldn't bet on it."

Whether we fight -- terrorism is not our choice, where we fight terrorism is. And I would much rather fight the terrorists in Afghanistan, as a brave soldier and the three that lost their lives yesterday did, instead of on the streets here in the United States of America. I wear on my wrist, it's a buddy of mine, Captain Andreas O'Keeffe, I flew with him in Iraq in 2008. And he was just killed this year in Iraq. Think about that. Mr. O'Keefe has been in Iraq multiple times over a time of 10 years, at least over the time that I knew him, and he gave his life. But, you know, we have a brave, brave group of people that still protect freedom and I think it's essential that we put the terrorists on their heels in their home area instead of let them come here. Because unless we are willing to convert to their brand, there are strict, narrow brand of Islam as a country, they will be determined to kill us and we have the best fighting force in the world that's going to make sure they don't make it here."

He said he wanted to fight for his country and he wanted to help people overseas and there has been certainly a lot of gains with regards to that. We've lost a lot of people recently. Thirteen U.S. service members have now been killed in Afghanistan in 2018. So, you know, in terms of how we are doing -- and the president has just spoken out about this in this new Washington Post interview tonight -- and he said -- you know, this is not a direct quote, I'm piecing at some of it together here. He said, experts have told him that we need to stay there. He went on to say in a separate part of that response, you know, oil is now less of a reason. All of a sudden it gets to a point where maybe you don't have to stay, he said, the exact quote is up on the screen now. But he said one reason now, are we going to stay in that part of the world, one reason is to stay is Israel. And then he went on to say what I just said, oil is becoming less and less of a reason. So, you know all of a sudden gets to a point where you don't have to stay there. What do you say about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "Well, I want to get to a point where we don't have to stay there. The president was right especially in the first part which is we can't leave. And the reason is this. The Taliban have a saying that, you know, America has the watches but we have the time. President Obama -- I hate to do what about-ism but President Obama when he claimed that we were going to leave and he put a timeline, he emboldened the Taliban, he emboldened the enemy because these are people that are fighting a generational war. They knew they just had to outlast us. Sending the message and meeting that which I think the president is doing now that we are going to win. We don't get defeated on the battlefield against the Taliban or Al Qaeda or ISIS or anybody. Where we get defeated is in our will. And it's tragic that we've lost 13 people and it's awful but we have the best fighting force, it's inflicting significant damage on the enemy and not on ourselves. And the other thing to keep in mind, is the Afghan people, we are popular in Afghanistan, and they have stood up and have sacrificed to defend their country. There is a lot of work to do and I think we are going to be there a while. And I wish at the beginning of this war, we spent more time setting that table but if we leave, we will be back because fighting them is not our choice. It's just where we fight them that is."

So, groups are requesting a review of an Indiana law that was signed by then-Governor Mike Pence. The law required doctors to inform their patients that abortions were not permitted if the reason was the unborn baby's race, color, or potential of disability, such as down syndrome. So, earlier this year, a federal appeals court found that the law unconstitutional. But that could potentially change under the new Supreme Court with the addition of Justice Kavanaugh. Here now, Governor Mike Huckabee, a Fox news contributor and author of \"Rare, Medium or Done Well.\" Good to see you, sir."

      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Thank you for being here. This is an issue that is very important to you. Why do you think that there may be, for a number of reasons, science, and a number of reasons, more of these cases that start to question the validity of Roe v. Wade?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, let's hope so. Because science has dramatically changed since 1973. We know things about the unborn child that we simply didn't know in 1973, about when life begins, and the viability, issues that were very different then. But I think a lot of people may need to step back and realize that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, it doesn't end abortion. You know, so many people think that is the end of abortion. It isn't. All it does is return it back to the decision of the states. No in some states, like my home state of Arkansas, abortion would be abolished because there is a constitutional amendment that bans it. That would happen in several states. In other states, there actually could be more abortions. My guess is, states like New York and California would likely see an uptick in the number of abortions because those dates would likely end any restrictions whatsoever. Ultimately, this is the decision, we've seen incremental changes and the way people approach it legally at the state level. But ultimately, it's got to be decided by personhood. This will be resolved when we determine that an unborn child is a person. That moment is when that child will be protected by the fifth and 14th amendments that says that you can't deprive somebody of life or liberty without due process, and in an abortion, there is no due process."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "And, Martha, this particular law in Indiana, think about it. When the federal courts overturned that law, what they basically said was, we can't discriminate anywhere in our culture except we can discriminate when it comes to the gender or to the race of an unborn child. I find that appalling. I wish society would find that appalling."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "utterance": "Wade, and he, like everyone who sits in that chair, said, you know, I can't tell you that until I see the case before me and I look at the law that would direct it, but you know, I would imagine that to you, people who feel the way you do, are hopeful that this court will make this decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I would like love to see it happen. I just want people who are pro-life to recognize this is not the ultimate solution. This does not really fix the idea of what I think has been a horror on our civilization that we have taken the lives of almost a million unborn children a year in their mother's womb. This is amazing. Sixty million -- if you want to know, well, how come we have to have so many people immigrating into the country just to supply jobs. A lot of it is, we've aborted our workforce over the past 45 years. Think about that. Sixty million people that would be in our workforce were never seen the light of day. That's pretty tragic, Martha. And I think every time we can put a new hindrance on the wholesale slaughter of unborn children, it's a step for a more civilized culture and society."

The authors describe a handful of White House aides as the November 9th club, establishment Republicans who didn't support the president until he won and then showed up looking for a job in the White House. Joining me now, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, authors of \"Trump's Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency.\" Good to see you, guys. Welcome back--"

I mean, obviously they were going to have to be people who said after the election, well, I didn't support him in the beginning but I do now, and I want to help. What do you call of that?"

Let me give you a great example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was with somebody else on the primary but when he came to the administration, he was with the president's agenda 100 percent of the time. But other people, not only do they work against him in the election process, they didn't vote for him on election day, but when they got into the White House, they have their own agenda. Gary Cohn, Sean Spicer, Rob Porter, and that agenda was to subvert the will of the president to move the country in a certain direction. That's not what they were there to do. They were supposed to be there to support the president and I think of people like--"

They weren't elected to do that. I think of people in the past like Jim Baker, who was a rival before he came in to be chief of staff to a different person, and that's what you are supposed to do. You put your personal differences aside, and the privilege of working in the administration means you support the president and his agenda. You can have differences of opinion and you should air those differences but when he makes a decision, you don't use your position to subvert the decision that has been made."

But my point is, there are people there who, like the author, feel that it's their job to save the country from the president, as that person said in the letter. It is outrageous. people -- that person is a coward, should stand up and be counted and say, I'm against--"

I think when the president makes decisions to bring people in like John Bolton and Larry Kudlow and Bill Shine, individuals who are there for one reason, which is to support the president, they have fundamental disagreements amongst them and they present those arguments to the president, and the president makes the final decision on what those policies are going to be. But that's a healthy thing to do. Those are the type of people that I think the president needs to continue to bring in and surround himself with."

So, in all sorts of jobs. And I think this president, first and foremost, when he makes his changes post midterm elections, with which all presidents do, and we are looking forward to some of these changes, he needs to put together that team that is going to be solely focused on his reelection. Seamlessly working the legislative agenda, the political agenda, and the communication aspect of it, the forward-facing 2020 agenda that is going to get this president reelected. That should be what people are thinking about when we are creating the new team."

She sort of, couched about a little better but she does feel like that sometimes. She's really incredible in so many ways, and she is very supportive -- she is also the person that says that there are people in the White House who are against the president's agenda, you know.

They never would have done that to Barack Obama's wife, they never would have done it to Bill Clinton's life, they sure didn't do it to George Bush's wife.

As you just mentioned, Mike Espy is trying to become tonight the first African-American elected to the Senate in the state since reconstruction and he says he knows he needs crossover voters. Because the state's Democratic base in the state's African-American base are not enough to lead him to victory. It still early but, so far tonight Democrats in the state are telling me they think the dynamics of this special election might be different enough from the general that they could be poised for an upset the way that Democrat Doug Jones upset Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama special election last winter. But unlike Alabama's special election, where top Republicans kept the controversial candidate at arm's length and the closest President Trump got to Alabama during election week was Florida. The GOP cavalry has been here in full force. President Trump twice yesterday, Senators Lindsey Graham and Roger Wicker, the governor, Bill Bryant, the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel, all with Cindy Hyde-Smith, appealing to voters, and a big part of their argument is just give Mitch McConnell a little bit of cushion so that senators who sometimes take a long time to decide how they want to vote in D.C. lose leverage when it comes time for a close vote on something like immigration or a Supreme Court justice. And so, the real wild card tonight is who actually showed up. Because you could vote today, whether you voted three weeks ago or you didn't. Martha?"
