So the Republicans are, you know, making a mountain out of a molehill. REP. MATT GAETZ, R—FLORIDA: What's most fascinating, Laura, is what's not in the Democratic memo. The fundamental premise of argument is that cash at the Democratic National Committee was convertible into a government sponsored warrant to spy American citizens, and surprisingly the Democratic memo does not say Hillary Clinton's name once and it doesn't mentioned the DNC once. And so I think it is pretty evident that there are a lot of the Republican claims that are actually bolstered by the Democratic memo, including the fact that the dossier was used to get this warrant and that a Yahoo!

After learning of Director Kevin Smith's massive heart attack the other day, actor Chris Pratt tweeted, 'Kevin, we don't know each other too good, but I've loved you since 'Clerks,' and I'm praying my blank off for you because I believe in the healing power of prayer.

But first, controversy and question stocking the Broward County Sheriff's Office. That is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Who is Scott Israel and what do we really know about him? He is a colorful, brash, outspoken Broward County sheriff who has been speaking for law enforcement since the Valentine's Day massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School. Just eight days after the shooting, before his department had even concluded its own investigation, Sheriff Israel found time to join a CNN town hall where he decided to join forces with the pro-gun-control lobby."

Now, the video reveals how Officer Peterson and other deputies responded to this active shooter situation. It's kind of important, don't you think? Now, could it be that the video would be perhaps highly damaging to the sheriff's office and perhaps to the sheriff personally? And back to his appearance at that CNN town hall meeting, why on earth did he choose to go on TV to make himself the center of his heated political debate? Is that really his role? Then he went on television the next week, just yesterday, to praise his own leadership as amazing. Just bizarre. By the way, this wasn't the first time Sheriff Israel ignited controversy for making himself the main attraction, back in September of 2015, he took major heat for putting his big face on five taxpayer financed Broward Sheriff's Office cars. They were called jokingly Israel-mobiles, and to a lot of people, they're more about politics and policing. The cars were to be assigned to members of Israel's community outreach team, which itself had been staffed by, it looks like just the sheriff campaign supporters. He got hammered for that as well. Just a few hours ago, THE INGRAHAM ANGLE received copies of internal e- mails from a source close to the Broward Sheriff's Office which has since been confirmed by a second source this evening by one of our producers. Now, it urges all staff members to vigorously support Sheriff Israel, \"At the moment, we find our agency up against a flurry of media allegations and a personal attack against our sheriff, Sheriff Israel, Sheriff Israel stood with us and now we must stand with him. It is important they know we stand as one.\" The focus should be on getting to the bottom of what happened leading up to the shooting, not some CYA deal for the sheriff. We need to know about the actions of law enforcement on the day of the shooting. It shouldn't be about saving Sheriff Israel's job because that would be really pathetic. Now, the governor yesterday announced that Florida's Department of Law Enforcement will investigate Broward County's response to the shooting, with which Sheriff Israel said he would cooperate fully. Now President Trump and with the governors at the White House and they discussed school safety in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting."

      "utterance": "Before this administration, in the end, embarks on some legislative response to the shooting, the president should request that Attorney General Sessions open his own federal investigation into this entire matter. And that means not only examine what happened on that horrible day, but also the FBI's failure to follow up on critical tips, the school's internal disciplinary record, and Broward's own interactions with Cruz and the family. No law-abiding American's Second Amendment rights should be diluted or compromised before we know exactly what happened from the moment that first distress call came into the Broward Sheriff's Office, and Sheriff Israel should spend a lot less time patting himself on the back and a lot more time being transparent with a public that demands answers. And that is THE ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction from San Antonio is Terry Lane, a former FBI special agent, in Idaho, former LAPD detective, Mark Fuhrman, who is also a Fox News contributor, and in Tallahassee, Florida State Rep Randy Fine, is one of the 73 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed a letter urging Florida Governor Rick Scott to suspend Sheriff Israel. Well, to start a conversation, guys, I want to share another exclusive report with you tonight. Now, our sources near the Broward County Sheriff's Department are telling us that the deputies who arrived at the scene of the shooting were told not to enter the school unless their body cameras were turned on. And then we found out that the deputies did not have body cameras so they did not enter the building or engage the shooter. Curiously, police also lost radio communication during the Parkland shooting. And our resource claims that radio communication also went dead during the Fort Lauderdale Airport shooting in 2017 that he also got a lot of criticism for. I want to start with you, Representative Fine, your reaction to this news that they were told to enter without body cams, which they lacked at the time, your reaction?"

That is why I signed that letter. And that is by the Florida House is moving this week to subpoena all records of Sheriff Israel, and we are going to be subpoenaing him and making them come to Tallahassee to explain himself. What happened is a disgrace."

The report we got tonight that some of these radio communications are missing or weren't recorded which, I think, are very important, are going to be critical as we try to determine what really happened in the aftermath here. What's your reaction to what we have learned, frankly, just today and tonight?"
    },

      "speaker": "MARK FUHRMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it's pretty shocking that, one, it even occurred, and then, two, we were able to find out any of this information. But what's interesting is, Sheriff Israel is a character, he is a politician. Let's not forget that. But it really has nothing to do with the actions of the deputies at the scene. I don't care if they had radios. I don't care if they were on or off. They should have done exactly what they knew they had to do regardless of who told them what to do over radio. You ignore that, and you go in and you to try to save the lives of those children and you contact the shooter and kill him."

We are also learning that in the training of some of these police officers, they were taught a kind of -- deconflict the situation, don't rush in, assess the situation first, and Scot Peterson's attorney is also kind of indicating that in some of his comments. We tried to get him on the show tonight, he would not join us, which is unfortunate. But if the police are being trained in a way that is not really helpful in this type of active-shooter situation, that also is something we'd better find out fast."

If they are being trained that way, I don't know why they would be trained that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, one of the reports we also heard, Rep. Fine, is that the deputy on-site thought that apparently some of the shooting was taking place outside of the building because again, radio transmissions, that I think we may or may not have, indicated that someone was injured on or near the football field. And so that is one of the reasons he stayed behind the cement barrier or car and was just 4 minutes went by and people were being shot one after the other after the other in this building. Maybe it was just an honest mistake? I don't know, but it seems like we should have a lot of video already publicly available."

      "speaker": "FINE",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Mark Fuhrman, there is a sound bite that I thought of you when I heard this yesterday. I know you know which one it is, but I'll just read it. I don't think we have it ready. But Jake Tapper basically asked him about the Broward County Sheriff's, you know, reaction, if they had done things differently, wouldn't have happened or not. And Sheriff Israel said, listen, ifs and buts were candy and nuts, O.J. Simpson would still be in the record books. And Tapper, is like I don't know what that means, there's 17 people dead and a long list of things you could have done differently. He had this glib way of responding to questions, and I think you hit the nail in the head, he is more of a politician than someone to head the largest police department in the country of its type of stature apparently. I didn't realize that it is the largest police department in the country. I don't even understand how it can be with New York and so forth, but of its type, I guess it is the largest."

It almost like he doesn't see the gravity of exactly what happened, like it's an opportunity for somebody to know his first and last name and all of his career. But when he had to, he had to actually give up this information on the deputy that was sitting outside of that building number 12 listening to those gunshots -- and I'm going to tell you right now, they knew full well that shooting was going on inside of that building. I will guarantee something for Deputy Peterson or ex-Deputy Peterson. He will relive that 4 minutes outside of that building for the rest of his life."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Speaking of the need for a real thorough investigation that is not tainted or questioned, could the Justice Department, I should say, could they conduct a real investigation here given the fact that the FBI clearly dropped the ball on at least two of these tips. The most recent one was really disturbing. Involving the woman who actually had him living in her house? Could the Justice Department really do this investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "I believe they can, Laura, but the fundamental problem here is the FBI has dropped the ball for the last several years, as I mentioned to a number of my colleagues, the FBI no longer communicates with the community. When you contact the FBI anymore, even myself as a retired FBI agent, when I called the agency I used to work out, I get a recording. I don't speak to a human being. When I was an FBI agent, we answer the phone. We talked to the people in the community. We were there to provide safety to the community, and in order to do that, you have to be able to communicate with them. They have to be able to speak with you as an agent, a trained agent, not an analyst, not an analyst, but a special agent of the FBI. The FBI has tried to centralize all their activity for so long now that they have lost touch with the communities. That is the fundamental issue. Whether the DOJ can investigate that and come up with a conclusion, I'm certain they can. With the FBI needs to work within itself and it needs to start providing the services to the community."

For him to use this time to go out on this political tour to try to bolster his own political agenda, which is a gun grab, which is so fascinating. Because Democrats in these times, as you know, go immediately to ending the Second Amendment and taking our guns, let the government protect you. We have seen what the government did at the FBI. We saw what it did at the local level. And now we saw deputies outside who were trained and had guns and didn't go in.

Let's ask our guest. Claude Arnold is a former special agent in charge for ICE in Los Angeles, and Joe Alioto Veronese -- I'm getting that right -- a former San Francisco police commissioner. Great to see both of you. All right, Joe, let's start with you because Libby Schaaf is a very popular mayor, she's very colorful, and now she is saying that not only we are not going to cooperate with ICE, that's throughout the state you're not cooperating with ICE and businesses and so forth, but she is going to send out these warnings apparently any time gets word of an impending raid or operation to target criminal aliens. So not just a farmworker who walks across the border, but aliens who are already judged criminals who have either not been showing up for their deportation hearings or who have just absconded.

And you read some of the headlines, and that's not really what we're seeing. But the fundamentals of what's going on here is that law enforcement officer, and some of your previous guests have even talked about it on your show, Terry Lane said, the FBI dropped the ball in the Florida incident. You were talking but the sheriff and his relationship with the public. The most fundamental tool that law enforcement has is that relationship with the public.

You have criminals who are doing real damage and real harm to both legal immigrants and American citizens. You have people who are just working, and yes, we get that.

But almost all these targets are people with criminal convictions or some sort of criminal history. So we are talking rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, gang bangers. ICE doesn't have the resources to go after the street vendor. This is something that's always alleged on the other side, they're arresting the street vendor. They don't have the time or the inclination to go after those people. And by facilitating these people to escape ICE's grasp, all the city of Oakland is doing is endangering their own community and, I daresay, the diverse part of their community because that is where these people reside. So the national recidivism rate, the rate at which people recommit crime, is about 57 percent. So we know that more than half of these people when released, they are going to commit more crimes. So if you are not releasing these people to ICE -- and by the way, the county of San Francisco has not released someone to ICE since 2010 -- they are going back on the street to commit more crimes against their communities."

The two sides also disagree whether the FBI informed the court of the political origins of the document, which was paid for by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign. So who is telling the truth?

So the Republicans are, you know, making a mountain out of a molehill. REP. MATT GAETZ, R—FLORIDA: What's most fascinating, Laura, is what's not in the Democratic memo. The fundamental premise of argument is that cash at the Democratic National Committee was convertible into a government sponsored warrant to spy American citizens, and surprisingly the Democratic memo does not say Hillary Clinton's name once and it doesn't mentioned the DNC once. And so I think it is pretty evident that there are a lot of the Republican claims that are actually bolstered by the Democratic memo, including the fact that the dossier was used to get this warrant and that a Yahoo! News article planted by Christopher Steele was also served as a valid basis for the fake dossier. It's shameful."

I have learned in the last couple of months that if I'm going to play poker with someone, there are four people I want to play with, Donald Trump Congressman Gaetz, Jim Jordan -- you started this -- and Devin Nunes, because these guys where their fear on their sleeves. When they yell 'memo,' when they introduce legislation, it means they know what is coming. Literally they probably have a heads up, but they know there is a problem. In this case, I'll let you introduce your legislation in the previous case when you called for Special Counsel Mueller to be fired, that was in November. Mueller was appointed in May. Six months go by. Why do you wait? I'll tell you why you waited. Because five days before his legislation, Paul Manafort was indicted. Five days before the legislation, the indictment, Mike Flynn was rumored to be talking to Mueller."

At what point does the Hillary Clinton team say we just lost because we had a worse candidate and Donald Trump had the more compelling message."

First this adorable selfie was taken by U.S. Olympic bobsledder and silver medalist Lauren Gibbs with first daughter Ivanka Trump and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Gibbs tweeted out \"It is important to remember that we don't have to agree on everything to get along. Be civil to each other and enjoy each other's company. It was a pleasure to meet you both.\" Seems like a perfectly innocent expression of the Olympic spirit, right? Not to the left. They went ballistic over Gibbs fraternizing with the enemy. Some of the mean tweets, 'Congratulations, you just got used for propaganda.' Gibbs replied gracefully but firmly. 'I'm not falling for anything.' But being nasty would not solve the issue. Don't get me wrong, there are many issues. Lauren Gibbs was eventually bullied into deleting the picture from her Twitter feed. Can't Americans celebrate Team USA's victory together? This is insane. And now even prayer is not safe from social media scorn. After learning of Director Kevin Smith's massive heart attack the other day, actor Chris Pratt tweeted, 'Kevin, we don't know each other too good, but I've loved you since 'Clerks,' and I'm praying my blank off for you because I believe in the healing power of prayer. Can you please pray with me, people?' An avalanche of ridicule and hatred followed. One person tweeted, 'Prayer does nothing. Only doctors and nurses and how healthy he is will save Smith.' Another said, 'That's cool and everything, but doctors and nurses save lives, not prayer.' Those comments were overwhelmed, though, by those supporting Pratt's sentiments. Man, it never ceases to amaze me how often the left will leap at any excuse to attack what society held sacred not so long ago. We'll be right back."

They put out a statement that distances itself from some of the NRA views, but that is a smart call. Otherwise what are businesses going to have to do, ideology checks on every organization, what it supports on climate change versus pro-life or immigration, it's crazy. So good for Fred Smith and good for FedEx. You don't have to agree with everything the NRA does to have a partnership with it.
