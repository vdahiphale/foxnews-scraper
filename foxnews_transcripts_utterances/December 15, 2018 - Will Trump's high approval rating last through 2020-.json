Do you know what ICE did just last year, they intercepted and they surveilled enough fentanyl to have killed every man, woman and child in this country. They're stopping the human smugglers, the child smugglers, the drug smugglers and folks who are coming over with criminal records. Now, the mainstream media want us all to believe, Jesse, that the President thinks everybody who wants to come here is a bad person. No, he doesn't. In fact, the President says constantly he wants people to come here, but come here legally. Be - add to the list of the 33 million people who have come to this country, immigrated here legally over the years, because we are so generous and welcoming. But, if anyone is smuggling a child, if anyone is smuggling drugs, if people are coming here for nefarious reasons, if they're MS-13 gang members, you know that number is not zero, not even close to zero.

But that's still not a campaign related expense. That's something you have to pay out of your own funds, you can't use campaign money to do it.

Even Comey said that there was no indicia of lying when Flynn originally met with these folks. Now, Jesse, compare that to Hillary Clinton who had nine lawyers present. Several of her lawyers that were present were actually fact witnesses that should not have been there. So for him for, you know, Hillary Clinton, they roll out the red carpet, they paved the yellow brick road to no consequence, but yet with Michael Flynn, someone who didn't even indicate that he was lying according to James Comey, he's facing serious consequences, and I think the President could do right for justice by pardoning Michael Flynn."

Well, finally the - I guess, Inspector General issued a report and said, you know what, we lost them when we they turned - one-one device they couldn't find, the other couple of devices they said were wiped clean.

But number two, I think the FBI has such contempt for Donald Trump winning this election which is basically a contempt for the American people who elected him. They were willing to twist and contort the laws to actually try to prosecute him and implement that insurance plan to make sure that the electorate didn't have its way, that the FBI and the liberal progressive elites got their way to take Donald Trump out.

You see the way they talk about Trump supporters at Trump rallies and the negative things that get said about them. You see people going out to have a nice dinner that get accosted by people, thanks to people like Maxine Waters telling you that you should get up in their face and kick them when they're down like Eric Holder.

Look at female unemployment in this country. The lowest it's been in like 60 years or something. I'm sure we'll get to lowest in all time at some point. It's a safer country, thanks to Donald Trump.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TONYA REIMAN, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT",
      "utterance": "Hey, how are you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Very good. All right, let's take a look and slow this down of this interaction between crying Chuck and the President. All right, what are we seeing here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Okay, so obviously, we know, President Trump loves to use his hands and he uses them to frame his words, so when you're watching him -- Okay, here's the interesting thing. You see how he just adjusted his jacket."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "This is the one time that you see him get nervous. When he adjusts his jacket, that's his little bit of discomfort coming through, but here comes the New York. Okay, so he leans forward, gets closer to Schumer and then the only other pacifying gesture he does is he holds his hand like this. So when you hold your hand like this and you see Schumer is doing the same thing, this is something that builds comfort and it also puts a blockage between the two of us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's like a soothing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Right, not only that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "What's he doing here? Now, he's - oh, with the finger."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, that's you and Nancy, right? And then again, the stop sign. This is what he's famous for like it's not your turn to talk, it's my turn to talk. Listen to what I'm saying. So a lot has been made also about Schumer with his posture. He's a slouch to begin with. He just has terrible posture. When he got serious though, he lifted himself back up and then went right back into that position. So I love the fact that Trump was so into like right getting into --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, he's right up in Chuck's face."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, there was no go about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Now, also, there was some interesting kind of go-between between Nancy Pelosi and the President. Let's watch that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "You know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now and I understand that and I fully understand that. We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens. But we have to have border security."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PELOSI",
      "utterance": "Mr. President, please characterize the strength that I bring for this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHUMER",
      "utterance": "Elections have consequences, Mr. President. PELOSI; Let me just say it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "That's right and that's why the country is doing so well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right, so the President starts off and let's look at what he's doing here. He starts off kind of talking for Nancy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Okay, look at the steeple."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, what is the steeple when the President does that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "This is what his go-to position, but a steeple is typically considered to be one of power, so this is his go-to posture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, got it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "What was interesting is you see Nancy, she gets very offended and she - don't speak for me. This is a woman no matter you like her or dislike her, she is not afraid of Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "She's doing a lot of aggressive hand motions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, because she is not afraid. She is like \"don't speak for me.” She came in to have a meeting and gets frustrated because you see Schumer looking at everybody who's in the crowd. You see Trump talking to the crowd and Pence just sitting there. So Pelosi is getting annoyed because she's like \"I want to have a dialogue\" and that's when she starts to turn around and talk to other people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, let's look at Pence here. I mean, what is Pence doing the whole time, just like this? What does that - I mean, he's just like \"get me out of here.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Here's the interesting thing. If you watch him, not only did he lean back in his chair which is a distancing thing. We do that we want --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So he doesn't want any part of this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Right, but not only that. He also sways back and forth depending who he agrees with at any given moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "He might be agreeing with Nancy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, he might just not be agreeing with Trump. There's a difference. It doesn't mean he's agreeing with Nancy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Very interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "And if you watch him, he does fidget. The foot will start to jazz occasionally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Jazz foot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REIMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, and he does not hold eye contact really with anyone. He says what's called an extended eye closure quite often and that's his way of like shutting this out because he truly does not want to be there and it's quite evident."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right. Tonya Reiman, everybody. Thank you very much."
    },

      "speaker": "REIMAN",
