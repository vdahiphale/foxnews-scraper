In moments my angle, we'll reveal what they are really frightened of. And the leftist mob mentality is moving from the halls of Congress and public restaurants to college campuses and even parking lots now. Ahead, we'll talk to two victims of the new mob mentality including the friend of Susan Rice's Republican son who was assaulted just days ago --her son, not the friend -- at a pro-Kavanaugh rally. Plus, did a pair of Senate candidates just have their own basket of deplorable's moments? Sean Spicer and Ari Fleischer are here to break it all down. It could spell trouble for Democrats in two key Senate races. But first, the liberals freak out as Trump reaches out. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" It was an amazing moment in the Oval Office today when pop culture icon, rapper extraordinaire Kanye West met with President Trump before the cameras. He unleashed a 10-minute monologue where he tried to explain his love of all things MAGA.",

The political right watches this herd mentality and action, concedes that blacks are monolithic, picks up a few dissidents and wistfully shrugs at the seemingly unbreakable hold of the liberal left on black Americans.\" That official's name was Clarence Thomas, then chair of the Equal Opportunity Commission.

The President support among African-Americans has nearly doubled as of last year. In the latest Rasmussen Poll, President Trump now has a 36 approval rating among African- Americans. Some attributed the rise to the support from Kanye West and of course a historic low unemployment rate in the black community. Whatever the cause, whatever the reason, the shifting support among African-Americans is very, very significant. Democrats cannot win a national election without their huge swath of black voters, and perhaps Kanye is giving them a reason to look elsewhere for political answers. So next time you hear liberal pundits writing him off as a crazy, slave denying lunatic, remember, it's all about the numbers. They have to smear West for fear that black Americans will follow him into the arms of President Donald Trump. And what are the Democrats going to do then? And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now, is Horace Cooper, co-chair of Project 21 former counsel to then House majority leader Dick Armey. Preston Mitchum is the division chair for the Washington Bar Association, young lawyers division and Charlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point USA, now author of the book, \"Campus Battlefield.\" He met with Kanye for hours earlier today. Great to have you all on tonight. It was a very interesting day in Washington for a lot of reasons, and Preston, I want to start with you. You listened to THE ANGLE.

And you know what, you should be quite afraid because even if that Rasmussen poll is half correct, if Donald Trump's approval rating is 18, 19 or 20 percent, the Democrat Party is done. And Kanye West, he's not even saying vote Democrat, vote Republican. He's saying think free, think for yourself, think independent and if you look objectively at what the Democrat Party has done to our inner cities, our urban communities and the black community over the last 60 years, it ravished these communities. High murder rates, crime everywhere. You saw in Chicago, you did a wonderful special there, there has not been a Republican mayor of Chicago since 1931.

Ahead, we'll talk to two victims of the new mob mentality including the friend of Susan Rice's Republican son who was assaulted just days ago --her son, not the friend -- at a pro-Kavanaugh rally. Plus, did a pair of Senate candidates just have their own basket of deplorable's moments? Sean Spicer and Ari Fleischer are here to break it all down. It could spell trouble for Democrats in two key Senate races. But first, the liberals freak out as Trump reaches out. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" It was an amazing moment in the Oval Office today when pop culture icon, rapper extraordinaire Kanye West met with President Trump before the cameras. He unleashed a 10-minute monologue where he tried to explain his love of all things MAGA."

Kanye West is hardly a political philosopher, and I've always believed that entertainers should first entertain and keep their politics separate from their art. But I cannot remember any artist on the left who was treated with the same vitriol and hatred as Kanye West has been subjected to since he announced his support for the president. When Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus were headlining Hillary Clinton rallies, running through dorms to register voters, I don't remember anyone at MSNBC or CNN criticizing them for lacking policy experiences.

The political right watches this herd mentality and action, concedes that blacks are monolithic, picks up a few dissidents and wistfully shrugs at the seemingly unbreakable hold of the liberal left on black Americans.\" That official's name was Clarence Thomas, then chair of the Equal Opportunity Commission.

The President support among African-Americans has nearly doubled as of last year. In the latest Rasmussen Poll, President Trump now has a 36 approval rating among African- Americans. Some attributed the rise to the support from Kanye West and of course a historic low unemployment rate in the black community. Whatever the cause, whatever the reason, the shifting support among African-Americans is very, very significant. Democrats cannot win a national election without their huge swath of black voters, and perhaps Kanye is giving them a reason to look elsewhere for political answers. So next time you hear liberal pundits writing him off as a crazy, slave denying lunatic, remember, it's all about the numbers. They have to smear West for fear that black Americans will follow him into the arms of President Donald Trump. And what are the Democrats going to do then? And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now, is Horace Cooper, co-chair of Project 21 former counsel to then House majority leader Dick Armey. Preston Mitchum is the division chair for the Washington Bar Association, young lawyers division and Charlie Kirk is the founder of Turning Point USA, now author of the book, \"Campus Battlefield.\" He met with Kanye for hours earlier today. Great to have you all on tonight. It was a very interesting day in Washington for a lot of reasons, and Preston, I want to start with you. You listened to THE ANGLE. Do you think that any of this overwrought reaction to Kanye West is because the left is worried that if this -- let's say it's even 20 percent support for Trump. That's cataclysmically bad news for Democrats."

He ranted and raved all in the Oval Office, banging his hand as a child would when they are throwing a temper tantrum. You have to almost read hieroglyphics to even understand what he was saying, and I'm actually proud of anyone who knows the Morse code enough to know what Kanye was saying. He grandstanded the entire time and he pontificated on nothingness. As a Democrat I'm certainly not worried about any African-American approval ratings for Trump. No -- they will still receive a low, excuse me, President Trump will still receive a low amount of African-American supporters. Trust that."

He's not, you know, no more than Miley Cyrus bumping and grinding or doing the twerk on whatever it was at the Grammy's. She looked like a complete moron, but she's out there banging doors for Hillary. Hillary is the person for you, let me give you the five reasons why. No one talked about Miley, but this is a real problem for liberals. Why isn't Miley Cyrus and Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and all the other people that showed up, over all the years, never heard about policy considerations then. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Celebrity after celebrity has always come out and supported the left and we all were supposed to rejoice.

His whole life is about popularity and so many people in Hollywood and so many people in the music industry are afraid to do what he did. And you know what, you should be quite afraid because even if that Rasmussen poll is half correct, if Donald Trump's approval rating is 18, 19 or 20 percent, the Democrat Party is done. And Kanye West, he's not even saying vote Democrat, vote Republican. He's saying think free, think for yourself, think independent and if you look objectively at what the Democrat Party has done to our inner cities, our urban communities and the black community over the last 60 years, it ravished these communities. High murder rates, crime everywhere. You saw in Chicago, you did a wonderful special there, there has not been a Republican mayor of Chicago since 1931.

It's not about race, all of that. And people said why are you lecturing black folks when there is systemic racism? So I don't buy that he did nothing. I think today with Kanye West, what you saw was not a message to the black community. It was a message to Trump supporters ahead of the midterms. Don't worry about the problem of race, I have a black friend, and that's why Kanye was a prop."

Similarly, I think Marsha Blackburn initially was in a tight race going back a few weeks ago with former governor Phil Bredesen. And I think that that race has opened up for Marsha Blackburn. These two folks needed to pretend that they actually were conservatives and that they have championed sort of the issues that they could work with someone like President Donald Trump. And these videos that had both been unearthed proved that they will say whatever they have to say to get into power, and yet they are truly leftwing Democrats that will elect Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi if they ever were to get to Washington."

So along comes rough, tough, gruff Trump, who just lets it fly, lets it rip. And it makes some people uncomfortable. But on the other hand, I think people actually embrace the fact that he is real. And that has helped him. In the case of the Senate candidates in these very red states, there is a terrible tension that they are suffering from. They want to be more liberal, but they know they can't be more liberal, and so it doesn't surprise you when you hear things, you see things like what happened with Arizona, like what's happening in Tennessee, come out of the woodwork, because its' the real reflection of who they are and what they believe.

And we're talking about Kanye West, all the criticism of him is he's crazy, he's nuts, he's stupid, you can't understand him. There's very little substantive dialogue. And Sean, I want to go with you and then back to Ari. Nicolle Wallace was on MSNBC today, and we were talking about this push to violence and intimidation, getting in people's faces.

People who used to have moorings, people who used to say, there's a limit to where we will go. And because they don't like what Donald Trump is doing, they go lower. And that is really going to hurt the Democrats when good people like Nicolle have lost their way and say things like that. Advocating violence, no. And Sean is 100 percent right. That was actually an assassination attempt on scores of Republicans with 200 rounds of ammunition. Don't forget the shooting at the Family Research Council or the firebombing of the GOP headquarters in North Carolina in 2016. These are actual acts of violence, and one of the reasons why I'm so upset about this is because the mainstream media doesn't blow the whistle, put it on the front page, and call them out. They look the other way. And that mean they acquiesce to it."
