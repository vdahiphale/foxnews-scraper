Trey Yingst is on the ground in Kharkiv, Ukraine for us on Vladimir Putin's warning of more strikes to come, Mark Meredith on how President Biden's Armageddon comments could be complicating matters, and Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg and how the U.S. should respond to those attacks right now. We begin with Trey. He's on the ground there, as I mentioned, in Kharkiv, for us, the target of some of those attacks. What is the latest from there, Trey?",

At least 11 people were killed and dozens more injured, including the head of the national police cyber unit in Kyiv. Black plumes of smoke were seen rising from the city center of the Ukrainian capital after the attack began. While the Russians say they were targeting military infrastructure, images from the ground tell a different story.

President Biden going on to say -- quote -- \"These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom.\" Tomorrow, G7 leaders are expected to hold a conference call with Ukraine's president to discuss the war, President Biden saying the U.S. is going to continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance.

He needs to pick up the phone and needs to call Vladimir Putin and say quite clearly to him, look, we are going all in. We are going to provide Ukraine with every bit of armament they need to defeat the Russian army in the field and force them out of the field. And that means Crimea as well. And then you turn it over to Putin and said, OK, it's over to you now. What are you going to do? I understand the risk behind that. But we haven't done that. As I said earlier, we haven't given the armament he needs. We haven't given him the air defense that he needs. Give it to him. Press the attack going forward.

That's not going to happen. He's losing the fight in the field. And what Zelenskyy needs to do, but he needs our help to do it -- he needs the alliance help as well -- to press the attack forward. And I really look -- and I have said this before -- look at the south. If that attack on Kherson keeps going the way it's going and he's able to cut off Crimea, and he's able to take Crimea -- and the reason they hit the Kerch Bridge was that is a supply route into Crimea -- then Putin has got a major problem. But escalate to a level that Putin has to make the decision, do I escalate more or do I negotiate? And then there his problem escalation is, he's going to become a pariah among the United Nations. But all of his allies are going to desert him as well. I just cannot believe the Russian military, nor the siloviki, the strongmen within Russia, or the Chinese want him to escalate much further than he is right now.

And you can see it is $6.49 here for a gallon of regular. But, like you said, right, we have been seeing gas prices rise for the last 16 days. Now, the national average, it's $3.91 today, close to $4 a gallon. That's already 12 cents higher than a week ago. And I want to highlight it's 63 percent higher than when the president took office. And that could get worse, largely because of OPEC's planned production cut of two million barrels per day. Many, of course, are calling that announcement a slap in the face, after the president visited Saudi Arabia. Prices, oil prices have cooled a bit today, but we are still seeing double-digit growth because of that vs. a week ago. And one path the administration is considering, to continue tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, not only is it a short-term solution, but those reserves, of course, are intended to be used for disasters like Hurricane Ian, and are now at their lowest low levels in 40 years. I do want to draw attention to what's going on with diesel prices, because we have now gone over the $5-a-gallon mark, 19 cents higher than a week ago. So that pain that you're feeling is not just going to be when you go fill up your car, but diesel is known as the canary for inflation. And that's because it gets our groceries and our holiday presents to the store. So this week's inflation number that I know we're all eagerly awaiting won't include the increase at the pump that we're seeing now. But come November, come December, we will start to see the impact of that. And, certainly, if inflation goes up, we will also see the Fed continue to likely get aggressive with rates. So it's kind of just this snowballing domino effect that we're seeing in numbers like that at the pump, Sandra.",

Very good to see you, sir. Thanks for joining us on this. Everybody wants those prices to come down. It inflicts a lot of pain on the American consumer.

And it's a privilege to be with you under, let's say, austere conditions in the country because of policies that this administration has been involved with, particularly the oil and gas industry. They started sending a message on day one, we're going to try to bring the fossil fuel industry to its knees. And they basically are doing a pretty good job of that. They're overtaxing, over-regulating, overlitigating. And if you want less of something, that's how you do it. You go in and government overtaxes, over-regulates, overlitigates. And that's what this Biden administration is doing, shutting down pipelines, not allowing the offshore drilling, not allowing federal leases. All of that collectively sends a message to the companies, whether they're small independents or whether they're the big oil and gas companies, that you better be really careful if you're going to go expend monies to explore for and deliver oil to the refineries. And, as a matter of fact, I think we're about a million barrels last refining in the U.S. since the Biden administration took over. So, all of that together, Sandra, sends a clear message that a lot of this recession that's happening is driven by the cost of energy. And America was independent for the first time in 67 years in 2019 because of the policies that President Trump put into place. We were producing. We were doing a great job. We were working with our foreign partners. And the supply of energy around the world was in a lot better place.

They're dissatisfied with the way things have been going. President Biden made the decision to drain millions of barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and that temporarily decreased gas prices. But now they're coming back up. I think, if he was looking for the political solution, the Band-Aid for this problem, he probably pulled the trigger on that decision too early. But Americans want long-term solutions. They want to know that they're not going to keep paying record high levels of inflation for groceries, for gas and so forth. And so, if voters vote those issues, Democrats are in trouble. If they vote the candidates, that's another question. It's always a challenge for both parties to get the right people out there, the right messages out there.

This is ground zero for migrant encounters, last fiscal year, more than 470,000 to the Del Rio Sector. And the migrants are coming from more than 40 countries right now. Over the weekend, some 13,000 migrants across the entire Southwest border from as far away as Somalia, Syria and Iran. Now, let me show you some video of some drone we shot this morning Sandra. This is a group of about 100 or so at a pecan orchard. They come every morning around the same time at daylight with the efficiency of having perhaps your Amazon package delivered. The Border Patrol, National Guard, and Texas DPS wait for them, process them, and send them along their way. It's a daily occurrence like clockwork. I want to show you. Take a look at this video we shot with our drone on Sunday, though. This is the large groups we're getting, upwards of 200. In this one, there were 178 total; 21 were children, among them, a woman from Cuba, Sandra, that I asked how much she had paid a coyote to cross the river. She said $1,500.

And customers have complained that restaurant bills, food delivery, ride sharing, and credit card statements are much more expensive these days. And that's because, instead of outright raising prices to cover higher costs, businesses are charging you a little more in added fees to cover rising inflation and wages, probably most notable on your restaurant check, with restaurants accused of serving up those airline-style fees, where your final bill might actually be 30 to 40 percent higher if you add up the 20 percent mandatory tips, the extra percentage charges on top for health care taxes to cover workers, state sales taxes, even wellness fees or macroeconomic surcharges, as restaurants cover perks to attract workers. Now, we know that inflation is still near 40-year highs. The jobs market is still tight, with restaurants and hospitality adding workers last month. And prices are forecast to jump another 8 percent-plus from last year in September. And that data due out on Thursday morning.

President Biden going on to say -- quote -- \"These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom.\" Tomorrow, G7 leaders are expected to hold a conference call with Ukraine's president to discuss the war, President Biden saying the U.S. is going to continue to provide Ukraine with military assistance.

What President Biden should do -- and he shouldn't be doing it over the airwaves or a DNC fund-raiser, I think. He needs to pick up the phone and needs to call Vladimir Putin and say quite clearly to him, look, we are going all in. We are going to provide Ukraine with every bit of armament they need to defeat the Russian army in the field and force them out of the field. And that means Crimea as well. And then you turn it over to Putin and said, OK, it's over to you now. What are you going to do? I understand the risk behind that. But we haven't done that. As I said earlier, we haven't given the armament he needs. We haven't given him the air defense that he needs. Give it to him. Press the attack going forward. Then you basically tell Putin, it's up to you now. Do you want to escalate or do you want to negotiate? And if you escalate, we're prepared for that. If you want to negotiate, we're prepared -- prepared for that as well. But we haven't done that. And I think we have not helped the Ukrainians win this fight as much as we should.

They're going to be more resolved in the fight going forward. So, he's attacking targets that he thinks is going to affect the will and they're going to break down -- bring down the government. That's not going to happen. He's losing the fight in the field. And what Zelenskyy needs to do, but he needs our help to do it -- he needs the alliance help as well -- to press the attack forward. And I really look -- and I have said this before -- look at the south. If that attack on Kherson keeps going the way it's going and he's able to cut off Crimea, and he's able to take Crimea -- and the reason they hit the Kerch Bridge was that is a supply route into Crimea -- then Putin has got a major problem. But escalate to a level that Putin has to make the decision, do I escalate more or do I negotiate? And then there his problem escalation is, he's going to become a pariah among the United Nations. But all of his allies are going to desert him as well. I just cannot believe the Russian military, nor the siloviki, the strongmen within Russia, or the Chinese want him to escalate much further than he is right now. You're going to see the Chinese walk away from him. And when that happens, he's a man alone."

They need to prosecute the attack going forward. We haven't given the air defense system. We haven't given him ATACMS. Give him everything he needs. But we need to tell Putin, there are certain guardrails and we're coming to do this and we're going to defeat -- the Ukrainians are going to defeat the Russian army in the field.

      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Hey, good to see you, Sandra. Yes, I mean, of course, people across the country are feeling it, but nowhere more so than California. And you can see it is $6.49 here for a gallon of regular. But, like you said, right, we have been seeing gas prices rise for the last 16 days. Now, the national average, it's $3.91 today, close to $4 a gallon. That's already 12 cents higher than a week ago. And I want to highlight it's 63 percent higher than when the president took office. And that could get worse, largely because of OPEC's planned production cut of two million barrels per day. Many, of course, are calling that announcement a slap in the face, after the president visited Saudi Arabia. Prices, oil prices have cooled a bit today, but we are still seeing double-digit growth because of that vs. a week ago. And one path the administration is considering, to continue tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, not only is it a short-term solution, but those reserves, of course, are intended to be used for disasters like Hurricane Ian, and are now at their lowest low levels in 40 years. I do want to draw attention to what's going on with diesel prices, because we have now gone over the $5-a-gallon mark, 19 cents higher than a week ago. So that pain that you're feeling is not just going to be when you go fill up your car, but diesel is known as the canary for inflation. And that's because it gets our groceries and our holiday presents to the store. So this week's inflation number that I know we're all eagerly awaiting won't include the increase at the pump that we're seeing now. But come November, come December, we will start to see the impact of that. And, certainly, if inflation goes up, we will also see the Fed continue to likely get aggressive with rates. So it's kind of just this snowballing domino effect that we're seeing in numbers like that at the pump, Sandra."

Very good to see you, sir. Thanks for joining us on this. Everybody wants those prices to come down. It inflicts a lot of pain on the American consumer. American small businesses are reeling because of this as well. So what is your take? Is this the administration's fault, why we continue to see sky-high gas and oil prices?"

      "utterance": "Yes, well, happy Columbus Day, Sandra. And it's a privilege to be with you under, let's say, austere conditions in the country because of policies that this administration has been involved with, particularly the oil and gas industry. They started sending a message on day one, we're going to try to bring the fossil fuel industry to its knees. And they basically are doing a pretty good job of that. They're overtaxing, over-regulating, overlitigating. And if you want less of something, that's how you do it. You go in and government overtaxes, over-regulates, overlitigates. And that's what this Biden administration is doing, shutting down pipelines, not allowing the offshore drilling, not allowing federal leases. All of that collectively sends a message to the companies, whether they're small independents or whether they're the big oil and gas companies, that you better be really careful if you're going to go expend monies to explore for and deliver oil to the refineries. And, as a matter of fact, I think we're about a million barrels last refining in the U.S. since the Biden administration took over. So, all of that together, Sandra, sends a clear message that a lot of this recession that's happening is driven by the cost of energy. And America was independent for the first time in 67 years in 2019 because of the policies that President Trump put into place. We were producing. We were doing a great job. We were working with our foreign partners. And the supply of energy around the world was in a lot better place.

If that refining capacity is offline to the degree that you just described, and there's solid evidence of that, well, does pumping more help or buying oil help or releasing more from the reserves help, if we can't refine it into gasoline?"

There seems to be still blame putting on the oil companies themselves, even some -- in some cases, the mom-and-pop gas stations in this country, and warnings to them not to price-gouge. You heard it from the president during the storm, in the aftermath of the storm. You hear it from Gavin Newsom out there in California. And in my research today, I was surprised to see a White House pool report from you several years ago, 2017, I believe, and you too, during Tropical Storm Harvey, made a similar warning to not price-gouge at the fuel pumps in the wake of the storm."

This administration is doing it to try to cover up for bad policies that they put into place. There is no doubt that this administration wants to force Americans to quit using fossil fuels and go to wind and solar to power their grid. And it's just not going to happen. You have got to have fossil fuels and nuclear power to be the baseload for your electric grids.

But, in certain House races, especially given how narrowly divided the House is -- it only takes very few seats for Kevin McCarthy to become speaker. Gas prices going up hits everybody in their pocketbooks.

They're dissatisfied with the way things have been going. President Biden made the decision to drain millions of barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and that temporarily decreased gas prices. But now they're coming back up. I think, if he was looking for the political solution, the Band-Aid for this problem, he probably pulled the trigger on that decision too early. But Americans want long-term solutions. They want to know that they're not going to keep paying record high levels of inflation for groceries, for gas and so forth. And so, if voters vote those issues, Democrats are in trouble. If they vote the candidates, that's another question. It's always a challenge for both parties to get the right people out there, the right messages out there.

But this administration seemed to turn a blind eye to inflation. But why do you believe this White House hasn't gone out of its way to show voters that, no matter whose fault it is, that they're going to rein in those high prices, and they're going to start pumping more oil domestically to bring down your gas prices if, in poll after poll, it shows up as the number one concern of the American voter, no matter your party?"

This is ground zero for migrant encounters, last fiscal year, more than 470,000 to the Del Rio Sector. And the migrants are coming from more than 40 countries right now. Over the weekend, some 13,000 migrants across the entire Southwest border from as far away as Somalia, Syria and Iran. Now, let me show you some video of some drone we shot this morning Sandra. This is a group of about 100 or so at a pecan orchard. They come every morning around the same time at daylight with the efficiency of having perhaps your Amazon package delivered. The Border Patrol, National Guard, and Texas DPS wait for them, process them, and send them along their way. It's a daily occurrence like clockwork. I want to show you. Take a look at this video we shot with our drone on Sunday, though. This is the large groups we're getting, upwards of 200. In this one, there were 178 total; 21 were children, among them, a woman from Cuba, Sandra, that I asked how much she had paid a coyote to cross the river. She said $1,500. This is all a part of what Congressman Gonzales really wants Vice President Harris to see and why he's so frustrated that she won't come and see it.

And as long as they stay absent to this, the problem is only going to get worse in Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona, and all other states in this country. It is not a positive thing.

If you have eaten out at a restaurant or hailed a ride or even looked at your credit card statements lately, you may have noticed a few extra added charges. And customers have complained that restaurant bills, food delivery, ride sharing, and credit card statements are much more expensive these days. And that's because, instead of outright raising prices to cover higher costs, businesses are charging you a little more in added fees to cover rising inflation and wages, probably most notable on your restaurant check, with restaurants accused of serving up those airline-style fees, where your final bill might actually be 30 to 40 percent higher if you add up the 20 percent mandatory tips, the extra percentage charges on top for health care taxes to cover workers, state sales taxes, even wellness fees or macroeconomic surcharges, as restaurants cover perks to attract workers. Now, we know that inflation is still near 40-year highs. The jobs market is still tight, with restaurants and hospitality adding workers last month. And prices are forecast to jump another 8 percent-plus from last year in September. And that data due out on Thursday morning.

Over the last nine months, the economy has contracted. But it's not just the loss of GDP. The average family has lost about $4,000 in purchasing power over the last year. You have seen $10 trillion of losses in the stock market this year. Employers are having the hardest time getting people back to work. I mean, I could just go on with these litany of problems. You got gas prices, Sandra, that now look like they're headed back to $4.50 to $5 a gallon. And so, yes, we're in a recession right now. And what they're saying was, maybe we will have one a year from now. Come on, it's here."

They don't want you to sit down at their restaurant and see that their prices went up and their customers to say, hey, what are you doing here? They want to clearly show that this is what we are passing down to you. We're keeping our prices the same as we -- the best that they can, at least, but we're going to show you what we would otherwise be passing along to raise prices. They don't want the blame for it."

And all of them are saying exactly what you just said, Sandra. Wait a minute. We have got higher costs because energy is more expensive. Food is more expensive. Wood is more expensive. Construction is more expensive. So it all gets passed on to the consumers. We're getting crushed, as I mentioned, $4,000 a year in lost income. That's like a $300-a-month pay cut for people. And then people said, well, we're not really in a recession right now. It is a cost of living recession. And it's hitting the poor and the middle class the hardest."

I will draw your attention. You have got like 10 seconds when I give it to you, Steve. The markets, the Nasdaq, new low for the year."
