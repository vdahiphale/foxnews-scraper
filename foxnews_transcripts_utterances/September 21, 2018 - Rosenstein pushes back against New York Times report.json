If they do not here, that there is a plan, then they say they will vote on that nomination on Brett Kavanaugh come Monday.

I'm Martha McCallum and this is \"The Story\" that is changing by the hour as we wait for word now from Ford's attorney. We're also waiting for the president of the United States who no doubt will have some comments on both of these stories this evening.He is obviously in Missouri tonight, where just can take you there in a second but he's going to probably weigh in which he did this morning for the first time really in a bold way with a tweet early this morning.

I want to read it to you in full. He says, \"I'm extending the deadline for response. Yet again, to 10:00 this evening.\" So just three hours from now. \"I'm providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Ford's attorneys don't respond, or Dr. Ford decides not to testify. So, we've got to wait, at least, three more hours before we find out whether or not this hearing on Wednesday is going to be a go or not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, let's talk just a little bit about the terms of this counteroffer from Senate Republicans today. What they want is they wanted a Wednesday hearing. They want a female attorney to do the questioning and they say that Ford would have to testify first, then Kavanaugh. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, Ford's teams wants a Thursday hearing, they want no outside attorney asking questions and they want Kavanaugh to go first. So, you know, the two sides still have quite a ways to go. But today, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mitch McConnell, he sure sounded very confident while speaking to conservatives at the Values Voter Summit here in D.C. Listen to this.",

Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill is in one of the toughest re-election battles in the country against state's attorney general Josh Hawley. Now President Trump won Missouri by 19 points and he's hoping his popularity will help energize voters to get them out to vote for Holly in November.

She's hoping for another round in the Senate. Josh Hawley, her attorney general, is hoping that he can get that seat from her and build on that Trump momentum from the 2016 election where as Garrett said he's ahead by 19 points. This race is pretty much neck and neck if you look at most of the reads on it, it is going to be a tossup at this point as most of those 10 states are. So Democrats would need two states to flip the Senate in their direction. They would need to clear two states. And the GOP hopes that they'll make big gains in the Senate in order to increase their lead, which the president has said it so tiny small makes it impossible to get a lot of things done. So he is there to ramp up the crowd. And of course one of the main reasons, that we want to listen to some of his comments tonight is because he has been really a lot more out there on the issue of Brett Kavanaugh today in terms of his strident take in his tweets this morning towards Brett Kavanaugh's accuser asking why she hasn't come forward with her FBI files.",

But critically there are a lot of questions here about political modification and perhaps leading the story. Andy McCabe must obviously, former FBI acting director under investigation. Others in the Department of Justice, perhaps leaking this as a way to delegitimize Rod Rosenstein, and perhaps play into the president's hand in terms of giving an excuse to get rid of him. We don't know, we need to know. I think the fortunate thing here is unlike so many of these investigations when we do get a look into this because I think we well, because it is such a powerful allegation, it would be resolved relatively quickly because the DOJ, the Department of Justice, will know exactly who's in that room the New York Times reports on because they take a list of all those names.

Will the president decide to fire Rod Rosenstein, based on these scathing stories in the New York Times? More on all of that in just a moment. Also, this Senator Grassley situation this evening is a moving target. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says they'll give it until 10:00 tonight. But that, that is the final deadline. We have seen this pushed and pushed again. They are saying 10:00 is the final deadline. If they do not here, that there is a plan, then they say they will vote on that nomination on Brett Kavanaugh come Monday. But there are some more developments coming through on that, that we're deciphering at the moment. So, we will give them to you just a moment. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha McCallum and this is \"The Story\" that is changing by the hour as we wait for word now from Ford's attorney. We're also waiting for the president of the United States who no doubt will have some comments on both of these stories this evening.He is obviously in Missouri tonight, where just can take you there in a second but he's going to probably weigh in which he did this morning for the first time really in a bold way with a tweet early this morning. And all of this is sure to come up as we get into this rally about 30 minutes from now. As I said, in Springfield, Missouri. It's a rally for Josh Hawley who, of course, is running against Claire McCaskill, the incumbent senator there. And Kristin Fisher is live at the White House with the latest in any reaction that we are getting from there tonight on both of these stories. Hi, Kristin."

Now, the original deadline for that counteroffer had come and gone. It was close of business today. But just moments ago, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Senator Chuck Grassley, put out a statement saying that he had extended the deadline. I want to read it to you in full. He says, \"I'm extending the deadline for response. Yet again, to 10:00 this evening.\" So just three hours from now. \"I'm providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Ford's attorneys don't respond, or Dr. Ford decides not to testify. So, we've got to wait, at least, three more hours before we find out whether or not this hearing on Wednesday is going to be a go or not. So, let's talk just a little bit about the terms of this counteroffer from Senate Republicans today. What they want is they wanted a Wednesday hearing. They want a female attorney to do the questioning and they say that Ford would have to testify first, then Kavanaugh. But, Ford's teams wants a Thursday hearing, they want no outside attorney asking questions and they want Kavanaugh to go first. So, you know, the two sides still have quite a ways to go. But today, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mitch McConnell, he sure sounded very confident while speaking to conservatives at the Values Voter Summit here in D.C. Listen to this."

Ever since the accusations first surfaced, he's been uncharacteristically restrained. But that all changed this morning with a series of tweets from the commander-in-chief. He said, \"I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement authorities by either her or her loving parents. Now, that did not sit well with Republican Senator Susan Collins, a critical swing vote, she said that she was appalled by the president's tweet, she called it inappropriate, and wrong. She also said that she had no problem delaying this hearing for a few more days. But Martha, it is very clear that both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump are tired of waiting, they want this hearing to happen. And we're going to find out in exactly three hours whether or not Christine Blasey Ford and her legal team agree to their demands. Martha."

And tonight, the latest word, Cleta, from the Judiciary Committee is that they extended the deadline from 5:00 to 10:00 which might have indicated that they were getting closer. That there was reason to believe that they were coming to some kind of conclusion on the arrangements here.

And let's be very clear about this. Senator Feinstein had this letter in July. She didn't notify anyone. Not the chairman of the committee, none of her colleagues. She didn't raise these allegations when she met privately with Judge Kavanaugh. She didn't tell any of her colleagues. So the 64 private meetings that they had with Judge Kavanaugh, they were not able to raise it. She did not even attend the private session where Senators can ask a nominee about more sensitive kinds of information. She didn't even attend that. She didn't raise during the three days of hearings or the 1,300 questions posed to him afterwards."

And you know, normally Senators are very courteous with each other in that way that sends a huge rift through the Senate Judiciary Committee. It's just another of Feinstein's -- I think, these steps is even understating. And she is -- she has mishandled this affair profoundly. And I think it's interesting as Cleta, said -- you know, the Senate Judiciary Committee has already been interviewing and not even just Judge Kavanaugh, but the other people that they were able to determine were alleged to have been at this party, who have all the ones have been able to reach have said, nope. And that Senator Grassley wanted the Democrats to participate in it in normal -- under normal circumstances, that would be bipartisan. The Democrats were simply too busy standing in front of cameras demanding an investigation to actually do it. This whole affair just reeks of a circus and a media sideshow. This is not -- they're not taking it seriously. Senator Grassley is taking her allegations much more seriously than the Democrats who are simply treating it as a partisan football."

And as you say, at least, at this point they haven't gotten responses on that. Cleta, let's fast forward for a moment. If indeed, there isn't a response and they're not able to put together a hearing for Wednesday which is, is the proposed day here. It's -- obviously, this the story doesn't go away. I mean, I would imagine that Dr. Ford will find another way to get her story out and that Democrats will continue to go after Judge Kavanaugh even if he passes this vote, and try to undo it."

And you have people like Tammy Baldwin, the Senator from Wisconsin who was hosting a fundraiser with the lawyers for this accuser. Until she was found out, and then, it was canceled. So, if you want to do something about Tammy Baldwin, send money to her opponent Leah Vukmir. But honestly, this is all being carried out by people who have said that they are not going to support Judge Kavanaugh under any circumstances. And I just am appalled. But I will say this, this is actually in keeping with the feminist playbook that was started during the Obama years where colleges and universities nationwide were instructed to adopt procedures that where there is an accusation of sexual assault, that the accused gets no due process rights."

He was getting a lot of credit for being reserved on this issue and not speaking out, not vilifying her in any way. This morning, he said this, \"I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement authorities by either her or her loving parents. I asked that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn the date, time, and place.\" Of course, you know, Carrie, everybody knows that, that doesn't exist.

But I think it goes to the question of these are very difficult allegations to even go back and verify because they are so old, they are so vague. I mean, at the end of the day the Washington Post who really helped to break this story and really everyone else has gone forward with the story that's very, very thin on facts. Now, they're trying to railroad a process that turns a lot of rule of law principles on its head, where she's making demands -- it's the witness making demands of the Senators. She is saying things like, well, the accused has to go forth testify first. That's never, in 800 years, that's not happened, so it's unreasonable. How can he respond?"

It claims that he suggested that he could wear a wire and talk about invoking the 25th Amendment in an effort to remove President Trump in early May of 2017. It was all shortly after the firing of James Comey. So that report is based in part on memos from fired FBI official Andrew McCabe. He says he doesn't know how the New York Times got their hands on those memos, other people think that perhaps he was behind that. He is coming out with a new book come December. He's also under investigation by the Inspector General Michael Horowitz and there's a grand jury that's reviewing those charges right now.

We're told there were five or six people at the meeting including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director Andrew McCabe and FBI Counsel Lisa Page who had the affair with disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok. The New York Times says Rosenstein talked about secret (AUDIO GAP) president to expose the chaos in the White House and told Andrew (AUDIO GAP) Attorney General Jeff Sessions and then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to begin proceedings (AUDIO GAP) 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office. Sources tell (AUDIO GAP) in the meeting and both mention a heated moment between Rosenstein and McCabe where the Deputy A.G. asked McCabe if he wanted him to wear an effing wire. And when someone asked Rosenstein if he was serious, he responded yes, I'm serious. What do you expect us to do? Another person at the meeting says he believes Rosenstein was being sarcastic.

Based on my personal dealings with the President there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\" The story also touched off speculation that this could be the tipping point for the president to fire Rod Rosenstein.

What do you want me to do? You want me to wear a wire? Is that what you want me to do? Something along those lines. Jonathan, when you listen to that and you think about the tension of that moment that James Comey had just been fired not only days before,4 you know, take a look at the activity in that room and what does it say to you?"

      "speaker": "TURLEY",

I have a column in the Hill today talking about how Trump could use this as a way to fulfill what he has wanted along -- for a long time, not only to replace Rosenstein but ultimately Sessions. He could say that this is a case of insubordination, not obstruction and go ahead and fire Rosenstein and replace him potentially with a person he wants to become ultimately attorney general. If he followed that course, he would end up with an attorney general who had direct control over Mueller's investigation. Now, that's a series of events that is going to be viewed very differently by both of these parties but it's ironic that this newspaper that the president loves to call the failing New York Times may have given him the ability to do just that."

Let's talk about the New York Times and the way this story was presented, Howard, because there's also reports from people who were familiar with what was going on in that room that the notes and the memos are all typed up. They're not extemporaneous notes that were scribbled down. They're notes that were probably made later and that for one thing Lisa Page wrote very copious notes and that Andrew McCabe's notes were a little bit scratchier. She wrote all these notes and yet she didn't mention any reference to the 25th Amendment that was set in the room. She said the only thing -- the takeaway is that the only thing that was discussed in the room was that wire moment and there's some suggestion about why the New York Times wrote both of those things together and whether or not they can really back that up."

And the unnamed sources behind this explosive time story may be putting the wrong twist on it possibly or even probably in an effort to damage Rod Rosenstein because if the line was sarcastic, as sources have told Fox, Washington Post also has a similar account, then it may just be you know, they're having a heated exchange, Rosenstein and the former number two at the FBI Andrew McCabe and Rosenstein is pushing back. But I do have to say that Rod Rosenstein's denial here leaves a whole lot of wiggle room. He says the article is inaccurate but he doesn't deny a specific detail in it. He says he doesn't now believe president should be removed through the 25th Amendment but doesn't say anything about whether he at least speculated about that or talk to others about that back in 2017."

And with regard to that anonymous New York Times editorial that everyone has been trying to figure out who it came from, it also referenced this idea of using the 25th Amendment and Donald Trump Jr. piped in pretty quickly with a tweet saying we likely have a winner in the search for anonymous. Anything to subvert a president who's actually getting things done for America for change. And now let's put up the actual piece of the anonymous op-ed back then which said, \"given the instability many witness, there were early whispers within the cabinet for -- of invoking the 25th Amendment which would start a complex process of removing the president.\" Your thoughts on all that, Jonathan Turley."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all there's no basis that I can see for starting a 25th amendment a process of removal let alone to have it be successful. It's just -- it is -- it is beyond really any sense of plausibility. But in terms of picking out who's the anonymous source here, I agree with Howard. There's a lot of very weird fingerprints that are likely on this story. Someone leaked these memos which may be classified. That could cause a serious issue with the special counsel or the Department Justice. I don't know what their status may be. But there was clearly an agenda here. One possibility is someone wanted to trigger Trump to see if he -- this would push him to firing Rosenstein. I don't believe he should fire Rosenstein. I don't believe he should fire Sessions because I think that that would complicate this and it would be bad for the country. But this really does open up a pathway for him to say that this is really a case of insubordination, this fulfills the narrative I've been talking about that there are people that are really not supporting me and are seeking to undermine me and he could clean house and that, of course, would change a lot of things."

President Trump has been very careful with his words for a while this week on this controversy. He got a lot of praise for that. But then this morning that changed and he fired off two pretty explosive tweets about this writing, \"I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local law enforcement authorities by either her or her loving parents. I asked that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place.\" And then, \"the radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved now. Why didn't someone call the FBI 30 years ago? Here now my ladies panel for tonight, Lisa Boothe, Marie Harf, and Jenna Ellis. Thanks for all of you for being here. Obviously you know, this has been such a difficult week discussing all of this, waiting for her attorneys to come forward."

And they're clearly weaponizing these allegations to try to hurt Kavanaugh and to derail him. And also I don't think it is unfair for him to question the veracity of the claims that Christine Ford is making. Considering the fact she doesn't remember when it happen, she doesn't remember where it happen, she doesn't remember how she got there, she doesn't remember how she got home. Yet, because of the Me Too movement we've been conditioned and so you just automatically believe her claims simply because she is a woman. And I think that is dangerous and wrong. We need to treat each of these things by looking at the facts. And unfortunately, there are no facts and evidence here. And furthermore, after 30 years, the only evidence or anything written down was by her therapist that contradicts what she's saying now. And the witnesses that she has named have all said that this never or at least they don't recall any sort of incident ever happening. So I think it is perfectly fair and actually I find it dangerous that more people aren't questioning the validity of her allegations considering the fact that there is nothing there. There is nothing to support which she--"

And what I think is really interesting as well is the New York Times and CNN both ran a piece today talking about Christine Ford's background and that she's scared of flying and that's why they had to delay. She did an internship apparently at the University of Hawaii. How exactly did she get there? This is just a delay tactic, and so if Kavanaugh is not ultimately nominated - I mean, or he's not ultimately confirmed, this is just going to impact the midterms where I think the American families want to vote their values, they want to preserve and protect the Constitution.

It was the first year of the woman in 1992. We are already talking about how this could be the year of the woman, record number of women are running in midterms, that is 45 days from now. The Republicans on the Hill have been so careful, Martha, as you mentioned, to walk a fine line to look empathetic, to try and give her ability to state her case. And judge Kavanaugh to defend herself. Donald Trump, who has been accused by over a dozen women of everything from rape to sexual assault and sexual harassment, is not the person Republicans want on the Hill want coming out and stepping into this firestorm. They are trying to walk a very fine line where women, independent women, are fired up. In every poll, they are moving away from the Republican Party.

And tonight's rally like last nights in Vegas, it's all about Republicans holding on to the Senate in the midterm elections. Possibly even adding a seat or two to their majority. Missouri is one of their top targets to make that happen. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill is in one of the toughest re-election battles in the country against state's attorney general Josh Hawley. Now President Trump won Missouri by 19 points and he's hoping his popularity will help energize voters to get them out to vote for Holly in November. McCaskill is a moderate Democrat in an increasingly red state. She's one of 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in states that president won. He's hoping to get voters out to support Holly six weeks from now. Martha?"

As Garrett was saying, this is one of 10 Senate seats that we're watching very closely because it is a red state. Claire McCaskill has been in office there for some time. She's hoping for another round in the Senate. Josh Hawley, her attorney general, is hoping that he can get that seat from her and build on that Trump momentum from the 2016 election where as Garrett said he's ahead by 19 points. This race is pretty much neck and neck if you look at most of the reads on it, it is going to be a tossup at this point as most of those 10 states are. So Democrats would need two states to flip the Senate in their direction. They would need to clear two states. And the GOP hopes that they'll make big gains in the Senate in order to increase their lead, which the president has said it so tiny small makes it impossible to get a lot of things done. So he is there to ramp up the crowd. And of course one of the main reasons, that we want to listen to some of his comments tonight is because he has been really a lot more out there on the issue of Brett Kavanaugh today in terms of his strident take in his tweets this morning towards Brett Kavanaugh's accuser asking why she hasn't come forward with her FBI files."

Thirty percent chance that they take the Senate back, and I hear that from a lot of Republican who are saying that what's going on with Dr. Ford is just a delay tactic so that maybe we can get the majority back in the Senate and have the possibility of getting a liberal justice down the line. I personally don't see us winning the Senate. I think it's going to be very tight margin as the president said, you know, if someone has a cold, we won't get our votes through. But it definitely the Rod Rosenstein story, it's not -- it certainly feeds the president's argument that he's been making all along, even though Rosenstein has categorically denied that's even said today I never said anything about the 25th amendment nor do I think that he should be removed. But the president has a lot of fodder for this rally tonight for sure. And a lot of legitimate things than he can talk about.

I had a piece about this, this afternoon, I mean, the relationship because of the power of the deputy attorney general, especially in relation to the Russian investigation and the importance of having a judicial branch that can command the respect of the American people that has to be an investigation. But critically there are a lot of questions here about political modification and perhaps leading the story. Andy McCabe must obviously, former FBI acting director under investigation. Others in the Department of Justice, perhaps leaking this as a way to delegitimize Rod Rosenstein, and perhaps play into the president's hand in terms of giving an excuse to get rid of him. We don't know, we need to know. I think the fortunate thing here is unlike so many of these investigations when we do get a look into this because I think we well, because it is such a powerful allegation, it would be resolved relatively quickly because the DOJ, the Department of Justice, will know exactly who's in that room the New York Times reports on because they take a list of all those names.
