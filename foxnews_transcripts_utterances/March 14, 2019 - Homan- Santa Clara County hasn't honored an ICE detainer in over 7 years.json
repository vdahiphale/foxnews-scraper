      "speaker": "LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST",
      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Tonight, we are going to decode the real reason for the elites love affair with skateboarder, turned punk rocker, turned Congressman, turned presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. And whose invisible hands may be behind the entire effort? My “Angle” explains. And later with news breaking today that Google may be aiding the Chinese military. I asked and answered this question. Why aren't American corporations more patriotic? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, we have a Fox News Alert. In an “Ingraham Angle” exclusive we have more details about illegal alien Carlos Arevalo-Carranza who is arrested for the brutal murder of Bambi Larson in San Jose, California. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Earlier today, “The Ingraham Angle” was contacted by an anonymous source with knowledge of the case. This person obtained, what they said, was the copy of the DHS immigration detainer notice of the action dated October 9, 2018 for Carranza. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And after we got our hands on this document, we verified its authenticity directly with DHS officials. Now remember, the county has insisted all along that they are not at fault for the fact that Carranza was not detained or deported prior to the killing. They even went so far as to blame ICE for the release of this suspect. However, as you can see clearly here, the detainer is not stamped, quote is stamped \"Not Honored for County Policy\", indicating that it was the sanctuary city status that was directly at fault for this crime and for the man being on the loose. Obviously, it wouldn't have been here to commit the crime if he had been detained by ICE and deported out of the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now tonight, we can also tell you that DHS just confirmed to us - just shortly before this show went to air that the suspect was not only in the country illegally, but had left and then re-entered after he claimed asylum and passed that initial credible fear screening in an interview with border officials. Now we learned this shocking information just hours after a bipartisan majority in Congress rejected the President's emergency border declaration. And we have to be clear here, Trump's declaration would not change current asylum laws, which are simply put - I have gone through this countless times on this show, pathetically easy to game. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But a wall, which he does want, and which we need, does help with the overall flow of the illegals, the prioritization of the Border Patrol officials and also of course sends a very strong message to those wanting to come into this country for reasons that are criminal, fraudulent or otherwise. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now joining me now on an all-star panel to break this all down every aspect political, national security, legal and so forth, in this “Ingraham Angle” exclusive is Paul Kelly. He's the President of the San Jose Police Officers Association; Tom Homan Former Acting ICE Director and Fox News Contributor; Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; and Democratic Strategist Monique Pressley and Byron York is with us, Chief Political Correspondent at the Washington Examiner, also a Fox News Contributor. All right, Paul, I got to start with you, because the gall of the county officials in San Jose to turn around and try to blame ICE, when we just showed the audience that their stamp was on that document, is it stunning, are you surprised?",

She - I guess, she had a pet, and they found her there. He left her there, obviously for death.

OK. Don't stand on your high horse about the Constitution when Congress delegated the authority to the legislature - to the President to declare a national emergency in the 1970s. It is an emergency every time a parent or son or daughter or a child is raped or brutally assaulted or in this case murdered. And I'm done - these Republicans, I have no words for them tonight. No words at all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it disgusts me and the blame-shifting to ICE, by these Democrats, like \"Oh, ICE\" is like committing hate crimes, Tom, come on. I'm sorry. I'm torqued off about this tonight.",

I mean this President is doing his job. He's keeping his promise. He wants to secure the nation, protect American people. I thought that was a #1 responsibility of Congress. But apparently for 12, it isn't. And I want to add one more thing. I mean, I need to add one more thing on the detainer. The detainer thing, just so you know, this isn't the first time.

Come on, I mean, this could be an O'Rourke's expression of kind of his inner desire to be - I don't know a conductor of the Philharmonic. No, no, as Jim Geraghty rightly observed today, if Beto had an \"R\" after his name instead of a \"D\", you'd hear - all you'd hear was boarding school attending judge's son who dodged serious charges for the DUI and burglary used eminent domain to gentrify poor Latino neighborhoods, and married into a billionaires family. That's kind of the Beto background in a nutshell. But before we dismiss Beto as a pretty boy and an empty hat, don't miss the larger strategy here. The idea in Democratic circles is to put Texas in play, create enough excitement around Beto that the Democrats are able to flip the Lone Star State from red to blue or at least tie up a lot of Trump's resources in Texas. That Republicans don't want to waste a lot of time or money in Texas, they got a lot of other states to canvass. But if you can tie them up in Texas, because of Beto's popularity either on the top of the ticket or is number two that could pose real problems for the Republicans. But is Beto ready to be President of the United States? Well, maybe not, but again being VP he could deliver this state he lost once before, maybe. But that may be a bet the Democrats are willing to take, because if you win Texas in 2020, you win it all. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now with reaction, Lieutenant Governor of the great state of Texas, Dan Patrick. He's someone who has long warned against the Dems' push into the Lone Star State.

And we'll bring you the details as we get them. And we have another story tonight we have to get to, compelling as it is, because we're going to ask a question we don't ask really enough, or at all -- patriotism and corporate America. Is there a role for patriotism in corporate America, or are we all just globalists now? We don't ask this question lightly, but given two recent developments there seems to be a corporate class intent on selling out Americans to China in order to further line their own pockets. The latest two cases involve companies that you've all heard of. OK. The two G's, Google and Goldman Sachs. But first let's look at Google. Last year they were forced to shelve a censored search engine in China after scrutiny from the media and some inside their own country. But even after that, Google decided to reject some of the Pentagon's recent product contracts while at the same time they are reconsidering these projects in China. So if picking Chinese over American dollars wasn't bad enough, listen to how Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joe Dunford said Google is aiding Chinese forces.",

      "utterance": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Tonight, we are going to decode the real reason for the elites love affair with skateboarder, turned punk rocker, turned Congressman, turned presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. And whose invisible hands may be behind the entire effort? My “Angle” explains. And later with news breaking today that Google may be aiding the Chinese military. I asked and answered this question. Why aren't American corporations more patriotic? But first, we have a Fox News Alert. In an “Ingraham Angle” exclusive we have more details about illegal alien Carlos Arevalo-Carranza who is arrested for the brutal murder of Bambi Larson in San Jose, California. Earlier today, “The Ingraham Angle” was contacted by an anonymous source with knowledge of the case. This person obtained, what they said, was the copy of the DHS immigration detainer notice of the action dated October 9, 2018 for Carranza. And after we got our hands on this document, we verified its authenticity directly with DHS officials. Now remember, the county has insisted all along that they are not at fault for the fact that Carranza was not detained or deported prior to the killing. They even went so far as to blame ICE for the release of this suspect. However, as you can see clearly here, the detainer is not stamped, quote is stamped \"Not Honored for County Policy\", indicating that it was the sanctuary city status that was directly at fault for this crime and for the man being on the loose. Obviously, it wouldn't have been here to commit the crime if he had been detained by ICE and deported out of the country. Now tonight, we can also tell you that DHS just confirmed to us - just shortly before this show went to air that the suspect was not only in the country illegally, but had left and then re-entered after he claimed asylum and passed that initial credible fear screening in an interview with border officials. Now we learned this shocking information just hours after a bipartisan majority in Congress rejected the President's emergency border declaration. And we have to be clear here, Trump's declaration would not change current asylum laws, which are simply put - I have gone through this countless times on this show, pathetically easy to game. But a wall, which he does want, and which we need, does help with the overall flow of the illegals, the prioritization of the Border Patrol officials and also of course sends a very strong message to those wanting to come into this country for reasons that are criminal, fraudulent or otherwise. Now joining me now on an all-star panel to break this all down every aspect political, national security, legal and so forth, in this “Ingraham Angle” exclusive is Paul Kelly. He's the President of the San Jose Police Officers Association; Tom Homan Former Acting ICE Director and Fox News Contributor; Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; and Democratic Strategist Monique Pressley and Byron York is with us, Chief Political Correspondent at the Washington Examiner, also a Fox News Contributor. All right, Paul, I got to start with you, because the gall of the county officials in San Jose to turn around and try to blame ICE, when we just showed the audience that their stamp was on that document, is it stunning, are you surprised?"

Four months before Bambi was murdered, all they had to do was pick up the phone and call authorities, and that didn't happen and now we're here today. Let me tell you that it's simple for us. The American police officer thinks, if you commit a violent crime and you're indicted and you're undocumented, you do your time and then you're deported."

She - I guess, she had a pet, and they found her there. He left her there, obviously for death. And she would be alive today. Tom Homan, you and I on so many occasions on this show have brought these types stories to light. And when I hear these Republicans, we're going to put their faces up on national television right now, because I'm not even bothered of the Democrats, because we know what they think. But these Republicans, 12 of them, who voted against national emergency declaration, should be ashamed of themselves tonight. OK. Don't stand on your high horse about the Constitution when Congress delegated the authority to the legislature - to the President to declare a national emergency in the 1970s. It is an emergency every time a parent or son or daughter or a child is raped or brutally assaulted or in this case murdered. And I'm done - these Republicans, I have no words for them tonight. No words at all. And it disgusts me and the blame-shifting to ICE, by these Democrats, like \"Oh, ICE\" is like committing hate crimes, Tom, come on. I'm sorry. I'm torqued off about this tonight."

I've said it many times before, a lot of these Republicans - well, we don't want to back it up, because we're afraid the Democratic President future would do it. They've already done it. That's where DACA came from. President Obama went around Congress, gave amnesty to 800,000 people. So it's - so they got to stop playing nice and support this President. I mean this President is doing his job. He's keeping his promise. He wants to secure the nation, protect American people. I thought that was a #1 responsibility of Congress. But apparently for 12, it isn't. And I want to add one more thing. I mean, I need to add one more thing on the detainer. The detainer thing, just so you know, this isn't the first time.

In the Vanity Fair piece we learned that Beto was with former White House speechwriter Ben Rhodes and President Obama on a trip when his was a Congressman to Asia in support of the TPP. And then there was former Obama White House Op staffer, Emmett Beliveau, who was hired by O'Rourke to organize a really big rally in Austin where Willie Nelson performed, cool. And Beliveau, let's not forget, was the guy who produced that spectacular Obama victory rally in Chicago on election night in 2008 when Brad and Angelina and Oprah, weren't they all crying then. So in Beto, the Obama machine liked what it saw. He had that homespun earnest appeal combined with a cool factor from the Lone Star State, no less, kind of like a white Obama. What a story. Beto raised a record $80 million in its failed Senate bid against Ted Cruz and a lot of that money, I bet, came from Obama supporters. And there's also the fact that he met with Obama himself just a week after he lost that race to Cruz, according to Vanity Fair. So was that meeting the kissing of the ring? No we don't know. Only thing except that Obama told Beto, according to the piece, that Beto should think hard about how this will all affect his family and whether there's actually a path to victory. And you will recall who the first big celebrity to encourage Beto to run for President on our national talk show, well, who was that? That would be Oprah."

Arroyo is going to handle that. The President I think - they think about it, he might be a little too hard on Beto. Come on, I mean, this could be an O'Rourke's expression of kind of his inner desire to be - I don't know a conductor of the Philharmonic. No, no, as Jim Geraghty rightly observed today, if Beto had an \"R\" after his name instead of a \"D\", you'd hear - all you'd hear was boarding school attending judge's son who dodged serious charges for the DUI and burglary used eminent domain to gentrify poor Latino neighborhoods, and married into a billionaires family. That's kind of the Beto background in a nutshell. But before we dismiss Beto as a pretty boy and an empty hat, don't miss the larger strategy here. The idea in Democratic circles is to put Texas in play, create enough excitement around Beto that the Democrats are able to flip the Lone Star State from red to blue or at least tie up a lot of Trump's resources in Texas. That Republicans don't want to waste a lot of time or money in Texas, they got a lot of other states to canvass. But if you can tie them up in Texas, because of Beto's popularity either on the top of the ticket or is number two that could pose real problems for the Republicans. But is Beto ready to be President of the United States? Well, maybe not, but again being VP he could deliver this state he lost once before, maybe. But that may be a bet the Democrats are willing to take, because if you win Texas in 2020, you win it all. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now with reaction, Lieutenant Governor of the great state of Texas, Dan Patrick. He's someone who has long warned against the Dems' push into the Lone Star State.

I'm torqued up over his comments, quite frankly. Every life is valuable. And you know what she said earlier, and this is how Beto thinks. We should pursue every murder. In America, actually we do. If a woman is killed or raped, we actually have detectives and police who go out and pursue it and they arrest people and we put them in jail. If they're found guilty they stay in jail. They stay in jail. But if you're here illegally, we'll let you out. We'll just let you out. It doesn't matter if you raped --"

He joins me now exclusively, along with FOX News contributor Sara Carter, who has been covering the Democrats' growing problem in this arena.

But then, of course, she still should have condemned anti-Semitism per se, but she didn't do it. Now, either she's not capable, or it's because she has caucuses. It was the Black Caucus.

I think what's happened here, and I agree with the rabbi, especially within the Democratic Party, Laura, it's like they have tried to normalize anti- Semitism, right? They haven't -- in fact, it's like they have watered it down so much so that you can't say you're anti-Semitic without having somebody scream back, you know you're against the Palestinians. You don't like Muslims. That's why you're calling me anti-Semitic. I never thought I would see such a flip-flop. And I think these stories are so important."

There is another aspect to this that goes beyond Pelosi on college campuses. It's sadly become the breeding grounds for anti-Israel sentiment and anti-Semitic sentiment. The latest example, students and faculty at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, are currently really angry that the college offers trips to a university in Israel. And they are even getting support from one of the newest Dem members, Rashida Tlaib, big surprise there. They voted tonight, and we have the tweet, this was tonight's vote.

We're getting some reports that a man reportedly fired on hundreds of worshippers at Friday prayers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. Citing sources, at least 30 people were injured or killed. We're being told that the shooter livestreamed the shooting, wearing all black as he entered the mosque. And we'll bring you the details as we get them. And we have another story tonight we have to get to, compelling as it is, because we're going to ask a question we don't ask really enough, or at all -- patriotism and corporate America. Is there a role for patriotism in corporate America, or are we all just globalists now? We don't ask this question lightly, but given two recent developments there seems to be a corporate class intent on selling out Americans to China in order to further line their own pockets. The latest two cases involve companies that you've all heard of. OK. The two G's, Google and Goldman Sachs. But first let's look at Google. Last year they were forced to shelve a censored search engine in China after scrutiny from the media and some inside their own country. But even after that, Google decided to reject some of the Pentagon's recent product contracts while at the same time they are reconsidering these projects in China. So if picking Chinese over American dollars wasn't bad enough, listen to how Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Joe Dunford said Google is aiding Chinese forces."

Mike Pillsbury, of course, the author of the \"The Hundred-Year Marathon\" on China. Mike, it's surprising to either you or me, because we've been following this for so many years.

What about China? China is ahead of us right now on artificial intelligence. MIT is trying to make up the difference quick. They're going to start this new thing at MIT.

Mike Pillsbury, I think this is why Reagan didn't trust big corporations. Neither did Margaret Thatcher. They like the small businesses, medium size companies, where it was more based on the traditions and understanding of America. They were always suspicious, and I think with good reason.
