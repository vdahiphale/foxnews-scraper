So today, among other places that you saw him, Joe Biden was also on the street outside his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Here he is with a film crew. Which looks like a pretty good indicator that he is, indeed, about to announce that he is running. A bio video will likely tell the tale of his blue-collar roots. His father who cleaned furnaces for a living and told his son, \"The measure of a man is not how often he is knocked down, but how quickly he gets up.\" So, Biden has clearly been knocked down a few times this week and the question is will he get up and stay up? Today, yet another woman came forward to say that in retrospect, this picture, which she once treasured; taken at the 2016 Oscars of the V.P. and her. She is an advocate for sexual assault survivors. Now she says when she looks at it, it gives her, \"a sense of shame and belittlement. Also today, Biden attempted some humor about the whole thing."

They think you're too old, your time has passed, and you're not where the energy of the base is, or the money. Karl Rove and Ash Scoud join me in moments.

He wasted no time addressing it in front of a large crowd. Here, a union crowd he's been speaking in front of unions for years, so, he was on friendly turf. The crowd laughed and cheered when he gave those hugs on stage. But it was after the event where Biden became more subdued in impromptu gaggle with reporters."

I think -- first of all, he was slow, he got attacked on Friday, and it took him really until Wednesday and Thursday to sort of get his act together. And then, today, you know, maybe you could say that the first throwaway line was funny. But the second one with the child, I don't think -- you know. Your eerie is that where you are on Wednesday and Thursday which is, I get it, I shouldn't be doing this, and I made on people uncomfortable, I didn't intend to do that. I understand norms have changed, and I endeavor to do better, or you don't. And today seemed like a step back for him."

    {
      "speaker": "ASHE SCHOW, SENIOR EDITOR, THE DAILY WIRE",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, Joe Biden has been on this since the beginning. I mean, it was the Obama administration that had their Department of Education put out new rules, saying, you know, the students on college campuses don't really have due process rights. They supported the affirmative consent movement. That's basically, if you want to touch anyone, really for any reason, you have to ask their permission first. So, this is just all coming around for Joe Biden. And I really can't feel sorry for him on this. I mean, it's on us campaign, believe women, affirmative consent. These were all things that came up in the Obama administration and Joe Biden was the one that was there at the Oscars. That's there at every awards ceremony, saying, \"We need to take this issue seriously. I take this issue seriously.\" Meanwhile, we had all these photos and videos of him clearly not taking the issue seriously or, at least, he didn't think it applied to him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Karl, let me ask you about the piece that I mentioned that Peggy Noonan wrote. Because I heard you say earlier today -- you know, it's going to be obviously his own decision. But, does she make points in there about what's going on in this environment and whether or not he is going to be the guy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, she made -- she made some excellent points. Has -- and then a big questions that he's got to face. Is the Democratic Party now moved beyond him, and moved to the left? Is it -- is he past his time? Everybody has an expiration date for their political careers. Is he beyond his expiration date? What's interesting is we don't hear that about Elizabeth Warren and about Bernie Sanders who are roughly the same age. But, yes, he's -- does he face some issues? You bet he does. On the other hand, he does bring some strengths. We saw partly today. Strong support among unions. In the polling, he runs number one. He has a seven-point lead in the real clear politics average and runs well among less liberal and moderate Democrats. And does exceedingly well against -- among African-American Democrats. 44 percent in the recent Quinnipiac Poll of African-American Democrats support him. So, you can chart a path to victory for him. But in this election, more than probable any in our lifetime, the day by day performance of candidates is going to matter in determining the outcome."

Will he be able to actually pick off any? I'm not sure. And I honestly don't think so. Because in 2016, had the DNC not kept Bernie from being the nominee. He might have been able to beat Trump. But now, people who may have been Bernie supporters such as working-class Americans, even union people. They've now had -- you know, three years of Trump. They will have had four years of Trump. They've got the tax cuts, they've manufacturing jobs coming back."

Capital One responded that they are preserving the records but that \"Given the confidentiality obligations that we have as a financial institution including under state and federal law, we respectfully request that any production of materials be made pursuant to a subpoena rather than an informal request.

You know, no that's not going to work. That doesn't work for us. We want it with absolutely no redactions. I mean, why not just wait? As you say, why not just wait until it comes and then see what you get. And if you don't get everything you want, then you go to the next level."

And as soon -- and also from what we understand Robert Mueller and attorney general -- Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein are also very closely involved in this whole process of getting this document ready to turn it over and it's only really a matter of days.

There's no reason to hold up this report for one millisecond and delivering it to the certain committees that are requesting it and deal with this information on an ongoing basis. In addition, we know that Mueller already in in giving the report had positioned the report with information that could be immediately disseminated because he had already taken the trouble to redact it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROUDA",
      "utterance": "Well, for me I guess the question is what is the Attorney General afraid of that the public might learn by providing this report unredacted to Congress to committees who deal with confidential information on a regular basis? What are they trying to hide?"

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Even the summaries oftentimes referenced grand jury information based on reporting I've seen. But the macro problem is that Democrats are dealing with the consequences of their own eroding credibility. How can Democrats say that we just need members of Congress to be able to look at intelligence and information and then cast their opinions or views on it when for the last 22 months, Adam Schiff and other Democrats have been saying that they had actual evidence, that they had cold hard evidence of collusion and there is no dispute, Martha, as to the conclusion of the Mueller report, that there was no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. I've looked at that reporting carefully, Martha, and it seems to suggest that there were members of the Mueller team that believed that the question about obstruction of justice should have been left up to Congress rather than the Attorney General. That's no surprise to me because the because Mr. Mueller populated his team with people who had worked for the Clinton Foundation, were partisan supporters of Hillary Clinton's campaign. and so it would be likely to have a difference of opinion. But there is no reporting or no evidence of any difference of opinion as to the principal question of collusion with Russia. And you know even the member of Congress you just had on, Mr. Rouda, he said that when Republicans stood up for the State of the Union and applauded the President, that we were literally applauding collusion. So I think there's a lot of crow for Democrats to eat and it's a tough time for them to have to make the argument that if you just give everything to Congress, the American people can trust Congress because it was Democratic members of Congress that weren't telling the truth."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",

Planning for it actually started under the Obama administration but it was funded and built during the Trump administration. And this is the kind of wall the President Trump would like to see across most of the southern border. Now, this stretch is just about two miles long but President Trump announced today that he expects to have 400 miles in two years. That's despite a new lawsuit from 20 states led by California challenging his national emergency declaration to fund it. Speaking today to Border Patrol and Immigration officials, the President noted a 400 percent increase in the apprehensions of family units here in the El Centro border sector from January and February of this year to the same time last year. And his critics say it's a sign that his hardline immigration policies aren't working. But the President argues that that's exactly why those policies are needed now more than ever."

I'm not sure if this is Rio Grande in this spot or not and then they're climbing up the other side. And the other piece of video, and Congressman Biggs, you know, I know you've seen this firsthand, I mean, these people are climbing through a tunnel of barbed wire coming out of the dirt on the other side of a fence.

And I think all of our hearts go to these people who want to come here so badly but they are not doing it the right way. They are trying to intersect themselves -- put themselves ahead of other people who have been waiting in line literally years to get in here. But the problem that we face is if you don't build the wall and you don't change asylum laws and some of the other issues that we have. We will continue to be overrun because we will not have put the deterrent in effect. And that's the problem. Is, we are incentivizing people to come here.

There is no -- they can't even cover the number of people who are coming in terms of housing and taking care of all of them once they get here so something has to, you know, stop the migration at this moment until they can figure this whole thing out."

That's the most expensive, least effective way to deal with this. Do we shut down the border? That's not going to work. Do we cut aid to the countries where these migrants are coming from?
