Short time ago Tate Reeves, tweeting, President Biden said allowing Mississippians to decide how to protect themselves as Neanderthal thinking recipients don't need handlers. As numbers drop, they can assess their choices and listen to experts. I guess I just think we should trust Americans, not insult them. With that, let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment Inclusion Capital, Morgan Ortagus, former State Department Spokesperson and Jonah Goldberg, Editor in Chief of the Dispatch. Morgan, let me start with you. Welcome back, first of all, and your thoughts about this. And obviously, it's important to point out while Texas is lifting the mandatory mask mandate, it is not saying that you're not going to wear masks or businesses couldn't say we want to have masks in our business?",

It's what you're seeing going on at the border, just as the senator alluded to. There are reports, media reports today about some of these illegal immigrants coming across the border, testing positive for COVID-19. So this is not only turning into an immigration issue, which is very contentious in the country, we now have potentially a public health issue as well. And I think when you're seeing law abiding citizens and citizens of other countries coming to the United States and abiding by the rules and taking a COVID test, it's nonsensical to people that illegal immigrants would cross the border without taking that COVID test. So there's certainly a lot to unpack in Texas today. You're seeing many of these people within the state stand up for themselves. And it's the nature of Texas, I think, the push to push back into the federal government, but we do have some very serious public health issues in Texas.

Texas ranks 48 out of 50 in terms of people being vaccinated, less than 7% of the state is. So if we were at a point rebel, we're talking about half the state were vaccinated and he wanted to remove this mandate. I think there might be a different mood, might be a different feeling. I think it's important to know that the President unlike someone, maybe the former presidents not saying we're going to withhold money from anybody because they choose not to do this. I think that the President Biden probably used the wrong choice of words of Neanderthal today, but I just don't think it's smart with the governors of Mississippi and Texas are doing if their vaccination rates were higher, I'd say maybe it makes more sense.

At the same time, I think that the Governor Abbott, you know, is basically a part of this as a cynical thing about changing the subject from the blackouts not too long ago.

But obviously, there's a pattern of behavior there because there's one -- more than one woman that has had this experience, and the pattern of behavior, by the way, I would say extends beyond just this scandal. You know, there are journalists that have told their stories of what it's like the intimidating behavior from the governor and his staff when covering them. And then, of course, you know, we have seen that his staff has admitted hiding mishandling information related to the nursing home scandal. So again, I think it fits this larger pattern of behavior of intimidating behavior whenever you're covering Governor Cuomo, whenever you're interacting with him.

It would create automatic voter registration across the country simplified voting by mail and expand early and absentee voting. Democrats said the bill counteracts 253 \"voter suppression\" initiatives being considered by legislators in 43 states. Republicans say this is a pure power grab by Democrats and likely will be legally challenged. When we come back, the panel on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's apologies, President Biden's COVID warnings and the border Patrol's concerns about a surge on the southern border."

      "utterance": "President Biden has a lot of problems to take care of. It's got a crisis at the border that he calls a challenge and not a crisis, dismantling all of our immigration laws and protections to protect our border. And so I don't think he's got a lot to say about preaching to my state about how we've handled this COVID-19 virus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Senator John Cornyn there, reacting to the question that was asked to the President about Texas and Governor Greg Abbott, there lifting the mask mandate as of next week, the governor of Mississippi has weighed in tonight as well. Short time ago Tate Reeves, tweeting, President Biden said allowing Mississippians to decide how to protect themselves as Neanderthal thinking recipients don't need handlers. As numbers drop, they can assess their choices and listen to experts. I guess I just think we should trust Americans, not insult them. With that, let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment Inclusion Capital, Morgan Ortagus, former State Department Spokesperson and Jonah Goldberg, Editor in Chief of the Dispatch. Morgan, let me start with you. Welcome back, first of all, and your thoughts about this. And obviously, it's important to point out while Texas is lifting the mandatory mask mandate, it is not saying that you're not going to wear masks or businesses couldn't say we want to have masks in our business?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN ORTAGUS, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN",
      "utterance": "That's right. And I think there is super spreader news coming out of Texas today. But it's not about Governor Abbott's announcement. It's what you're seeing going on at the border, just as the senator alluded to. There are reports, media reports today about some of these illegal immigrants coming across the border, testing positive for COVID-19. So this is not only turning into an immigration issue, which is very contentious in the country, we now have potentially a public health issue as well. And I think when you're seeing law abiding citizens and citizens of other countries coming to the United States and abiding by the rules and taking a COVID test, it's nonsensical to people that illegal immigrants would cross the border without taking that COVID test. So there's certainly a lot to unpack in Texas today. You're seeing many of these people within the state stand up for themselves. And it's the nature of Texas, I think, the push to push back into the federal government, but we do have some very serious public health issues in Texas. And I think it's less about Governor Abbott and more about the border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Harold, your thoughts, you know, the President is sending a signal. He wears the mask all the time while he's in the Oval Office there. When talking to the press, at least, he's been vaccinated. There are people who just I think, wonder if I'm going to get the vaccine, eventually, am I not going to wear a mask? And when is that? And shouldn't Texas -- shouldn't Americans be able to decide when that is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR., FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely, Americans should be able to make that determination. I think the governor should be able to weigh in heavily as well. But -- in Governor Reeves and Mississippi and Governor Abbott of Texas have that right to do so. I think part of the frustration, perhaps from President Biden is that there's some numbers, you have to pay attention to. Texas ranks 48 out of 50 in terms of people being vaccinated, less than 7% of the state is. So if we were at a point rebel, we're talking about half the state were vaccinated and he wanted to remove this mandate. I think there might be a different mood, might be a different feeling. I think it's important to know that the President unlike someone, maybe the former presidents not saying we're going to withhold money from anybody because they choose not to do this. I think that the President Biden probably used the wrong choice of words of Neanderthal today, but I just don't think it's smart with the governors of Mississippi and Texas are doing if their vaccination rates were higher, I'd say maybe it makes more sense. But not to be four out of 50 and say let's stop now. It's probably not the right time to do that."

    {
      "speaker": "JONAH GOLDBERG, THE DISPATCH",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, I came here tonight to defend the Neanderthal. The latest science says that they are actually quite intelligent. But more importantly, look, I think this is -- people are on both sides of the argument are kind of making too big a deal about this. I went and looked on various Texas websites, most big businesses, most supermarkets, most movie theaters, hospitals, airports, bus stations, train stations, they're all still going to require wearing masks, people have been habituated to it. At the same time, I think that the Governor Abbott, you know, is basically a part of this as a cynical thing about changing the subject from the blackouts not too long ago. But he's probably right on the merits. People are going to -- people can take care of themselves. We learned from Florida that most of the lockdown stuff was unwarranted and uncalled for. And I think that both sides are trying to make it into a much bigger deal than it really is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right, a big deal today was the New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, with a press conference apologizing. Here's a piece of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK GOVERNOR",
      "utterance": "I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. It was unintentional. And I truly and deeply apologize for it. I never touched anyone, inappropriately. I wasn't elected by politicians. I was elected by the people of the state of New York. I'm not going to resign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES TRUSTY, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Lawyers are right, you know that he needs to shut up. There is really nothing a prosecutor or a plaintiff's attorney likes more than a defendant who keeps running his mouth. He's got this title seven hostile environment thing, you know, flaming up in front of him with his own help."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Morgan, what do you think of this apology, we should note he didn't apologize to about the nursing home controversy that he's also embroiled in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, as a woman, it really struck me whenever he said, I never touched anyone inappropriately. When we looked at the pictures that came out of the woman telling her story where the governor had his hands on her face, I think so many women in business and politics have unfortunately been there where a man, more senior than them has used his intimidating presence, in a way, you know, the touching of the cheek may not seem like a big deal to him. But obviously, there's a pattern of behavior there because there's one -- more than one woman that has had this experience, and the pattern of behavior, by the way, I would say extends beyond just this scandal. You know, there are journalists that have told their stories of what it's like the intimidating behavior from the governor and his staff when covering them. And then, of course, you know, we have seen that his staff has admitted hiding mishandling information related to the nursing home scandal. So again, I think it fits this larger pattern of behavior of intimidating behavior whenever you're covering Governor Cuomo, whenever you're interacting with him. And really the left is the one that have set the standards for what's you know, appropriate from politicians from other democrat politicians from Kavanaugh and I don't think Cuomo is meeting the standards that Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and other women have set in the Democrat Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Jonah, a couple tweets in recent days as this thing was continuing to bubble up, Tara Reid tweeted out, I stand with both women coming forward about Cuomo's behavior. I've supported Lindsey Boylan for a while. She was responding to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I exist, I endured a sexual assault from Joe Biden while I worked as a staff and then smears in silence. Your silence regarding me, the sheer hypocrisy breaks my heart. A former Political Strategist, former Clinton adviser tweeting, Peter Daou, if you're tweeting about Cuomo, but gave Biden a free pass, it's not about the principles. It's about the politics. MeToo isn't there for your political convenience. I guess, you know, people how they've reacted to different allegations coming up again and again and these days."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "Yeah, that cuts way -- that cuts in all sorts of different ways, including for, you know, President Trump. But I think the remarkable thing about this is that this is an entirely a democratic scandal, democratic problem in a democratic state with a democratic governor, democratic legislature, who supported basically by the democratic favorable press, and everyone else is just sort of, you know, let when your opponents are tearing themselves apart, stay out of the way. And I think that's the smartest thing that a lot of Republicans can do."

      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "Look these allegations are serious, the allegations around a nursing home, and perhaps things they may have done narrative that have alleged to have done their or even probably more serious in some ways. I've said on this show these investigations, and they're now number of them, the New York U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and now the New York Attorney General, if any of the things the governor is saying if they're facts that countered that they've come out, he will find himself in a different set of trouble."
