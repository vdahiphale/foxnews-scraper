      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. As we have probably heard earlier in the hour, Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops into regions of Ukraine that he claims now are independent. We're going to be monitoring events there. We'll bring you an update shortly, a lot happening on the ground, but to more immediate and serious issues closer to home. Well, Canada continues its descent into tyranny, authorities even assaulting a journalist covering the protest. She joins us exclusively in moments. Plus, we also just learned that our own CDC has been hiding key data, how surprising on COVID from the public and the reasons why are truly shameful. My medicine cabinet is here. And facial underwear, maybe that's better left unseen. But Raymond Arroyo is here for a truly disgusting edition of Seen and Unseen. But first, birds of a feather. That's the focus of tonight's angle. So, two men, 29 years apart in age, one just turned 50. He's kind of the political pinup boy of the socialist set, and the other is 79 and closer to a grandfather you visit in the memory care unit. But the similarities between these two leaders and their political parties are striking. First, they both abuse their COVID powers. Now Biden's vaccine mandates which have been repeatedly blocked by our courts, it caused chaos across our economy and throughout the military even. These mandates have made the shortage of health care workers in the United States even worse, and our children have been harmed beyond measure by Biden and his party slavish devotion to the anti-science demands of teachers' unions. If Biden could be as draconian as Canada, he would have, if it wasn't for the Republican led states that ended lockdowns early and rejected a lot of these COVID mandates. But Trudeau found out that even Canadians have their limit when he imposed nonsensical vaccine and testing requirements for truckers returning from the U.S. Now what the parents rising up at school board meetings were to the Biden administration. The trucker convoys protesting the vax mandates were to Justin Trudeau's government. Now in both countries, regular working class people, they just been pushed too far by the elites who truly seem to just enjoy bossing him around. And the growing support for parents' rights here and the truckers' rights up north have brought out the worst in both leaders. Now according to the Biden DOJ, a mom who's just passionate about keeping her child's school open and speaks out against idiotic masks rules, even for outdoor sports. And she's kind of like the new al Qaeda. Our own FBI sees her as a bigger threat than the criminals running wild in the city streets, or the cartels and human traffickers operating seemingly now with impunity on our southern border. According to Trudeau and his globalist goons, the large numbers of Sikh immigrants who came out to support the Canadian truckers were basically Nazis and white supremacist, just waving swastikas. It's all disgusting, and they're all lies. But the Sikhs who are shamelessly smear just like the school board members, well, they took the high road.",

Now despite federal law enforcement trying to paint January 6th as some wide-ranging conspiracy run by insurrectionists or even potential domestic terrorists. We learned that the vast majority of defendants, this was last year by the way, were charged with misdemeanor trespassing and have no or limited criminal histories. Many are employed have stable family and community ties and many are military vets, according to the records. The more unpopular though Biden and his policies become, the more he and the Democrats return to January 6th. They're even reinstalling the fencing around the Capitol. This is costing taxpayers millions and gives our Capitol a prison, kind of prison camp like look and feel. But Pelosi and her whole crew, they don't care. It's the symbolism of that fencing that they crave to link any protest, any dissent that shows up in Washington with the rioters who stormed the Capitol. Something else that Biden and Trudeau share though, is that they both refuse to relinquish their emergency powers. They're like baby baboons clinging to their mother's underbelly. They're holding on for dear life, afraid of being eaten by the predators below, or defeated by the voters who are just sick of them. Biden just extended the National Emergency Declaration that was first issued in March of 2020 by President Trump. Keeping it going now is a complete scam, a power grab and red flag. Mark my words, in a month or so, he'll find some other bogus rationale to extend it again. Right through the midterms. And breaking, just moments ago, Canada's parliament voted to extend the emergency powers of Biden's wonder twin, Justin Trudeau, who earlier today made it clear that democracy won't be returning anytime soon.",

And afterwards, I saw - everything goes so fast, but someone shot me in my left leg with the tear gas gun. It was point blank; it was really next to my legs.

I'm deeply concerned about what they're doing to journalists that are not with the government agenda. I can't believe they actually shot our reporter. But I think what is a graver and far reaching threat is that of the social credit style approach to punishing anyone with the wrong opinions. Justin Trudeau has cleared the streets that was not hard to do. There weren't that many trucks, but he's persisting with his emergency powers, so he can seize and freeze bank accounts of anyone who's in his opposition without going to court. The police literally tell the banks which accounts to freeze and they do it, there's no legal recourse, and you're, in fact banned from suing. So, what that means is, if there's someone who's merely accused of supporting the truckers, maybe it chipped in $50 to their crowdfund, maybe you walked alongside their trucks one day, your entire family bank account is frozen. So not just you, but your wife and your kids can't get money for groceries or rent or gas. And there is no legal appeal. That is exactly the Chinese social credit system.

The seizing of these bank accounts is done in complete violation of presumption of innocence.

Here in this western Ukrainian city six hours from the capital, the remaining American diplomats have fled the country, making U.S. withdrawal from Ukraine complete. Ukrainians I've spoken to earlier tonight are very nervous and afraid of a potential full-scale Russian invasion. After recognizing the two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials say annexation like what Russia did with Crimea could be next. That would give Russia control of 13 percent of Ukraine's land. This is a crisis over 30 years in the making. Vladimir Putin has never accepted that Ukraine and Russia are two different nations. He thinks they are one people. Ukrainians here disagree. A majority want to be part of the European Union and NATO. Ever since NATO expanded to the Warsaw Pact countries of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic in 1999, Putin has felt threatened. When NATO began bombing Serbia three weeks later, Putin thought Moscow could be next. He thinks the launchers used by the U.S. military to fire defensive missile interceptors from Romania and Poland could be used to launch offensive Tomahawk cruise missiles into Russia. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union. Many Ukrainians here think he's trying to put it back together. Laura?",

So for example, if a white student tried to perpetrate a racial hoax that would in effect blame his black colleagues and students, fellow students, for having bias against him, this would be outrageous. The white student would be castigate, would be expelled, would be brought up on charges. But somehow, if the situation is reversed and it's a black perpetrator, the idea is, well, look, the black students can't be judged by the same standards as the white students. They've got to be held to a kind of lesser standard. In a sense, they are deprived of agency, of moral accountability.

As we have probably heard earlier in the hour, Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops into regions of Ukraine that he claims now are independent. We're going to be monitoring events there. We'll bring you an update shortly, a lot happening on the ground, but to more immediate and serious issues closer to home. Well, Canada continues its descent into tyranny, authorities even assaulting a journalist covering the protest. She joins us exclusively in moments. Plus, we also just learned that our own CDC has been hiding key data, how surprising on COVID from the public and the reasons why are truly shameful. My medicine cabinet is here. And facial underwear, maybe that's better left unseen. But Raymond Arroyo is here for a truly disgusting edition of Seen and Unseen. But first, birds of a feather. That's the focus of tonight's angle. So, two men, 29 years apart in age, one just turned 50. He's kind of the political pinup boy of the socialist set, and the other is 79 and closer to a grandfather you visit in the memory care unit. But the similarities between these two leaders and their political parties are striking. First, they both abuse their COVID powers. Now Biden's vaccine mandates which have been repeatedly blocked by our courts, it caused chaos across our economy and throughout the military even. These mandates have made the shortage of health care workers in the United States even worse, and our children have been harmed beyond measure by Biden and his party slavish devotion to the anti-science demands of teachers' unions. If Biden could be as draconian as Canada, he would have, if it wasn't for the Republican led states that ended lockdowns early and rejected a lot of these COVID mandates. But Trudeau found out that even Canadians have their limit when he imposed nonsensical vaccine and testing requirements for truckers returning from the U.S. Now what the parents rising up at school board meetings were to the Biden administration. The trucker convoys protesting the vax mandates were to Justin Trudeau's government. Now in both countries, regular working class people, they just been pushed too far by the elites who truly seem to just enjoy bossing him around. And the growing support for parents' rights here and the truckers' rights up north have brought out the worst in both leaders. Now according to the Biden DOJ, a mom who's just passionate about keeping her child's school open and speaks out against idiotic masks rules, even for outdoor sports. And she's kind of like the new al Qaeda. Our own FBI sees her as a bigger threat than the criminals running wild in the city streets, or the cartels and human traffickers operating seemingly now with impunity on our southern border. According to Trudeau and his globalist goons, the large numbers of Sikh immigrants who came out to support the Canadian truckers were basically Nazis and white supremacist, just waving swastikas. It's all disgusting, and they're all lies. But the Sikhs who are shamelessly smear just like the school board members, well, they took the high road."

Now despite federal law enforcement trying to paint January 6th as some wide-ranging conspiracy run by insurrectionists or even potential domestic terrorists. We learned that the vast majority of defendants, this was last year by the way, were charged with misdemeanor trespassing and have no or limited criminal histories. Many are employed have stable family and community ties and many are military vets, according to the records. The more unpopular though Biden and his policies become, the more he and the Democrats return to January 6th. They're even reinstalling the fencing around the Capitol. This is costing taxpayers millions and gives our Capitol a prison, kind of prison camp like look and feel. But Pelosi and her whole crew, they don't care. It's the symbolism of that fencing that they crave to link any protest, any dissent that shows up in Washington with the rioters who stormed the Capitol. Something else that Biden and Trudeau share though, is that they both refuse to relinquish their emergency powers. They're like baby baboons clinging to their mother's underbelly. They're holding on for dear life, afraid of being eaten by the predators below, or defeated by the voters who are just sick of them. Biden just extended the National Emergency Declaration that was first issued in March of 2020 by President Trump. Keeping it going now is a complete scam, a power grab and red flag. Mark my words, in a month or so, he'll find some other bogus rationale to extend it again. Right through the midterms. And breaking, just moments ago, Canada's parliament voted to extend the emergency powers of Biden's wonder twin, Justin Trudeau, who earlier today made it clear that democracy won't be returning anytime soon."

And I wanted to be on the frontline to see the interaction between the police officer and the protester, because it's always there, that all the action is on and as well, I wanted to see if you have any violence coming from all the protester or the police. And so, I was there reporting and my microphone, my Rebel News reach (ph) on my neck. And so, when the first shot of the gas tear gun was shot and I screamed, because I was in shock, I was like, OK, something just happened. And it started to be a little bit difficult to breathe. And afterwards, the police officer went towards the protester, and they hit me three time with the wood stick. And afterwards, I saw - everything goes so fast, but someone shot me in my left leg with the tear gas gun. It was point blank; it was really next to my legs. And so, I fell on the ground, because not only my legs were hurting, but all the gas from the canister when all over me in my thighs and in my mouth. So yes."

So, same with my press card, and they say that I made up my card, so I'm not really allowed to work freely in the perimeter. So, all the shop right now is closed.

And joining me now is Ezra Levant, publisher of Rebel News. And Mollie Hemingway, Editor-in-Chief, the Federalist, Fox News Contributor. Ezra, that was your journalist injured by the police. This is very personal to you, I know. Is there a warning that Americans should take from what Trudeau is doing up north?"

I'm deeply concerned about what they're doing to journalists that are not with the government agenda. I can't believe they actually shot our reporter. But I think what is a graver and far reaching threat is that of the social credit style approach to punishing anyone with the wrong opinions. Justin Trudeau has cleared the streets that was not hard to do. There weren't that many trucks, but he's persisting with his emergency powers, so he can seize and freeze bank accounts of anyone who's in his opposition without going to court. The police literally tell the banks which accounts to freeze and they do it, there's no legal recourse, and you're, in fact banned from suing. So, what that means is, if there's someone who's merely accused of supporting the truckers, maybe it chipped in $50 to their crowdfund, maybe you walked alongside their trucks one day, your entire family bank account is frozen. So not just you, but your wife and your kids can't get money for groceries or rent or gas. And there is no legal appeal. That is exactly the Chinese social credit system. And that could come to America just as easy as the rest of the martial law."

And what we're watching happen in Canada is horrifying on its own merits, but also because we know that this is what the regime wants to do here as well. There are multiple problems with it. The seizing of these bank accounts is done in complete violation of presumption of innocence. And that's something that both Canada and our country share is a belief, as we say that you have the right to be presumed innocent. That's not happening here. But if you don't have the right to make financial transactions, you don't have any rights at all. You don't have freedom of speech, you don't have freedom of religion, you don't have freedom to protest. This is a direct assault on democratic Republic's and from the very same people who claim that they're out to save democracy.

Even journalists, in Alexa's case and two of our other journalist, they demand to know what media company they're with and if the police in their whimsical capricious choice don't like that journalistic company or that one, they deny them access.

Among the most egregious submissions from the CDC data though, is that about vaccine and booster effectiveness in younger adults, but what's really infuriating is their lame excuse for all the secrecy, saying the agency has been reluctant to make those figures public when official said because they might be misinterpreted as the vaccines being ineffective. In other words, they didn't want the unwashed masses reaching conclusions that weren't approved by the medicrats and of course, the Left. Joining me now, Dr. Scott Jensen, who has been sounding the alarm on so much of this, physician and Minnesota Gubernatorial Candidate. And Dr. Houman Hemmati, Board Certified MD PhD research scientist. Dr. Jensen, let's start with you, you and I have known this entire time that the CDC has been hiding the ball, whether we were talking masks or now on this issue of the boosters. And you're one of the first people to point out the falsehoods about COVID mortality numbers. So, at this point, why is anyone going to trust the CDC?"

We can't politicize public health. That should be off limits to anything political, anything that's influenced by unions, by political parties, by corporations, by any outside factors. This needs to be the one federal agency that is completely and totally guided by science, by fact, and by nothing else. And two years into the pandemic, like you said, we have so much scientific fact. We have reams and reams of medical data, not from hundreds or thousands of people worldwide, billions of people worldwide. In fact, the entire world population, there's never in history, been anymore medical information than this. And for the CDC to curate the data and tell us that certain data that they have are not ready for primetime is as outlandish as Eric Garcetti, the LA mayor, when he said he was holding his breath for that photograph at the football game. It's unbelievable. It's - they owe it to us to be transparent and they have to start doing that now."

I saw that in the New York Times article, even Dr. Paul Offit who arguably is a pro-public health kind of person. He's I think embarrassed by what the CDC has done. And Laura, I think this is why you're seeing Americans rise up all across the nation, whether they are running for school board, city council. I certainly hadn't planned on running for governor, but I am doing this because I am fed up. I think Americans deserve to know when 18-to-49-year- olds aren't benefiting from vaccines. Why aren't we drawing antibodies test on these people? Why isn't the CDC saying do vitamin C, D, zinc, and get your antibodies checked, we'll help you have the information necessary so you can make a good decision?"

It's an emergency use authorization, but so is the vaccine, Dr. Hemmati. And it's like that doesn't even exist. Now, they're like, well, natural immunity actually might be relevant.

We have so much more data. And for some reason there are so many elements within the administration altogether that are just so resistant to changing based on changing data. They feel like they are admitting like they don't know what they're doing. And it's fine to say, you know what, medical science is changing. We have new data. Let's shift how we do thing.

Here in this western Ukrainian city six hours from the capital, the remaining American diplomats have fled the country, making U.S. withdrawal from Ukraine complete. Ukrainians I've spoken to earlier tonight are very nervous and afraid of a potential full-scale Russian invasion. After recognizing the two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, U.S. officials say annexation like what Russia did with Crimea could be next. That would give Russia control of 13 percent of Ukraine's land. This is a crisis over 30 years in the making. Vladimir Putin has never accepted that Ukraine and Russia are two different nations. He thinks they are one people. Ukrainians here disagree. A majority want to be part of the European Union and NATO. Ever since NATO expanded to the Warsaw Pact countries of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic in 1999, Putin has felt threatened. When NATO began bombing Serbia three weeks later, Putin thought Moscow could be next. He thinks the launchers used by the U.S. military to fire defensive missile interceptors from Romania and Poland could be used to launch offensive Tomahawk cruise missiles into Russia.

      "utterance": "This edition of their justifiable racism series takes us to Sacramento, California, with an egregious hate crime turned out to be nothing more than a race hoax. A black female student reportedly just admitted to scribbling racist graffiti at a Sacramento high school. The student wrote \"colored\" and \"white\" over two drinking fountains, which is obviously a reference to Jim Crow era segregation and meant to inflame racial intentions. But here's the wild part. While the school wants to take disciplinary action, the NAACP and other race activists want it all swept under the rug. Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator, host of \"The Dinesh D'Souza Podcast.\" Dinesh, this has happened before. This is a teenager in this case, so we don't want to blow this totally out of proportion. But gosh, if there was a different fact pattern, they probably wouldn't just laugh this off, would they?"

      "utterance": "Well, yes, I think I want to highlight the bigotry here not the student, not even of the racial hoax perpetrator, but of the left and the university and school administrators, even of the NAACP. The basic idea here is we cannot apply to blacks and other minorities the same standards that we apply to anyone else. So for example, if a white student tried to perpetrate a racial hoax that would in effect blame his black colleagues and students, fellow students, for having bias against him, this would be outrageous. The white student would be castigate, would be expelled, would be brought up on charges. But somehow, if the situation is reversed and it's a black perpetrator, the idea is, well, look, the black students can't be judged by the same standards as the white students. They've got to be held to a kind of lesser standard. In a sense, they are deprived of agency, of moral accountability. So there is a kind of deep presumption here of inferiority, at least in the manner that the students are treated not just at this school, but in racial hoaxes that are now occurring on schools and campuses across the country."

      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "Yes, this, Laura, I think goes back to, well, it goes back to the early stages of Affirmative Action. Once Affirmative Action had sort of evolved into racial preferences, the left had to make a distinction. And they made a distinction between what they called \"invidious racism,\" that is basically racism that is in favor of White House, and \"benign racism.\" And benign racism was essentially racial discrimination in favor of minorities. But benign racism was still considered to be racism. It was still a form of discrimination. Over time, the left realized, well listen, why admit that benign racism so called is racism at all? Let's just define racism in a way that only whites can do it. Let's just make racism in a sense a subset of white supremacy, and that way whatever minorities do, however targeted it is by race, we just don't even count it as racism because we define racism in a way that excludes that possibility."

But they are the ones who have done it from the beginning, and they continue to do it. But now I don't think they know what to do at this point. So they are like you're a racist. Their default answer is you are a racist."

      "utterance": "If there is one central aspect of the American creed, it's simply the idea that all men, all individuals, all humans are created equal. And the whole doctrine of colorblindness is nothing more than an application of that principle. So far from this being a divisive doctrine, it's actually the only doctrine that could conceivably unify the country. And that's the left attempting to poisonous against that ideal, that's why they are in trouble. That's why people are, in a sense, blocking, because they know that there is no way other way for the country to move forward other than to treat people, all individuals, as a minority --"
