When you look at the coverage of it, what you see is a clear divide. Local media has actually covered this story perfectly. Because what they have done, is they dig into it and said why can't the American people, who many of them are suffering, many of them who are unemployed, many of them who are trying to figure out how to make ends meet at the kitchen table, why can't they get this $2,000.

And what they elucidated is, we don't oppose more money in the pockets of Americans -- more money in the pockets of Americans who really need it, we oppose more pockets in the money of Americans who don't need it. For example, everybody who makes under $75,000, including people who haven't lost a dime of a days' wage during COVID, like hundreds of thousands of government workers.

I think that some of the media mistakes that were big were when we really started to get the facts on things like school reopening, for example, and the fact that schools were not super spreaders of this and children were kept out of school for too long. There seems to be a resistance by media to just report what was going on with that. Same thing goes for some of the lockdown measures. You're talking about outdoor dining. That was not a super spreader. That needed to be out front and center. The same thing goes for holding some of these governors accountable. There was a quick rush to hold President Trump accountable and he deserved some of that in terms of the messaging coming out of the White House on COVID-19. There was a lot of mixed messaging. But there were also a lot of problems coming from the likes of Andrew Cuomo. That guy somehow walked away with an Emmy when he was responsible for some of the worst decision making related to nursing homes. Now, he is responsible for -- look at the rollout of the vaccine in New York. They have all of these vaccines. They're not being distributed to people. Gavin Newsom has just now being held accountable by media where they're covering this, you know, recusal attempt.

At the same time, Donald Trump was good for business. I think they knew that. I think Donald Trump knew that also. He wanted to have that foil and while he played the antagonist to the media, they were sort of serving as that foil to him that he could be that punching bag. So I am not sure anyone really landed blows. I don't know if anyone changed minds when it comes to the media situation or from Donald Trump. But I will say, I think the problem was more of the self-inflicted wounds the media did to themselves over the course of the entire 2020 over a variety of stories from coronavirus to others that were related to sort of Donald Trump and politics. I think that more of it when they were trying to go after Donald Trump, it ended up being self-inflicted wounds on the media, especially the legacy media.",

And I think that one issue with making all of the coverage so Trump- centric, is you can kind of miss other of things like Congress, for example, quite ridiculous.

Mitch McConnell, Republicans draw their -- dragged their feet on it and here we sit today when Donald Trump has asked the American people - -has asked Congress to give an additional $2,000 to the American people, Mitch McConnell is standing in the way. When you look at the coverage of it, what you see is a clear divide. Local media has actually covered this story perfectly. Because what they have done, is they dig into it and said why can't the American people, who many of them are suffering, many of them who are unemployed, many of them who are trying to figure out how to make ends meet at the kitchen table, why can't they get this $2,000. And the mainstream media has made the story about this age-old battle in Washington between Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.

I think we should criticize everyone in government whenever there's something that deserves it.

And what they elucidated is, we don't oppose more money in the pockets of Americans -- more money in the pockets of Americans who really need it, we oppose more pockets in the money of Americans who don't need it. For example, everybody who makes under $75,000, including people who haven't lost a dime of a days' wage during COVID, like hundreds of thousands of government workers. What Pat Toomey said and made a great case of on our air last weekend was I want this aid to go out. I want it to be more targeted. I don't want it to go to everybody.

But now that we have a situation where the program has fallen short of its own goals which was by the end of 2020, 20 million Americans to be vaccinated. And instead it was two and a half million.

And the truth is, something that hasn't been covered very much, is that there has been issues with government bureaucracy sort of slowing our fight against this virus. Certainly, in this case, and also even back at the beginning of the pandemic with testing and there not being approval of people other than the CDC to do testing for this.

What I will say is that President Trump has made clear from day one that the way he sees this, whether it's the whole issue of preventing and treating the vaccine, whether it's regulations about mask wearing, whether it's the race to a vaccine, whether it's who makes the decisions about who gets the vaccine first, he said you guys, the states, this is up to you.

Maybe not. Maybe they'll be encouraged by more volunteers looking to watch these things. But I think, again, people are out of touch in much of the media thinking of, you know, nobody really thinks this, nothing will really happen when really there are a lot of people that really certainly do.

I will say one of the senators who signed onto this, is Senator Marsha Blackburn, I had the opportunity to interview her on our air yesterday within the hour that they announced this new effort. And one of the things I asked her was what they hoped to accomplish out of it by delaying 10 days with an audit. And she said to me, one of her first answers was well, you know, Gillian, there has been resistance to President Trump and never-Trumpers in Washington, driving policy against his agenda this entire time. And I stopped her right here and I said, so is this political retribution? And she then said, no, of course not. And went on to explain herself. I think what the media is underestimating here is the opportunity that Republicans are seeing in this politically to drive home their message which they don't believe President-elect Biden won this fair and square. That's what they're trying to do here. I don't believe any of them believe a 10-day audit is going to reverse the results of the election."

You have you to have evidence, you have to have sources that say there was indeed election fraud, the election was indeed -- people were taken advantage, people were cheated. But there's no evidence of that. We've seen many, many dozens of cases where there was no evidence of that.

I would argue that's all that people have left these days. The act is as important as how the votes turn out. Not for the millions of Americans who depend on these people to actually do things for them.

And Mike, the press has been pouncing on the fact that President Trump tweeted that the Georgia he election, not just his own, but the Senate races are both illegal and invalid even as he'll be campaigning for these candidates, Kelly Loeffler, Republican senator on Fox News Sunday today, wouldn't say whether she agrees with the election fraud charges."

And so, there are a lot of frustrated Republicans all across the country, a lot of them in the state of Georgia. If they are convinced that somehow the 2020 election was unfair to President Trump, what's the incentive for getting out. So I think a lot of people, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office are quite anxious right now and a lot of Republicans on the ground in Georgia who are trying to drive this across the finish line worry that this mixed messaging may in effect hurt turnout and hurt them when it comes to these critical runoff races."

But they also need President Trump's coalition, President Trump's die-hard voters to turn out for them, and so they were really in a tough spot. Kelly Loeffler asked questions about that again today.

You're seeing Republican senators trying to distinguish themselves from one another, from some of the others who may be voting. Obviously, this is a situation that majority leader Mitch McConnell tries to avoid every chance possible, one reason perhaps why he didn't put the $2,000 stimulus checks on the floor. Certainly, some wanted to vote for them but he does everything possible to avoid dividing his conference.

I say that objectively, just covering the facts of what's going on. This has gone through the courts. Sixty cases around have been brought to the courts. Oftentimes, widespread voter fraud has not even been alleged in court because there simply isn't evidence to support that. If you look at the evidence that has been shown, it does not support that. There's nothing that supports that this was rigged or stolen. And I think it's a very dangerous precedent. Elections have consequences. I think you have to accept.

In some cases, I think initially there was a rush to try to figure out what was going on with respect to COVID-19 and you had a lot of mixed messaging that was coming from within the medical community, which then bled into the media, which then bled out to everyone in terms of wear a mask, don't wear a mask, et cetera. I think that some of the media mistakes that were big were when we really started to get the facts on things like school reopening, for example, and the fact that schools were not super spreaders of this and children were kept out of school for too long. There seems to be a resistance by media to just report what was going on with that. Same thing goes for some of the lockdown measures. You're talking about outdoor dining. That was not a super spreader. That needed to be out front and center. The same thing goes for holding some of these governors accountable. There was a quick rush to hold President Trump accountable and he deserved some of that in terms of the messaging coming out of the White House on COVID-19. There was a lot of mixed messaging. But there were also a lot of problems coming from the likes of Andrew Cuomo. That guy somehow walked away with an Emmy when he was responsible for some of the worst decision making related to nursing homes. Now, he is responsible for -- look at the rollout of the vaccine in New York. They have all of these vaccines. They're not being distributed to people. Gavin Newsom has just now being held accountable by media where they're covering this, you know, recusal attempt. But I think there were a lot of steps of this where there was more than interest in making this about President Trump and about this administration and politicizing it than there was about actually getting facts out to people, not only about the virus, but about which leadership really needed to be held accountable throughout the process."

      "utterance": "Yeah, it was a very sadomasochistic relationship, I think. I think there were a lot of going around and a lot of ways, I think, that there was -- I don't doubt the motives of a lot of the media in 2020 when it comes to Donald Trump or even over the last four years. At the same time, Donald Trump was good for business. I think they knew that. I think Donald Trump knew that also. He wanted to have that foil and while he played the antagonist to the media, they were sort of serving as that foil to him that he could be that punching bag. So I am not sure anyone really landed blows. I don't know if anyone changed minds when it comes to the media situation or from Donald Trump. But I will say, I think the problem was more of the self-inflicted wounds the media did to themselves over the course of the entire 2020 over a variety of stories from coronavirus to others that were related to sort of Donald Trump and politics. I think that more of it when they were trying to go after Donald Trump, it ended up being self-inflicted wounds on the media, especially the legacy media."

      "utterance": "No question about that. My theory is that every little Trump controversy got cranked up to 11. Is he cheating at golf? Why does he eat pizza with a fork? That sort of thing. So when it came to the more serious stuff, impeachment over Ukraine and trying to overturn the election results, I think a lot of Trump supporters and conservatives just kind of tuned the media out, seeing it as a hostile force."

      "speaker": "KRAKAUER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I think when you make everything into the largest scandal in the world, I think that ends up being this crying wolf theory, right? And so yeah, I think that actually played out a lot, I think, with coronavirus. I think COVID was the story of 2020 and certainly will continue to be, potentially, you know --"

    {
      "speaker": "KRAKAUER",
      "utterance": "-- for months and years in the future. But I think one of the things we saw is that we finally -- everything was a scandal in the Trump administration. We've reached a level of here's a pandemic, here's actually a giant story that has major implications for the media, and now we have a president that -- now we have a media that's attacking the president over of every little thing instinctively when a lot of times there wasn't a lot of maybe scientific evidence to do so. And so I think that played out in a very negative way for the media and again further eroded the trust that the public has for the media when it comes to an important issue like this pandemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What you had in the early months of the pandemic is the media saying this is really, really serious and could be deadly and President Trump initially playing it down, then came of course the fall and winter surge and everybody knows how deadly it is across the globe. But at the same time, the coverage seemed to break down along ideological lines, the virus itself, the masks, the lockdowns, and then I think also to your point about undermining trust, depending on what you believe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAKAUER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, two quick examples of this. You know, I think in the summer, we had a series of -- we had first like anti-lockdown protests that were happening. And then we just had people going to the beach for Memorial Day. And the media went wall to wall coverage trying to shame people going to the beach because they weren't wearing masks, weren't properly social distancing, and this could be a big super spreader event. OK, so we had that. A week later, the George Floyd protests broke out, tens of thousands of people protesting all around the country. And the same doctors who were on cable news were not having that same, you know, idea about OK, this may be a dangerous super spreader event when it comes to this ideological situation. So, I think that was a very clear case of hypocrisy. Another one, more recently, the Operation Warp Speed in June put out -- did a press conference and they said that there was a very likely chance that we might have a vaccine by the end of 2020. The media treated that as if it was like this fantasy, this complete like that is never going to happen --"

      "utterance": "Right. Impossible, they said. Not even -- unlikely, impossible. Obviously, you know, we reached the end of 2020 and millions of people have already been vaccinated. That is a very clear example where this is a cause and effect. We were told one thing and it became very clear that the media was wrong in the way that they covered this when it first happened. That further erodes trust. It doesn't make it feel like there's an expertise that we can trust either when it comes to science."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Eroding trust seems to be the theme here. I say that with some sadness because I like the media business. But as you said earlier, self-inflicted wounds, more so in 2020, I think, than any recent years. Steve Krakauer, great to see you. Thanks very much for joining us."

      "utterance": "Acosta now tells the magazine the Trump presidency was a nonstop national emergency. And then he -- quote -- \"couldn't stomach the president's attacks on the press.\" This is clearly a personal vendetta for Acosta. By the way, a president is allowed to say whatever he wants about the media. Now, Jim Acosta says journalists will approach Joe Biden differently. I don't think the press should be trying whip up the Biden presidency and turn it into must-see TV in a contrived way. Got it. Is it any wonder that the 74 million people who voted for Donald Trump believe there's a blatant double standard? New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi made a great point of saying it didn't really require any special bravery to report honestly and critically on Donald Trump. Why? Because journalists who are unrelentingly negative were rewarded with cable news contracts, book offers, big Twitter followings. But reporting critically on Joe Biden will be riskier. They could alienate their newfound liberal fans who won't want the new president pummelled the way Trump was. Now, covering Trump through four years of controversies, investigations, impeachment, tweeted attacks, sometimes exaggerated or false statements has been difficult for the press. Biden has a lower key style and so far has rarely been challenged."

      "utterance": "Sorry for that little blip (ph). Now, obviously, the coverage can't be exactly the same, but if journalists roll over for Joe Biden rather than holding him to a high standard, praise his policies, and minimize Democratic Party conflict, well, it will be pretty clear their coverage is calibrated based on who occupies the oval office. As for our program, we have always tried to provide journalistic balance. I've criticized the media for their relentless negativity against President Trump and also held the president accountable when he's gone too far including his denunciations of the press, some of them at least. And I repeatedly chided the pundits for writing off Joe Biden during the primaries while also trying to hold Biden accountable for his mistakes. I am still wedded to the rather old fashioned concept of fairness. I very much appreciate your watching. That's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz.
