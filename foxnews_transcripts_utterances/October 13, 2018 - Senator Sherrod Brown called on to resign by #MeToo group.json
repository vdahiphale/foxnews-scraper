But people who knew Pastor Brunson have told us the charges were absurd.  He was a pillar of the Christian community, a man who led his congregation faithfully, and it also loved Turkey.  When asked to speak in court today, he said only, \"I am innocent, I love Turkey, please release me.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And if you pointed out, he is now on route to Germany where he'll have a full medical examination before flying into Joint Base Andrews.  And, of course, one of the other issues here, many people saying this may well bridge the divide between the U.S. and Turkey.  Two countries which have been at odds quite recently.  Ed?",

In that letter, Grassley stated that any government workers who possibly engaged in such serious offenses would at the very minimum have their security clearances suspended pending an investigation.  Well, three weeks ago the State Department finally responded to Senator Grassley's 2017 letter saying quoting here.  \"At her request former Secretary Clinton's security clearance was administratively with on August 30th, 2018.\"  The letter went on to say that on September 20th the security clearances of five other Clinton researchers had also been revoked.  Only Clinton aide Cheryl Mills was listed, the other four names were redacted. Of course, at the time of the probe Hillary Clinton was running for president and no charges were filed.  This summer president trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan and at the time the White House said it was reviewing the clearances of several other people.  So about 17 months after Grassley sent the letter, he finally got her response from the State Department.",

Breaking tonight, American pastor Andrew Brunson is finally a free man.  Thanks be to God, another American reverend who was in the courtroom exclaimed today, as Pastor Brunson is finally off Turkish soil after 24 months in prison. Headed to a medical exam in Germany before he'll touch down here at home.  Bringing joy to his relief family, of course, and handing President Trump a foreign policy victory as another imprisoned American has been set free on his watch. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum, tonight.  Just hours ago, we witness Pastor Brunson's arrival at an airport in Turkey.  Walking through a throngs of reporters as he clutched the hand of his wife, Norine. His release, a diplomatic triumph for the administration and we expect the President to address the news at a rally tonight in Lebanon, Ohio.  You see him there, he'll be speaking in just a few moments.  We will be monitoring that.  We'll bring you his remarks to get you the latest once he talks about it. But we begin tonight with our reporter Benjamin Hall.  He's live in Izmir, Turkey for Pastor Brunson was released.  Good evening, Benjamin."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes.  Hi, Ed.  And what we saw today was really the end of a two-year nightmare for Pastor Brunson.  Most of that ordeal was spent in a Turkish jail, the last few months under house arrest. But as you say, this is also very much a victory for the Trump administration, and in particular, for his foreign policy.  This all started this morning when Pastor Brunson's convoy swept into the courthouse just outside Izmir.  Then after a trial lasting just over four hours, the prosecutor recommended that his house arrest be lifted, his travel ban be lifted, and the control order too, before the judge then announced he was free, clearing the way for his return to the U.S. Brunson released a statement today, saying, \"This is the day our family has been praying for.  I am delighted to be home on my way to the United States.\" President Trump has always pushed hard for Brunson's release and often, in person, and at the highest levels of government.  And it was because of sanctions and major tariffs imposed by the President and crucially the threat of more sanctions and tariffs that Turkey conceded. Just in the last hour, the president has commented, saying, \"He is I think in good shape.  And he's going to be coming to the Oval Office most likely on Saturday.  He suffered greatly.  That there's no deal there at all, there's no deal.\" Brunson was convicted of terror-related charges today, but the sentence was commuted to time served.  He had faced 35 years in jail for espionage and terror of offenses, connected to the failed 2016 coup in Turkey. But people who knew Pastor Brunson have told us the charges were absurd.  He was a pillar of the Christian community, a man who led his congregation faithfully, and it also loved Turkey.  When asked to speak in court today, he said only, \"I am innocent, I love Turkey, please release me.\" And if you pointed out, he is now on route to Germany where he'll have a full medical examination before flying into Joint Base Andrews.  And, of course, one of the other issues here, many people saying this may well bridge the divide between the U.S. and Turkey.  Two countries which have been at odds quite recently.  Ed?"

It wasn't like Turkey did it all out of goodwill, but he was in rough shape.  He lost over 60 pounds, he was in a regular kind of criminal prison with some pretty tough people.  And when he was under than house arrest since July until his released today, he's been improving. I think as the president said, which is why if everything goes well in Germany that he'll be in the Oval Office with the president tomorrow.  I mean, imagine what Andrew Brunson is going through and his wife right now who was also in Turkey with him."

Talk about the reaction you've talked to the family, we're trying to give them some space right now before they do a whole lot of interviews."

His children who were here in the United States, his daughter put off her wedding for a long time hoping her dad would be able to attend."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, you mentioned what a joyous occasion for his daughter to finally be able to walk down the aisle.  We hope in the weeks or months ahead, there was another pastor, Pastor White I believe, down North Carolina in the same community where Pastor Brunson serves, who said today that a lot of people there were saying, hallelujah and doing a happy dance. Talk about this community as we have about one minute left and the president tomorrow in the Oval Office, what we can expect there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Sure.  You know, Pastor Brunson has spent 23 years in Turkey as an Evangelical minister.  Part of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. Again, they are excited about his release. I know -- I've been working on this along with our -- some of our senior attorneys for a long time, and there were a lot of low points, there were some high points, and then obviously get to a day like today with the celebration. They will be excited, but they will be there as a support network. That's part of the Christian community, and the community he's a part of."

      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "That's -- it's pretty amazing.  I mean, you think about -- you know, in prior administration's what was paid to get people back.  And doing this, the President Trump understands one thing, about U.S. power.  And that is that there is U.S. power.  That we have the largest economy in the world, the biggest military, and we have a lot of arrows in our quiver to be able to use. And so, for him to frankly take a very tough stand, and there are a lot of people that were upset with him for doing it."

What do you know about how many Americans are still there in Turkey beyond Pastor Brunson?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes.  I don't know the numbers, but there is a lot.  You know, some of them can be from legitimate reasons create -- committing crimes while they're in the country, and some are illegitimate reasons. And obviously, the pastor was a very illegitimate reason, it was a preposterous trial.  But this is one of the things where when the president makes it very clear that there's going to be a cost to illegally detaining American citizens. This will have a ripple effect not just in Turkey with the other people being held in Turkey, but in other countries that are looking at this saying, are we really going to get leverage now out of detaining an American illegally?"

      "utterance": "And I want to go over to Saudi Arabia because you mentioned a moment ago the American power.  But the president's also under pressure tonight.  He gets congratulations for bringing Pastor Brunson home.  But he's under pressure to do more to deal with Saudi Arabia and find out what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist who has disappeared, some fear he is been murdered. The Turks say that Saudi Arabia planned this out and basically killed him.  What do you know tonight from U.S. intelligence and other sources?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "Well, everything seems like that's correct.  Turkey's been very forward-leaning.  Which means they have evidence.  Supposedly they have played this evidence, I, of course, haven't heard it. It's disgusting if it's true, and it appears to be true.  But I think what's important here is to take broad international politics of this and put it in context.  Keep in mind, the Russians poisoned people in the United Kingdom."

    {
      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "Assad, Iran, and Russia killed 500,000 Syrians.  So, it's not excusing, and there needs to be a cost to that.  But some of these Senators that have been pining for years to cut off any kind of aid to Saudi Arabia for some reason are using this as now the impetus and saying this is the reason to now basically cut off all aid, cut off relationships with Saudi Arabia is an overreaction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes.  I've got 30 seconds though.  One of those Senator is Lindsey Graham.  And he has said, there should be a bipartisan tsunami he calls it if, in fact, Saudi Arabia was behind the disappearance potential murder.  What does that mean?  Should we cut off, you say don't cut off aid?  What about the arms sales?  Over $100 billion in arms sales."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "Well, I -- yes, I think the arms sales is the big thing that we have to really think about before we handle that because there are some big implications.  I have a lot of respect for Lindsey Graham.  I think there should be sanctions against the individuals involved, but we have to be very careful before you make massive pronouncements and basically in the relationship with Saudi Arabia.  We'll have massive implications in Israel, Syria, and everywhere else."

When they found a man in need of medical transport they relied on soldiers from the 144th transportation company out of Marianna, Florida to handle that in one of the big five-ton trucks.  Security all the while was handled -- was provided by cops out of Baltimore so lots and lots of cooperation. These search and rescue teams are going door-to-door and they're putting a lot of hearts at ease.  The number one concern we get here is people who cannot locate or communicate with a loved one."

Some sad news particularly for your Air Force fans, news out of the Tyndall Air Force Base which is home of the F-22 Raptor Joint Strike Fighter.  The commander of the 235th Fighter Wing says the flight line suffered catastrophic damage.  Now, those F-22 is they have a price tag $143 million.  Most of them were able to fly out ahead of the storm, but as it stands the reason some are going to be down for maintenance, some of them for whatever reason couldn't move. Well, just about all of the structures at Tyndall Air Force Base which took a direct hit, all of those structures were damaged.  And what we're hearing from the commander of the 235th Fighter Wing is that these engineers just are unable to get inside these hangars which are so badly damaged and really do an assessment of how extensive the damage has been to the aircraft that remained there on the ground.  Ed, back to you."

If all goes well with the medical checkup, we are told by U.S. officials we can expect Pastor Brunson headed towards Maryland, to Washington D.C. area as the President said roughly 12:00-noon Eastern Time tomorrow.  We, of course, will be covering that live here on the Fox News Channel.  And then after that Pastor Brunson expected to go to the White House in the Oval Office to meet with President Trump.  So we will be all over that.  In the meantime, we have a lot of other news. Also breaking tonight, word from the U.S. State Department that Hillary Clinton is surrendering her top-secret security clearance.  It comes in the wake of her handling or mishandling of classified information in the now-infamous e-mail server scandal.  Trace Gallagher is following this breaking story, just heard about from the State Department the last couple of hours. He's live in a West Coast newsroom.  Good evening, Trace."

In that letter, Grassley stated that any government workers who possibly engaged in such serious offenses would at the very minimum have their security clearances suspended pending an investigation.  Well, three weeks ago the State Department finally responded to Senator Grassley's 2017 letter saying quoting here.  \"At her request former Secretary Clinton's security clearance was administratively with on August 30th, 2018.\"  The letter went on to say that on September 20th the security clearances of five other Clinton researchers had also been revoked.  Only Clinton aide Cheryl Mills was listed, the other four names were redacted. Of course, at the time of the probe Hillary Clinton was running for president and no charges were filed.  This summer president trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan and at the time the White House said it was reviewing the clearances of several other people.  So about 17 months after Grassley sent the letter, he finally got her response from the State Department."

      "utterance": "So what do you make of this?  Maybe better late than never but a lot of people are wondering for a long time whether Hillary Clinton would be held accountable at all for the server issue.  One wonders tonight whether this is something she just maybe was no longer using the security clearance and decided to give it up or maybe she knew a blistering report was coming and wanted to say I'm voluntarily giving it up before it gets taken away."

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, nothing did happen as far as the actual criminal investigation of this is concerned.  That was extremely controversial.  Now, I think the idea that at her request it was -- it was ended gives her a way of saying look, this wasn't a disciplinary action.  I no longer used it.  It's not something that is important to me anymore. But given that the -- that the administration has already done this with John Brennan, the former CIA director who really bashes the president at every opportunity these days, I think people are going to want to look at this and say exactly what went on behind this withdrawal of a clearance."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, the key issue of course in her secret e-mail server was that she did send classified information over this unclassified basically unsecured system.  And there's really no doubt about that.  I suppose you could argue whether it was super important stuff or not but the fact that it was classified, she did send it in a casual way over an unsecured system seems pretty much beyond dispute now."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So that sounded like a trial balloon a few days ago.  Then Ivanka Trump herself tweeted, no I'm not interested, dad and the rest of the world, I suppose.  Today the President was at it again tweeting \"so nice everyone wants Ivanka Trump to be the new U.N. Ambassador.  She would be incredible but I can already hear the chants of nepotism.  We have great people that want the job.  What's going on here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this is exactly the sort of thing the president says a lot. He frequently praises his daughter saying she would make excellent this or an excellent that. She is already on the White House staff and I believe they would have to get around the nepotism rules to make that happen in the first place. So this is -- that strikes as the president's sort of normal praise of his daughter. He did actually bring up the fact that there are nepotism rules involved here. But the bigger thing being Ivanka Trump has basically said--"

In fact, there was a restraining order at one time against Sherrod Brown when he was still married to her and he violated that restraining order. All we are doing is going back to the public documents. And now we live in a different world. We are in the Me Too era and the victims are coming out and they're speaking up. And we want to make sure that victims have a voice. And the fact that in the past Sherrod Brown has dismissed this and calling it a family matter I think is really unfortunate.

She stuck to the agreements we had for the interview. She answered every single question. She never told me anything was off limits. I think she truly cares about combating cyber bullying. I think she care about her son Barron a lot. And I think she is trying to balance one of the most complicated times for a first lady in the White House."

That sit-down getting a lot of attention as Americans get a closer look at the nation's first lady. She was just on that big trip to Africa. She has largely avoided the spotlight and rarely spoken during her tenure. Here to weigh in tonight for ladies night as we call on Friday on \"The Story.\" Jessica Tarlov, Lisa Booth, and Susan Li. Good to see you, all. Jessica, what do you think of--"

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I think that she did well. I think she said some things that are ridiculous like that she is the most bullied person in the world. I think there are a lot of people who are suffering from bullying, you know, being physically attack and things like that who would disagree with her. But I think that actually whenever she gets in front of a camera, gives an interview she does herself a world of good. I think her popularity is at 54 percent which is far above any other member of the Trump administration or the Trump family. I appreciate her answering questions about what it feels like when you know, your husband is accused of cheating on you publicly like that. And ask when she isn't the first first lady to suffer from that but it's I think always end up positive for her to do something like that."

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, we know they went there because they would make headlines and we'd be talking about it like we just did. So I mean that's the whole point of him asking the question. But look, Melania Trump has been on the receiving end of a lot of ridicule making fun of her accent, making fun or even the clothes that she wears, criticizing her intelligence and trying to make it seem like she is not an intelligent woman despite speaking multiple languages. So, she is always on the receiving end of ridicule. So I think it's fair for her to say that she is bullied. I mean, we see it all the time."

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

The Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute. That's all. That's ridiculous what they are doing. I think the Fed is out of control. I think what they are doing is wrong."

In fact, the only president I can remember in modern history that actually approved of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates is Alan Greenspan -- not Greenspan. Pardon me. It's Paul Volcker and that was Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s. But in terms of actually criticizing the Federal Reserve chairman? What about Alan Greenspan in 1992. Bush H. Bush blamed him Alan for the fact that he lost the 1992 economy."

    },
