We have that story and so much more tonight. We first turn our attention to “Hannity” watch on the alarming crop of 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Democrats are pushing, let's see, to give 16-year- olds the right to vote. You can't drink until you're 21, promising to stack the Supreme Court so they get enough justices that think their way and will legislate from the bench, and proposing an end to the Electoral College. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now what is happening, we will break it down. This is a scary attempt by politicians to centralize power and control the lives of you, we, the American people. And right now, it is the party line among almost all the radical Democrats running to be president in 2020. A blatant, dramatic frightening attempt to alter America in ways that will make it unrecognizable, forever destroy the greatest economic, wealth creation system in the history of mankind. Now, last night during the friendly interview with so-called comedian Jimmy Kimmel, our old friend, Senator Kamala Harris became the latest Democratic candidate to express support for an end to the Electoral College.

Now, Senator Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand and many Democrats support an end to the constitutional process by which we have always elected the president of the United States. So, why is this a big deal? All right. We turn quickly tonight to a “Hannity” history lesson on the Electoral College to give you an open explanation. Now, when our Constitution was drafted in 1787, the framers of the Constitution, they sought to rectify what was a very challenging conundrum. How do you create a limited, central government strong enough to defend its people against serious threats but decentralized enough to prevent consolidation and subsequent abuse of power? The result was a Constitution filled with checks, balances, shared power between the individual states and the federal government. The Electoral College is a product of this system, giving the states the power to conduct elections and choose the president. As a result, each state holds some power in determining the executive branch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me explain.

Everywhere else, in other words, all of red America were pretty much totally would be ignored. Don't take it from me. Listen to what Obama's former campaign manager had to say about this. Take a listen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } JIM MESSINA, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Just from a campaign manager standpoint when I ran President Obama's campaign, we would never go to a small state if there was no Electoral College. You'd go to the major markets. You would not go to Iowa. You won't go to Montana. You won't go to New Hampshire. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, I think any proposal getting rid of the Electoral College -- I understand the concern and the concern is real that we've had two presidents get elected without winning a popular vote, but I agree with Charlie.

You think all those red states to stick around and be in the United States if they kept losing to New York, New Jersey, California and Illinois? I tend to think not. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Democrats don't share the values of our Framers. They want power for themselves, and they wanted at all cost. That is why every major proposal they are now pushing begins and ends with their power and a centralized federal government that they control. Government run health care and complete takeover of the health care industry -- yes, run by the state. Remember, Kamala Harris and others, they want to end all private health care. That impacts 200 million Americans. I thought they were pro-choice, government run education. Now, they're going to add pre-K and college education. They haven't done a better enough job with kindergarten through 12th grade. And they will have government consolidation of all guns and gun laws, government-run clean energy through the government takeover of the energy sector. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, they will take it over.

In other words, the socialist green new deal, they proposed and will tell you how to run your business. Government promises for everything and for everybody, you'll never have a worry in the world, but you also give up all of your freedom, and all of the wealth creation systems we have built up to this point in our history. And we're going to explain. Even the poorest in America have it so much better than so many other people around the globe. I'll have the mini monologue detailing this destructive -- what do social mean?

We'll actually do the math and tell you how much your paycheck the Democrats want to take. It is pretty close to 100 percent. And if the Democrats get their way, this country as we know it, it's going to be over. It's done. It will not be the United States of America as we know it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. But, first, we turned our HANNITY watch on the Mueller witch hunt and we'll get to our breaking news. And another sign that the probe is in its final stage, special counsel attorneys requested an extension for a court filing relating to the metaphoric case because they were too busy with, quote, press of other work -- maybe they're writing a report after nearly three years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, today, President Trump said he wants that report to be available for all Americans.

      "sentences": "Now, here's the ironic, thanks to Democrats after the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the president has no say whatsoever in that decision whether to make the findings public. The attorney general and only the attorney general will decide. Now, tonight as we wait the Mueller report, I want to get back to how this all began. This is important because people need to absorb exactly what this is all predicated on. Now, according to then lead FBI investigator Peter Strzok and top FBI lawyer Lisa Page, after nine months of an FBI investigation beginning in July of 2016, they found no evidence of Trump- Russia collusion, nine months before Mueller. So after the president rightly fired Comey which even Comey acknowledges the president has to do, has the right to do for any reason or no reason at all, well, then the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, well, he appointed special counsel, his friend Robert Mueller to continue the FBI investigation into so-called collusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, Jeff Sessions recused himself. Now, Mueller's mandate was as follows, investigate, quote, any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump. And this part that everyone seems to forget: Any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we have seen Robert Mueller prosecute various Trump associations for processed crimes. We saw Mueller prosecute Paul Manafort for crimes that had nothing to do with his time with Trump, Russia collusion, and he worked for the Trump campaign. We watch Mueller prosecute a Russian troll farm, actually a number of them, filled with people who will never be extradited and tried in the United States to face justice, and Russia intel people. They will never be tried. They will never be extradited. But oddly enough, we have not seen Mueller prosecute matters that arose from or involving Democrats or Clinton allies. Where, we ask tonight, is the Mueller investigation into whether the Clinton campaign used money and used and funneled that money to an ex-foreign spy, Christopher Steele, who hated Donald Trump, who then colluded with Russia in a development of the dirty dossier. We know that dossier is filled with Russian lies and Ukrainian lies and total propaganda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Where is the Mueller into FISA abuse? After all clear and compelling and incontrovertible evidence that Trump campaign associate was spied on by federal officials, the bulk of the information and the FISA application was that Hillary bought and paid for Russian dossier. By the way, they never told the court that Hillary paid for it. Where is the Mueller investigation into the coordination and the effort of the State Department to use the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier to take down Donald Trump who they wish didn't win the election? Where is the Mueller investigation into Uranium One? Remember that case? Russians, we knew in the United States because we actually had an FBI agent in there that was reporting back bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and all sorts of racketeering. We know Bill Clinton at the time took a massive payment from a Russian bank related to Uranium One and met with Vladimir Putin in Russia. We know the Clinton Foundation raked in about $145 million from Uranium One executives. We know Hillary Clinton as secretary of state -- well, she was one of a number of people signing off on that deal. The Uranium One deal, that's right, giving 20 percent of America's Uranium to Russia and Putin, by the way, the foundational material for nuclear weapons that we don't have enough on our own, we import uranium. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Where is the Mueller investigation into this damning news story which we now get to tonight from John Solomon? We know tonight that a high ranking government official in Ukraine actively tried to benefit, the Clinton campaign in 2016. This is breaking tonight, according to Solomon, Ukraine's top prosecutor has opened a criminal probe into whether senior law enforcement officials in that country tried to sway the U.S. election, influence our election to help Hillary Clinton win. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, a tape recording released by a member of Ukrainian parliament captured in an official talking about leaking Manafort financial records in the middle of the 2016 election for the stated purpose to help Hillary Clinton. A Ukrainian court even ruled the leak was an improper effort to influence the American election. That's not all. According to this report by John Solomon, Ukraine's top prosecutor accused the U.S. embassy of interfering in corruption prosecution inside the country, including one probe into the alleged misuse of American aid, in a letter surfaced from a senior member of Congress to Secretary Pompeo, accusing the current U.S. ambassador in Kiev of bad- mouthing the Trump administration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this is exactly what Mark Meadows was talking about Tuesday on this show. So where is the Mueller investigation into these matters? After all, it's already under investigation in the country of Ukraine. There is a tape recording that has all of this information. Where is equal justice under our laws? Where's application of our laws? There's no Trump Russia collusion as we now know from, well, the FBI told us after nine months. And then, of course, the House Intel Committee told us and then the Senate Intel Committee told us and Congressman Nunez pointed out, many years ago, by the way, 2014.

He warned us in 2014. And not to the Trump campaign, instead, by the way, the power obsessed Clintons who made most susceptible.

I want to explain in detail what is free, free, free, everything government free mean.

Free health care, free college, free childcare, free retirement, free vacations, government-funded guaranteed healthy food, and more, and no planes, cows, cars, oil or gas. I want you to think about this. Every single time you are offered something for free, in this case, these are promises they can never keep and you will give up your freedom. You give up more control of your life to a bureaucrat, and you lose the ability to make choices to do what's in the best interest of you and your family. By the way (ph), I told you Bernie Sanders. He owns three homes, has seven- figure income. Why doesn't he share his own money? And Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loves to take planes instead of the train, the Acela, Amtrak despite her calls to abolish air travel. And her motto should be \"Do as I say,\" not as \"I do.\" And in addition to everything else, Democrats also want to hand out free cash now to every American. No strings attached. Look at Cory Booker's hometown in Newark, New Jersey. They are doing a test, universal basic income program. You have dark horse. Democratic candidate Andrew Yang grabbing headlines for weighing in on male circumcision, deciding that for people, also proposing we give each and every American $1,000 a month. How are we going to pay for that? Take corporations, look, like Amazon, for example. Take a look. ANDREW YANG, 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So I'm proposing a freedom dividend where every adult in America starting at age 18 would receive $1,000 a month, free and clear to do whatever they want.

      "sentences": "I'm sure Mr. Yang's proposal seems like as good faith attempt to help poor and the working class, deal with challenges the people have. Handing out money, no strings attached, is dangerous. First thing it will do is destroy incentive to work hard and better your life. When you take 70 percent of the income of people and 90 percent of corporate income, well, nobody is going to want to do anything. Where is this money coming from? Who is funding this? Look at what happened in Finland. They tried universal basic income. That experiment failed to completely get anybody back to work. Here's what the left doesn't get. Higher taxes, 70 percent for individuals, 90 percent for corporations, as proposed, burdensome regulation, massive government programs, they will drive every business out of this country, leaving fewer and fewer taxpayers to deal with the bigger and bigger tax bill, because as it turns out, nothing is free, everything has a cost. Somebody has got to pay for it. Look at the middle-class exodus from New York and California and New Jersey, and Illinois. Because the 70 percent top marginal rate, the 90 percent top corporate rate, it's going to make it impossible. No business can survive. They will all leave. No wonder we'll -- Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez owes taxes reportedly on her 2012 failed business. And guess who's hurt the most by all of this? The people they purport to help. The poor and the working class. Because the truth is the free enterprise system has led more people out of poverty and created the higher standard of living than any other economic system in history. And while we should do everything we can do to help the forgotten men and women in this country, they matter most, which Trump is doing, after Obama added 13 million more Americans to food stamps, he added 8 million more Americans to poverty. Remember the standard of living among the poor and working class in America is better than almost any other place on earth because of our capitalist system. Look at Pew Research. Even Americans who are considered poor are actually middle-class when you look at the global scale. Findings by the Heritage Foundation. The vast majority of Americans living in \"deep poverty of air condition and computer, cell phones.\" Now, in my life, I've lived paycheck-to-paycheck. Let me be the first to say that is not what we want for every citizen. We want every American to have better and more lives than just the bare necessities. But if you compare poverty in America, places like Venezuela, Cuba, all these other countries, there is suffering all across Latin America. Honduras, they have a 66 percent poverty rate. Conservatism, capitalism, freedom works. Limited regulations, low taxes allow businesses to thrive. That creates jobs for --opportunities for everyone. JFK did it, Reagan did it, and we now see Donald Trump doing it. Now, with near record low unemployment, a record number of Americans employed to million more jobs available than people on unemployment, the best wage growth in a decade under Donald Trump, finally we're energy- independence for the first time in 70 years. And we're going to have millions of high-paying jobs in the energy industry if government doesn't take it over. They want to roll all of that back. Hopefully, the American people know better than this. They won't fall for the bait and switch. It seems great. Everything is free. Nationalizing the health care and energy industries, tampering with the markets, mandating what car you can drive, what you can eat, getting rid of oil, gas, planes, free money for those unwilling to work? That will be a disaster. Socialism has been a failure every time it has been tried. It has resulted in some of the biggest and largest amount of human suffering in history. So tonight, remember, as we go through this election process, one thing. Surrendering control of everything to the government, and they promise to take all your fears away and guarantee everything is going to be great, how did keep your doctor, keep your plan and save money work out? That's only one aspect. The government taking all your hard-earned money, it's not going to lead to economic prosperity. Don't fall for the false promises, the scare tactics, the hysteria, playing on your fears. It's all part of their plan. They want the control of every aspect of your life. They want you more dependent on them so you will keep them in power. What is taking place right now, this is a defining moment in American politics. Two radically different agendas and ideas for our future are on display. One of them, racking up success after success after success. It's time for America to stay the course. The Trump agenda is setting records where it's most important. Helping people with a ladder up to success. Helping businesses invest and build factories and manufacturing centers, and create jobs in places like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan. Radical 2020 Democrats, they are on a mission. They will roll it all back and America will become unrecognizable. You won't believe what happened, for example, to an ICE agent while detaining an illegal immigrant. So we're going to get to that next. But our warning of the day, socialism will lead to an America you won't recognize. It won't be the same America for your kids and grandkids.

      "utterance": "All right. Tucker, great show. And welcome to “Hannity.” Breaking tonight, according to \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, we now have major evidence of election collusion in 2016, real evidence to back it up, this collusion surrounds Hillary Clinton and a top Ukrainian government official that wanted her elected. We're going to have all the details coming up with John Solomon. But before we get to our top story, ask yourself a couple of questions. Is this going to be investigated for three years? Two by Mueller, one by the FBI, and in Mueller's case, a merry band of Democratic donors? Will the mainstream media even cover what is a damning story with tapes? We're not going to hold our breath. We have that story and so much more tonight. We first turn our attention to “Hannity” watch on the alarming crop of 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Democrats are pushing, let's see, to give 16-year- olds the right to vote. You can't drink until you're 21, promising to stack the Supreme Court so they get enough justices that think their way and will legislate from the bench, and proposing an end to the Electoral College. Now what is happening, we will break it down. This is a scary attempt by politicians to centralize power and control the lives of you, we, the American people. And right now, it is the party line among almost all the radical Democrats running to be president in 2020. A blatant, dramatic frightening attempt to alter America in ways that will make it unrecognizable, forever destroy the greatest economic, wealth creation system in the history of mankind. Now, last night during the friendly interview with so-called comedian Jimmy Kimmel, our old friend, Senator Kamala Harris became the latest Democratic candidate to express support for an end to the Electoral College. Take a look."

      "utterance": "All right. Now, Senator Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand and many Democrats support an end to the constitutional process by which we have always elected the president of the United States. So, why is this a big deal? All right. We turn quickly tonight to a “Hannity” history lesson on the Electoral College to give you an open explanation. Now, when our Constitution was drafted in 1787, the framers of the Constitution, they sought to rectify what was a very challenging conundrum. How do you create a limited, central government strong enough to defend its people against serious threats but decentralized enough to prevent consolidation and subsequent abuse of power? The result was a Constitution filled with checks, balances, shared power between the individual states and the federal government. The Electoral College is a product of this system, giving the states the power to conduct elections and choose the president. As a result, each state holds some power in determining the executive branch. Let me explain. Without the Electoral College and our framers knew this, smaller areas with dense populations -- in other words, New York, New Jersey, California -- they would monopolize the keys to the White House. And look at how all four of those states have been destroyed by the people in those states that elected liberal socialist politicians. Everywhere else, in other words, all of red America were pretty much totally would be ignored. Don't take it from me. Listen to what Obama's former campaign manager had to say about this. Take a listen. JIM MESSINA, OBAMA 2012 CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Just from a campaign manager standpoint when I ran President Obama's campaign, we would never go to a small state if there was no Electoral College. You'd go to the major markets. You would not go to Iowa. You won't go to Montana. You won't go to New Hampshire. You know, I think any proposal getting rid of the Electoral College -- I understand the concern and the concern is real that we've had two presidents get elected without winning a popular vote, but I agree with Charlie. That's not going to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. In other words, power would be totally consolidated. This scenario our Framers, our Founders fear the most. It's one of the reasons, look at the quote of Thomas Jefferson, he hated cities, writing they are harmful to, quote, the morals, the health and liberties of men. He was smart, way ahead of his time. And for hundreds of years, yes, the Electoral College played an integral role in decentralizing power of a central government, keeping the United States united. You think all those red states to stick around and be in the United States if they kept losing to New York, New Jersey, California and Illinois? I tend to think not. Now, Democrats don't share the values of our Framers. They want power for themselves, and they wanted at all cost. That is why every major proposal they are now pushing begins and ends with their power and a centralized federal government that they control. Government run health care and complete takeover of the health care industry -- yes, run by the state. Remember, Kamala Harris and others, they want to end all private health care. That impacts 200 million Americans. I thought they were pro-choice, government run education. Now, they're going to add pre-K and college education. They haven't done a better enough job with kindergarten through 12th grade. And they will have government consolidation of all guns and gun laws, government-run clean energy through the government takeover of the energy sector. In other words, they will take it over. No more oil and gas is their proposal for ten years or we're going to die. Government-run universal income, government paid for, government paid for vacation, government- sponsored healthy food. Now, many of these 2020 candidates even want government to control the means of production. In other words, the socialist green new deal, they proposed and will tell you how to run your business. Government promises for everything and for everybody, you'll never have a worry in the world, but you also give up all of your freedom, and all of the wealth creation systems we have built up to this point in our history. And we're going to explain. Even the poorest in America have it so much better than so many other people around the globe. I'll have the mini monologue detailing this destructive -- what do social mean? What does its agenda will do to the country? Later in the program, we'll do something that -- well, no Democrat seems capable of. We'll actually do the math and tell you how much your paycheck the Democrats want to take. It is pretty close to 100 percent. And if the Democrats get their way, this country as we know it, it's going to be over. It's done. It will not be the United States of America as we know it. All right. But, first, we turned our HANNITY watch on the Mueller witch hunt and we'll get to our breaking news. And another sign that the probe is in its final stage, special counsel attorneys requested an extension for a court filing relating to the metaphoric case because they were too busy with, quote, press of other work -- maybe they're writing a report after nearly three years. Now, today, President Trump said he wants that report to be available for all Americans. Take a listen."

      "utterance": "Now, here's the ironic, thanks to Democrats after the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the president has no say whatsoever in that decision whether to make the findings public. The attorney general and only the attorney general will decide. Now, tonight as we wait the Mueller report, I want to get back to how this all began. This is important because people need to absorb exactly what this is all predicated on. Now, according to then lead FBI investigator Peter Strzok and top FBI lawyer Lisa Page, after nine months of an FBI investigation beginning in July of 2016, they found no evidence of Trump- Russia collusion, nine months before Mueller. So after the president rightly fired Comey which even Comey acknowledges the president has to do, has the right to do for any reason or no reason at all, well, then the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, well, he appointed special counsel, his friend Robert Mueller to continue the FBI investigation into so-called collusion. Remember, Jeff Sessions recused himself. Now, Mueller's mandate was as follows, investigate, quote, any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump. And this part that everyone seems to forget: Any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. Now, we have seen Robert Mueller prosecute various Trump associations for processed crimes. We saw Mueller prosecute Paul Manafort for crimes that had nothing to do with his time with Trump, Russia collusion, and he worked for the Trump campaign. We watch Mueller prosecute a Russian troll farm, actually a number of them, filled with people who will never be extradited and tried in the United States to face justice, and Russia intel people. They will never be tried. They will never be extradited. But oddly enough, we have not seen Mueller prosecute matters that arose from or involving Democrats or Clinton allies. Where, we ask tonight, is the Mueller investigation into whether the Clinton campaign used money and used and funneled that money to an ex-foreign spy, Christopher Steele, who hated Donald Trump, who then colluded with Russia in a development of the dirty dossier. We know that dossier is filled with Russian lies and Ukrainian lies and total propaganda. Where is the Mueller into FISA abuse? After all clear and compelling and incontrovertible evidence that Trump campaign associate was spied on by federal officials, the bulk of the information and the FISA application was that Hillary bought and paid for Russian dossier. By the way, they never told the court that Hillary paid for it. Where is the Mueller investigation into the coordination and the effort of the State Department to use the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier to take down Donald Trump who they wish didn't win the election? Where is the Mueller investigation into Uranium One? Remember that case? Russians, we knew in the United States because we actually had an FBI agent in there that was reporting back bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and all sorts of racketeering. We know Bill Clinton at the time took a massive payment from a Russian bank related to Uranium One and met with Vladimir Putin in Russia. We know the Clinton Foundation raked in about $145 million from Uranium One executives. We know Hillary Clinton as secretary of state -- well, she was one of a number of people signing off on that deal. The Uranium One deal, that's right, giving 20 percent of America's Uranium to Russia and Putin, by the way, the foundational material for nuclear weapons that we don't have enough on our own, we import uranium. Where is the Mueller investigation into this damning news story which we now get to tonight from John Solomon? We know tonight that a high ranking government official in Ukraine actively tried to benefit, the Clinton campaign in 2016. This is breaking tonight, according to Solomon, Ukraine's top prosecutor has opened a criminal probe into whether senior law enforcement officials in that country tried to sway the U.S. election, influence our election to help Hillary Clinton win. Now, a tape recording released by a member of Ukrainian parliament captured in an official talking about leaking Manafort financial records in the middle of the 2016 election for the stated purpose to help Hillary Clinton. A Ukrainian court even ruled the leak was an improper effort to influence the American election. That's not all. According to this report by John Solomon, Ukraine's top prosecutor accused the U.S. embassy of interfering in corruption prosecution inside the country, including one probe into the alleged misuse of American aid, in a letter surfaced from a senior member of Congress to Secretary Pompeo, accusing the current U.S. ambassador in Kiev of bad- mouthing the Trump administration. Now, this is exactly what Mark Meadows was talking about Tuesday on this show. So where is the Mueller investigation into these matters? After all, it's already under investigation in the country of Ukraine. There is a tape recording that has all of this information. Where is equal justice under our laws? Where's application of our laws? There's no Trump Russia collusion as we now know from, well, the FBI told us after nine months. And then, of course, the House Intel Committee told us and then the Senate Intel Committee told us and Congressman Nunez pointed out, many years ago, by the way, 2014. He's among many people, by the way, to do this. Russian interference, he told us is a real threat. He warned us in 2014. And not to the Trump campaign, instead, by the way, the power obsessed Clintons who made most susceptible. That's where the real collusion ends up being. And this week, big news, we learned that former Obama White House counsel, Greg Craig, may soon be facing charges linked to Mueller's probe. Oh, maybe a little equal justice. All right. Here with a full report, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, also, former U.S. attorney Joe DiGenova. Former assistant deputy attorney general, Victoria Toensing. Two of my favorite people. John Solomon gets the lead billing tonight with his breaking story. I want to get specifically, John, the tape recording released by a member of Ukrainian parliament. Let's talk about the tape recording, evidence."

That is a profound statement coming from the top law enforcement official of Ukraine. Why is it important? There's a court in Ukraine that's already concluded that Ukrainian officials leaked Paul Manafort's financial records to try to sway the U.S. election. You haven't heard anything about that in the American press. But that ruling occurred recently. And that parliament member comes out and says, I have a tape of these law- enforcement officials saying they did it specifically to help Hillary Clinton.

We have reporters spreading it before the campaign. \"The Washington Post,\" David Corn, Michael Isikoff, to influence the election -- and then we have come, of course, the FISA.

Those things, for all intents and purposes, for all that we know, have been ignored. They were certainly ignored by Mueller and they have been ignored thus far by the Department of Justice. As Victoria said, nobody knows what Huber has done or is doing. Most of us think that when Jeff Sessions appointed Huber, it was a head fake. But, Sean, here's the thing that's really changing, now we know that not was there a Russian collusion through Fusion GPS and through the MI-6 guy and all of that. But now, we know that Ukrainian officials deeply involved in trying to help Hillary Clinton through this and we also now know that the current United States ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, has bad-mouth the president of the United States to Ukrainian officials and has told them not to listen or worry about Trump policy because he is going to be impeached.

Beto, what did he do? He literally ate dirt. I mean, literally. In that, you're hearing me right. According to The Washington Post, during a trip to New Mexico in January, bozo ate dirt because he heard it had regenerative powers, even brought some home for his family to eat. How delicious! How nice! But that's not all. The profile goes on to explain how Beto loves to play pranks. Here's a few examples. A remote-controlled cockroach in his kitchen. Psycho-style shower scares in the shower. And one time he took poop from his kid's diaper, put it in a bowl, told his wife it wasn't avocado. Wow! Can't make this stuff up. And the media just loves him. Anyway, we've sent our own investigative reporter and, of course, friend of the program, Lawrence Jones, to Texas, his home state, to find out what people in Texas think of former Congressman Beto O'Rourke and if they could name one accomplishment because Nancy Pelosi sure couldn't. Here's what he's told Lawrence."

And look at what we've already found out though that he is a dirt eater. You can imagine, if that got out, what we don't know. But I would say that -- some in the media are saying, well, that's intriguing that he's like Obama.

So, on one hand, we are not to pass on expectations of people who are under 18, between 15 and 18, because they don't know what they're doing.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. We turn to our Hannity Watch on radical 2020 Democrats and a Hannity mini monologue tonight. I want to explain in detail what is free, free, free, everything government free mean. Well, the left continues to push these fantasies that they're going to take away all your fears and everything will be taken care of from the minute you're born to the minute you die. Free health care, free college, free childcare, free retirement, free vacations, government-funded guaranteed healthy food, and more, and no planes, cows, cars, oil or gas. I want you to think about this. Every single time you are offered something for free, in this case, these are promises they can never keep and you will give up your freedom. You give up more control of your life to a bureaucrat, and you lose the ability to make choices to do what's in the best interest of you and your family. By the way (ph), I told you Bernie Sanders. He owns three homes, has seven- figure income. Why doesn't he share his own money? And Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez loves to take planes instead of the train, the Acela, Amtrak despite her calls to abolish air travel. And her motto should be \"Do as I say,\" not as \"I do.\" And in addition to everything else, Democrats also want to hand out free cash now to every American. No strings attached. Look at Cory Booker's hometown in Newark, New Jersey. They are doing a test, universal basic income program. You have dark horse. Democratic candidate Andrew Yang grabbing headlines for weighing in on male circumcision, deciding that for people, also proposing we give each and every American $1,000 a month. How are we going to pay for that? Take corporations, look, like Amazon, for example. Take a look. ANDREW YANG, 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So I'm proposing a freedom dividend where every adult in America starting at age 18 would receive $1,000 a month, free and clear to do whatever they want. And what this would do, this would enable millions of Americans to more effectively make transitions, as we are in the midst of right now the greatest economic and technological transformation in the history of our country. We're calling it the fourth industrial revolution--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I'm sure Mr. Yang's proposal seems like as good faith attempt to help poor and the working class, deal with challenges the people have. Handing out money, no strings attached, is dangerous. First thing it will do is destroy incentive to work hard and better your life. When you take 70 percent of the income of people and 90 percent of corporate income, well, nobody is going to want to do anything. Where is this money coming from? Who is funding this? Look at what happened in Finland. They tried universal basic income. That experiment failed to completely get anybody back to work. Here's what the left doesn't get. Higher taxes, 70 percent for individuals, 90 percent for corporations, as proposed, burdensome regulation, massive government programs, they will drive every business out of this country, leaving fewer and fewer taxpayers to deal with the bigger and bigger tax bill, because as it turns out, nothing is free, everything has a cost. Somebody has got to pay for it. Look at the middle-class exodus from New York and California and New Jersey, and Illinois. Because the 70 percent top marginal rate, the 90 percent top corporate rate, it's going to make it impossible. No business can survive. They will all leave. No wonder we'll -- Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez owes taxes reportedly on her 2012 failed business. And guess who's hurt the most by all of this? The people they purport to help. The poor and the working class. Because the truth is the free enterprise system has led more people out of poverty and created the higher standard of living than any other economic system in history. And while we should do everything we can do to help the forgotten men and women in this country, they matter most, which Trump is doing, after Obama added 13 million more Americans to food stamps, he added 8 million more Americans to poverty. Remember the standard of living among the poor and working class in America is better than almost any other place on earth because of our capitalist system. Look at Pew Research. Even Americans who are considered poor are actually middle-class when you look at the global scale. Findings by the Heritage Foundation. The vast majority of Americans living in \"deep poverty of air condition and computer, cell phones.\" Now, in my life, I've lived paycheck-to-paycheck. Let me be the first to say that is not what we want for every citizen. We want every American to have better and more lives than just the bare necessities. But if you compare poverty in America, places like Venezuela, Cuba, all these other countries, there is suffering all across Latin America. Honduras, they have a 66 percent poverty rate. Conservatism, capitalism, freedom works. Limited regulations, low taxes allow businesses to thrive. That creates jobs for --opportunities for everyone. JFK did it, Reagan did it, and we now see Donald Trump doing it. Now, with near record low unemployment, a record number of Americans employed to million more jobs available than people on unemployment, the best wage growth in a decade under Donald Trump, finally we're energy- independence for the first time in 70 years. And we're going to have millions of high-paying jobs in the energy industry if government doesn't take it over. They want to roll all of that back. Hopefully, the American people know better than this. They won't fall for the bait and switch. It seems great. Everything is free. Nationalizing the health care and energy industries, tampering with the markets, mandating what car you can drive, what you can eat, getting rid of oil, gas, planes, free money for those unwilling to work? That will be a disaster. Socialism has been a failure every time it has been tried. It has resulted in some of the biggest and largest amount of human suffering in history. So tonight, remember, as we go through this election process, one thing. Surrendering control of everything to the government, and they promise to take all your fears away and guarantee everything is going to be great, how did keep your doctor, keep your plan and save money work out? That's only one aspect. The government taking all your hard-earned money, it's not going to lead to economic prosperity. Don't fall for the false promises, the scare tactics, the hysteria, playing on your fears. It's all part of their plan. They want the control of every aspect of your life. They want you more dependent on them so you will keep them in power. What is taking place right now, this is a defining moment in American politics. Two radically different agendas and ideas for our future are on display. One of them, racking up success after success after success. It's time for America to stay the course. The Trump agenda is setting records where it's most important. Helping people with a ladder up to success. Helping businesses invest and build factories and manufacturing centers, and create jobs in places like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan. Radical 2020 Democrats, they are on a mission. They will roll it all back and America will become unrecognizable. You won't believe what happened, for example, to an ICE agent while detaining an illegal immigrant. So we're going to get to that next. But our warning of the day, socialism will lead to an America you won't recognize. It won't be the same America for your kids and grandkids. Our Villain of the Day, you mail, next."

Illegal immigrant Christopher Santos Felix was released because of New York City sanctuary city policies. Here's the story. He overstayed his visa in 2015, then racked up a criminal record, including charges of driving while intoxicated and assault. ICE put a detainer on Felix after an assault charge in September. NYPD never handed him over to the feds because of New York's sanctuary city status. ICE had to go after him on its own. And during his arrest earlier this month, well, he bit off a piece of an ICE agent's finger. Pretty disgusting. We can stop things like that. All right. Time for viewer mail. One viewer writes \"I don't think most of the Dems who support the New Green Deal ever read it.\" Another writing, \"Democrats believe they own the government and that American citizens are their subjects.\" Not true.
