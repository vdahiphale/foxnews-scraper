If he runs for president, he will never succeed. I don't understand. I don't understand the timing. The man is not even sworn in yet. Let's just recall the facts. Mitt Romney sought the endorsement of Donald Trump. He chased him around to get it. He got that endorsement. Then in March 2016, Romney gave the speech about candidate Trump saying that he was a fraud. He was a phony and that his promises were worth nothing. The president was elected and forgave him. Took him to dinner and invited him to the golf club. They talked possibly about a cabinet position. It didn't work out. And now Romney returns it with this. By the way, when Romney was running for Senate in Utah just a few months ago, he didn't bring up these criticisms and the president endorsed him. So that's how he repays the kindness of the president. I wonder if Mitch McConnell when he said showboat or show horse is opposed to work horse was thinking of Mitt Romney.",

So, he was kind of getting mixed in there with another movement that's going on. And I don't think he is really a part of that. He supports Democrats. He supports those that are black Democrats.

I mean, I don't think the president has any plans of getting rid of that any time soon. He also asked the president to pardon Larry Hoover, one of the most notorious gangsters in American history. And I don't see the president with his pardon pen out any time in the near future. So, once again, he might like the president when it comes to policy. Him and the president are 50 degrees apart.",

He brought them to the White House, to the Situation Room, to have a conversation with Secretary Nielsen so she could brief them on all the crisis that's going on in the border. These numbers are devastating, they are sad, they are needless, and they are senseless. And Democrats wanted nothing to do with it. In fact, the president opened the meeting. He then turned to Secretary Nielsen, introduced her and said, \"Now, she's going to begin her briefing.\" Within five seconds, Chuck Schumer prompted Nancy Pelosi to cut Secretary Nielson off which she dutifully did within seconds. And then the entire presentation was basically over. I bet that the secretary probably said 50 words in the entire presentation. Which tells you a couple of things. One is the Democrats didn't know, didn't believe, and didn't care about anything Secretary Nielsen had to say. Had they been there to listen instead of talk?"

They would now know that CBP has arrested 17,000 convicted criminals in one year coming into this country. ICE has detained almost 4,000 known or suspected terrorists. Thousands of gang members have been arrested in our border, as well. Nancy Pelosi refused to listen to those numbers.

Will he be more willing to negotiate then? He's asking Democrats to give on their end. They do not want to pride funding for the -- provide funding for this border wall. I just wonder what is President Trump willing to give up at this point to make a deal."

And here is how you know that, the bill that Nancy Pelosi is touting that she put forward actually funds foreign aid more than it does border security. She wants to give more of Americans money to foreign countries than she wants to give more of Americans money to foreign countries than she wants to spend on protection of our own citizens. That's to tell you all you need to know."

Or is the president sort of feel like he's been put in a corner here?"

      "speaker": "GIDLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the consensus seems to be that Nancy Pelosi would be more able to negotiate once she secure her spot as Speaker of the House. So, that's going to be interesting how that plays out tomorrow. But the president is very clear because not only has he been repeated over and over again where he stands in his protection to American people. But now the Democrats are on record again. Standing with people who are here illegally. That's a watershed moment for this country, and entire party refuses to address what they say they want, which is border security. But they don't want border security, they voted down every measure to support the American people."

But what I can tell you is the president has been clear what he wants on his desk is a bill that opens the government, that funds the government, and protects the American people. And right now, the Democrats are not serious about that. And you know they're not serious because serious people with serious plans and serious proposals don't negotiate in the press."

He's already had record-setting accomplishments and record- setting time, and he wants to come through on this one because the crisis of the border is not going away where we were years ago. Democrats are now pushing forward with status quo money, and status quo legislation, and we are not in status quo. We're in full-on crisis mode.  The president knows that. And so do the American people. He's going to stand with them."

You just heard that conversation. A lot of people are wondering, how can there be a cabinet meeting, a briefing in the Situation Room, eight leaders from both parties, from both chambers of commerce, and the president, and the White House just told us nothing changed today, how can that be?"

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's -- what was this talk do? And I thank the president for putting the meeting together because that's what has changed. The president -- remember, the vice president went to Senator Schumer whose Senator Schumer could determine whether government stayed open or was shut down more than 13 days ago. And he made an offer to them. Schumer never got back to him, shut the government down because what your viewers have to remember is not a simple majority in the Senate. It takes 60 votes. So, it's the Democrats who decided about a shutdown. The president stays here with the vice president, wants to work this out, Democrat leadership leaves. So, he brought everybody together. Inside the Situation Room, we were invited to go because we're going to have a briefing. That's what happens in Situation Rooms about the crisis that's happening at the border today. The rise of those who are trying to come across the border. But more importantly, just within the last 48 hours, we had a violent mob kind of run across, try to get across the border as well. So, we were having a briefing with the Secretary of Homeland. She couldn't get past the first sentence before she was interrupted by Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. And they pretty much stayed on script. Almost like they had written the script. And they went through what they want to do these six appropriation bills move through. And then not do anything with Homeland Security. And you know what --"

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

It could -- the number of times I had to ask the Democrats. \"OK, what is your offer then?\" Or I couldn't even get them to define what's border security. They say they believe in border security. Then, I took it to the next level, OK, could you define what border security is for me?  Because they don't want to talk about having a wall. That's an element of border security. When you look at San Diego, El Paso, Yuma, Arizona. These have all cut down and made the community safe by more than 95 percent after being able to put some border security wall, as well.  So, this is a real part --"

You know, when it's that confusing, it's probably smart to step back. And this is what I think President Trump is banking on. You step back and you look at the big picture. And he's looking at the big picture and he's saying, I'm standing up for border security. And you -- and I'm against people who are -- don't -- you know, they don't like my wall, and they don't like -- and there's are elements of that group of people who are in favor of abolishing ICE and sanctuary cities and things like that. And he looks at that, he says, \"I can win that fight.\" And you -- and you have that going on at the same time that he's having the debate about Syria, pulling out of Syria, and the quote that you had which is a very good one for him.

The 33-year- old gang member did not enter a plea because his lawyers arguing that Arriaga is not competent to stand trial. Perez-Arriaga was captured on Friday in Bakersfield California after a 55- hour manhunt. Police say he was trying to flee back to Mexico. Arriaga is accused of shooting and killing Newman police officer Ron Singh the day after Christmas. Officer Singh had stopped Arriaga on suspicion of driving under the influence. The suspect had also been arrested for drunk driving in 2011 and 2014. And in most states after those arrests, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement or ICE would have been notified of Arriaga illegal status, but under California's sanctuary laws, local police are prevented from cooperating with federal immigration agents. Several California sheriffs blame the law for Officer Singh's death and today President Trump weighed in. Watch."

We're interested in bringing up something the House has passed, 60 senators will support, and the President will sign. In other words, make a law. The legislation that House Democrats are reporting -- reportedly planning to introduce and be voted on tomorrow will not be a serious contribution to the negotiations that are going on between the administration and the incoming Democratic majority in the House. It isn't comprehensive, it ignores the needs of border security. It's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect if the incoming House Democrats are choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping to govern the country. In other words, a total non-starter. So these new Democrats come to Washington ready to roll up their sleeves, work together, and make laws, or are they going to waste time on partisan show votes that will do nothing to move the country in a forward direction.  That's the question political performance, art, or responsible governance.  Well, we'll get an early signal in the next few days but let me make it perfectly clear one more time as I've said consistently for the last two weeks, the Senate will not waste its time considering a Democratic bill which cannot pass this chamber in which the president will not sign.

But his record now of returning good gestures by the president with this kind of ingratitude, and worse, obloquy, is really an embarrassment. He will never be president. If he runs for president, he will never succeed. I don't understand. I don't understand the timing. The man is not even sworn in yet. Let's just recall the facts. Mitt Romney sought the endorsement of Donald Trump. He chased him around to get it. He got that endorsement. Then in March 2016, Romney gave the speech about candidate Trump saying that he was a fraud. He was a phony and that his promises were worth nothing. The president was elected and forgave him. Took him to dinner and invited him to the golf club. They talked possibly about a cabinet position. It didn't work out. And now Romney returns it with this. By the way, when Romney was running for Senate in Utah just a few months ago, he didn't bring up these criticisms and the president endorsed him. So that's how he repays the kindness of the president. I wonder if Mitch McConnell when he said showboat or show horse is opposed to work horse was thinking of Mitt Romney."

He said that if he ran as hard and pushed as hard against Barack Obama in the campaign as he is doing against Donald Trump, he might have won. And that's entirely true. You know, has Mitt Romney played team sports? Does he understand anything about the situation that his colleague, his Republican colleague Donald Trump is in now? Challenges by the Democrats. Of course, the constant challenge of the media and the like. By the way, you know, you said he didn't back down. He went on CNN. Now that's courageous to go on CNN to criticize the president.

The Russian federal security service announced his arrest on their web site three days after he suddenly disappearing, saying only that he was caught during an espionage operation.

Whelan's arrest comes just weeks after Maria Butina, a Russian woman in the U.S. admitted being a Russian secret agent for the Kremlin trying to infiltrate U.S. political groups. And some say Whelan's arrest is a response to that. U.S. and Russian relations have deteriorated greatly over recent years over Russian meddling in U.S. elections, Russian's actions in Ukraine, and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K. which led for tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions for a 100 diplomats.

He said that if the Russian charges were untrue, we would immediately demand his release. But he did not say that Paul Whelan was an innocent man. However, everything points to a retribution, an action that was taken by the Russian government. And it had to be at a very senior level.

It's unlikely that he was working for the CIA given his discharge the bad conduct discharge. However, there are other intelligence agencies. So, first of all, the U.S. government will quickly determine whether or not he was on a contract of some kind for someone. But whether or not he was, there will immediately be negotiations began about his release. And I think what Putin may be trying to do is to just signal to President Trump that if Donald Trump wants good relations with Russia, this kind of thing has to stop. And that's unfortunate because Donald Trump is not wrong in seeking to work with the Russians where we can work the Russians -- with the Russians. But Vladimir Putin has been so aggressive in the area, so aggressive towards the Ukraine, et cetera, that it's very hard to work with him. If he approved such an arrest of an innocent man, that's a very serious issue."

There is a lot of youth that just don't know really know what is the army is all about. And so, an awareness issue is one. I think the second thing we have is we have a challenge with finding quality in some cases. Most youth are they either have in some cases some medical challenges that may prevent them from joining the military as well as some other challenges, physical challenges that prevent them from joining the military.

Those 22, when you look at them, they are high propensity for quality applicants who really want to join the military and want to join the army.

When they see our recruiters that are in uniform, to me, that's an awareness issue. And that's a point that allows them to understand that hey, look, I can be just like this person in uniform. And then they get a chance to see the talent of our recruiters and our army. We do have some talented individuals that are recruiting. Some of who have degrees, whether it's a bachelor's or master's degree. And it really resonates with these young kids that hey, look, I'm wearing the uniform. I'm defending my country, I have an education and I'm doing extremely well and I can make a difference in my life and have a great career."

Kanye tweeting on New Year's Day Trump all day adding \"From now on I'm performing with my mother bleeping hat on,\" a reference to his make America great again hat. Here is Kimberly Klacik, Republican strategist, and Richard Fowler, a Fox News contributor. Good evening to both of you. So, Kimberly, I will start with you first. The president responding to Kanye's words today seems to be embracing the support of Kanye West."

      "speaker": "KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. I don't think they ever had a falling out. I think honestly Kanye West was trying to remove himself from a movement that he wasn't really a part of. Kanye West is unpredictable just like the president he is unpredictable. And they kind of move to the own beat of their drum. Right? So, he was kind of getting mixed in there with another movement that's going on. And I don't think he is really a part of that. He supports Democrats. He supports those that are black Democrats. I think he just really wants to support the black community and I think that was getting lost before, so now he is reaffirming that he is a Trump supporter."

      "speaker": "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the thing. I think he does support President Trump. Sadly, when it comes to the issues as you remember from the White House meeting a couple months ago, the president and Donald Trump seem to be completely unaligned. Case in point is when Kanye talked about fixing the 13th amendment which says if you are in prison that you don't -- you lose your rights and Kanye says we need to get rid of that. I mean, I don't think the president has any plans of getting rid of that any time soon. He also asked the president to pardon Larry Hoover, one of the most notorious gangsters in American history. And I don't see the president with his pardon pen out any time in the near future. So, once again, he might like the president when it comes to policy. Him and the president are 50 degrees apart."

      "utterance": "But I don't think that's true. OK. Well, I don't think that's true. I think President Trump is doing, you know, more than President Obama. I remember President Obama not even supporting school vouchers as his kids went to private school which would help the black community. He is helping with black unemployment. He is helping with HBCUs, prison reform, the farm bill will eventually help the black community as well. He's got the urban revitalization coalition going on. I think Kanye West sees what he is doing and it's much more than what President Obama ever like attempted to do."

      "utterance": "Neither am I. But let's talk about this. The president one thing that he touts us though, black unemployment rate. But yet still he is not dealing with the real issues facing the African-American community number one, being the alarming infant mortality rate or the number of black women who die at childbirth. These are real issues facing the black community. We heard nothing from this president about that."

    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I mean, I have. But to say that the president did it all on his own that's irresponsible. Remember, the economy when President Obama got it was in the hole. And what President Obama did was he stabilized it and President Trump is benefiting from that. But, once again, this segment is about Kanye West and his policies and the president's policies are unaligned."

And I think Kanye West is making sure people know it's OK to be a free-thinker. It's OK to support our president. When everybody supported President Obama that was fine. It's OK to support your president. This your country and that's who you should support."
