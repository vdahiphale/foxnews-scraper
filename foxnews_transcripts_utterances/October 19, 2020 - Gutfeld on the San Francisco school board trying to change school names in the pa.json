Can you starve these stories, as Jesse was mentioning about -- can you starve them to death?

On the remote days, the nonverbal ones who have to sit there in front of the computer screen for hours staring and not participating. And the only student of hers that actually is succeeding right now is because his mother sits with him the whole time and helps him. So, what about the families with two working parents or another mother I talked to who works in New York hotel. She's to take off from work at least one day a week to help her son and she's an hour and a half commute. Every family has a story.

He'll massively raise your taxes, Biden. He's going to raise your taxes. First time I've ever heard of a politician. He's running on raising taxes. That's how crazy the world has become. He's probably the worst in the history of presidential politics. Win, lose, or draw, win, lose, or draw, this man should not be a president. Number one, he is corrupt.

Joe Biden is running on the Coronavirus, which now isn't even one of the top three issues in the country right now. It's not even the leading cause of death in this country. It's far behind cancer and heart disease. And he's looks like he was accused of a massive scandal and is hiding from it. He's not facing it head on. And if you look at the books, Juan, it is a felony for a public official to promise a benefit to a foreign country in exchange for something of value to a relative. And that's what happened in Ukraine. We also know that his son was holding 10 for the big guy after he flew over in Air Force Two, which we paid for to China and then came back. That has not been explained. Hunter's business partner, who is in prison, flipped, has over 26,000 emails, which are being looked into. And there is more stuff that's going to come out on Joe Biden, on China. And Juan, I don't want you to get too far out on a limb protecting Joe Biden. It's -- when the stuff comes out, it's going to hurt your credibility. It's going to then hurt the shows credibility. So just dial it back a little bit and just wait and see."

      "utterance": "Well, they are basically making their final arguments right now. But you would think it's kind of passed that. By the time we get to Thursday's debate, and it's estimated that one-third of likely voters in this country will have already voted. So that's, you know, that's a lot of votes that are already in the bank, a lot of them also for President Trump. The mail-in ballots did not -- an early voting did not just go Biden's way, especially in rural counties, in Michigan and Minnesota, for example. And I think new voter registration is going to have a really big impact. And I think that if you look back to the beginning of the Trump campaign, which started in January of 2016, actually. They had a concerted effort early on to register new voters. Like 100,000 in Florida, 77,000 in Pennsylvania. You know, trying to get a little cushion. I think the president is going to Arizona because he knows that they could have some trouble there. You heard him -- we played it here. He says to the campaign three weeks ago. I didn't think we were going to win or I wasn't confident saying that. Today, he feels a little bit more confident. I think between now and Thursday, what you will see him try to do is win every single day on the news cycle, whether he can or not. I do think it's interesting that Joe Biden has decided to call a lid for four days. I mean, that's -- it's an interesting strategy. Can you starve these stories, as Jesse was mentioning about -- can you starve them to death? Just to have them come up again on Thursday night and have to freshly try to defend yourself, or could you have tried to defend yourself and then say I already answered this and try to move on? That will be interesting."

He's calling a lid, because he needs to -- whatever is going on in his life. It does not inspire confidence. That guy is under a lid more than King Tut. It's just very strange. You know who needs to be under a lid is Jeffrey Toobin. Someone should tell him there's a difference between a Zoom call and a Zoom lens, because I think he got it confused. But I think what you said, like, you know, are they trying to starve these stories? You don't have to starve a story if no one's eating, right? Like, it's not like the media is chasing the story down. And it's a huge story. This makes the Steele dossier look like the Hardy Boys. And this is real. I mean, no one is denying these emails. No one is denying this stuff isn't happening. And it is -- this China thing is a big deal. But if -- the media is not chasing it, instead, what they are doing is they are essentially Trump's stenographer, right? Like, Trump said this. Trump said that. Because he says everything, right? You can fashion a narrative. That is all the media is doing is they are Gladys from Bewitched, constantly screaming about how awful he is and what he just said. Meanwhile, there is this giant glowing meteor of a story, and they are not going near it, unsubstantiated. That didn't stop them with the tax returns."

So for example, the RNC and Trump campaign have coordinated a blitz of ad buys right now in Arizona, where he was today, Iowa, North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin. And they are still running their ads, of course, in Pennsylvania and Florida. The Biden campaign pulled ads on Friday from Texas, Virginia, and Colorado. Likely conceding Texas is red and thinking likely that Colorado and Virginia are in the bag. And the Trump campaign -- why are you smiling? And the Trump campaign pulled ads from Ohio and Minnesota. Likely -- and so I just -- I think that's where we can see where their priorities are shifting in the next two weeks. And that's going to be a good indicator, too, of where they think they have it in the bag and where they think they need to continue earning votes."

Because you don't want anyone to take anything for granted, and certainly not after not after 2016, there is a lesson right there. So, I mean, you should have learned your lesson.

I beg to differ respectfully with one thing that you said, Juan. And that I think the Biden camp is worried about how well and how much better Trump is doing with non-white voters than he did in 2016. So according to FiveThirtyEight, he is up 11 points with African-American voters and 14 points with Hispanic-American voters since 2016. And granted, he is losing ground with some white voters. But at the same time, we know that in the key battleground states, registrations have increased 10 points with white, non-college-educated over 30 voters. So to your point, it's not in the bag yet. But certainly, there is a lot of statistics in his favor."

      "utterance": "And I think his basement right now is 260. He only needs to pick off one in that upper Midwest region. If you just look at the early vote by mail, this is a Trump landslide in the making. Democrats have to outperform by mail two and a half to one to 2-1, because they are not going to be able to overwhelm election date turnout by Republicans. Now, it's 50/50. Republicans are actually winning early vote by mail in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio, and are also right behind there in Arizona. And Democrats are doing very poorly in early vote by mail in Florida. So if you also look at just registrations, JP Morgan predicts the Republican President, Donald Trump, is going to win Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona, just on registration alone. And so also, party affiliation. In 2016, it was D plus three. Gallup has it now, Republican plus one. So why are these national polling people over- sampling Democrats by nine? There is no way Joe Biden is winning in a double-digit landslide. That is like a Reagan-Mondale situation, where you win 40 out of the 50 states. No one believes that's happening. And if you go to the state polls, Trafalgar has the president tied or ahead in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. And he was the most accurate state pollster in the last two cycles."

Twitter, I think, is in a lot more trouble than Facebook, but all of them are going to have to answer to this. And what Republicans are going to ask for and conservatives are as for is just treat us equally. Because there was a kerfuffle over the weekend where John James, the Michigan Republican candidate for Senate, his opponent deceptively edited something that he said, they tried to get a change, nobody would respond to them. And then the Biden campaign had something that happened to them with the Trump campaign, immediately that issue was taken care of.

I could go on. I have a whole list here. And I think that the key point for the president is that I actually think this deal and getting this deal done would help him the most going into this debate on Thursday night because he's the deal maker. He's the one that can tell the Senate who wants to do $500 billion and she wants to do $2 trillion. If he could -- he could bring them together and put them in the room, it is the right thing to do for the country. It is imperative that they get it done sooner than later because every day that you wait means that there's another -- it's lag time. And you're going to get into the winter, and people that are on -- now on -- finding themselves on food stamps or having to go to the food bank, because all they want to do is work, but we're not helping them. That is unconscionable. And I think that he's the one that could actually be the difference maker here if he wants to be. But he's got to get on the phone with these Republicans and say, I am telling you, this is what I want. This is my priority.

But we brought so much -- so many people out of poverty. Five million people were brought out of poverty in the first three years of the administration. That's a record. They had it down to 10.5 percent poverty rate, another record. And to hear about more millions of people going into poverty because they want to play politics with this, it's sad and they're actually hurting themselves, because blue states have twice as high of a jobless rate than red states.

It doesn't. It's just more radical destruction by delusional scolds who have as much interest in helping kids as COVID itself. Schools included are Abe Lincoln High, George Washington High, Roosevelt Middle School, but also get this Dianne Feinstein Elementary. Why? Because she once replaced a vandalized confederate flag. Why isn't she on death row? So, all these schools must come up with new names while they deal with COVID which is like trying to iron your socks during a house fire. So, why not help them with names the S.F. board might love? How about Mao? He's no dead white male and how about that Great Leap Forward. He cleared a mountain of bodies. Or Stalin, he never owned a single slave, instead, enslaved millions and then killed them. Or let's replace Feinstein with Sir John Harrington. He invented the first flushable toilet and the city is drowning in crap. But given its success of THE FIVE, isn't it time for our names to grade schools? I've come up with a few.
