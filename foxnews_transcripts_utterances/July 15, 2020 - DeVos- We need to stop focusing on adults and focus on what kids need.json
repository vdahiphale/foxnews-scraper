This afternoon, though, in Georgia, the President laid out his plans for rebuilding America's infrastructure. In the Peach State, which is now a toss-up - it's a toss-up category, the President also warned again about the mail-in ballots, which is sure to be a big theme going forward. Also, tonight, a new poll that shows that Pennsylvania voters believe that there is strong unspoken support for President Trump in their state, despite the top line poll numbers. We're going to show you those new numbers in our next segment when Ari Fleischer and Richard Goodstein join me in just a bit. But first tonight, beyond the virus itself, there's another dynamic at play in the charged battle over returning to school. It's a COVID-19 laced election year showdown between school choice and teachers' unions."

It's what they want, it's what their parents want. But as you may know, the teachers' unions and the politicians that they support, are very against these new charters for a number of reasons. So Joe Biden has changed his view over the years on charter schools. Here he is just a few months back."

If their school is closed, might they have the opportunity to use the taxpayer dollars allocated to their student to go somewhere else?"

And we know for a lot of students this spring, their experience in their assigned schools was less than ideal, less than optimal. A lot of kids who didn't even continue to have any learning opportunities presented to them. We also know that parents have become frustrated. As we talk about schools reopening again, it seems to be centered more around adult needs and issues than it is about what's right for kids. And I hear, again, right here in suburban Washington, Fairfax County Schools are going out with a plan that would have kids in school a maximum of two days a week in-person and starting at 10:00 am."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVOS",
      "utterance": "Well, every state has that opportunity and I urge every state to look seriously at expanding the choice programs they already have, or create new ones to meet the need of - needs of these families. And from the federal level, we're looking at every option and every opportunity. We know there are families who have a crying need for something different for their children. They've seen their kids and their education up close and personal the last several months. And many of them realize for the first time that perhaps their kid learns very differently than they did - then that parent thought they did."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, that - I think it's true. I mean, that there's a lot of schools, something like 56 percent of schools stopped even taking attendance online. And we know that there's a lot of kids, especially in urban areas who just didn't have what they needed. They didn't have the laptop, they didn't have the structure, in some cases, to be able to perform. But I think a lot of people listen to what you're saying and they say, look, school is supposed to start in a few weeks. The parents need to get back to work. So in a - from a practical perspective it's great what you're talking about, but does that option exist for them right now? Can they say, I'm going to pull my kid out of the public school and send them to this Catholic school or this charter school with the money that is public?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVOS",
      "utterance": "Well, the public money has come through state choice programs and states are looking at increasing those programs. But practically speaking, from the federal level, what the federal government needs to do is first of all ensure that poor kids who are in these schools right now have the chance to continue going. Most of them have been directly economically impacted, and there's a real risk of these schools having to shut down. That would be tragic for the kids that they're serving - that those schools serve and, would be tragic for America in general."

Because if some of these kids lose three months of learning, how to read, how to do math, and then they lose more time this fall. And it just - it doesn't get discussed enough. And I asked her, can they start early? Can they start August 1st? Or will they go through vacation breaks to make up this time? And basically what I heard was no, we don't have the money to do that. Here's what she had to say. Listen to this."

      "speaker": "DEVOS",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly we all want school to be safe for kids. But the reality is, the science tells us that in - being in school is safe for children. There was just a study that came out from Germany on Monday that suggests that actually kids might even be stoppers of the virus. That it was over 2,000 kids studied and the virus did not spread, did not grow in any way. The science says it is safe for kids to be in school. We clearly have to follow guidelines around hygiene, wearing masks when appropriate, and ensuring that teachers have distance and protection. But this can be done. It's a matter of will. And it's a convenient argument to make now when you - we don't use, say - you follow the science. Well, let's follow the science indeed. And let's ensure that kids can get back into school and that parents and families that need to have their kids in school five days a week have that option."

I mean, some kids in perfect circumstances, I'm sure, did fine. But, overall, remote learning has been a failure. So how is it OK for the depart of education to look at what's going on in the country and say, OK, so all these districts decided that they're going to go online learning in the fall, and we're just going to have further fall back. And a lot of people are looking to you to say, NO, that is not acceptable. That's not what the President wants. That's not what the administration wants. We are - we will provide a path for you to get back to school in six weeks. People say they don't have that path."

You said before when I asked you what the federal government might provide in terms of a path for a parent who says no I want - I want them to go to this other school that - you kick back to the state. So if I'm a parent who's saying what are my options? I want choice and my state doesn't provide it, my community doesn't provide it. The federal government, it sounds like, doesn't have any path for that parent either at this moment, is that correct?"

And there's a real opportunity for this and I expect that there's going to be leadership up on the Hill to do just that. The administration is advancing this. And we need to make sure that we are focused on doing what's right for every kid, because we know that those that are most vulnerable, those that are from families that are most fragile, the lowest income families are the ones that are going to be most deeply affected by the lack of focus on kids and their futures. And the focus instead on a narrative that is paying attention more to a system that that is indefensible in too many places."

Georgia is now rated a toss-up state with Biden holding a two-point lead, according to the latest CBS battleground tracker. In another poll out of Pennsylvania where Biden holds a commanding lead, in the internals of that poll - this is this is interesting - 57 percent believe that there are secret voters in their communities who support Trump, but aren't telling the pollsters which way they lean. And then when asked do you think some of those voters exists for Biden as well - secret Biden supporters, only 27 percent said that they think the same is true of Biden.

And I think when you when you look at our culture today, and when you look at the price you can pay for wearing a MAGA hat, for going into a store with a Trump sign on, and the way you get attacked. You go to a restaurant to have a meal and you get thrown out of the restaurant. People get used to this and they say, I'm just not going to talk about it anymore. And it's the intolerance that then makes people a hidden voter. So I do think that's a legitimate factor. It's very hard to say with precision what percentage of an electorate it is. But it is a reason for hope. For Donald Trump and for his campaign. They have to do better still, but that is a fact that's out there."

And I look at what's going on here in New York, police officers getting bashed over the head and bleeding. It's unbelievable what we're seeing. And I think perhaps some of that, secret voter or whatever you want to call it, the dissatisfaction with what's going on in the streets may evolve, may become more of a factor.

The Quinnipiac Poll today nationally had him down 15. The Monmouth Poll in Pennsylvania had him down 13. At this exact time four years ago Quinnipiac had him up two in Pennsylvania. Look, and if you look at the generic ballot, Democrats are up nine. If you look at Right Track Wrong Direction, 75 percent of public says wrong direction. Satisfied, dissatisfied, the Gallup has been asking that question forever, 20 percent of the country says they're satisfied. So the answer to, are there hidden Trump voters? You know, Donald Trump says there may be a miracle end to the coronavirus. Let's hope so. And I'm sure the Trump people have to hold on to the hope that there is a hidden Trump vote, because otherwise they'd give up hope. And Democrats are trumpatized--"

I think though, given this unbelievable combination of events that we have lived through in the past year, it's a little difficult to read into the meaning of that number at this point, and I guess we'll see. I want to put up The Cook Political Report, because I thought this was an interesting visual. This is where they have the electoral college right now. And they have Joe Biden with the blue balls in his mason jar, up at that level, being able to hit 270. And what they're demonstrating is that President Trump would need to win all of the states in his jar, plus all of the states in the middle including Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania - Maine isn't there, Arizona. He has to win all those in the middle, Ari, and then also pick up 11 of the lean Dem electoral votes that are in Biden's jar at this point. Do you - what do you think of that assessment?"

      "utterance": "Well, it's not like Wuhan, because we don't know what Wuhan was like, because their numbers weren't real, and that's the first. And they were cooking numbers on purpose, trying to make it look better than it actually was. Look, it's bad. I mean, we have a lot of infections, a lot of numbers. We see the numbers. We see the testing. I don't - I've talked repeatedly over the last four weeks with the administrator of the largest public health hospital here, the public sector hospital here. It's going to be a strain, but they are managing it as best they can. I don't think we're in that situation or even some of the things you saw in New York. So, look, it's bad. It's not great. But I don't think we're anywhere - I don't think comparing us to Wuhan is probably a bit too far, given the fact that one was catastrophic. They had government - they had hospital overruns there. We don't have that here. And we don't know what Wuhan's real numbers were, because they didn't tell us. So, on the first point about the tests. Yes, look, that doesn't mean the positives that they sent to the state, we're not positive, those numbers are real and those cases are real. What it would do, however, is influenced the positivity rate, right. The number of - if you have labs that are only forwarding the tests that are positive and not the ones that - the numbers or the ones that are negative, then obviously your positivity rate, which is what a lot of people are keeping an eye on, is going to be higher than it needs to."

They don't have any more ICU beds there. Then we're also hearing some reports of shortages and some places have PPE shortages and all of that. Is that what you're seeing? I mean, that's not good."

And by the way, about 40 percent of the patients that are hospitalized and identified as COVID patients may be there for an unrelated reason. That's good. They're not being treated for COVID. The bad news is though, you have to use PPE, you have to isolate them, it puts a strain on the staff. So I'm not saying things are perfect here. They do have capacity to create new ICU unit beds, that they have the capacity to do. And, again, I talked to the mayor of the county today and the hospital, it is certainly going to be dicey. It's going to be tough. They're at their limits in many ways. But they feel confident that even as they model out this thing's peak here in the next two to three weeks, but they have the resources to handle it as long as they have Remdesivir in sufficient quantities, and as long as we get those PPEs delivered, obviously."

The NYPD releasing bloody images of the injured officer. Chief of department Terence Monahan suffering a head injury and two others required stitches. The NYPD tweeting that this is not peaceful protest and will not be tolerated but demonstrators say that the violence goes both ways. One of our occupiers went home with a gash in his head and is in the hospital.

And, you know, they learn habits and things that really are not conducive to thinking about other people and thinking about the welfare of other people. And our society is breaking down in terms of the family values that you pass on, it's almost politically incorrect to talk about family values and about doing the right thing because then someone comes in and says, which family are you talking about? That's not right. There was a congressperson last week who said that a lot of this violent hate behavior is induced by the fact that people are poor and people are hungry. Give me a break. You know, I grew up around a lot of poor and hungry people and they weren't like that.

It's not going to be to individuals but it is going to be to programs. And one of the council people there, Shanika Smith, said that the reason for this is because slavery is this institution that serves as the starting point for the building of the strong economic floor for white America while attempting to keep blacks subordinate forever to its progress. That was one of her reasonings behind this program. Thought from you on that before we go?"

It's been a proud display of patriotism at stadiums large and small lever since. But now there are calls to cancel that tradition. An op-ed in the L.A. Times reads it's time to cancel (AUDIO GAP) that they say (AUDIO GAP). Joining me now, legendary coach Lou Holtz, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and a legend to everybody. Lou, great to see you tonight. You know, I guess with regards to the Star-Spangled Banner, tell us what it feels like as a coach to stand on the sidelines with your team when the national anthem is played at the beginning of a game."

Most of our teams had to stay in the locker rooms before they played the national anthem but I just said this about cancel the national anthem, who are they? What have they done? What office have they won? What in the world gets them the right other than the fact that they're going up there, there was never a valedictorian, everybody got a trophy, and everybody got everything they always wanted and now they decide they don't want the national anthem, tell me what in the world gives them the right to bring this up and to say that? We are having an election."

And you know, obviously you're not going to hear the Star-Spangled Banner at a football game if there is no football and those decisions have not been made, finally, yet. There's still some hope that some of us have but it sounds like you think the outlook is pretty grim."

Yes, you are going to have them, the (Inaudible) have said if you're sick, go see a doctor. But we are going to have it unless somebody has the leadership and be able to say, I look at things from both sides. A leader who look at from both sides. The player and the coaching side, where is right now they just look at it from a medical side we have one single case, we can't have it. Somebody has got the courage to step up and none of it going to happen. Once again, if you don't have colleges open, how in the world are you going to have a football team?"

It's like there have been something like 30 deaths of people under 25 years of age, yet, the virus, the normal flu, we had like 156 deaths of people under 30. Yes, this is dangerous for older people like me. If you have asthma, yes, that's a problem. But we just have to move on, we are shutting down a whole country, we are shutting sports, we are shutting down everything. And as you say, I can't believe I am in the United States. There isn't much united about the states."
