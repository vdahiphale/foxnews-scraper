Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley tweeting just a couple of moments ago, \"If we're ready to vote, we will vote. If we aren't ready, we won't vote.\" He is on the fence but they're trying to move this forward, that's pretty clear tonight. All of this comes on the heels of Kavanaugh's decision to speak out here last night.

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein telling us that she cannot guarantee that Dr. Ford will even be at Thursday's hearing to testify. Saying, she has quote no way of knowing for sure in the last few moments as well, an attorney for the second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, just revealed she is not going to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. There was an idea that she might. And as you noted, Republicans are announcing that they may vote in the committee, on the Judiciary Committee as early as Friday. A suggestion that they are moving forward with this process and that they are feeling confident that maybe they will have the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the High Court. Ford's legal team, the reason why they may not show up on Thursday. They are saying, they do not think she will get a quote, fair and respectful treatment because of Republican Mitch McConnell saying in his speech yesterday that her allegation is part of a \"smear campaign.\" Democrat Chuck Schumer, today demanded McConnell apologized for in Schumer's words politicizing the Supreme Court nomination process. Something that others believe has already been politicized. Now, a sticking point for the legal team was revealed in a letter to the Judiciary Committee. Where they object to Republicans hiring a special lawyer for Thursday's hearing writing this is inconsistent with \"Dr. Blasey Ford's repeated request through counsel that Senators conduct the questioning. This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate. Republicans say they want an experienced prosecutor who shows sensitivity to a potential victim of sexual misconduct in a matter like this. And they suspect the Democrats want the appearance of having the 11 Republican men on the committee pepper Dr. Ford with a whole series of questions and potentially look like they are bullying her just six weeks before the midterms.

      "utterance": "Also new tonight, Senate Judiciary staffers conducted a phone interview with Kavanaugh today, where he denied an allegation from that second woman I mentioned, who charged to The New Yorker that he exposed himself to her at Yale. The New York Times has said, it investigated that charge by the second accused of Deborah Ramirez, but could not corroborate it after interviewing several dozen people in the past week. Her lawyer says tonight, the committee has refused to meet scheduled appointments to hear her story. And that they think a better venue is to try and get the FBI to look at her accusation. That is unlikely to happen. A key Republican swing vote Lisa Murkowski, said earlier she was open to Ramirez getting a chance to testify but interesting that she added she does not want to see \"further delay\". And Republican Richard Burr said immediately following Thursday's hearing, the Judiciary panel should vote on the nomination. So the key there is while Democrats have been hoping to get more witnesses and delay this drag this out longer, you are seeing tonight, Republicans closing ranks and saying no we need to move forward as early as Friday with a committee vote. Then, we're hearing about the procedural vote, maybe Saturday and as early as Tuesday. A week from tonight, we may see a Senate floor vote on Kavanaugh up or down."

    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, there's considerable precedent for doing that. The issue though is that they haven't done that in this hearing. I mean, investigating committees often do that and they'll have a special counsel or a committee counsel who will lead the questioning. So, there's plenty of precedent for it. This is obviously all about the politics of appearances. This has really nothing to do with the substance of the questioning. The Senators, I'm sure all believe that their great question is although many may not be. But, this is not -- they want to have a woman questioning a woman. And the Democrats on the other side don't want to see that. They want to see a bunch of white guys questioning this -- and playing victim."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And all of the -- you know, there didn't get high marks for the way that they did the questioning. And some of them have since said that it didn't go well. So, it kind of -- I understand what the Democratic Senators are saying that they think it strikes them as odd that they're going to have someone else be their voice in that room."

But there's you know, there's ample precedent for it in the past, but it's -- this is really not about fact-finding at this point. This is about the appearances of -- that's really as always about. Now, the woman interrogator, I don't know who she is. She may be very good and she may be very, very strong on both sides. And strong toward this woman accuser in a way that wouldn't look so good if a man we're doing it, that's really the key."

It isn't about Republicans as it holds about a tiny handful of them, Lisa Murkowski being one of them. She sounds like she's ready to go that, that what she wanted to do is to see this woman have a chance to be heard, and then, not unless she delivers some staggeringly persuasive testimony that Kavanaugh cannot adequately rebut. And I think that -- you know, she's looks like she's going to go. Now, the question were not sure about Jeff Flake. Susan Collins is still out there. So, there's -- you know, there's still some votes out there. But if they can afford the Republicans can lose exactly one vote and get this nomination bill. One."

This judge had signaled that he was a supporter of Roe versus Wade. Do we think any of this would be happening? I guarantee it would not. And this is the root of this. His Roe versus Wade, a decision reached sort of almost out of nowhere that has been widely criticized even by many who like the result as a piece of sloppy, inventive legal reasoning. And we have been living with the consequences of it for 45 years. It took this issue, this highly controversial and sensitive issue out of the political process and made it a constitutional right. And we have been fighting over it ever since, it failed utterly to resolve the issue and this, this episode with all of Sturm und Drang and drama and pain is a further consequence of that one decision."

I mean it's a bit rich for the world's first Islamic extremist regime that's now been in place for 40 years to accuse others of racism, extremism, and Nazism which frankly in many ways is all that they've encompassed over these decades. I mean this is I think without doubt the most dangerous unpleasant regime in the world. And Trump -- and clearly John Bolton being there now is a very important influence but Trump is calling on Iran. He's saying, look you guys are sponsoring terrorism, you're spreading it you know, across your borders. The deal that Obama struck with you did not work far from taming you, it made you worse. And I have to say, it's very interesting but of all that was said today at the U.N. by Trump, Iran is the most interesting thing because today of all days the European Union's Foreign Minister Mrs Mogherini who by the way is unelected but never mind, and she said today the E.U. is facilitating easier trade with Iran. So you have Trump on collision course with the European Union over whether Iran are the good guys or the bad guys."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And you know, clearly this is all over the Iran deal and Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran deal and the E.U.'s pushback to that.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, as far as the E.U. is concern, no, they are committed to the Obama idea that we should treat around as our friends and that we should embrace them economically. The Trump-Bolton idea is these guys were given a chance with the Iran Nuclear Deal, they abused it. They became even more terroristic. They spread their bad message all over that region. So no, those new positions are uncompromising. From a British point of view, it's very interesting.

The question is, would they do the same if his supporters wanted to protest en masse, would their classes have also been canceled? The debate comes as we see him how much the higher education can shape opinions. In a recent Fox News poll, those with a college degree lean towards believing the accuser Christine Ford, while a .14 percent margin while those without a college degree seem to side with Kavanaugh by a 17- point margin. My next guest understands all of this. He argues that a lack of intellectual diversity is leaving students unprepared for the real world. Here and now is Greg Lukianoff, a speech lawyer, co-author of a New York Times bestseller, \"The Coddling of the American Minds: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting up a Generation of Failures.\" And there it is. So my first question for you, is, you know, first of all, these are law students that are protesting. And they have not yet heard the hearing."

      "utterance": "Well, we miss Joe Biden. Here's the presumption. Anything Trump, fair game, no rules when it comes to Trump or his nominees. They knew about this in July, they sit on it. We have an allegation that's collapsing. I've never been more upset than I am now. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan. I didn't do this to them. Judge Kavanaugh doesn't deserve this. Ms. Ford doesn't deserve what happened to her. We're going to play this out. And I can tell everybody who is listening. That everything about Judge Kavanaugh screams this is not true. He is not Bill Cosby. He's not Weinstein. He's lived a good life. This is an allegation 35 years old that's unverified and I'm not going to ruin his life based on that. Show me something credible that yet to do it."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That's incredible. Everyone -- everyone on one side of the aisle on the Hill is screaming for an FBI investigation and, Joe Biden who is pretty much the standard bearer of the Democratic Party says quite clearly there, that is simply not what they do."

    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The other side had this in July, they went seven weeks without bringing it up and they drop it a week or three or four days before we vote. The FBI has told me, we don't know how to help you. We don't know where to go, we don't know what town to go, we don't know what month to look at, we're not even sure about the year. So this is just an excuse to destroy this man's life. This is not about fairness, this is about destroying Brett Kavanaugh to make sure Trump doesn't get a second pick. It's about no more, no less, and in the process they are destroying Ms. Ford, too in my view. Something may have happened to her. I don't know her. I'm respectful of people who've gone through bad experiences but I have to use some common sense here and I've been a lawyer all my life. And you could not get a warrant based on this allegation. You can't tell me when it happened or where it happened and everybody says it doesn't happen."

I voted for their nominees, I never would thought have to do this to Sotomayor and Kagan. These allegations are collapsing and the second allegation couldn't even make it in The New York Times. And only God knows what Avenatti is going to say. Everything in this man's life screams that he's been respectful to women. When he's been in charge of women in their careers, they have nothing but great things to say."

Kavanaugh will have a chance to respond and we've been ask questions. We are not going to move it, we're not going to delay it, just like in arsonist complaining about a fire. These are the people who put in this box."
