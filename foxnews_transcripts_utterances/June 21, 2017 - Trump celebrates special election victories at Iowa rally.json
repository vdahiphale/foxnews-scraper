So, the President feeling a little wind at his back. He hit on a lot of the high notes. Infrastructure, tax reform, immigration. North Korea, China.

Trump is been on the road all the time. He has reason to celebrate today.

I thought that what is refreshing about it if you are a viewer or a fan or just interested in politics is that it's completely unfiltered. It's not scripted. This is all off the cuff. And he was able to give his viewpoints on the accomplishments that you think he is made so far, nobody is going to forget what he was talking about. He did something else that was really important tonight. And you haven't seen them do it before like when the House was trying to pass health care. He laid out the case for why we need health care reform and he said the Republicans are working on it. We are going to bring it to you. And it doesn't matter how good the bill is, we are not going to get a single Democrat for it. What I think that was saying to Republicans back in Washington is, I've got your back. I am going to provide some air cover for you because despite what's going to happen within the next seven days, and that bill will be public tomorrow. It will be voted on, well, Republicans will hopefully vote on it by Wednesday. And he goes to Iowa and he makes these points in a state where Medicare and Medicaid mean a lot. And they have a governor who is paying a lot of attention. We're going to spend a lot of time on it this hour. But I would say, health care in particular. Also he talked about the future of tax reform. And in particular in Iowa, he talks about death taxes.

He would say, why does he go back and actually run the government instead of campaigning all the time? Trump is been on the road all the time. He has reason to celebrate today. That was a big win for him yesterday because if he hadn't, he would have seen terrific erosion among Republicans especially in the House who would fear for themselves in the Trump era. So, what you saw in this speech, I think the spine of it was going after the media. I thought that was the whole thing. They won't show the crowd size, turn the cameras around.

Especially annoying celebrities who are coming and telling how to live. That's not good. Also, you're calling your adversaries names. We've learned that this doesn't work. You go on twitter, there are people saying, vote Ossoff, don't be a bigot. Don't re-elect another bigot. They called these bigots. That's also wrong. But the biggest thing that the Dems did, and I don't even want to tell them this. Because I don't want them to win is that they traded life experience for identity. So, if you had a man with experience let's say in the military or in the corporate world. But you had an undergraduate from Evergreen College, the undergraduate from Evergreen College would gain more respect. Even though she or he doesn't have life experience but has an identity. So, a party that took identity and made that more important -- more important than life experience ended up with an inexperienced candidate who is being pushed forward by a bunch of rich liberals from the left coast and at the right coast.

Big mistake. And you would think that they would learn but not so much. Because every time they do the same thing, and they fail miserably. And what we are seeing is, it's just strengthening the base and popularity of President Trump amongst his supporters. And that's why when you look at the polls that he is in fact very strong with the people that supported him. He's got 96 to 97 percent of the people that cast a ballot and a vote for him. They would do it again with confidence. So now all he's got to do is get some other people over to his side.

So the ultimate question Dana is does this plan provide insurance for more people than Obamacare? Does it deal with pre-existing conditions that has allowed people who need preventative care out to get it? Does it prevent kids from being kicked off of their parent's plans prematurely? And so far, what we're seeing is that nobody says that it meets that standard. I think what you saw from President Trump tonight is an effort to try to say, hey, this is about us versus the Democrats. The Democrats aren't going to approve anything we do. And the Democrats took forever to whip up a plan and I've been there five months and yes, I promise I would undo it in the first 100 days and I promise and I promise, but don't worry.
