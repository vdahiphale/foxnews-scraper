He is frankly very fed up with the anti-Russian sentiment that you could argue he's responsible for in Ukraine. He clearly does want some sort of partnership though, that we understand, and also he thinks that Russia and Ukraine are basically the same people and he claims to be very worried that Ukraine is fast becoming a tool of the West to be used against Russia's interest. He also says that he worries that Ukraine is being overrun by neo-Nazis. Now, opposition figure Alexei Navalny believes that Putin simply doesn't want democratic movements moving closer to his borders and one thing that a lot of people here agree on is that the bottom line for Putin is he does not want anymore NATO expansion. He has had it. He's reached a breaking point. He's also tired of feeling the West is on his case, that they are sanctioning him and squeezing him and frankly don't respect them. He for his part doesn't appear to respect the West very much, and some say he's playing the West at this point, seeing how far he can push it.

Now he appears to be massing troops not only inside of Western Russia, but inside of Belarus as well. A short run down into Ukraine from there, preparing coercive force, the capacity to change what the Ukrainian people want from where they are today with President Zelensky running an important country, a country that matters to the United States and wants to put someone friendly to Russia. And so, he puts this in the newspapers, in \"Pravda\", the Russian outlets. This is Russian propaganda. Vladimir Putin knows that the Ukraine is not going to attack Russia. To suggest somehow that there is a threat from NATO or from the Ukraine is just propaganda, an excuse for Vladimir Putin to do what he ultimately wants, which is to extend his influence, his authority, his power, his control into the former Warsaw Pact countries.",

The real hard work of deterrence would have happened a long time ago, a year ago, when President Putin demanded that we give him a new START treaty extension, we gave it to him for nothing. When they had Russian cyberattacks and they shut down the Colonial Pipeline, we told them you can only attack certain sectors, but 16 are off- limits. When we left Afghanistan in the way we did -- those were the places where the administration had a chance to establish deterrence. Putin saw this and so these tactical things today about whether our families will stay in Ukraine, we've got to the right thing and take care of our families. But these tactical things aren't what causes Vladimir Putin to recalculate his cost-benefit analysis. I think they don't see President Biden as credible. I think they see all this talking, these pieces of paper being exchanged just not credible. They don't to the right thing. They don't protect the American people, establish deterrence and prevent -- to reduce the risk that what President Biden called a minor incursion -- it reminded me, Shannon, of what President Obama called ISIS the jayvee, right? Same kind of downplaying of risk.

He will perceive any weakness, any gaffe. They say, well, we didn't send an assembled unit, it was -- it was disorganized. These are the kinds of things that are listened to very closely. You can tell by the response of President Zelensky. He listened very closely. We had deterrence for four years. Vladimir Putin didn't do these kind of things. He didn't threaten. He didn't use coercive activity to try to push back on NATO in the way that he did. We made sure NATO was focused on its mission and when we did that, Vladimir Putin respected us. We had respect for him and his power. He's a very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness' sakes. He knows how to use power, we should respect that.

And the fact is, Putin thinks that Biden is bluffing. He remembers that in 2014, when he invaded and annexed Crimea, the Obama-Biden demonstration refused to put serious sanctions on Russia or impose any real costs. The sanctions cost them about 1 percent of GDP and he was willing to pay 1 percent of GDP for Crimea. The question now is, are we going to impose the kind of costs on him that would deter him, that would be too high for military action? To do that, you have to sanction oil and natural gas, which are the only exports that Russia cares about, and put massive sanctions on Russian banks. Europeans depend on Russia for 40 percent of their natural gas, they are not eager to do that, and Biden has not laid out the specific sanctions that he would impose. He needs to show Putin that the cost would be enormous and specific. He needs to name the bank that he's going to sanction.

So, there is time here. But, you know, Joe Biden has done -- did very well in the first half of his first year as president with a clear message that showed results, getting shots in your arms, getting money in your wallet's, referencing the relief package, and was about to roll out the third part, which was jobs in your neighborhoods and talking about the infrastructure bill. And then that got slowed down. And then it started to feel a little less like results in the national conversation. And that's when you started to see his numbers take a huge downturn. There's an opportunity to go back, talk about those three pillars of success so far, but then do what he did in his press conference the other day and say, we've laid the foundation, but it hasn't been enough yet. Here's what's next. And demonstrating that he and Democrats have a path forward to deal with people's anxieties over Covid and over inflation, and that Republicans don't.

JULIE PACE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think this is the big question for the White House, when Mo talks about the White House having to prove to results. That's certainly true. You know, any president wants to be able to go out to the American people and show what they've actually done in office. The problem for Biden is that he keeps running into the same opposition, and some of that is coming from within his own party. Yes, he has a majority, but it is extremely narrow, and he does not have the full Democratic majority in the Senate on his side to pass many of his priorities. So, how's he going to get through that? What is -- what is the mechanism for him to get results? Because, as you say, on voting rights in particular, I do think there was some political imperative for Biden to show that this was a priority, to show he was going to try to take some action, even if he knew it was -- it wasn't going to pass, but it didn't pass, so now what is the next step? This is where I think they are caught in a little bit of a bind right now.

And the reality is, Americans didn't elect him to do that. That's why there's a 50/50 Senate. That's what he has a couple a vote majority in the House. It was a mandate for compromise. It was a mandate for unity. It was a mandate for reaching across the aisle. And now's the time for him to fulfill that mandate because, come November, he's going to have to because when Republicans take over at least one House of Congress, there's not going to be any more Democrat-only reconciliation bills.

He is frankly very fed up with the anti-Russian sentiment that you could argue he's responsible for in Ukraine. He clearly does want some sort of partnership though, that we understand, and also he thinks that Russia and Ukraine are basically the same people and he claims to be very worried that Ukraine is fast becoming a tool of the West to be used against Russia's interest. He also says that he worries that Ukraine is being overrun by neo-Nazis. Now, opposition figure Alexei Navalny believes that Putin simply doesn't want democratic movements moving closer to his borders and one thing that a lot of people here agree on is that the bottom line for Putin is he does not want anymore NATO expansion. He has had it. He's reached a breaking point. He's also tired of feeling the West is on his case, that they are sanctioning him and squeezing him and frankly don't respect them. He for his part doesn't appear to respect the West very much, and some say he's playing the West at this point, seeing how far he can push it.

He's tried to do so through political gamesmanship, coercion, all the kinds of things, the tools of statecraft that are sub-rosa, not overt. Now he appears to be massing troops not only inside of Western Russia, but inside of Belarus as well. A short run down into Ukraine from there, preparing coercive force, the capacity to change what the Ukrainian people want from where they are today with President Zelensky running an important country, a country that matters to the United States and wants to put someone friendly to Russia. And so, he puts this in the newspapers, in \"Pravda\", the Russian outlets. This is Russian propaganda. Vladimir Putin knows that the Ukraine is not going to attack Russia.

There are critics of this who think they're worried that the U.S., whatever we put in writing, Russia's going to use as a context for moving in.

When they had Russian cyberattacks and they shut down the Colonial Pipeline, we told them you can only attack certain sectors, but 16 are off- limits. When we left Afghanistan in the way we did -- those were the places where the administration had a chance to establish deterrence. Putin saw this and so these tactical things today about whether our families will stay in Ukraine, we've got to the right thing and take care of our families. But these tactical things aren't what causes Vladimir Putin to recalculate his cost-benefit analysis. I think they don't see President Biden as credible. I think they see all this talking, these pieces of paper being exchanged just not credible. They don't to the right thing. They don't protect the American people, establish deterrence and prevent -- to reduce the risk that what President Biden called a minor incursion -- it reminded me, Shannon, of what President Obama called ISIS the jayvee, right? Same kind of downplaying of risk. When he talks about a minor incursion, this costs an awful lot of lives to be lost, not only in Ukraine but in other places in Europe, and energy prices to skyrocket all across the world."

He will perceive any weakness, any gaffe. They say, well, we didn't send an assembled unit, it was -- it was disorganized. These are the kinds of things that are listened to very closely. You can tell by the response of President Zelensky. He listened very closely. We had deterrence for four years. Vladimir Putin didn't do these kind of things. He didn't threaten. He didn't use coercive activity to try to push back on NATO in the way that he did. We made sure NATO was focused on its mission and when we did that, Vladimir Putin respected us. We had respect for him and his power. He's a very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness' sakes. He knows how to use power, we should respect that. And if we did that, we could make sure we do the things right for the American people and reflect well on our country's history and traditions and pushing back and making sure that Europe and the Western World stood together."

These are the kinds of things that reduce risk, Shannon. It's how we prevent there to be a significant outbreak of conflict and war in Europe. America can lead. We can't lead from behind. We have to be the leader. We should be flying weapons and systems into Ukraine every single day, making a demonstrable commitment to the Iranian -- excuse me, to the Ukrainian people who have demanded the simple thing to have their own sovereignty and democracy in their country."

So, the Cato folks can play the straw man, and say, gosh, we shouldn't send our military in. But no one is suggesting that. What we -- what we're going to do if we get this right is we're going to do what we did in the Trump administration. We're going to support governments that have outlined their boundaries. We protect our sovereignty at the southern border. That's what we did during our four years. Other countries should be permitted to do that.

We did it all without sending thousands of soldiers or creating a war, any place in the world, Shannon. So they're watching very closely. They're watching to see if this administration has the resolve and the steel to use all of its tools to preserve sovereignty for a nation like Ukraine. I promise you not only are Xi Jinping and Chairman Kim and ayatollah watching, but so are the people of Taiwan, the Iranian people, and the Chinese people as well. The whole world watches how America leads. And when we fail to do so, we create instability and the cost, the risks to people in Iowa, Nevada, and Kansas, my home state, are real. We have to get this right. We have to establish deterrence in the model of Reagan and the model that we had for our four years.

I mentioned with former Secretary Pompeo, this back-and-forth between Lavrov and Blinken, this idea that the U.S. is going to provide written answers to the Russian demands. I mean, some say that, you know, Lavrov is celebrating even that, that we would go that far as a win. Should we be doing it?"

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "No, we should not be doing it. What we should be doing is laying out in the very specific terms what the consequences will be if Russia does in fact invade, which we have not done. Look, we -- what Biden doesn't seem to understand is weakness is provocative. When you project weakness in the world, your adversaries are more likely to test your resolve. And the fact is, Putin thinks that Biden is bluffing. He remembers that in 2014, when he invaded and annexed Crimea, the Obama-Biden demonstration refused to put serious sanctions on Russia or impose any real costs. The sanctions cost them about 1 percent of GDP and he was willing to pay 1 percent of GDP for Crimea. The question now is, are we going to impose the kind of costs on him that would deter him, that would be too high for military action? To do that, you have to sanction oil and natural gas, which are the only exports that Russia cares about, and put massive sanctions on Russian banks. Europeans depend on Russia for 40 percent of their natural gas, they are not eager to do that, and Biden has not laid out the specific sanctions that he would impose. He needs to show Putin that the cost would be enormous and specific. He needs to name the bank that he's going to sanction. He needs to make clear what the sanctions on Russian energy exports are going to be, and show him that the cost are going to be too high for him to bear."

She says the president has not maximized his option for defensive weapons sales to Ukraine and Putin knows it. He also knows the Biden demonstration lobby Democrats to reverse course and vote against Nord Stream 2 sanctions, necessary actions to prevent the handover of Western Europe's energy sector to the Russian regime. We got a brand-new FOX News poll this morning that shows the president is upside down, 54 percent disapprove on how he's doing on foreign policy, 41 percent approve. What does the White House do now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think, you know -- and you hear this coming out of the White House, you hear this coming out of the State Department, that they are being very clear that there's two paths moving forward or Putin. We can either continue to negotiate and pursue diplomacy, or there can be swift consequences if you don't pursue diplomacy. So I think they are making that case. And look, Marc and I actually don't disagree on this point, that strong economic sanctions and strong and very clear ramifications are critical. But when you look at something like Nord 2, we can go ahead and sanction it now to the bill that Senator Ernst was referencing and take away our leverage in this. Right now, the pipeline isn't operational. So Putin doesn't have any leverage with it. We do. And so, if we sanction it now, we lose our leverage. If we make it clear that any sort of action by the Russians could shut down this thing that Putin wants more than anything, we've got some leverage."

They are a key ally, but obviously because of Nord Stream 2, they are in a different position than many other countries who are parties to this conversation. Germany is blocking Estonia from being able to export certain weapons and equipment to the Ukraine. There's talk about whether President Biden is -- what kind of relationship he's got with the new chancellor there. What do you make of where we are with Germany on this?"

      "speaker": "JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS EXECUTIVE EDITOR",

As you mentioned, Nord Stream 2, it is so crucial to the Germans and Europe's energy supply as a whole at a time where we are seeing a real energy crush on the continent. And so, this is going to be a question about not only how Biden is going to negotiate with senators in the U.S. Congress about potential sanctions, but also how he's going to negotiate with a brand-new chancellor in Germany, someone he doesn't have a long-standing relationship with my former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and what the climate in Europe will be when it comes to trying to stave off Russian aggression versus dealing with very real energy -- a very real energy problem that will directly impact a lot of the people that European politicians will need for their support."

Putin told him apparently it's time to take on the power of the Americans with an increased synergy between our two countries. We know that naval exercises are being held with Russia, Iran, and China. There's pressure to change the economics of who cooperates with the West, who cooperates elsewhere with may be these three. What about that part of this?"

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",

What does it matter what happens in Ukraine? Ukraine isn't Las Vegas. What happens in Ukraine doesn't stay in Ukraine. The reason we are having this crisis in Ukraine is because of the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which projected weakness. The last time we had this crisis in Ukraine was after President Obama refused to enforce his red line in Syria and sent a message of weakness which emboldened Vladimir Putin. If we do now not stand up to Putin in Ukraine and forced him to back off with massive specific sanctions and military aid to the Ukrainians, guess what? China is watching and they're going to look at it and say, well, if Putin can invade Ukraine, we can invade Taiwan. North Korea is watching. Iran is watching. This has -- this could spin out of control on a global scale and cause conflagrations across the world. So we need to start projecting strength in Ukraine. We should immediately, immediately -- President Biden should announce the Nord Stream 2 is over. We've proven -- Russia has proven that it cannot be trusted to hold Ukraine energy supplies hostage and then he should lay out specific sanctions, what are the energy sanctions? The reason we haven't done that is because the Germans don't want to -- don't want to do it. He should lay out those sanctions. He should lay out the specific Russian banks that will be sanctioned and show the cost to Putin, that the cost will be higher than what he's willing to bear."

And the bill that I'm bringing this year to our legislatures says that when a heartbeat is detected, that then abortions should not be an options for people, that we need to protect those babies. And, Shannon, I think what's interesting in South Dakota is that we've proven this issue doesn't have to be divisive. Last year I brought a bill that protected babies upon the diagnosis of downs syndrome and it unanimously passed my legislature.

So, this week, the Supreme Court had some dealings with that -- that particular bill out of Texas and Justice Sotomayor said this about it. She said, it's a complicated, private bounty hunter scheme that violates nearly 50 years of this court's precedents. She went on to talk about the case about the law. She said, it's a disaster for the rule of law and a grave disservice to the women in Texas who have a right to control their bodies. How do you respond?"

It is modeled after the Texas law. And it says, when that heartbeat is detected, that then abortion is not an option. And, frankly, since we got to the Texas law in place, lives have been saved. You know, in South Dakota, there's a private right of action clause that is different than the Texas model. But we think that that really gives people the option to really not insert the state into that relationship, but make sure that people have the opportunity to go after those doctors that do perform abortions and save those lives so that we can continue to be bold in doing that. I was very clear when I ran for governor, and since I've been governor, that we wanted to get up every single day and look for ways to protect every single life. That equality truly do -- does come from valuing every single life. And that is what we've done by putting an unborn child advocate in the governor's office. I saw Glenn Youngkin just did that as well. And I was so grateful to see him at that job description to the governor's office there.

And we do have amazing centers and people that wrap their arms around these mother's in these families and let them know that there are options for that child, that there is adoption, that there is ways that they'll come alongside them and mentor them so that they can teach them how to be parents and help them through the struggles that come with raising a child.

So immediately, that very same day, I put executive orders in place to protect girls' sports. And this is about fairness. This is about making sure that our girls have a chance to be successful and to compete, to win scholarships, potentially go on to play professional sports beyond that. We want them to have the opportunity to do that. Title IX fought for that years and years ago. And I've been doing this for years, which started, men, almost five years ago now, in a sport of rodeo, where we protected girls' events. So, now I'm bringing a bill to the legislature that will be the strongest bill in the nation in protecting fairness in girls' sports. And I'm hopeful that my legislatures will support it."

We've got more to do. We've got the strongest economy in the country. We're -- we've got historic revenues. We put more money into reserves than ever before.

Mo, 2024 vote, if it were held today, election today, re-elect President Biden, 36 percent, vote for someone else, 60 percent. That someone else number is higher than it ever got for President Trump. So, Mo, what does the White House do now?"

      "utterance": "Yes, look, those numbers aren't great. I also, though, think you need to take a little bit of caution. I remember in 1994, and in 2010, when Barack Obama and Bill Clinton lost their midterms big and everyone was writing their political obituaries and they both came back and won re-election. So, there is time here. But, you know, Joe Biden has done -- did very well in the first half of his first year as president with a clear message that showed results, getting shots in your arms, getting money in your wallet's, referencing the relief package, and was about to roll out the third part, which was jobs in your neighborhoods and talking about the infrastructure bill. And then that got slowed down. And then it started to feel a little less like results in the national conversation. And that's when you started to see his numbers take a huge downturn. There's an opportunity to go back, talk about those three pillars of success so far, but then do what he did in his press conference the other day and say, we've laid the foundation, but it hasn't been enough yet. Here's what's next. And demonstrating that he and Democrats have a path forward to deal with people's anxieties over Covid and over inflation, and that Republicans don't. That's got to be the framing of the conversation for the next year out of the White House if they want to be in the game this election, and in '24."

      "utterance": "But, Julie, there hasn't been a pivot or sort of a reset. In fact, Democrats spent a lot of political capital pushing these election overhaul bills that they knew weren't going to pass, trying to nuke the filibuster, knew that wasn't going to happen. I mean, why do that, especially in a week that has not been good for the White House the last few days, losing at the Supreme Court in their OSHA mandate. I mean why swing for the fences like this when Democrats knew none of that could succeed? JULIE PACE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think this is the big question for the White House, when Mo talks about the White House having to prove to results. That's certainly true. You know, any president wants to be able to go out to the American people and show what they've actually done in office. The problem for Biden is that he keeps running into the same opposition, and some of that is coming from within his own party. Yes, he has a majority, but it is extremely narrow, and he does not have the full Democratic majority in the Senate on his side to pass many of his priorities. So, how's he going to get through that? What is -- what is the mechanism for him to get results? Because, as you say, on voting rights in particular, I do think there was some political imperative for Biden to show that this was a priority, to show he was going to try to take some action, even if he knew it was -- it wasn't going to pass, but it didn't pass, so now what is the next step? This is where I think they are caught in a little bit of a bind right now. They are always going to have this blockaded unless Biden can find a way to change the minds of two very important Democratic senators. And right now I think is very little indication that he's going to be able to do that."

The president was pressed on this in a number of different ways during his press conference. And there were a lot of folks who felt he could have been more clear on the way that he answered those questions and sort of this film of doubt he sort of left out there. \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board asked, what's worse than a president who claims elections are a sham? To presidents. So, Marc, where do we go from here on this question now of presidents questioning whether elections will be legit?"

      "utterance": "It's shameful. It was shameful when Trump did it, and it's shameful when -- that Biden said it. I mean, look, this is -- but this is indicative of the big problem that Biden has with his presidency. He was trying to ram through partisan election -- a federal takeover of the elections through a Senate using -- by getting rid of the filibuster. The worst thing that happened to Joe Biden was winning those two Senate seats in Georgia because it allowed the left-wing of the Democratic Party to convince him to abandon his promise to be a unifier, a uniter who reaches across the aisle, brings the country together and convince him he could be FDR, he could be -- he could pass this transformational, left-wing agenda through Congress. And the reality is, Americans didn't elect him to do that. That's why there's a 50/50 Senate. That's what he has a couple a vote majority in the House. It was a mandate for compromise. It was a mandate for unity. It was a mandate for reaching across the aisle. And now's the time for him to fulfill that mandate because, come November, he's going to have to because when Republicans take over at least one House of Congress, there's not going to be any more Democrat-only reconciliation bills. So, better start now and at least looks like it's a choice."

He had to say this week, I'm not Bernie Sanders. I'm not a socialist. There are now all these pieces flying around and the chatter around Washington that chief of staff Ron Klain, who spends a lot of time on Twitter, has pulled the president further left than the moderate he campaigned he would be."

Not even so much the public health part of it, but the impact that it's having on our lives, the prospect of another shutdown or anything like that. He needs to be out there aggressively talking about those two pieces. The thing that they've got going for them is, as much as the president's numbers are getting battered, Republicans aren't talking about those issues in any real way yet.
