I think it's hard to argue that we have not objectively done everything we possibly can to bring a different security framework to Afghanistan. I have traveled to Afghanistan several times, including a few times with then Senator Biden and Senator Graham and the late Senator McCain.

And I might add, there were 83 people shot in Chicago over the weekend and 13 killed. We have rogue crazy everywhere. But if a red line is crossed and our security interests are threatened in Afghanistan, I hope that the administration and trust that the administration will be ready to go back in. They allowed a red line to be crossed in the past administration under Mr. Obama. The question is will they not allow it this time if the Afghans are threatened.",

      "utterance": "When we fully withdraw, the devastation and the killings of women, the humanitarian crisis, fleeing across the border into Pakistan, President Biden is going to own these ugly images. Our vital interests are ISIS and Al-Qaeda, and we are going to give them a save haven as the Taliban takes over that nation, and that vacuum is going to be filled by terrorists. And I've concerned that we will be going back."

Let's bring in our panel, former education secretary Bill Bennett, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, and Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina. Gentlemen, welcome. Bill, your thoughts on the situation in Afghanistan, U.S. troops coming out. What are your concerns?"

This is South Asia. We will have no major base in South Asia. The Bagram Air Force base is a substantial place. We do a lot of monitoring from there. And by the way, the Belt and Road strategy of China across Asia into Europe goes right through Afghanistan. We have now made it a lot easier. Plus, consider those women, what's going to happen to them. Are they going to be able to go to school? And I hope we have gotten out as many people who helped us as possible. Finally, not just the moral victory but in some ways a real victory for the Taliban. We cheered when they outwaited the Soviets. The Soviets left and we applauded. Now we're leaving. Admiral Kirby's comments from the Pentagon sounded to me an awful lot like Saigon. Very sorry to stay this, but I think this is a dreadful and huge mistake."

It is incumbent upon us for our allies, but also for any future endeavors we have to protect democracy. If our allies can't trust to us to have their backs like these Afghans have had our back for an almost 20-year war, then we are not going to be able to project our values, our democratic values across the world."

      "utterance": "First of all, Happy Fourth of July and happy Independence Day. I share the frame that Secretary Bennett has drawn. And Congresswoman Sherrill, I think she's right. We as a nation have to show our commitment to the families, to the individuals and families of those translators and intel gatherers. We should provide safe haven, if not even refuge here in the U.S. But let's take a step back for one moment. I think it's hard to argue that we have not objectively done everything we possibly can to bring a different security framework to Afghanistan. I have traveled to Afghanistan several times, including a few times with then Senator Biden and Senator Graham and the late Senator McCain. I'm proud of the progress we've made there, but I do think some of the things that Secretary Bennett has raised have to be considered. And my sense is that they have. And I hope that the White House -- what I have not heard from the administration consisting of what Secretary Bennett has raised is whether or not a red line has been drawn on the part of this administration, saying if our national security interests are threatened, if the Taliban, who, again, is in some ways a rogue group of terrorists. And I might add, there were 83 people shot in Chicago over the weekend and 13 killed. We have rogue crazy everywhere. But if a red line is crossed and our security interests are threatened in Afghanistan, I hope that the administration and trust that the administration will be ready to go back in. They allowed a red line to be crossed in the past administration under Mr. Obama. The question is will they not allow it this time if the Afghans are threatened."

We need 750 people to protect our embassy in the airport, and you tell me that the country is thriving and safe for translators and Afghan women? I mean, 750 soldiers to protect our embassy?

      "utterance": "Yes, it turns out to be. By the way, Matthew McConaughey, I love his support of the University of Texas, but he's ridiculous. Puberty, we is he talking about? We have lived longer under a single document than any nation in the world. Yes, we're young, but we are mature in ways other nations aren't. Yes, I was in North Carolina for the Fourth. It was wonderful celebrations. But yet these dissenting voices saying we are a bad place, structural racism, systemic white privilege everywhere now. That's not what most people think. And if you went around the country yesterday you saw that. But the elites think otherwise, so you get these dissident members of Congress, these people on the left wing of the Democratic Party, and there is a popular uprising against them. But the major media, the big media, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters, Hollywood, the universities, all of them are in agreement on this. Unifying symbols are no longer unifying symbols. I saw the \"New York Times\" said maybe the flag can't be the unifying symbol anymore since it has been captured by the Trump people. This is insanity, and there is a fight on, there's a cultural divide, a cultural civil war. McConaughey is right about that reference. There's a cultural civil war of enormous magnitude going on right now, and we have to win it."

That's a record low in terms of pride in America for the young generation. We have work to do. I say that not just as a former secretary of education, but as a father and now a grandfather.
