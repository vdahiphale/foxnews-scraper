Two people dead and two critically injured this evening, and the manhunt to stop the next bomb could be anywhere and is underway. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. Governor Greg Abbott is now offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone responsible for these bombings. The first bomb took the life of a 39-year-old man, and then today, ten days later, as the police chief was warning the public after another explosion this morning. Right after he spoke, another package exploded. A 17-year-old boy is now dead and two women were injured. All of the explosions occurred when people were doing what everybody does every single day, went out to their front steps and picked up a package.

And just as police were investigating the parallels of the first two bombs, a third package exploded severely injuring a 75-year-old woman. Now, investigators are in the process of establishing any patterns. For example, they believe the explosive devices are similar and were delivered in similar size boxes though they will not go into detail. We know that the first two explosion happen about 12 miles apart; the third bomb went off five and a half miles from the second. Both victims who died are African-American; the 75-year- old female, who is now in critical condition is Hispanic. Police are not ruling anything out, but they say it's too early to tell if the victims were the intended targets or if these might be hate crimes. Surveillance cameras near the locations are now being scanned to see if the video captured any potential suspects. The packages do not appear to have been delivered by the postal service or shipping companies like FedEx and UPS. And police are now telling everyone in and around the Austin area that if a box shows up at your home and you were not expecting one, call 911. We should note the south by southwest music festival is this weekend in Austin. So far, there are no plans to change that. And back in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Ted Kaczynski mailed and planted several package bombs around the country that killed three and injured several more.

Two people dead and two critically injured this evening, and the manhunt to stop the next bomb could be anywhere and is underway. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. Governor Greg Abbott is now offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone responsible for these bombings. The first bomb took the life of a 39-year-old man, and then today, ten days later, as the police chief was warning the public after another explosion this morning. Right after he spoke, another package exploded. A 17-year-old boy is now dead and two women were injured. All of the explosions occurred when people were doing what everybody does every single day, went out to their front steps and picked up a package. Here is Austin Police Chief, Brian Manley, just a short time ago."

This again is the third in what we believe to be related incidents that have occurred over the past ten days, and we are imploring the community: if you know anything about these attacks, it is imperative that you come forward and that you let us know. We are having innocent people getting hurt across this community, and it is important that we come together as a community and solve this. It's not time to panic, but it's time to be vigilant, and it's time to pay attention, it's time to pull together as a city and a community and solve this."

And just as police were investigating the parallels of the first two bombs, a third package exploded severely injuring a 75-year-old woman. Now, investigators are in the process of establishing any patterns. For example, they believe the explosive devices are similar and were delivered in similar size boxes though they will not go into detail. We know that the first two explosion happen about 12 miles apart; the third bomb went off five and a half miles from the second. Both victims who died are African-American; the 75-year- old female, who is now in critical condition is Hispanic. Police are not ruling anything out, but they say it's too early to tell if the victims were the intended targets or if these might be hate crimes. Surveillance cameras near the locations are now being scanned to see if the video captured any potential suspects. The packages do not appear to have been delivered by the postal service or shipping companies like FedEx and UPS. And police are now telling everyone in and around the Austin area that if a box shows up at your home and you were not expecting one, call 911. We should note the south by southwest music festival is this weekend in Austin. So far, there are no plans to change that. And back in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Ted Kaczynski mailed and planted several package bombs around the country that killed three and injured several more. It took investigators nearly 18 years to bring him to justice. Martha."

And when they picked them up, or in the second incident when they brought it inside and opened it up, both of those packages detonated. The one that happened this afternoon was in a little bit of a later hour, but under the same circumstances."

And in the process of getting that message out to hear that we, in fact, did have a third incident occur was very troubling given that we now lost two lives."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANLEY",

And as far as sophistication, it takes a certain level of skill to be able to build a device like this, and then deploy it to your intended target without having it explode in the process. We're seeing how easily they explode once the victims are handling them, so there is a certain level of skill that is going along with what this individual or individuals are doing."

      "utterance": "So, there's a lot of analysis being done by the alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives division along with the FBI as far as the types of explosives that are being used, that is still being analyzed. But what we're doing in the message we want to get out is don't limit yourself to thinking that it's only if an unexpected cardboard box shows up. If you go out on your porch and you see something that does not belong to you -- a package or other item -- just give us a call, because we want to come out and we want to take a look at it to ensure that there's nothing suspicious or nothing that we need to do as a department to make that safe, so that we don't lose in another life or have another life significantly impacted by this."

What can we piece together about these three individuals to determine if there's something that connects them? Right now, we have not yet identified any ideology that may be behind this or any specific link between these victims. And so, that's really at the core of what we're working on right now trying piece it together on top of the evidence collection and all of the analysis that will be done on that."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "MANLEY",
      "utterance": "So, we are keeping some of these details private right now for the integrity of the investigation. As this would be information that really is only known to the suspects in this incident, and again, that's why we're highlighting to the community here that if you see something that looks suspicious or out of place or if you had a package delivered that you weren't expecting, just give us a call and let us come clear at first. And you know, so now, this person, whoever is doing this or this group of people, obviously they know that you guys are on to what's going on, and I imagine that you are going to -- are you upping your patrol, your presence on the streets all around Austin tonight, what's your plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANLEY",
      "utterance": "So, we are obviously having our patrol officers be vigilant in the neighborhoods. They, in addition, to all of the neighbors that we're asking to look out for anything suspicious, our officers will be looking as well for something that looks out of place or looks suspicious. But there is a level of attention and a level of involvement by our federal partners here in Austin that we've not seen before. The number of ATF and FBI agents that have come into Austin to assist us with this investigation. The governor himself has put a $15,000 reward out there for any information leading to a closure of this case. And then we have also had assistance given to us from any of the local partners as well. We are all working together so that we can clear this as quickly as possible before we move lose any more lives or have any more lives seriously impacted."

He did an outstanding job by getting the people in Austin notified that of the danger. And this case will be solved by a public assistance, I feel quite sure. Right now, he mentioned this, and I know it to be true that ATF, and the FBI, and GTF, and Austin P.D. are putting a full court press on this. And there are a lot of things that are going to be done. Remember, the FBI saw the Boston marathon bombing in a couple of days. This may take a little bit longer, but they will solve this case. You know, it will be done a lot by public assistance and the saturation that the law enforcement puts on these types of events."

I also think of the D.C. sniper, because you've got this fear of just a random act potentially that are happening anywhere in your city, and you don't know where it's going to happen or if it might happen to you. It's really terrifying for anybody who lives in that area to touch anything, I would imagine, coming in your mail."

      "utterance": "Well, we want to them to be afraid. That sounds a little sinister, maybe, but they want -- we want them to be very much aware of the threat to them. And I think that it's interesting that all of these are at residences and not in public places. Generally, a terrorist or someone bent on making a statement will put it in a public place for more carnage. The fact that it was done at a home, I think that will maybe the focus of the investigation by both the FBI and the APD. And I will tell you, I managed the Unabomber and we only caught him because he wanted his manifesto published. Before that, we had no clue who he was. So, these things are difficult."

And all of these -- there's some sort of a pressure switch, and the person knows what he or she is doing, and that makes it even more sinister. And if we get the message out, Martha, if you find something on your front porch, don't touch it call the police -- no matter if it's pay forward box or a wooden container or whatever. Just be really careful. Better safe than sorry."

I mean, if you have any packages with Amazon and all this, everything comes to your house, it's the only way people get things these days. They're going to be chasing after these boxes all the time. It's going to be insane, I would imagine."

President Trump held a raucous rally over the weekend for Republican Candidate Rick Saccone. Today, his son, Donald Jr., was campaigning there as well, both fighting to keep a congressional district outside Pittsburgh from turning blue. And this is a district that now President Trump won by 20 points in 2016. So, this should not even really be in play for Republicans. The latest moment polling shows a very tight race. 45 percent Saccone, 51 percent for Connor Lamb as we head into election day, which is tomorrow. So, joining me now, Karl Rove, Former Senior Adviser to President Bush and a Fox News Contributor; and Philippe Reines, a Former Senior Adviser to Hillary Clinton. Welcome, gentleman. Good to see both of you as always. So, Karl, you know, they're really pulling out a lot of money and the big guns from Washington and from the White House to try to pull him across the finish line."

Look, the Democrats have the picture- perfect candidate, a former Marine, prosecutor, somebody who says he won't support Nancy Pelosi, that he's personally opposed to abortion. Applauding things of President Trump with which he agrees, not the normal Democrat, and the Republican has been underwhelming. But if Saccone wins, it's going to be because Donald Trump came in at the end and campaigned for him. If he loses, it will be because the president's approval ratings -- even in this district -- are not particularly high. They're certainly not where they need to be for somebody in a year and a half in office."

And while we'll be hearing that talking point again about Conor Lamb being an exceptional candidate, which he absolutely is. The truth of the matter is, is that it shouldn't come to this. And more importantly, that if it comes to this repeatedly in November, the Republican Party can't put in the resources, can't put in $10 million into dozens and dozens of close races. And you know, it's not a good sign even if Saccone pulls it out by a couple of points -- I would not feel good if I were the head of the RNC."

At the end of the day, the principal reason a candidate gets close to winning or wins is because of the candidate in the campaign's organization. Outside groups can help lift them up three, or four, or five points, but they can't get them from, you know, zero to 51. I want to comment on something quickly that Philippe is saying, you know, Democrats are going to find it hard to duplicate Conor Lamb. We saw it here in Texas, for example, the preferred candidate in one of their best shots to pick up a Republican seat was in West Texas, the guy named Jay Hollins, he's a former prosecutor, military background, spent $500,000, was beaten by somebody who spent $600 who move back to the district after something 18 years in Washington, six months before the election. And he actually came in fourth, Hollins, came in fourth behind a guy who spent $20,000 and another candidate who spent $30,000. So, why? Because he wasn't -- he wasn't a typical Democrat, the typical Democrat issue tends to be far more left wing than either Hollins or Lamb."

I mean, it's -- and Karl has better success rate at this than I do, but it seems to be harder to win the office and to keep the office if you go back as far as Richard Nixon, five of the last seven president who sought the second term, won it. And it comes with some built in advantages. We saw some of them the other night. Frankly, I think the president prefers to campaign like that. I was a little surprised -- that keeping America great was no surprise, I'm a little surprised about the exclamation point, because to the extent that there is a Donald Trump tweet for everything, I'm sure that there is one making fun of Jeb Bush with the Jeb!"

She's at an India today conclave, and she was speaking, and here's what she said. She said, 'What happened in my election? I was on the way to winning white women. I'm told former Director of the FBI Jim Comey dropped ill-advised letter then down my numbers went. All of the sudden, White women who are going to vote for me and standing up to the men in their lives were told she's going to jail.' And what we don't have here is that the top of this, which is what I found the most striking, actually, in the whole thing was that she said that women voted -- that White women voted the way that their husbands and their bosses and their sons told them too.

In this particular case, she's talking about an Oregon State study that does a look at this fact. And I understand why that would come across as insulting. Obviously, that's not how she meant it."

But the whole concept that women who voted against her were told to do so by their husbands or their bosses or their children, and women who voted her did so out of, you know, I don't know what -- it just is jaw-droppingly tone-deaf, arrogant, condescending and stupid."

The committee has conducted more than 70 interviews during its probe including, just last week, former manager of President Trump's 2016 campaign, Corey Lewandowski. Corey joins us now.

I sat voluntarily before the committee for a total of more than 12 hours answering every question that they had about what I saw during my tenure at the Trump campaign. And I was very clear. I never interacted with Russians. The candidate never interacted with Russians. There was no collusion. There's no cooperation, and there's no coordination. And I could have my testimony done in five minutes because it was very simple. I didn't coordinate with anybody to impact the outcome of the election that was a foreign entity. So -- but, you know, Mr. Schiff wants to use this as a bully pulpit for him. I sat through on Thursday of last week and said, 'Before I get up and leave, I've been here for four and a half hours, are there any additional questions before I get up and go home to see my family?' And there were no additional questions. So this notion that he wants to grandstand and have people come back and talk some more, he had all the time in the world on Thursday to ask me as many questions as he wanted and he had no more questions, that's the bottom line because there was no collusion."

I sat there for 12 hours, and I answered all of their questions. They've interviewed 73 people before the committee. And what Chairman Conaway has said was he saw no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and for that matter, between the Clinton campaign and the Russians. But what we haven't seen, as you know, is the list of 73 Democrats, including Robbie Mook and all the members of the Clinton campaign, who had to come and testify before this committee. Why didn't that occur? Because the only campaign that I know of that took money of the campaign coffers and paid a former spy was the Clinton campaign. And he took that money and went to Russia to create a false dossier. That's what really took place. And the House Investigation Committee never looked at that issue that I'm aware of."

And look, you know, unfortunately, for Mr. Nunberg, what he said, these are his own words, he was going to testify in front of the grand jury on Friday, which he did.

Hopefully, we'll have it soon. But she said that women who voted for President Trump did so because they basically were pressured by their husbands, their bosses and their sons. That's why they voted for him. What's your response to that having been on the campaign trail for all of those months?"

That women aren't intelligent enough to make their own decisions, and that the only way they can decide who to vote for is if their husbands, their sons, or their male bosses tell who to do so, it is such a disgusting thing. This is supposed have been a person who has fought her entire life to destroy the glass ceiling -- that was going to have fireworks on election night to destroy the glass ceiling in New York, and now she makes this type of statement with no backlash.

But first, more than a year after the death of Penn State fraternity pledge, Timothy Piazza, whose parents you know well and you've seen here many times, one university is now crossing the line and banishing a sorority.

Last year, eight fraternities and sororities were shut down nationwide, and a trend that may continue. Now, we are learning about a scandalous scavenger hunt, which sounds like a pretty harmless thing, right -- out of Pennsylvania Lehigh University. To our knowledge no one was hurt, but it was enough to get the sorority Alpha Chi Omega, which is a huge national sorority, banished for two years from the campus. They're appealing that question. Trace Gallagher joins us now live from our West Coast newsroom with the back story. Trace."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha, the scavenger hunt at Lehigh held back in December was called the road rally. It happened both on and off campus and involved drugs, alcohol, sex and other activities that violate university policy. Four days after the scavenger hunt, Alpha Chi Omega's Theta Chi chapter was placed on interim suspension, and the organization national headquarters ordered the sorority to cease and desist all activity. Now, the full investigation has led to a two year ban with the investigative committee saying just because the participants were willing does not mean it wasn't hazing. The committee also found evidence this event has been going on for years saying, quote, 'This incident was a significant reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed. This type of behavior is simply unacceptable considering the current climate on college campuses.' That's current climate clearly intimates cases like Timothy Piazza, the Penn State sophomore who last year during a pledging ritual, called the gauntlet, drink excessive amounts of alcohol in a short period of time and suffered multiple falls including down a flight of stairs. His fellow pledges and fraternity members waited several hours to get help. And Piazza died of traumatic brain injuries two days later. Twenty six fraternity members were then charged. And there's the case of Florida State University pledge, Andrew Coffey, who died from alcohol poisoning in November, following hazing rituals. Coffey drank an entire bottle of Wild Turkey 101 proof whiskey. And after passing out, he was left on the couch unattended. His blood alcohol level was six times the legal limit. Coffey's parents have now sued the Pi Kappa Phi national fraternity for negligence among other things. Martha."

We turn to you often on, you know, sort of issues of where were going as a country, and I think these questions raise this. When you have -- you know, this is just one example, but you've got the sorority. And a scavenger hunt sounds like a fun thing, right? I mean, you look for things, maybe look for a certain statue around the campus. But it turns out from what it sounds like the stops along the way in the scavenger hunt dealt with sex acts, alcohol and drugs that had to be accomplished, let's say, as part of this scavenger hunt, what do you make of this?"

    {
      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the worst part of it is the whole idea of a sorority or a fraternity as being part of a brotherhood or a sisterhood. This isn't treating people like their brothers or sisters, it's treating them like their slaves. It's an indecent way for a person to be treated regardless of the circumstances. And the depersonalization, the fact that you can take a human being that has been entrusted to the care of the university by parents who are spending an enormous amount of money to send them to college, and then they end up needlessly dead because of this kind of outrageous behavior. Martha, it's symptomatic of a society that has lost touch. I would say -- and let me be bold and say lost touch with God, lost touch with each other, lost touch with the common sense of decency, and it's alarming. And, you know, I'm hoping that not just the suspension of a sorority, but a greater sense of a personal and spiritual revival breaks out in this country where we start treating people like human beings rather than things and objects."

I was in one when I went to school. And there was, you know, in all of these institutions. I think there's, you know, too much drinking, too much of a lot of things, OK. But I find it interesting, because these students today were raised in a culture where they had an enormous amount of focus in grammar school, on things like bullying, on sensitivity, on, you know, fitness, and your body, and understanding drinking, and all of those things. And I'm starting to wonder if these things sort of blew up in our faces because we have not raised, overall, you know, a generation that is treating each other very well, at least not in these situations"

But I do think that there's a depersonalization. There's not one thing that's a contributing factor and the only thing. But social media has given people a sense of anonymity. They don't have connections with human beings. They have connections with devices. And I do think that that has contributed to this notion that people aren't really humans, and I can say things to them, I can do things to them, because after all I'm hiding behind a pseudonym, I'm hiding behind this identity that I don't have to reveal, and I think that's a horrible way. When we depersonalize people, whether we depersonalized an unborn child, it's simply a fetus, we depersonalized Jews as the Nazis did, wee depersonalized people of color and we say to them as they did in 1857, in the Dred Scott decision, they're only three-fifth of a human being, that is the beginning of horrendous inhumane treatment to other human beings. And I don't think you can divorce that. The depersonalization is a critical part of it."

I'm not doing that. Part of the scavenger hunt, whatever it is.' It's tough. A lot of peer pressure. And we've got to give them strength for it. Thank you so much, governor.

So, for that reason, that's one of the reasons I believe that she was up near Howland Island.
