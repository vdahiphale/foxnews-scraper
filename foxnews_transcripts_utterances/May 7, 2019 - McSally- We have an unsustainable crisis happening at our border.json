      "utterance": "Hi there, Neil. And the talks between the U.S. and China will indeed take place later this week, although it will be delayed a day. Now it's taking place on Thursday and Friday. And China said today that its top negotiator, the vice premier, Liu He, will be a part of those discussions. As far as the expectations for China, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry saying today -- quote -- \"Our hope is that the two sides should work together and move in the same direction and strive to take care of each other's legitimate concerns on the basis of mutual respect and equality and strive for a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement.\" Now, after the markets closed yesterday, the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, went on the record saying the talks have suddenly gone backwards. For example, Lighthizer saying -- quote -- \"The bottom line is we felt like we were on track to get somewhere over the course of the last week or so. We have seen an erosion in commitments by China, I would say retreating from specific commitments that have already been made, in our judgments.\" Now, while that has made investors nervous, President Trump happens to have an unusual ally in the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer once again saying today that he believes that President Trump should stand tough."

That will go into effect first thing on Friday. When you step back here and take a look at the big picture with all of this about this delayed meeting and who is coming, who might not becoming, keep in mind, there still officially is not a scheduled meeting between President Trump and President Xi -- Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good afternoon to you, Neil. And the tariffs and the potential threat to hype them up certainly has the stock market rattled. And it has it rattled for a really good reason. It can have an impact not just on the consumer, but the overall economy. If businesses that use Chinese goods see these kinds of price hikes, there will be a two-pronged impact. They're either going to have to absorb those prices themselves, or they're going to have to pass them on to the consumers. Either way, you impact profitability, or consumer spending drops. That's the threat. Now, remember, these tariffs are on everyday goods that you and I are purchasing all the time, clothes, handbags, electronics, personal care items, so things like shampoo and perfume, home items, furniture, dishes, bed sheets, even meat and cereal. Now, businesses have said absorbing the 10 percent tariff has been difficult enough. It will be nearly impossible if you hike those prices. And it's not just about prices."

      "speaker": "RICK HELFENBEIN, CEO, AMERICAN APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION",
      "utterance": "Our members will start rushing out of China. And many of them have already left. And they go into another country, and they have to bump somebody out. So there goes your product integrity right out the door, and prices go up. You bake inflation right into the system. And you know what happens? Prices go up, sales go down, jobs get lost. This is what scares us the most."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "A study by the Trade Partnership suggests that this could have an impact of almost a million jobs. And when it comes to how it would impact a family of four, for example, over the course of a year, almost $800. That's a lot for a lot of people. And when you look at GDP, the estimates right now, it could shave about three-tenths of a percent off. So consider that. There's also the probability that there could be another 25 percent tariff impacting the remaining $325 billion of Chinese imports. So that could be coming down the pike as well. There is one bright spot here, Neil. And a lot of economists are saying it will urge people if this goes through to buy made in the USA. It won't make up for all the losses, but that is a positive point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, thank you for looking at the half-full glass there. Thank you very, very much. All right, so up until now, when it's been 10 percent, a lot of companies could absorb that without passing it on to you, or most of them not passing it on to you. They say, at 25 percent, all bets are off and that you will feel the pinch. Keep in mind that when tariffs are imposed, governments don't pay them. You do. So the impact for our economy with Lindsey Piegza. We have got FBN's Ed Lawrence at the White House and market watcher Alan Knuckman over at the CME. Ed Lawrence, are you getting that sense that this is going to happen, that there's not a lot of time, presumably, by Thursday, for them to agree on much of anything?"

It looks like, unless the Chinese come on Thursday and say they're going to put back the concessions that they had rolled away, then these tariffs are going into effect. Robert Lighthizer, the trade representative, made no uncertain terms. He said the president is going to oppose these tariffs on Friday at 12:01 a.m."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm looking at the relatively limited impact we have been seeing from what tariffs are in effect now. And the ones that are proposed, all of a sudden, everything changes that if they go up to 25 percent, if they include $300 billions-plus more in goods, and if they go from a few dozen items to better than 6,000, as is likely the case. Then what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, there's a lot of threads here. Now, optimism wins. I have been bullish and positive from a trader's standpoint for weeks, months, years, and looking like almost a decade now. So I don't think this changes the equation that much. We're only three quarters of a percent off of the all-time forever highs coming into today in tech and the S&P. So we're seeing a bit of a pullback. Yes, the points seem scary, but in percentage terms we're down 1.75 percent today, not really that significant. Now, when we're talking about the Trump world and the way things are unconventionally negotiated, shall I say politely,. let's be prepared for anything. We needed to be prepared for the statement that came on Sunday. I wouldn't be surprised and I don't think you would either if there was another statement tomorrow or the next day saying, everything's fine and we just made the greatest trade agreement in the history of the world. So be prepared."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "LINDSEY PIEGZA, ECONOMIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I do think that, at this point, it is sort of a waiting game. And although the U.S. will not escape unscathed, we do know that the vast majority of the pain is being felt overseas. When we look at the impact of the tariffs from late 2017 to 2018, it shaved off about two-tenths of percentage point from top-line GDP here in the U.S. The impact in China was about three times that or maybe even more. So we do know that China is feeling the pain, they do want to come to the table, and they do want to reach an agreement, as does the U.S. But there is more of an economic push on the Chinese side. That being said, there's also somewhat of a political push here in the U.S., with the 2020 elections very much on the forefront of voters' minds at this point. The Trump administration does want to reach some sort of a deal, even if it's not a perfect deal, but a step in the right direction, in order to say that he met that promise, that campaign promise, and really pander to the base."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, but let's remember, I think China has a little bit more room to delay. There are a lot of constituents here in the United States, from soybean farmers to the supply chains for all the manufacturers, to the consumer. And, again, it's a tax on us, meaning the U.S."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAWRENCE",
      "utterance": "And that is the strategy. And, as you know, their economy is suffering. And one of the things that they have to balance is actually the supply chains actually moving out of China. Some companies will look at this 25 percent tariff that could be enacted on Friday and then the additional 25 percent on everything else, and possibly move some of the supply chains. I saw analyst reports -- this was, I guess, the end of last year -- where they were saying Apple at 25 percent making an iPhone in China, it might be worth Apple moving that supply chain out of China. And that's something that Chinese just can't get back easily. So this is something they're going to have to weigh, as companies look decisions long term down the road. Are they going to move those supply chains? Could it be a fundamental shift in the Chinese economy? And they need to protect for that."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Guys, I want to thank you all very much. And to Alan's point about looking at the half-full glass on this, just a reminder that even though we fell about 473 points today, that wasn't even 1.8 percent of the Dow's value. Just as a point of perspective, on October 19, 1987, when the Dow fell a similar amount, a little over 500 points, it was a quarter of its value. That was then. The argument, it's a very different market now. We will have more after this."

But as we speak, our city of Yuma, Arizona, had declared a state of emergency. We have an unsustainable crisis happening at our border, hundreds of people often apprehended at the same time, unable to continue to keep them. The catch and release and the loopholes in our laws have to be closed. And so we need Democrats and Republicans to work together to close these loopholes now and secure the border. So that was the conversation we had today."

And I think there is a lot of pressure on the Democrats, as there should be, that they need to stop obstructing, because this isn't a game in Arizona. It's a public safety issue. It's a national security issue. And everybody knows, when I'm out and about in my state, that we have got to fix the border. We got to secure it and we got to fix our immigration system. So, I just ask my colleagues, let's come to the table and let's work on this together, so that we can solve it for the American people."

Again, this was a meeting where we talked about ideas to revamp our legal immigration system and secure our border, build the partnerships between the executive branch and the legislative branch, so we can set this legislation up for success to solve these really pressing problems.

Law enforcement sources there are telling our local station FOX for Denver and the Front Range that they have one suspect, that they're looking for two more. They believe at least two people have been injured. Local reports indicate a plethora of law enforcement have arrived on scene there, more than 50 law enforcement agents said to be there working to close down areas around this school. Again, it's in Douglas County, Colorado, outside of Denver. Highlands Ranch is the name of the place, a STEM School there. And again, one suspect down, looking for two more, a very fluid situation. And we're expecting a feed in from our local station momentarily there. The sheriff in that particular county has said that they're going to have a news conference in just a moment. So we expect to have further information from him, if and when that begins. Our local station, Fox for Denver, has crews on scene. And the latest information is that they're, as I mentioned, cordoning off the area. This is a Google Maps shot of the place, because we don't yet have a feed out of there.

On top of that, the vice president also says that the United States will be sending a hospital ship to the Caribbean to address the crisis there. The ship is expected to arrive in June. And it's on a five-month mission in that region. The U.S. has been consistently calling out Cuba and Russia for their interference in the crisis in Venezuela, supporting the Maduro regime there.

What do you think?"

And then, last week, when you had the absolute best chance in the world, that didn't happen either. And so I don't know what these very small measures here are going to do, because most people don't even know they have sanctions on them. It doesn't give them any money or anything. So I don't know why they would switch. But the bigger issue is, why would we want to? Because any time we have tried over the last several decades to regime-change, by whatever means, whether overt military or economic means, it has never worked out well. And when we try to insert ourselves into another country's diplomatic situation, we basically make their problems our problems. And that doesn't help anyone."

We don't want to continue to put America's credibility on the line by trying to advocate for something that then doesn't work, because then that actually lessens our influence that we could have elsewhere. And, again, it just doesn't work out for us. So we need to let the people of Venezuela handle their own situations. And, look, it's a terrible humanitarian disaster. We should be able to help with that any way that we can, help diplomatically. But we need to take the military off the table, because that won't help anyone."

Now, I know they, unlike lower-ranking soldiers and indeed the Venezuelan people, they are getting food, they are getting medicine. Maduro is taking very good care of them. Do you think we made any guarantees to protect them, offer them amnesty -- I know that was on the table some months ago -- to flip? So far, they're not flipping, or at least not in significant numbers."

      "speaker": "DAVIS",

But one thing we have to keep in mind is, there's very, very certain reporting that many of these generals are very much in the corrupt nature of the Maduro regime. They benefit from the status quo. They're the last ones in the world who are going to want to let it -- see it end, because then their gravy train, their ticket to get all kinds of corruption and money also would dry up. And so there's -- they're not likely to do that. So we probably should try to find some other ways, because that's -- I don't think that's a winning ticket."
