And in our case, the challenge he's felt every day because of the increasing number of Venezuelans coming into Colombia, because of terrorist organizations acting against Colombian interests from Venezuelan territory. Because the impact of the bad policies, economic policies in Venezuela. BAIER: When you hear President Trump talk about securing the U.S. border and the efforts to stop illegal immigration into the U.S., what is the sense from a Colombian point of view about how he's dealing with that."

And the fight to stop it can be dangerous. The Coast Guard recently released a video of officers boarding a speeding submarine off the coast of Colombia last month that was filled with more than 17,000 pounds of cocaine. In 2012, it's estimated Colombia produced approximately 210 metric tons of potential pure cocaine. That number rose dramatically to a high of 900 metric tons in 2017 and has dropped just a fraction since that time. The foreign minister promises the administration is working to reduce that number further."

So, the first thing that President Duque did was to strengthen the operation in Colombia in order to get those numbers down, they have leveled off already. And they're going to start to go down. Due to the huge effort that the administration made."

A deal that ended 50 years of internal conflict and earned Juan Manuel Santos the Nobel Peace Prize. Can you say now definitively that the peace deal that former president Santos cut with the FARC was not a good deal?"
