He gave in during the last government shutdown because of political pressure, the pain got too great. Now in this case he would have a bill on his desk.

Most of them have to do with sanctioning individuals in countries that are very troubled -- Nicaragua, Venezuela, Burundi, Yemen. But the President will say, look, last year about 400,000 people were apprehended trying to cross illegally into the United States between ports of entry. And who is to say that's not a national emergency? And that's what he'll argue.",

It also gives local authorities in five Texas border towns veto power over the wall. And it puts significant handcuffs on the President's discretion to make changes in spending. There are 354 instances in the bill where the phrases, \"none of the funds\", \"none of these funds\", and \"none of the amounts\" are used to place restrictions on how the money can be used or moved around. Declaring an emergency may allow President Trump to move some money around from other departments to add to wall construction. It will almost certainly land him in the courts, but he will be able to tell his base he did all he could to make good on his central campaign promise.

Byron York, chief political correspondent of the \"Washington Examiner\"; Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today\"; and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president. Byron -- your thoughts. BYRON YORK, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, on the bill itself, the President really has to sign it. He gave in during the last government shutdown because of political pressure, the pain got too great. Now in this case he would have a bill on his desk. The only thing between keeping the government open and shutting it down would be his signature. There is no way he wasn't going to do it. Now, on the issue of a national emergency, I think what we are going to see here is the Democrats are, of course, going to claim that there is simply no emergency, it just doesn't exit. The court challenges will be filed within seconds after the President does this. The President's case is going to be, look, there are about 30 current national emergencies declared by presidents. Most of them have to do with sanctioning individuals in countries that are very troubled -- Nicaragua, Venezuela, Burundi, Yemen. But the President will say, look, last year about 400,000 people were apprehended trying to cross illegally into the United States between ports of entry. And who is to say that's not a national emergency? And that's what he'll argue."

Word is that Senator McConnell is trying to still -- trying to prevent him from doing it. SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": Although Senator McConnell said on the floor of the Senate he would support the President if he declared a national emergency. You know, it's true that there are other national emergencies, that's not so rare. This is a somewhat different utilization of that presidential power than most of the others in history. And you know, interestingly, President George W. Bush once threatened to declare a national emergency and it was blocked in effect when George Miller from California used kind of an obscure parliamentary provision that meant that you could oppose it if you got a majority of the Congress to oppose to vote against the declaration of national emergency. It was repealed. It was pushed back. And that is another course that Democrats could pursue -- certainly that would pass in the house. It is possible a proposal like that might pass in the Senate because there are several Republicans who've expressed concerns."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Tom -- our latest possible we asked the question about bypassing Congress, declaring an emergency to build the wall. It is upside down -- this 56-38. But if you look at others, like number two -- I'm sorry number one, the budget deal that includes money for barrier, security and humanitarian aid, there is support for that. It's how you asked the question, obviously, where the support comes down. TOM BEVAN, \"REAL CLEAR POLITICS\": Yes. I mean this is a risky move on Trump's part in the sense that it does certainly shore up his base and it keeps the issue top of the mind. And I think the contrast that Trump likes is the idea that it's a matter of opinion. He says this is a national emergency and Democrats are rushing to barricade to say this is a complete fiction, it's an invention. That's a contrast that he wants. The downside is it does. It puts the focus back on a split in the Republican caucus. And the media will certainly cover all the Republicans that are going to come out and say, this isn't the proper way to go. So, you know, after Trump got a pretty significant bump in his job approval rating after the State of the Union speech in part because of the bipartisan message, I think, he's back to brawling. And so we'll see how this works out for him. But it's definitely a risky move on his part."

But you know, from a policy standpoint, this may not be a popular view, Trump actually did make some progress here. The administration has already been replacing about 125 miles of dilapidated, inadequate fence with new, strong barrier. This bill allows him to do 55 miles of currently unfenced area with a new, strong barrier. And that really arguably is an improvement in border security. Now, it's not nearly what the President wants. It's more like the glass quarter full. But on the other hand he actually made some progress from a time not too long ago where the Speaker of the House was declaring any such barrier immoral."

      "speaker": "ANDREW MCCABE, FORMER DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I was very concerned that I was able to put their Russia based on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace. I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground, and if somebody came behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, the former deputy FBI director, who was fired, and who is facing actually a possible criminal prosecution, talking to CBS. Lindsey Graham up on Capitol Hill wants him to have him talk to senators about what he's saying. The DOJ issuing a statement, \"The Deputy Attorney General,\" Rosenstein, \"again rejects Mr. McCabe's recitation of events as inaccurate and factually incorrect. The deputy attorney general never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references. As the deputy attorney general previously has stated based on his personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.\" Obviously, this is about wearing a wire possibly against President Trump. Quickly about this and what the fallout is."

      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "That's clearly the shocking revelation here is you've got members of the FBI and the Department of Justice sitting around counting cabinet heads, talking about plotting to invoke the 25th Amendment here against the president of the United States, the newly elected president of the United States. There's a word for that. It's called a coup."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So Susan, DOJ is essentially saying that he was out of the loop once Mueller goes in. He's no longer in the Russian investigation. And this is about may be retribution about Rosenstein."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "It could be. Remember when we had to wait years and years to find out what was happening in secret meetings in the White House and the Justice Department, historians would go through archives, discover them. Look at the wealth of information we get from people who are foes of the president, like Mr. McCabe, but from friends and allies and members of the administration. We had this incredible store of information that provides -- their details are different, but a reasonably consistent picture of chaos and conflict and deep concern on the part of career people at the FBI about this new president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "The question is what happened? He didn't wear wire. They didn't go forward with the 25th Amendment. And now we are waiting for the Mueller investigation to complete?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "There were several things that they actually did do. We knew the FBI began immediately authorized a counterintelligence investigation targeting the president specifically as well as, of course, the Mueller investigation came a few days later than that. This is really quite stunning and maybe one of the last things you have to think about. As when we speak now, we've had a new Senate confirmed attorney general for a few hours, and the question is why does Rod Rosenstein still have a job? A lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill have wondered that. And now that Bill Barr is in office, they are going to wonder that even more loudly."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "What struck me is I think the administration has done a pretty good job reorienting our policy toward Iran. That's been one of their focuses since they took office. We're they're struggling, and I think Pompeo admitted this, is getting Europe to come along. And they are working at it but not having as much success as they'd like."

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "He's sounded very critical of the allies, of Great Britain and Germany and France, who have devised this kind of scheme to help Iran get around the U.S. sanctions and keep the nuclear deal alive. It's clearly a big breach within our traditional alliance."
