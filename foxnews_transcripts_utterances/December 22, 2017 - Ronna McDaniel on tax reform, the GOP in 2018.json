Also tonight, Politico reporting that James Baker, the FBI's top lawyer was in contact with a liberal journalist David Corn of Mother Jones in the weeks before the outlet broke the first news story about the existence of the anti-Trump dossier.

He is a pit bull. He has already said that while the election was legitimate, the President is illegitimate at this point, because of the Russian probe. And that has been echoed by a number of other Democrats. In fact, that little blurb you had about the impeachment resolution actually got 58 votes before there had been any type of investigation that was started at all. On top of that, I saw a TV ad today by billionaire leftist Tom Stayer who is now calling for impeachment because he doesn't like the President's tax plan. Have we come to that now, David, where if you disagree with policy it's going to be impeachable? It's scary. A lot of these folks in the Democratic Party are moving the goal post. First they said it was about, you know, collusion, they couldn't get the smoking gun. So they shifted to talk about obstruction. Not enough there. So then they start talking about the President's personal finances in the 1990s. Maybe not enough there. So we will start talking about his relationship with women in the 1980s.

This is something that Republicans wanted for years and Democrats wanted for years and yet it never got done. Who would object to trillions of dollars being brought back into our country? Nobody. The biggest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. This is bigger than actually President Reagan's many years ago. I'm very honored by it. Democrats don't like tax cuts.

They have got the White House, the House, and the Senate. They stepped up here. And you heard McConnell and Ryan and others say, it was presidential leadership that got this across the finish line. We have heard Chuck Schumer for weeks now say that this is not going to trickle down. The workers, you know, the employees are not going to feel the corporate tax cut from 35 percent to 21 percent. What's happened the last 48 hours here?"

You've got to be fair and acknowledge that that any party in power when you have got a new president, Barack Obama faced this, Bill Clinton faced this, either party, you are going to likely face losses in the midterms. But, this tax cut may mitigate that that may help this president big time. Because when Chuck Schumer says, this is not going to trickle down to employees and then a whole bunch of companies like Boeing and AT&T say, we are giving out $1,000 bonuses. We may be hiring more people. We are investing in our company. That's exactly what the President promised would happen and which Democrats said would not happen. And so, if you have an economy that's already been picking up steam in recent weeks and months, all of a sudden take off in 2018, that's going to wreck some of the Democratic plans for major gains in the midterms."

And by the way, you now have every single Democrat in the House and Senate who is on record voting for higher taxes and lower wages because they didn't want to see what's playing out now play out.

We're going to grow our economy. We're going to fight for the American people. So, at the Republican Party, we are going to keep hammering home the great accomplishments of this president and Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan. And then we are going to remind them that the Democrats were nowhere to be found. In fact, Joe Manchin went home and he saw a big banner that said, we'll remember in November.

And that is so important to the small business owner because they were so constricted by these cumbersome regulations that were preventing them from growing and being able to expand their businesses. So that. And then with the tax cuts, they're going to take more money home. They are going to be able to invest in their businesses. They are also going to be able to help their families, this is great day for small businesses for like you said, those truck drivers, people across the country are going to benefit.

And there has been a divided points in the Republican Party.

The President has signaled that he wants to tackle infrastructure next year. That's something that should bring bipartisan support. You know, there's a lot in the accomplishment column for Republicans. What have Democrats done this year? What have they accomplished? Nothing. Resist and obstruct and fighting this president at every turn even if it's in the best interest of their constituents is not a message that they're going to be able to run on in 2018. This tax bill has shown that we can come together as a party. We can govern as a party. We have a president who is leading the way. And we are going to continue fighting for the American people.

These senators in these red states where President Trump won, they want the photo op with the President. They want to show that they are bipartisan. But so far they are totally beholden to their leadership, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. And when voters go to the ballot booth next November, they're going to ask, what did my senator do?

Basically the reason they did it was the $28 million tax incentive for them this year because they would get screwed next year. In addition, let's talk about the hundreds of jobs that are being taken away from individuals. The layoffs that they are having at AT&T. Over 600 of them, even more concentrated in Illinois."

They need to distribute some money and it makes them look good to say, hey, here are some bonuses. So, when you ask if it is a Christmas present, it may appear that way but that's not the reason. Is it a Christmas present to the poor? Is it a Christmas present to the elderly? Is it a Christmas present to the disabled or to people that don't make between 300 and $700,000 a year or don't itemize their taxes. I would say, no."

Number one, let's just look at Corporation CEOs, corporations employ 152 million American people. And I am really tired of the media spin that corporation CEO and Corporate America is evil. They supply us with jobs. They're not evil. And the last time I checked, both Democrats and Republicans, they own corporations. And the other thing that I would like to say which is just very irritating for me is the fact that, you know, this tax cut really amplifies what Donald Trump is trying to do. He got elected on the backs of the working man because the Democrats weren't representing them. And he turned, you know, blue states into red states. Look at the ones that he won. And he has made good on that promise. They are going to see money in their paychecks. And these corporations that are giving these tax cuts, they are giving back to their employees. So, they are not evil doers, so nice try for the Democrats' narrative to spin it to where, you know, the corporations are big fat cats and they are taking home a bunch of cash. They are giving it down to their employees. And there may be one or two bad actors that Leslie can maybe, you know, trump me on, but the majority, these guys, these women and men that are CEOs of American Corporations, they are giving it back."

Eighteen thousand, I like that edition if you are a single parent and 24,000. That means if you are a household under that 40,000, under that 50,000, you've suddenly got more of your money to use on top of that. The child tax credit. Big Democrat talking point.

There is something called 529 plan which is going to let people put money aside if they are putting their kids through K to 12 private school. Parochial school, what have you. That's a fantastic thing that Ted Cruz put in which can be very helpful, probably the biggest boost for school choice in decades, I'm sure. And whatever AT&T's motives are. It's very interesting. A&T may figure they're going to get some kind of a special benefit from giving this bonus to their employees. But what about Comcast, Sinclair, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bank. I thought they see, they're all the same, all of these other people. So, whatever AT&T's motives might be, it's very interesting this other major corporations are giving these bonuses, putting money into worker, education, committing to spend more money on production, on constructing facilities and this is just within 48 hours of passage in just a few hours of this bill being signed."

Eighty percent of the people according to the IRS who are taxed by the ObamaCare mandate make under $50,000. Wouldn't Democrats be on board with this?

Fox News exclusively reporting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has now ordered a Justice Department review of an Obama era law enforcement initiative called Project Cassandra. That initiative targeted Hezbollah's drug trafficking operations in the United States and abroad. Sessions' move follows a recent political report that alleges the Obama administration shut down this initiative in order to secure nuclear deal with Iran. Also tonight, Politico reporting that James Baker, the FBI's top lawyer was in contact with a liberal journalist David Corn of Mother Jones in the weeks before the outlet broke the first news story about the existence of the anti-Trump dossier. Here with reaction to all of this, former Utah Congressman and Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and FOX News legal analyst Greg Jarrett.

This was a massive group of cases involving the terrorist group Hezbollah and not prosecuting them for drug trafficking as well as money laundering. You can't hide behind prosecutorial discretion for that which means that I have concerns that justice may have been obstructed here by the Obama administration. You were not allowed to interfere in the due process of law for political purposes. It appears that the Obama administration was doing precisely that trying to curry favor with Iran on the nuclear deal. How many American lives were lost because of the influx by Hezbollah of cocaine into America?"

We are talking about if this political report is to be believed then it is true if it is true, that there were 30 agencies or so involved in this. Not just one agency. This is beyond discretion. What about the different layers of this and does Congress have a responsibility here with oversight and how so?"

This is exactly one of those disgusting stories where for purely political reasons so that the Obama administration can complete a deal with Iran, they turn their nose away. These investigators, they put their lives on the line. They are doing a great investigation and then it gets to the point where they are seeing that there are untold amount of drugs and cocaine coming into the United States of America via Hezbollah of all people. And they just are there to turn a blind eye, to not prosecute, to just tone it down? I mean, Politico, hats off to them. Because this is one of the best investigative pieces of journalism given the debt, these people are on the record. They are not some anonymous source. But the author of this piece has got to be proud of the work because he has done a good job documenting this. Congress should look at it and it's a disgusting story."

We now have another political report. And this one is about a senior counsel, James Baker, and what may, what may have been a connection to the Trump dossier. Where is the inspector general in this? How does congressional oversight get into play here?"

And actually the inspectors general kind of report up on a jurisdictional basis through the oversight committee. Michael Horowitz is the one that actually runs, is the inspector general at the Department of Justice for 150 employees. A massive budget. They have been doing the investigation on the Comey matter. The Hillary Clinton email matter. They have been silent. You haven't heard leaks. And now we have seen two publicly released news reports. One back in July saying in is James Baker, the senior most counsel there at the Department of Justice was being looked at for releasing classified information to a journalist. And then just today as you said, it popped that he has been reassigned. Now, we don't know exactly why that happened or what happened there, but, you know, people like Trey Gowdy and John Radcliff on the judiciary committee. Devon Nunez of the intel committee I'm sure are going to be all over this. But I have a lot of faith in the inspector general. I think they have ruled out a lot of things."

I find it hard to believe that it's just a coincidence that James Baker, general counsel at the FBI suddenly gets reassigned at the moment of Department of Justice targets him and a criminal investigates allegedly for leaking important anti-Trump dossier material to a liberal reporter just before the election. Is that a series of fantastic coincidences? My instincts as a lawyer tell me absolutely not."

      "utterance": "Yes, I thinks it starts with the inspector general and the 450 employees there. I think by the end of March, you will see them come out with a definitive report. That is going to be a critical piece. It was something that myself and Elijah Cummings in a bipartisan way asked and started. I hate to say this, but I said it previously. I do think they need a change at the Attorney General's office. I don't think that Attorney General Sessions is up to the job. He needs to recuse himself of all of this. It's why we have Director Mueller. There are deep seeded systemic problems within the Department of Justice that need to be rooted out. Again, it's going to be people like Trey Gowdy and John Radcliff and host of other people there that got to get their fingers into it. They have got to file documents and follow transcribed interviews and they can do the investigation they need to do."

The last three days on these other outlets in the media would dominated by this fake story.

Senators Schumer and Warner went to the floor of the senate saying we are having a constitutional crisis. Nancy Pelosi wrote to Speaker Ryan saying you must stop this.

      "utterance": "Well, it's nice to know Nancy is very worried about it according to the Washington Post, and the appointment of Jerry Nadler, the ranking Democrat on the judiciary committee is a clear sign of the left's intentions to impeach the President. I don't know what they are going to charge him with. Let's not talk about the constitution. That doesn't seem to matter on that process. Still with us, radio talk show host Steve Levy, Fox News contributors Doug Schoen and Deneen Borelli. You know what? Let's go to Doug Schoen right here. What's the strategy here? What's the plan? I mean, Maxine Waters, by the way, the poverty warrior that she is, has a 4.5-million-dollar mansion on 450,000 claimed income. That is another story I need to get in, because what are they selling to their base, Doug?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "They are selling resist. I'm a centrist Democrat. The Party has moved far left. They recognize they can keep everybody together with one simple principle. Resist and attack Donald Trump. I would have put forward an alternative tax plan. They didn't do that. Now, in fairness, the Republicans weren't that eager to compromise the Democrats didn't want. It's all about resist and attack and ultimately, if you listen to the talking points we just heard, ultimately, move towards impeachment."

    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "Well, they did very well in Virginia. They did very well in New Jersey. They have won a bunch of legislative seats. They are up by double digits in the generic vote, which usually pre-stages a substantial victory in the house elections. That is the deal and that is the strategy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "All right. Steve Levy you heard the strategy from Doug. I have got to tell you in the senate they are going to defend some 24 seats or. So and the Republicans are going to defend four, maybe six, so are the numbers really with the Democrats on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVY",
      "utterance": "Well, the numbers are with the Democrats if they take control of the house. And if they do, I think you can bet on impeachment being almost a certain at this. You have to understand Jerry Nadler, I know him because I was in New York politics during the 1990s when he first got elected into congress. He is a very smart fellow but very, very partisan. He is a pit bull. He has already said that while the election was legitimate, the President is illegitimate at this point, because of the Russian probe. And that has been echoed by a number of other Democrats. In fact, that little blurb you had about the impeachment resolution actually got 58 votes before there had been any type of investigation that was started at all. On top of that, I saw a TV ad today by billionaire leftist Tom Stayer who is now calling for impeachment because he doesn't like the President's tax plan. Have we come to that now, David, where if you disagree with policy it's going to be impeachable? It's scary. A lot of these folks in the Democratic Party are moving the goal post. First they said it was about, you know, collusion, they couldn't get the smoking gun. So they shifted to talk about obstruction. Not enough there. So then they start talking about the President's personal finances in the 1990s. Maybe not enough there. So we will start talking about his relationship with women in the 1980s. It really gives to say that they plan to undo the election."

    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "Clearly Deneen, you got women voters behind him, let me call this silly word in there, the constitution. Bill Clinton who was impeached on the 19th of this month back in 1998 had to be charged with a crime. There's to be a chargeable crime to impeach a President in the house. And, yet, nothing they have brought up in reasons works. Cases keep getting thrown out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BORELLI",
      "utterance": "They are saying just because he is President he should be impeached. Even had Maxine Waters screaming for impeachment at a eulogy. This is how low the Democrats will go because they are so desperate. They don't like the fact that President Trump is in office."

      "utterance": "Steve Levy, Doug Schoen, Deneen Borelli. You do a great job. Look at this lineup, radio, television, and someone who actually tells it by the numbers. Doug, I don't know, they will throw you out of the Party."
