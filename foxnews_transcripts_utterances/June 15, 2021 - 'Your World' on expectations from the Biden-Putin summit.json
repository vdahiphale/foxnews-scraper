But, today, the focus is on China, which is facing increasing pressure to cooperate with world leaders, look into the origins of COVID, as the death toll from the illness tops 600,000 in this country today. The European Union today joining with the G7 in calling for a transparent, evidence-based inquiry. We're going to be speaking with Virginia Republican Congressman Rob Wittman in moments. He is sponsoring a bill today that would sanction certain Chinese officials until China complies. Welcome, everyone. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" First to Rich Edson. He is live in Geneva, where U.S. and European officials are pressuring China for answers. But the big question, Rich, is, will they get any?",

And this began this week with the Group of 7 meeting, the G7, coming out with it statement pushing on the World Health Organization to push into this investigation and try to find out how COVID-19 began. That followed on today with the European Union and the United States with this statement coming out earlier today -- quote -- \"We call for progress on a transparent, evidence-based and expert-led WHO-convened phase two study on the origins of COVID-19 that is free from interference. And we commit to working together toward development and the use of a swift and independent means for investigating such outbreaks in the future.\" Now, China's government is largely refusing that. They do not want an independent examination into the origins of the virus in China, they have said, to determine whether this came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or whether this came from nature. In fact, China's government has essentially said, go look at U.S. government bio labs instead. And so, with all of that, there are some Republican congressional leaders who are calling for another inquiry.",

Border Patrol here completely overwhelmed, overstretched and undermanned. And just to highlight that point for you, just as we're getting ready to go live, this large group of migrants just pop out of the brush right behind us here. There are no Border Patrol units here. So they're just sitting down waiting to be apprehended. Some of them look to be in a lot of stress from the heat. It's very hot out here. It's incredibly humid, but, again, Border Patrol units, there's no one here right now to apprehend these folks. And that just kind of tells part of the story there, that they are so stretched thin, we have a group right here just waiting to be captured. But talking about that stash house, take a look at this video that we shot yesterday. This is exclusive video. We were tipped off to. This was a human smuggling stash house that was busted in Alton, Texas, yesterday, about 20 minutes away from where we are right now. It appeared to be an old auto garage. More than 100 migrants being kept there by those human smugglers in some pretty horrible conditions, completely crammed on top of each other in that heat, with no air conditioning. What happens is, these human smugglers will bring them across the border, leave them at the stash house, and hold them there until they're ready to move them elsewhere, deeper into the United States. And actually spray- painted on the wall of that stash house were the letters CDG. Law enforcement sources tell me that stands for Cartel del Golfo, the Gulf Cartel. That's the Mexican drug cartel that runs this area on the opposite side of the border in Mexico. They're big into human trafficking and drug trafficking. And they are profiting greatly from this crisis. More activity. Take a look at this video we shot here from right where we're standing this morning. This is La Joya, Texas. Like clockwork, every single day, every single morning, large group of migrants just come out of the brush and walk down the road and give themselves up to Border Patrol. I cannot stress to you how often this happens like clockwork, every single day. These are mostly those family units, those people who are not trying to run away. But we see this every single morning out here. And as we finish up back out here live, taking a look at this again, still no Border Patrol units here. And it's not Border Patrol's fault. They're doing everything they can. They're completely overwhelmed. They can't be everywhere at once. We saw one unit drive by and just leave them there, which suggests potentially they got other action the border that's more important right now. So, despite what the administration says that the border is closed or it's under control or the messaging that migrants shouldn't come right now, that messaging isn't getting through. And the border, as you can see, is not closed. We will send it back to you.",

But on the other, you don't want to have litigation, even if it doesn't end up going in employees' favor, but you don't want to have to deal with that, on top of disgruntled employees and the morale that might come along with forcing people to do something that they feel is a personal choice. So it seems that a lot of companies are not mandating, even though, legally, I think they have a lot of basis to do that. And they probably could get away with it.

So a lot of these companies have an obligation to show their staff, show their employees that they're creating a safe work environment. I go to my last question, and that is this. We all are taught what's right, H.R., what is politically correct, what you can and can't say in the workplace.

Some of that money fueling Democrats' green energy dreams, $31 million going to clean energy projects alone in the state, including $4 million for electric vehicle charging stations and $19 million to put electric buses on the road. But there are some projects included that may make some do a double-take, including over $6 million for a suicide safety net to be installed at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, $6.5 million for a bike trail in Menlo Park. That's where Facebook is headquartered -- $3 million for a bike trail through Napa's Wine Country, and another $3 million for new toilets and lights at a San Francisco Bay Area Metro station. California, though, does have the extra cash to pay for this stuff if they wanted to. They have a $76 billion surplus.

But, today, the focus is on China, which is facing increasing pressure to cooperate with world leaders, look into the origins of COVID, as the death toll from the illness tops 600,000 in this country today. The European Union today joining with the G7 in calling for a transparent, evidence-based inquiry. We're going to be speaking with Virginia Republican Congressman Rob Wittman in moments. He is sponsoring a bill today that would sanction certain Chinese officials until China complies. Welcome, everyone. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" First to Rich Edson. He is live in Geneva, where U.S. and European officials are pressuring China for answers. But the big question, Rich, is, will they get any?"

And this began this week with the Group of 7 meeting, the G7, coming out with it statement pushing on the World Health Organization to push into this investigation and try to find out how COVID-19 began. That followed on today with the European Union and the United States with this statement coming out earlier today -- quote -- \"We call for progress on a transparent, evidence-based and expert-led WHO-convened phase two study on the origins of COVID-19 that is free from interference. And we commit to working together toward development and the use of a swift and independent means for investigating such outbreaks in the future.\" Now, China's government is largely refusing that. They do not want an independent examination into the origins of the virus in China, they have said, to determine whether this came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or whether this came from nature. In fact, China's government has essentially said, go look at U.S. government bio labs instead. And so, with all of that, there are some Republican congressional leaders who are calling for another inquiry."

And the only way that we make that happen is to be aggressive, to be direct in what we expect out of China. And what we know is the information that is out there, if they're willing to divulge it.

It's about holding China accountable. It's about making sure this never happens again. Over 600,000 people in the United States have died from this virus.

We have heard from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said any suggestions about this originating from a lab where pooh-poohed. It wasn't politically correct, in some cases, to bring this up within the State Department walls. So what is going on here, as the American people -- you are clearly saying with this announcement today, the American people want to know more. So why didn't we want to know more earlier on?"

Those are world-renowned experts that are starting to call into question these issues. I think countries around the world are saying, China needs to be held accountable. They need to be transparent.

      "speaker": "BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Sandra, we're in the Rio Grande Valley here, and this is by far the busiest section of the U.S.-Mexico border. Border Patrol here completely overwhelmed, overstretched and undermanned. And just to highlight that point for you, just as we're getting ready to go live, this large group of migrants just pop out of the brush right behind us here. There are no Border Patrol units here. So they're just sitting down waiting to be apprehended. Some of them look to be in a lot of stress from the heat. It's very hot out here. It's incredibly humid, but, again, Border Patrol units, there's no one here right now to apprehend these folks. And that just kind of tells part of the story there, that they are so stretched thin, we have a group right here just waiting to be captured. But talking about that stash house, take a look at this video that we shot yesterday. This is exclusive video. We were tipped off to. This was a human smuggling stash house that was busted in Alton, Texas, yesterday, about 20 minutes away from where we are right now. It appeared to be an old auto garage. More than 100 migrants being kept there by those human smugglers in some pretty horrible conditions, completely crammed on top of each other in that heat, with no air conditioning. What happens is, these human smugglers will bring them across the border, leave them at the stash house, and hold them there until they're ready to move them elsewhere, deeper into the United States. And actually spray- painted on the wall of that stash house were the letters CDG. Law enforcement sources tell me that stands for Cartel del Golfo, the Gulf Cartel. That's the Mexican drug cartel that runs this area on the opposite side of the border in Mexico. They're big into human trafficking and drug trafficking. And they are profiting greatly from this crisis. More activity. Take a look at this video we shot here from right where we're standing this morning. This is La Joya, Texas. Like clockwork, every single day, every single morning, large group of migrants just come out of the brush and walk down the road and give themselves up to Border Patrol. I cannot stress to you how often this happens like clockwork, every single day. These are mostly those family units, those people who are not trying to run away. But we see this every single morning out here. And as we finish up back out here live, taking a look at this again, still no Border Patrol units here. And it's not Border Patrol's fault. They're doing everything they can. They're completely overwhelmed. They can't be everywhere at once. We saw one unit drive by and just leave them there, which suggests potentially they got other action the border that's more important right now. So, despite what the administration says that the border is closed or it's under control or the messaging that migrants shouldn't come right now, that messaging isn't getting through. And the border, as you can see, is not closed. We will send it back to you."

We have had semi-trailers that have killed people that we found. And this crisis continues, and there's no solutions coming from the White House. Instead, Vice President Harris is meeting with dreamers, instead of meeting with the law enforcement that have to deal with this on a daily basis. We're getting overwhelmed.

Optics is part of leading, there is no doubt. And all of this is happening while Kamala Harris, the vice president, who has been assigned in charge of this crisis by President Biden, she is currently talking about the 10th anniversary of DACA in Washington. She has not paid a visit to the border. I believe it's 83 days and counting that she's been in charge of this crisis.

She can't come to the border, because, if she does, she's going to be expected to fix the problem. And then there is no political will to fix the problem. All you have to do is look at the interviews that she's given. When she says that she's an advocate for undocumented aliens in this country, that is clearly inviting these people to come across the border, if they know that the vice president is going to advocate for them? Then she says, don't come because I believe you're going to be sent back. What president or vice president says, I believe something is going to happen? They have to know exactly what the consequences are going to be. Yet she doesn't. She continues to say these things. And then their actions add to this problem."

      "utterance": "Now you will be able to see those smiles at the Happiest Place on Earth, starting today, Disney lifting its mask mandates for vaccinated guests at its two flagship parks in California and Florida. If you don't have a shot, you will still need to mask up on the ride and other indoor attractions. Disney also saying that it will not require its employees to show proof of vaccination. But not all companies are taking the same path as the Mouse House. Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley pushing workers to prove their vaccination status. Goldman using an internal online portal for proof. But how far can companies legally go with this? Let's get the read from attorney Katie Cherkasky. Katie, thanks for joining us. Everybody's got big questions about this, because so many folks who have been working from home, they're getting called back into the workplace. They're concerned about whether or not they need to be vaccinated and show proof of that. I believe that they're also concerned about the others around them being vaccinated, because unless you wear a pin on your shoulder that says you are, you just really don't know. So what can companies do to ensure that people are safe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, private employers really have very broad discretion to mandate vaccines. I think that there's a very common misconception that HIPAA requires employers to not ask these questions. But that's just not true, because most employers are not regulated by HIPAA. That's only for very specific health plans and health care clearinghouses. So a normal employer can ask the question, and they can mandate that as a condition of employment, except for in cases of religious exemptions or disability exemptions, which always existed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "There's -- it's a matter of whether or not you have to show your medical records to your employer. And I'm sure you can tell us all day long about the restrictions there are for doing that. And, certainly, there's medical reasons and, in some cases, religious reasons why people decide not to do. This is going to be -- my guess -- an incredibly difficult path to navigate for these companies who have never been here before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "I think that's absolutely true. And I think it's difficult for employers to make the right decision, because, on the one hand, you don't want an outbreak of some sort. But on the other, you don't want to have litigation, even if it doesn't end up going in employees' favor, but you don't want to have to deal with that, on top of disgruntled employees and the morale that might come along with forcing people to do something that they feel is a personal choice. So it seems that a lot of companies are not mandating, even though, legally, I think they have a lot of basis to do that. And they probably could get away with it. But they're not doing that because of those downsides, I believe, at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to be really interesting if companies do decide to mandate that how many people who haven't been vaccinated will go do so, or if we're going to see lawsuits as a result, people who just don't want to show their medical status. But all of this is incredibly important for getting people back to work, because, in some cases, when we talk about nine million job openings in this country, we are told the reason for that, in some cases, is people don't feel safe returning to the workplace. So a lot of these companies have an obligation to show their staff, show their employees that they're creating a safe work environment. I go to my last question, and that is this. We all are taught what's right, H.R., what is politically correct, what you can and can't say in the workplace. I wonder what it's going to be like if people decide to ask, are you vaccinated, or -- after we all got vaccinated, it seemed like we were all sharing that with each other. But is it going to be OK to ask someone if they have been?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "Well, you could certainly ask somebody that. I mean, obviously, the social awkwardness is one thing to navigate. But there was, in fact, a lawsuit was filed out of Texas, and the federal judge in that case actually dismissed it, saying that the employer could mandate the vaccines even for people that chose not to do so for non-religious or non-disability purposes. So it looks like, on the legal side, they're going to be able to do so. But the question is really, do the employers want to do that? Is that good for business? And that's the bigger question."

And the Golden State gets more of them in this bill than any other state. If passed, California will receive over $900 million in federal taxpayer cash to fund different projects in California's congressional districts. Some of that money fueling Democrats' green energy dreams, $31 million going to clean energy projects alone in the state, including $4 million for electric vehicle charging stations and $19 million to put electric buses on the road. But there are some projects included that may make some do a double-take, including over $6 million for a suicide safety net to be installed at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, $6.5 million for a bike trail in Menlo Park. That's where Facebook is headquartered -- $3 million for a bike trail through Napa's Wine Country, and another $3 million for new toilets and lights at a San Francisco Bay Area Metro station. California, though, does have the extra cash to pay for this stuff if they wanted to. They have a $76 billion surplus.

We're seeing these huge cyberattacks that are going on in America that are crippling our infrastructure. We're seeing President Biden green-lighting a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. At the same time, he killed the Keystone XL pipeline. Here's what I like to see happen. He should move that meeting from Geneva, move it to the Southern border. Bring Putin to the Southern border.

Right now, it's about $3.50 on average across the country, up from $3.21, and now more than the average price for a gallon of gas. The experts tell me that it's probably going to get worse before it gets better. And it's not just milk at the stores. It's also the price of bacon. That's up 13 percent over last year. Citrus fruits, those are up 9 percent or more. I'm here at the Klein Farms in Eastern Pennsylvania. They tell me they have been doing this for nearly 90 years.

Yesterday, a major firm said, we think Chipotle is a buy, even though they're paying $16 an hour, they're paying for pet insurance, they're paying for all kinds of things to lure workers.

Joining us, Independent Women's Forum Patrice Lee Onwuka, The New York Post's Kelly Jane Torrance, and Democratic strategist Laura Fink. Patrice, I will start with you first. I mean, obviously, he wants people back in the office. Isn't there -- doesn't he have a point? If you're going out to restaurants, you're grocery shopping, you're back out again, well, shouldn't you get back to the office?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a fair point. I mean, a lot of the concerns about health are receding, and especially for parents. Children should hopefully all be back in school full-time this fall. So maybe some of those concerns that kept workers at home are eroding. But I have got to say, this is a big deal. It's going to have a rippling effect in New York, with the competitors, the customers. Any businesses that deal with Morgan Stanley may start to follow suit. So this can be a really -- a really big deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, I can tell you, New York City needs them to return. It would be a good thing for the city to see them back, all those workers. But to go on, Kelly, to his other words, if you want to get paid New York rates, you work in New York. And it's a fair point. If you're going to continue to accept the salary that you had pre-pandemic, and you're living somewhere else, perhaps in a more rural area, or you went to Florida or whatever it may be, then maybe a company shouldn't have to continue to pay you those New York rates. What say you?"

    {
      "speaker": "KELLY JANE TORRANCE, NEW YORK POST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think I think he has a point there, Sandra. But there's a reason, I think, that a lot of people haven't come back to New York yet. And that is crime. I can walk to the restaurant down the street from me. I'm not taking the subway right now, honestly, because I don't feel safe. A lot of crimes, including felony assaults, are still up, despite ridership being down. And polls show that only about a quarter of New Yorkers right now feel safe on the subways. Before the epidemic, that was 65 percent. So it's a bigger issue than just, hey, get back to work. There's a lot of work I think the city's leaders need to do to get New Yorkers back to work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I think, Laura, that's a fair point, because we're not just talking about the risks of COVID getting back into the workplace. Certainly, in cases like New York City and some other hard-hit cities as far as crime, workers could be hesitant to go back for that reason, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAURA FINK, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Let's look at the data -- $4.1 billion, that's the amount of increase in revenue year over year that Morgan Stanley made. They could be sharing that wealth with their workers. Instead, they're threatening to cut salaries, when these workers have been increasingly productive, and have provided them and increased their bottom line. Instead of attracting them back to work with the carrot, he comes in hard with the stick. That's pretty typical of sort of top-down banking culture, and different than what we have seen in other tech companies, like Twitter and Salesforce. Look, 50 percent of workers want to do some kind of telework. Now, either companies are going to be responsive to that, or they're going to incentivize them to come into the office with rewards, or they're going to face talent and retention problems. That's -- workers have increased power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINK",
      "utterance": "And I think that's a good thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "So, let me dig into that last point with you, Patrice, because Citigroup just down the street from Morgan Stanley is saying, we are going to continue to offer a hybrid model. Some of these banks are deciding to give their workers an option to work some days in the office, some days from home. So isn't that going to become a major recruiting point with some of these big corporations, if they're going to offer a hybrid model?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ONWUKA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think so. I mean, to Laura's point, when we do look at polling, 86 percent of workers who worked remotely say they want to continue to do so. But only 25 percent want to do it full-time. So, it's an incentive for new employees and to retain current employees. But it is also an incentive to draw those people who are in other far-flung cities and locations that a lot of these companies couldn't necessarily bring to the city, but now can do so through a hybrid model. So I absolutely do think you will see more of this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "All right, Kelly, so wrap this for us, as a New Yorker yourself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "He says",
      "utterance": "\"Labor Day, I will be very disappointed people haven't found their way into the office.\" Do you think people are going to listen to this message and get themselves back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of people want to go back. I'm going back once in a while. I'm not in every day. I'm going in once a while. But the thing is, I have missed my co-workers. I missed that collaboration. So, until everyone is going back, and we're going to see that same kind of teamwork, throwing ideas off each other, I think it's going to be harder to get people in. You have got to get some kind of first wave that brings in the second and third wave."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "And, Laura, to your point, while productivity has been up in many cases for these big corporations, there's questions over whether or not that lasts, because if you have a workplace environment that originates outside of the office, will the productivity remain high in some of those cases? All really good points across the board. Thanks for joining us, ladies."
