      "sentences": "And thanks, Tucker, and welcome to \"Hannity\" and this is a Fox News alert. Tonight exclusively right here on the show, I can confirm from multiple high ranking DOJ sources who have now confirmed to me directly that the Attorney General of the United States has not recused himself from the Uranium One issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, that is huge news tonight. We'll have more on this breaking news from Gregg Jarrett in just a minute. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, we are following several developing new scandals tonight all centered around one person, Hillary Clinton and that ruthless political machine that mowed down anyone who threatened her quest to be leader of the free world. First, we have new evidence that Hillary Clinton rigged the DNC during the primary battle and she basically stole that primary from Bernie Sanders and the nomination. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, finally multiple prominent Democrats are speaking out against Clinton's corruption inside the Democratic Party. And also tonight, new developments surrounding Hillary Clinton's dirty dossier when she bought and paid for Russian about Donald Trump during the election. Tonight, we will lay it out exactly what laws she may have broken and why there is now time to start a formal investigation into her corrupt practices. Now, President Trump is even calling out the Justice Department for not investigating what could be widespread Russia collusion within the Clinton campaign and the Democrat Party. All of that and more in tonight's very important, Friday, breaking news, opening monologue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hillary Clinton, she has been caught red- handed rigging the Democratic primary in her favor. This according to former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile who says she found, quote, \"Proof that the Clinton campaign colluded with the DNC to demolish Senator Sanders. He didn't have a chance.\" Now, according to Brazile who has a new book coming out next week, Clinton controlled the Democratic parties finances strategy even had a final say on staffing, all while poor socialist Bernie Sanders tried in vain to take on the Clinton machine. Now, Brazile wrote an op-ed for political magazine entitled, \"Inside Hillary Clinton's secret takeover of the DNC.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She wrote, quote, \"I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton's team had rigged the nomination process as a cash of email stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested. I'd had my suspicions from the moment I walked in the door of the DNC a month or so earlier based on the leaked emails. But who knew if some of them might have been forged. I needed to have solid proof and so did Bernie.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Brazile later goes on to explain her findings. She wrote, quote, \"Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn't been very interested in controlling the party that she let Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn do as if desired so she didn't have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I have been trying to uncover for the last few weeks. By September the 7th, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.\" Well, that news should disturb every single voter in America. Now even some of Hillary Clinton's former comrades in the Democratic Party. They had now turning on the twice failed presidential candidate. Watch them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Now he directed us to the statement that he wrote on Twitter, that reads in part. \"Cruz of all of this bluster about DNC and HFA is Sanders didn't have the same opportunities to work with the DNC simply are not true. They opted not to.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Oh, really? You are really telling me Bernie Sanders had the same opportunities to control staffing and strategy and money and the head of the DNC, at the time that lifelong Clinton ally Debbie Wasserman-Schultz? Give us a break. Hillary had a secret sign contract. So, what they just told you is a lie. And by the way, countless Democrats must have known that Hillary had rigged the system and those are the people that stood by and said and did nothing. And then there is poor Bernie Sanders, he knew now that the system was rigged and yet he still supported Hillary Clinton in the general election. Where is his backbone? And today, Nancy Pelosi dodging questions when the reporters tried to ask her about all of this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is the highest level of corruption we have seen in our lifetime. Every single person that voted for Hillary Clinton you should be outraged. Especially those that voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, you were ripped off. This was a stolen election. It is a massive scandal. It is now dividing the Democratic Party. This will hunt Hillary Clinton for the rest of her life. Now, that smoking gun story broke just yesterday. But if you turned in to your network news broadcast last night, you wouldn't even know that this story existed. News buster's report today not one single second of coverage was dedicated to their story. Not on ABC, CBS and definitely not on NBC. Now this shouldn't surprise us. They are all driven by radical left wing ideology and politics. They are supposed to be fair and balanced to report the facts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this is called a bias of omission and it is the media's favorite trick to bury stories that look bad for their friends, their comrades, their Democratic Party. But unlike them on this show, we'd promise we will expose truth and we do it every night. Now tonight turned to another shocking revelation from Donna Brazile, not only she is calling out the corrupt Clinton machine but she also had a free choice word for former President Obama and how he nearly bankrupted the DNC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She wrote, quote, \"Obama left the party 24 million in debt, 15 million dollars in bank debt. And more than eight million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign and had been paying that off very slowly. Obama's campaign was not scheduled to pay it off until after 2016.\" Now months after being corrupted by Hillary Clinton and bankrupted by Barack Obama, the fledgling DNC is facing yet another scandal this time over a staffing e-mail first obtained by the Daily Wire from a Democratic technology manager. Now, this e-mail encourages staffers to look for candidates for some open positions. However, the manager then goes on to write this. I personally would prefer that you not forward literally the straight white males since they are already in the majority. Wow. Now, we reached out to the DNC and the personal wrote the email for comment shocking, well, we haven't heard back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is just one more example of the Democratic Party. They pretend that they're in an inclusive party for everybody all while actively now proven discrimination against people. And also tonight, new developments in the real Russian collusion story. And of course, I'm talking about the anti- Trump-Russian dossier bought and paid for, we now know by the Clinton campaign and created by a former foreign spy using false Russian intelligence. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All designed by Hillary Clinton, her campaign to use false Russian intelligence to now steal the general election just like she stole the primary from Bernie. And that is not all. The Clinton campaign funneled the funding of this document through a third party source in order to cover their tracks. But Hillary Clinton, she wants all of us to think, this is a none story because the dossier didn't come out until after the election. Watch this.",

And by the way, according to a brand new report, at the Daily Caller, the law firm that Clinton used to covertly fund this dossier, Perkins Coie was also responsible for helping the DNC avoid an FBI investigation after their servers were hacked. Now I wonder who Debbie Wasserman-Schultz got that law firm recommendation from. How is it that Hillary Clinton, think about this. How did she delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails BleachBit as it was the servers and then of course used a hammer on Blackberries and iPhones?

This is one of the corrupt -- most corrupt scandals that you've ever seen. And it's more than just bad optics. According to Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett who will join us in a few minutes, Hillary Clinton, others in her campaign may have broken serious election laws and you can see them on the side of your screen right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then of course, there's the Uranium One scandal, now that had put a course on national security risk for their benefit. When Hillary Clinton was one of what, nine people to approve the sale of a North American Uranium producer to let's see, the hostile regime of Russia, the bad actor Vladimir Putin giving 20 percent of our uranium to Russia when we don't have uranium, we have to import uranium. Hillary did this all while Bill Clinton, he got a huge payout from Moscow, the Clinton Global Initiative got huge donations up to $145 million with people associated with the Uranium One deal. And according to Gregg Jarrett, Clinton may have broken multiple fraud and bribery laws including wire fraud, mail fraud and many others.

Well, there, she may have broken multiple laws as well. These are very serious crimes. They must be investigated by our Justice Department and the Clintons must finally be held accountable for their actions.

      "utterance": "And thanks, Tucker, and welcome to \"Hannity\" and this is a Fox News alert. Tonight exclusively right here on the show, I can confirm from multiple high ranking DOJ sources who have now confirmed to me directly that the Attorney General of the United States has not recused himself from the Uranium One issue. Now, that is huge news tonight. We'll have more on this breaking news from Gregg Jarrett in just a minute. Plus, we are following several developing new scandals tonight all centered around one person, Hillary Clinton and that ruthless political machine that mowed down anyone who threatened her quest to be leader of the free world. First, we have new evidence that Hillary Clinton rigged the DNC during the primary battle and she basically stole that primary from Bernie Sanders and the nomination. Now, finally multiple prominent Democrats are speaking out against Clinton's corruption inside the Democratic Party. And also tonight, new developments surrounding Hillary Clinton's dirty dossier when she bought and paid for Russian about Donald Trump during the election. Tonight, we will lay it out exactly what laws she may have broken and why there is now time to start a formal investigation into her corrupt practices. Now, President Trump is even calling out the Justice Department for not investigating what could be widespread Russia collusion within the Clinton campaign and the Democrat Party. All of that and more in tonight's very important, Friday, breaking news, opening monologue. Hillary Clinton, she has been caught red- handed rigging the Democratic primary in her favor. This according to former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile who says she found, quote, \"Proof that the Clinton campaign colluded with the DNC to demolish Senator Sanders. He didn't have a chance.\" Now, according to Brazile who has a new book coming out next week, Clinton controlled the Democratic parties finances strategy even had a final say on staffing, all while poor socialist Bernie Sanders tried in vain to take on the Clinton machine. Now, Brazile wrote an op-ed for political magazine entitled, \"Inside Hillary Clinton's secret takeover of the DNC.\" She wrote, quote, \"I had promised Bernie when I took the helm of the Democratic National Committee after the convention that I would get to the bottom of whether Hillary Clinton's team had rigged the nomination process as a cash of email stolen by Russian hackers and posted online had suggested. I'd had my suspicions from the moment I walked in the door of the DNC a month or so earlier based on the leaked emails. But who knew if some of them might have been forged. I needed to have solid proof and so did Bernie.\" Brazile later goes on to explain her findings. She wrote, quote, \"Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn't been very interested in controlling the party that she let Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn do as if desired so she didn't have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I have been trying to uncover for the last few weeks. By September the 7th, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.\" Well, that news should disturb every single voter in America. Now even some of Hillary Clinton's former comrades in the Democratic Party. They had now turning on the twice failed presidential candidate. Watch them."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Earlier today, we heard from Donna Brazile that what many people had suspected for a long time has turned out to be true. The DNC secretly choose their nominee over a year before the primary elections even occurred."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "This is a real problem. What we've got to do as Democrats now is we have got to hold this party accountable. This is a test for Tom Perez."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "It was rigged. Now, we reached out for Clinton's communications director Nick Merrill for comments about Brazile's claims. Now he directed us to the statement that he wrote on Twitter, that reads in part. \"Cruz of all of this bluster about DNC and HFA is Sanders didn't have the same opportunities to work with the DNC simply are not true. They opted not to.\" Oh, really? You are really telling me Bernie Sanders had the same opportunities to control staffing and strategy and money and the head of the DNC, at the time that lifelong Clinton ally Debbie Wasserman-Schultz? Give us a break. Hillary had a secret sign contract. So, what they just told you is a lie. And by the way, countless Democrats must have known that Hillary had rigged the system and those are the people that stood by and said and did nothing. And then there is poor Bernie Sanders, he knew now that the system was rigged and yet he still supported Hillary Clinton in the general election. Where is his backbone? And today, Nancy Pelosi dodging questions when the reporters tried to ask her about all of this. This is the highest level of corruption we have seen in our lifetime. Every single person that voted for Hillary Clinton you should be outraged. Especially those that voted in the primary for Bernie Sanders, you were ripped off. This was a stolen election. It is a massive scandal. It is now dividing the Democratic Party. This will hunt Hillary Clinton for the rest of her life. Now, that smoking gun story broke just yesterday. But if you turned in to your network news broadcast last night, you wouldn't even know that this story existed. News buster's report today not one single second of coverage was dedicated to their story. Not on ABC, CBS and definitely not on NBC. Now this shouldn't surprise us. They are all driven by radical left wing ideology and politics. They are supposed to be fair and balanced to report the facts. Now, this is called a bias of omission and it is the media's favorite trick to bury stories that look bad for their friends, their comrades, their Democratic Party. But unlike them on this show, we'd promise we will expose truth and we do it every night. Now tonight turned to another shocking revelation from Donna Brazile, not only she is calling out the corrupt Clinton machine but she also had a free choice word for former President Obama and how he nearly bankrupted the DNC. She wrote, quote, \"Obama left the party 24 million in debt, 15 million dollars in bank debt. And more than eight million owed to vendors after the 2012 campaign and had been paying that off very slowly. Obama's campaign was not scheduled to pay it off until after 2016.\" Now months after being corrupted by Hillary Clinton and bankrupted by Barack Obama, the fledgling DNC is facing yet another scandal this time over a staffing e-mail first obtained by the Daily Wire from a Democratic technology manager. Now, this e-mail encourages staffers to look for candidates for some open positions. However, the manager then goes on to write this. I personally would prefer that you not forward literally the straight white males since they are already in the majority. Wow. Now, we reached out to the DNC and the personal wrote the email for comment shocking, well, we haven't heard back. This is just one more example of the Democratic Party. They pretend that they're in an inclusive party for everybody all while actively now proven discrimination against people. And also tonight, new developments in the real Russian collusion story. And of course, I'm talking about the anti- Trump-Russian dossier bought and paid for, we now know by the Clinton campaign and created by a former foreign spy using false Russian intelligence. All designed by Hillary Clinton, her campaign to use false Russian intelligence to now steal the general election just like she stole the primary from Bernie. And that is not all. The Clinton campaign funneled the funding of this document through a third party source in order to cover their tracks. But Hillary Clinton, she wants all of us to think, this is a none story because the dossier didn't come out until after the election. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Okay. It just blows Hillary Clinton's comments totally out of the water. But to steal a line from Hillary herself. Oh, what difference does at this point does it make? Her campaign still funded a former spy to put together sketchy false Russian intelligence in order to smear the character of Donald Trump and influence an election, and influence the American people. And by the way, according to a brand new report, at the Daily Caller, the law firm that Clinton used to covertly fund this dossier, Perkins Coie was also responsible for helping the DNC avoid an FBI investigation after their servers were hacked. Now I wonder who Debbie Wasserman-Schultz got that law firm recommendation from. How is it that Hillary Clinton, think about this. How did she delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails BleachBit as it was the servers and then of course used a hammer on Blackberries and iPhones? And why is it that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, what's going on here? She does the same thing. She had an I.T. guy with busted up hard drives in his garage and did the whole with the police and the laptop. I'm telling you there is so much evidence. What is wrong with the Democrats? How do they get to continue to obstruct justice? I'm telling you, we are only starting to touch the surface here. This is one of the corrupt -- most corrupt scandals that you've ever seen. And it's more than just bad optics. According to Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett who will join us in a few minutes, Hillary Clinton, others in her campaign may have broken serious election laws and you can see them on the side of your screen right now. And then of course, there's the Uranium One scandal, now that had put a course on national security risk for their benefit. When Hillary Clinton was one of what, nine people to approve the sale of a North American Uranium producer to let's see, the hostile regime of Russia, the bad actor Vladimir Putin giving 20 percent of our uranium to Russia when we don't have uranium, we have to import uranium. Hillary did this all while Bill Clinton, he got a huge payout from Moscow, the Clinton Global Initiative got huge donations up to $145 million with people associated with the Uranium One deal. And according to Gregg Jarrett, Clinton may have broken multiple fraud and bribery laws including wire fraud, mail fraud and many others. And let's not forget about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server scandal. Remember, mishandled national secrets, top secrets, special access program, confidential information, all top secret while she was serving as secretary of state. Well, there, she may have broken multiple laws as well. These are very serious crimes. They must be investigated by our Justice Department and the Clintons must finally be held accountable for their actions. Now, we'll talk to Gregg Jarrett and others in a few minutes to break all of this down. Meanwhile, the president rightly is now calling out the Justice Department for not investigating the Russian collusion story within the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. Here's the president from earlier."

As I have confirmed at the top of the program exclusively, multiple high-ranking DOJ sources, DOJ sources had confirmed directly to me that the Attorney General has not recused himself from the Uranium One issue. That is huge news tonight. Now, where is the investigation into the Clinton takeover, the DNC? Where is the investigation into the Clinton founded fake Russian news so- called dossier with lies and salacious materials to propagandize the American people before an election? So, we need to know. Where is the Justice Department on all of this? Will there be equal justice under the law as we have been saying we need in this country? And also according to an interview with Sharyl Attkisson which will air this weekend, President Trump believes that this Russia investigation will result in him being proven innocent. Finally, I want to end with some good news tonight which by the way, you'll never hear from the mainstream media because all they care about was delegitimizing this presidency of Donald Trump. All they talk about is Russia, Russia and Russia for a year with no evidence. Right now, we are getting the best economic news we have had in a long, long time. Something by the way, I was never able to say during President Obama's administration. Now since President Trump took office in January, our economy is taken off. In October, 261,000 new jobs created with manufacturing jobs adding 24,000. Unemployment now is at a 17 year low. Consumer confidence a 17 year high. And over a million viewer Americans are relying on food stamps, the best numbers in over seven years. The homeowners' rate in the last quarter has risen and more people are in the work force than say seven years ago. Wow! And two years ago, President Trump, he promised to make our economy great, that is exactly what is happening and that is only by getting rid of burdensome regulation. Hopefully Congress will now step up and do their job. Anyway, joining us now is former national justice director for Bernie Sanders, Tezlyn Figaro is with us. Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Former Clinton pollster, Fox News contributor Doug Schoen. Tezlyn, I guess I got to start with you tonight. I know you are a big Bernie supporter and if I supported Bernie Sanders and I found out the news that we just discovered yesterday, that the fix was in, that the primary was rigged, that she stole the election, that a signed secret deal was made with the Clinton campaign and DNC, I would be apoplectic. And how shocking this could happen in the United States of America in this day and age."

All of us from Sanders, staffers, supporters, surrogates have all come to say, we told you so. And it is so much bigger Sean than just a politician are being a pundit. I worked on the campaign. I spend seven, eight months on the campaign every day away from my 10-year-old child and lost my mother while I was on this campaign due to lung cancer really believing in the American process and we told you all along that it was rigged and so this is really a big deal to have Donna Brazile, someone who has been connected not just to the Clinton establishment but to the Democratic Party for over 30 years that has come out and spilled the tea on her own friends.

That suggests to me that the Department of Justice is looking very closely at all of aspects of the crooked Uranium One deal. It was corrupt, it was racketeering, bribery, extortions, kickbacks and so on. They are looking at that and who covered it up by not telling Congress about it which would have certainly killed the deal. Well, we know that Robert Mueller and Rod Rosenstein and Andrew Weisman were involved in the Uranium One deal and knowing about the illegality of it and didn't tell Congress and those three men are now presiding over the Trump/Russia case."

The far left which is the base of the party socialist, which is are many of the Bernie Sander's supporters. I saw in anchor today, I repeat myself. Bernie Sanders, he is note even really a Democrats. He was not running a Democrat. He won 22 million in 13 states even though she used it against him."

Earlier today President Trump tweeted the rigged Democrat primary and one of the biggest political stories in years got zero coverage on \"fake news\" TV network last night. It is disgraceful. It is disgraceful. Here with reaction, former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson. Look, I think you are a Hillary person, Austin, I get that, that is fine, but what about all of those people. They had a contract, Hillary was in charge of everything. Hiring and every bit of money and every decision and she had total control, Bernie the sucker never knew and he was in a rigged primary and super delegates on top of it. I would think you would be angry, I mean you want free fair and honest election and you are an honest guy."

You and I would be upset with now President Trump had we learned that he cheated his way in. And now these guys, I was on earlier on another program and they said it had no impact and all of these other excuses that the left tends to do, but the fact of the matter, Bernie's people knew he was cheated and the DNC has been cheating, Hillary Clinton and her band of crooks that is what they do. It is part of their DNA. And now the left is caught, it is like the Benghazi excuse. What difference does it make? It makes a big difference in the perception on how people believe politics work."

Only 373 theaters last weekend, it was the big movie breakout hit of the weekend. We're very, very humbled, appreciative so many of you liked it. The reviews have been incredible from so many people. The testimonials have been incredible. Hollywood has a formula. It is sex, violence and superman, Spiderman, Batman 99 or Jennifer Aniston falls in love or out of love with some new Hollywood actor. That is not our formula. So many times our values as conservatives or Christians are impound or not looked at when you go to movies. It's a special movie called \"Let there be light.\" I promise it will be intellectually stimulating. It will touch your heart, your mind, your soul. And most people cry. Anyway, we now have 700 locations this week. So many more of you will be able to see it go to hannity.com to find out where it is playing near you. By the way, here is a quick clip from the movie."
