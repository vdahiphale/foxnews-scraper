Remember, this is different than the Obama administration, which said we are not going to stand for this, and suddenly they had a different time zone and new passports."

      "utterance": "Amy is exactly right. It is a sort of words versus actions thing, and the actions, as is often the case with Donald Trump, sometimes he says things that -- different people take different ways. But the actions are I think the important thing here. But it was fun fireworks watching Pompeo's spar with Menendez and others. But at the end of the day of course the president of the United States can meet with foreign leaders privately, and of course he is allowed to have a secretary of state with whom he has conversations that are kept protected."

      "utterance": "I think there is a concern that Congressional Republicans did not want that summit to happen before the midterms, but I think also there is this broader understanding in the White House, at least with the advisors to the president, that if you can nail down some of the tangibles in terms of Syria going forwards to test the Russians out before the summit, that is a better way to go. I did think it was interesting on the Hill, today, as much as we talk about the president's rhetoric as a problem on Russia, Secretary Pompeo at one point saying he was being challenged by Democrats on what the Russian defense ministry is saying about the leader of Central Command, and he said why are you trusting what the Russians are saying? He was playing their own game at them and they didn't quite know what to do with that. So it's interesting, this wordplay."

      "utterance": "I don't know that we can get any more out of that tape. The question is how many more tapes are there? There are supposedly a dozen tapes, we don't know if the president is on any of those. And who is leaking them and how many more -- is this the most salacious, or are there more to come?"

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "It's been a year and a half since Donald Trump sent that tweet that blew the world up about how Trump Tower was tapped. We knew the DOJ had tapped at least somebody in there, and little did we know his private lawyer was doing it, too. I think the question is Cohen, did he make that recording in good faith or was he trying -- one thing I can assure you, I don't think CNN is doing much to preserve the evidence.
