One of the most interesting stories was when I went to Laredo, Texas, which is, has a Hispanic mayor, mostly Hispanic town, Hispanic law enforcement, they are tough boy on border security there and they explain why.

Is the press covering this as a human tragedy or an indictment of the Trump administration? Veteran journalist Sharyl Attkisson joins our discussion. Plus, the star of U.S. women's soccer team blows off the national anthem and now she is insulting President Trump. The media debate over Megan Rapinoe. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" There were 20 Democrats arguing over four hours in the debates on NBC and MSNBC but the media are fixated on one exchange, replaying it over and over between a former vice president and a black senator from California."

Huge picture of Kamala Harris -- hope to zoom in more -- so, journalists on the left and right agree, strong moment for Kamala, weak moment for Biden, but it seems like many of them were just waiting to pounce on Joe Biden for misstep and to talk up someone like Kamala Harris who is more liberal and by the way not a white male."

We saw that unclear display over both nights. Savannah Guthrie had a good moment where she did not let Bernie Sanders off the hook for raising tax on the middle class. She had a follow-up question where she got him to admit that his plan would indeed raise taxes on the middle class."

This is a great made for TV moment for the president. He is accomplishing sort of what he likes through the lens of the camera. But has the president overstated some of the progress so far considering that North Korea has not stopped its nuclear build up? It has not stopped testing ballistic missiles, while he today touted that they were returning hostages, there was the Otto Warmbier situation and there was -- you know, the Pentagon itself says that we kind of stalled talks on hostage release.

It will just be seen as another handshake in front of the cameras in a historic place obviously if there is very little progress in North Korea. I said to my staff a couple of days ago, the president is going to do something to regain, to commandeer the news cycle over the weekend because it was dominated obviously by the two nights of Democratic debates and also by the news that Robert Mueller is going to testify before a couple of House committees on July 17th. There was a huge build-up over that and it's going to be a massive TV spectacle, of course. But what surprised me about all the media excitement about this is Mueller has made very clear, he said in one appearance he is not going to go beyond what's actually in his report, he will probably try to be dull and somewhat bureaucratic as former FBI director. I think many liberals have a sense that if he just reads from the report, that that would be a game changer because most people haven't read the report. Very quick thought from you on that."

And what's been different about this president the way we've treated him is we have overtly suspended many of our normal ethical standards and practices because we have declared him to be uniquely dangerous and hostile to America, so, you know, we've excused ourselves. I argue that it is more important than ever when you're covering somebody that you don't like or don't agree with to maintain your ethical standards.

Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times, now says his paper was overly cautious in covering the 25-year-old sexual assault allegation Trump by inviting the columnist E. Jean Carroll.

I really don't want to second-guess the Times' own assessment of itself. That's what they view that they were overly cautious. But as a journalist, I don't think overly cautious particularly for stories and allegations like this is a bad thing. I looked back to during the Clinton years, we, at CBS News, when I worked there, had many more obligations than we ever reported on. And we delivered it those with a lot of thought because it wasn't because we didn't believe the women. We weren't in a position to know enough. There wasn't enough evidence to point to that that would justify based on our evidence and standards making a story that could be so damaging out of the things that they were saying."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Now, Trump didn't help himself by saying of E. Jean Carroll, well, she's not my type. A lot of people found that offensive. But in this climate for journalists given how difficult it is for women to come forward, are they almost allowed to say, well, I have doubts about her story or she's saying some odd things in interviews as we just saw?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ATTKISSON",
      "utterance": "You know, on full measure we covered a story that I called it shades of gray. And it looked at the very valid Me Too movement components of that but how that can be weaponized in a way that is unfair to the people who are accused and may not be guilty. And we had an example of a man who was accused of rape allegations. The police we're told that he was guilty of rape and so on. In the end, he wasn't, he sued, the woman retracted her claim but he'd been destroyed. I think we as journalists should point out both sides and should be mindful that although we want to believe women and that victims are typically to be believed, we, as journalists can't suspend again, our ethical standards and practices and the thought of evidence just because we like somebody or we feel sorry for them or we wish to believe them."

And what I hear when I'm there is far more reflective of what the polling shows nationally that, you know, vast majority of the American public is compassionate and feeling about the problems that people have when they're coming here and want to come here, but also believe we should have a secure border and that we have a problem. One of the most interesting stories was when I went to Laredo, Texas, which is, has a Hispanic mayor, mostly Hispanic town, Hispanic law enforcement, they are tough boy on border security there and they explain why. There's a criminal concern if they are not protective of the border in their community. They also rely on business south of the border with their friends in Mexico. So, it's an integral relationship to Laredo, but it's textured in nuance in much more like what you hear from the general public than what you may see represented on the news."

Lawyers warn that kids are taking care of kids and there's inadequate food, water and sanitation for the 250 infants, children's and teens -- children and teens at the border patrol station.

Because in January when President Trump drew attention to the border crisis, the media reporting and the Democratic politicians were all saying that Trump had manufactured the crisis. And if you look at the reporting from this week, they're not acknowledging the basic issue that a country needs to secure its borders and they don't detail, except for Washington Post. I will say there was one article by the Washington Post that talked about how there's a legal history of this going back to the Obama administration and the Clinton administration with the Flores settlement in 1997, but most of the media are silent on the need for a border and they're silent on the fact that this is something that's been going on for at least 20 years."

They're not saying there's a financial crisis in the country created by undocumented citizens, undocumented people, they're saying that there's a humanitarian issue at the border created by Trump. So, it's a play on words. But the media has also been covering since the Obama years. I mean, detention centers, have been photos taken there, they've been talked about in the New York Times, for example, has been covering this for years during the Obama years."

So, everything is coming secondhand from lawyers who are visiting. So, you had this past week, the director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Colombia Law School, a top official at Human Rights Watch being interviewed on TV., so are media outlets relying on advocates?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "They certainly are. And you can even look at it some of it in their reporting where I think the journalists don't even realize that they're building a case against the people that they are using as evidence to talk about these places. One of the lawyers that was interviewed in the New Yorker piece talks about how it would be cheaper to send these children with their parents in the U.S., it will be cheaper for the U.S. taxpayer. What that doesn't make sense on a financial basis and they don't push back about that at all in their own articles. So, when you look even in their own reporting these people that they are relying on for all the evidence about the conditions in these places are people who are partisans and they have an agenda on these issues and that's not journalistic, good journalistic standard."

So, we are hearing from the Latinos who speak Spanish from Univision and Telemundo, so the Spanish reporters can hear about people from those facilities as well once they do get out.

      "utterance": "And when you compare it to John Isner last year at Wimbledon when he said he supported the president, all the headlines, most of them were particularly negative against the ninth ranked tennis player in the world representing our country.
