Last night, Florida Governor DeSantis said two planes full of illegal immigrants to the progressive paradise known as Martha's Vineyard. Which makes sense, it's a vineyard, and those grapes are not going to pick themselves. I mean -- I mean, I assume there'll be plenty of work on a vineyard. But I wouldn't know I'm not allowed there, at least since Barack's birthday party. You should have seen his face when I jumped out of the cake. The G-string was a little much, and I was wearing one too. But the coverage has been hysterical. As if sending migrants from a sweltering part of Texas to the most luxurious vacation spot in America, home to the likes of Obama, Larry David, John Kerry, is now somehow cruel and inhumane punishment. But maybe it is cruel. After all, you know who also lives there? James Taylor. Yes, I know. I wonder if he has a comment.",

But basically, a border state is making a sanctuary state walk the walk, which poses a problem for critics of Florida and Texas. How can you be upset that Florida or Texas is shipping migrants to your town if you feel that those red states are inhospitable and yours isn't? Isn't transporting migrants to your cities like Chicago or Philly a true act of charity or bipartisanship? Unless, of course, you think it's cruel to send them there. And you might be right. Migrants leave Venezuela for the U.S. only to realize liberal run cities might be worse. They find that Philly is just Caracas with cheesesteaks and Chicago is just Tijuana with more gunfire. And at least in Tijuana, they fire the guns in the air, not into your bedroom. So what of Martha's Vineyard? Even though it's a tiny island, the homes are huge. Small families like the Obama's own a multimillion dollar home on the island with presumably many spare rooms. He could temporarily house some migrants, you know. But please, no kids in cages this time. And think about all the time saved, the cheap labor will be right there on location, ready to set up the tables for Obama's next superspreading birthday party. But the best part, what it's done to the phony politicians? The munchkin mayor from Chicago called Texas sending migrants to her city both racist and un-Christian. This was right before she herself sent migrants from her city to a suburb. But doesn't this make her even more un-Christian since she bragged about being a sanctuary city? I mean, you can't get more un-Christian than saying there's room at the inn. And when folks arrive after a long journey, telling them there is no room at the inn. And you can bet some of those folks are named Jesus.",

You recall Hunter's gun ended up at a trash can in 2018, which sounds shady until you realize it was dumped by his brother's widow, whom he was banging at the time. And who can't relate to that? The Obama appointed judge ruled that there's privacy outweighs releasing the records to the public. Privacy?

CNN demoted Don Lemon from prime time giving him a morning slot with co-anchors, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, which raises a key question what did Poppy and Kaitlan do to deserve this? But this means Don Lemon will now be doing commentary at 6:00 a.m. which is usually the time he wakes up in someone's shed and walks home. But 6:00 a.m. means we'll all be up at the crack of Don -- it should be the name of the show, you creeps. Anyway, that's another 11:00 o'clock-er are that our little show crushed. Meanwhile, CNN is asking potential guests to answer multiple choice questions about their politics, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, and more, reportedly to help bookers find guests who might be good for certain topics. For example, maybe you're looking for someone to provide commentary on being unpopular at work. It would be good to have a name right at your fingertips. CNN spokesperson says, \"The initiative launched is strictly voluntary. CNN is committed to representing a variety of voices and perspectives. And this information both helps us identify relevant guests and ensure diversity in our bookings.\" Well, some of the options you can choose for political ideology are extremely strange, such as Marxism and Nazism. Left off the survey was the question: how often do you masturbate during zoom calls? Seems like that would be a good question to have on there, K.T.

I'm going to present two topics and whichever one gets the most applause from our studio audience, that's the one we're going to do. And the writers of the losing story, will be transferred to \"FOX AND FRIENDS.\" First option, U.S. business inventories increased in July but the pace is slow likely from a drop in demand is higher interest rates push companies to be cautious as they enter Q-4. All right. One clap, one clap. All right. Second story option, did a chess player cheat using beads in his anus? All right. That's great! I guess these people really love chess. All right, story two it is. Was his strategy superior or were there signals in his posterior? This month, a 19-year-old from San Francisco named, Hans Neiman, beat Norwegian Grandmaster Magnus Carlsen at a tournament in St. Louis. Carlson is the reigning five-time world champ. Neiman was the lowest-rated player at the tournament, which is how he got his nickname the CNN of chess. After the loss, Carlson withdrew from the tournament and implied in a tweet that the young American had cheated. Other grandmasters came to Carlson's defense and came up with theories as to how Neiman could have cheated. Some theorized he might have done something completely foreign to competitive chess, like talking to a girl. One theory, he used vibrating buttons in his shoes to communicate with a computer program for the best moves, that theory then morphed into one that's rocking the chess world: that Neiman won by using wireless anal beads that vibrated him the correct moves. Officials were suspicious when he opened with a brilliant defense move and he had an extension cord sticking out of his ass. Rob, can I just say? What a delight that we found a story with two variables you're an expert in? Three.",

But I wouldn't know I'm not allowed there, at least since Barack's birthday party. You should have seen his face when I jumped out of the cake. The G-string was a little much, and I was wearing one too. But the coverage has been hysterical. As if sending migrants from a sweltering part of Texas to the most luxurious vacation spot in America, home to the likes of Obama, Larry David, John Kerry, is now somehow cruel and inhumane punishment.

How can you be upset that Florida or Texas is shipping migrants to your town if you feel that those red states are inhospitable and yours isn't? Isn't transporting migrants to your cities like Chicago or Philly a true act of charity or bipartisanship? Unless, of course, you think it's cruel to send them there. And you might be right. Migrants leave Venezuela for the U.S. only to realize liberal run cities might be worse. They find that Philly is just Caracas with cheesesteaks and Chicago is just Tijuana with more gunfire. And at least in Tijuana, they fire the guns in the air, not into your bedroom. So what of Martha's Vineyard? Even though it's a tiny island, the homes are huge. Small families like the Obama's own a multimillion dollar home on the island with presumably many spare rooms. He could temporarily house some migrants, you know. But please, no kids in cages this time. And think about all the time saved, the cheap labor will be right there on location, ready to set up the tables for Obama's next superspreading birthday party. But the best part, what it's done to the phony politicians? The munchkin mayor from Chicago called Texas sending migrants to her city both racist and un-Christian. This was right before she herself sent migrants from her city to a suburb. But doesn't this make her even more un-Christian since she bragged about being a sanctuary city? I mean, you can't get more un-Christian than saying there's room at the inn. And when folks arrive after a long journey, telling them there is no room at the inn. And you can bet some of those folks are named Jesus."

For example, maybe you're looking for someone to provide commentary on being unpopular at work. It would be good to have a name right at your fingertips.

Neiman was the lowest-rated player at the tournament, which is how he got his nickname the CNN of chess. After the loss, Carlson withdrew from the tournament and implied in a tweet that the young American had cheated.
