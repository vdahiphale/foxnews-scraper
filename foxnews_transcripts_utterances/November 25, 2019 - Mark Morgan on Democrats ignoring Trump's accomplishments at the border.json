But first, lessons learned, or not?  That’s the focus of tonight’s angle.  First, a message to the Democrats.  I tried to warn you that if you allowed leftist radicals to become the face and brain trust of your party, you’d end up regretting it.  And after two months of nothing but impeachment talk, Democrats are seeing headlines like this, even in liberal Vanity Fair.  It’s hard to read this as anything but a warning.  New polling suggests Democrats impeachment push could alienate key voters.  Oops.  Remember, the squad of hit girls has been pushing for impeachment long before they’d ever heard of Zelensky or Vindman."

And remember, billions of dollars of foreign aid was also on the line with Trump’s new approach.  Most people in Washington are doing their jobs.  I want to say that tonight.  They’re helping the president and his team carry out the policies that he ran on.  But, and that’s a big but, there are some rogue actors in the intel community and in the geopolitical space who refuse to do their jobs and instead decided to work with the president’s political enemies.  They considered it a noble calling.  The voters, however, are a lot more skeptical, especially with the election less than a year away and a booming economy.  Democrats are even losing interest in impeachment themselves, according to a new Hill Harris poll.  It’s the same with independents.  Plus, an Emerson poll reveals that more Americans are opposed, now, to impeachment.  This is all happening as Trump has a 52 percent approval of his handling of the economy, according to the RCP Average.  Ninety-five percent approval among Republicans.  And now, after allowing themselves to be corralled by their radical fringe, more mainstream Democrats are beginning to feel the heat, especially in those swing districts.  Is it any wonder that a vicious, brutal case of buyer’s remorse is infecting the party?  Or that now, some are urging them to drop the impeachment vote altogether in favor of the milder censure?"

What’s interesting going forward, if precedent means anything, Ken Starr, as the independent counsel during the Clinton impeachment, presented his report in person under oath.  That’s how much he believed in it.  Let’s see how much Adam Schiff believes in the report that he’s about to turn in about a week from now.  Will he be willing to show up at the House Judiciary Committee, for example, under oath and answer questions?  Will he face cross-examination not just from Republicans, but also from the president's counsel?  Let see if the prosecutor, the judge, the jury Adam Schiff will take his report from his kangaroo court to the American people and answer those tough questions.  He’s way ahead of his skis here, and I think he’s going to pay a huge price.  But I don’t know if the Democrats really, at this point, can roll back from impeachment --"

Circuit Court of Appeals, McGahn could just show up to Congress and assert privilege on as many questions as he wanted.  Alan, your response to the hyperbolic reaction to this.  One federal district court judge in D.C. on this question of McGahn."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " Well, just to your point, Alan, just a line from the opinion.  And the king -- the reference to the king was kind of a giveaway on this judge if you ask me.  But the court distinguishes this issue from the very different question of whether the specific information that high-level presidential aides may be asked to provide in the context of such questioning can be withheld from the committee on the basis of [unintelligible] privilege.  So, that’s Alan’s point.  So, it only goes to the specific question of whether he must physically present himself.  And Congressman Zeldin, contrary to what the kind of the measured analysis of Dershowitz just there, this is what Neal Katyal said on MSNBC, who was Solicitor General for a short period of time for President Obama.  Watch."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Alan Dershowitz",
      "utterance": " Absolutely, because the privilege belongs to the president and the presidency, and McGahn has no right to answer questions if the president invokes the privilege.  Then it has to go to court, and then there has to be a determination as to whether that's happened.  Look, I predicted on this show and others that this is the way the case would be decided.  The difference would be split.  They would have to go over and make an appearance, but they have to, question by question, determine whether the privilege applies, and it's the White House counsel --"

During the chaos of the 24-hour cable news cycle it's pretty easy to forget that the House Republicans over the past few weeks stood up to the Democrats and confronted both the Dems and their media cronies who’ve been pushing this entire impeachment scam on the American public.  I can be pretty critical of both sides, and I hold -- I try to hold both sides accountable, but now that we've seen things in their entirety as they've shaken out, I think we should take the time to point out four members of Congress who absolutely tonight deserve special recognition.  First up, Congressman Mike Turner."

In other words, he's not for total open borders and that apparently what you just heard Biden telling activists he would only deport criminal aliens, felons, to make it specific, went too far for this leftist.  Joining me now, Mercedes Schlapp, Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor and Dinesh D’Souza, conservative author and filmmaker.  Dinesh, former President Obama just told his party to ditch the old purity tests, just as his standard bear is being eaten alive.  So, what's going on here? Dinesh D’Souza: Well, Obama, although on the left, had -- was tethered to reality and Obama realized it's one thing to say that you have people who are aliens who are clearly breaking the law but there's a special category of lawbreaker, the criminal alien.  This is a guy who's a drug dealer or a murderer or rapist, someone who actually poses a threat to citizens and to say that that guy should not be deported, this is -- would be political lunacy.  So, Obama never went there and the fact that we now have an activist wing of the Democratic Party taking this kind of stance or considering the deportation of criminal aliens to be somehow be on the pale, this just gives you an idea of how this party has become at least to some degree unmoored, unhinged from reality."

And despite all the progress with our border, America still saw an increase of all hard narcotics in fiscal year 2019.  Now, this includes meth from so-called super-labs in Mexico.  They produce it faster, cheaper, and with higher purity.  Joining me now, Mark Morgan, acting Customs and Border Patrol commissioner.  Mark, we mentioned the success at the border.  There’s still a burgeoning drug trade.  A friend of mine in Mexico who lives there said to me the other day, “I don't -- we’ve tried a lot of different things, but they’re producing it, and it’s being smuggled in, and it’s being purchased, and it’s killing people.”"
