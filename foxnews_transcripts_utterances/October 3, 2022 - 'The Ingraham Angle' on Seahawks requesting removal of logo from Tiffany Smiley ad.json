The fact is, Florida was hit by a natural disaster. But Florida will recover because its people have a competent governor, and thus they're hopeful about the future. No wonder CNN and the likes of Maggie Haberman over at the New York Times are working overtime to cast aspersions and sow distrust. Hurricane Ian was horrid and deadly. But Hurricane Andrew as in Cuomo and then Hurricane Kathy as in Hochul, and that wide storm surge from Hurricane Gretchen in Michigan and Chicago's cat five hurricane Lori, and of course the ever expanding hurricane J.B. as in Pritzker. The catastrophic ruin they've all the left and their wakes will require years, not months, of cleanup. The results of their terrible policies, pro criminal and anti-business, they can't be removed with a crane. It's going to take multiple defeats for them and their party at the ballot box. But real reporters would be pounding these pathetic governor's on their records and pressing them relentlessly on why for instance, Illinois, California, New York are losing so much of their population to states like Florida, and Tennessee and Texas. How are those winning records? If you're losing your own people? Of course, most of the reporters who play defense for these failed politicians live themselves in well to do urban neighborhoods. They're cocooned in by their own bubbles of comfort. So they insulate themselves from the fallout of their heroes' policies that, obviously, regular working folks can't escape. Yet they're rooting now against Florida's governor in a time of crisis, that's just so lame and it's so sleazy. But a lot of these folks are used to lying with impunity. For weeks they've been pushing the false claim that Biden is staging some 11th hour comeback just in time for the midterms. But since August, \"The Angle\" has told you that this was untrue. But they're still trying to put lipstick on a donkey here. The New York Times Nate Cohn did his best makeup up today writing, \"The idea that Democrats can hold the House is not as ridiculous, implausible or farfetched as it seemed before the Dobbs ruling overturn Roe v. Wade. It is a real possibility, not some abstraction in the sense that anything can happen.\" Well, other pretend reporters that POLITICO are trying a new line, floating the idea that rural voters are demoralized and won't show up to vote. Now, they hang this wishful thinking at POLITICO on the slightly lower rural turnout in a few recent special elections. Then they attribute this to the Dobbs decision. And then they extrapolate to indicate that this could presage voting patterns in November. I mean, this is just ludicrous. Even political neophytes know that midterm elections are historically referenda on the White House, and the White House's performance. So it might be a good time to ask, how is the White House doing right now? Well, Biden approval is at 38 percent and the GOP is winning numerous generic ballots in a row now. Monmouth polling has the President getting trounced on issues that matter most to the voters. Only three in 10 Americans approve of the job Biden has done on the nation's top concern, inflation, 30 percent. As well as the other concerns that Republicans are focused on, i.e. crime, he gets a 32 percent approval; and immigration, a pathetic 31 percent approval. So these are among the unnatural disasters that Biden and the Democrats have dropped on the American people, causing immeasurable tragedy and damage along the way. And you bet the voters are noticing. So given the cyclone of bad news, the regime media is trying desperately to find a rainbow, which means blame shifting away from Biden and toward the Fed.",

And now well, inflation is devouring up the 5 percent wage increases that workers have on average seen, as food prices for the year that ended in August, increased by a staggering 13.5 percent. That is-- Gas prices are climbing again, we know that. OPEC is shrinking its output by a million barrels a day. And because Biden has kneecapped our own oil and gas industry, we're at OPEC's mercy. How wonderful? How sick is this? Soon we're all going to be at $6 a gallon for gas that they're already paying now in California. Yes. Other than that, how was the play Mrs. Lincoln?

They don't talk about the economy. They don't talk about Joe Biden. And it's really interesting, if you listen to all of these candidates running - Democrats running across the country, they've been in power for two years. They don't ever talk about any accomplishments from the past two years. Even this crazy student loan thing that Joe Biden is trying to pull off, they don't even talk about that. What do they talk about? The best thing they have going for them is abortion. Democrats are almost as popular as abortion. What a terrible, terrible way to try to run a campaign.

But as Elon Musk found out today, they don't seem to want calm. On Twitter today the Tesla CEO put out a poll asking his followers to weigh in on a series of proposals to obtain Ukraine-Russia peace. One was redo elections of annexed regions under U.N. supervision, and Russia leaves if that is the will of the people. Crimea remains part of Russian, water supply to Crimea is assured, and Ukraine remains neutral. President Zelenskyy responded by calling him a Russian apologist. And Ukraine diplomat Andriy Melnyk responded to Musk by tweeting \"F-off is my very diplomatic reply to you.\" It is here where we must remind you that Musk has been a huge supporter of Ukraine, sending thousands of Starlink satellite service as a way for Ukraine to increase its Internet connectivity. And what he has learned is what so many others have learned along the way. Ukraine feels entitled to endless support from the west, mostly the United States, of course. We're the ones who pay the bills. And anytime you challenge their demand, even if it is in the interests of staving off nuclear war, you are labeled a Putin sewage. Here now is Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who wrote a fabulous piece about this conflict today for \"American Greatness.\" Victor, this is now getting really serious.

We would destroy all Russian forces inside Ukraine. We'd sink the Black fleet. What would be the expectation what he would do? Then we have Joe Biden and President Zelenskyy saying we're going to humiliate him. He's got to leave office. OK, I don't like him. None of us like him, maybe. But he says he's not going to do that, and he has got nuclear weapons. He'd got maybe 6,500, 7,000 of them. So nobody is talking about how to step back. They're lowering the bar. Meanwhile, Iran is talking about maybe it has got a bomb, and we saw 5 million Japanese going into the shelters as this global nuclear bar goes lower and lower. And there's all these agendas, the European agenda, the NATO agenda, the American agenda, the Ukrainian agenda, the Russian agenda, and they're all mutually exclusive if your position is there's nothing going to happen except we're getting every single Russian out of the borderlands, we're going to humiliate Putin, and he won't dare retaliate. That would be good, but I don't think going to happen. I think Europeans are going to be pre-civilizational in February. They're going to be cold. They're not going to have energy.

The fact is, Florida was hit by a natural disaster. But Florida will recover because its people have a competent governor, and thus they're hopeful about the future. No wonder CNN and the likes of Maggie Haberman over at the New York Times are working overtime to cast aspersions and sow distrust. Hurricane Ian was horrid and deadly. But Hurricane Andrew as in Cuomo and then Hurricane Kathy as in Hochul, and that wide storm surge from Hurricane Gretchen in Michigan and Chicago's cat five hurricane Lori, and of course the ever expanding hurricane J.B. as in Pritzker. The catastrophic ruin they've all the left and their wakes will require years, not months, of cleanup. The results of their terrible policies, pro criminal and anti-business, they can't be removed with a crane. It's going to take multiple defeats for them and their party at the ballot box. But real reporters would be pounding these pathetic governor's on their records and pressing them relentlessly on why for instance, Illinois, California, New York are losing so much of their population to states like Florida, and Tennessee and Texas. How are those winning records? If you're losing your own people? Of course, most of the reporters who play defense for these failed politicians live themselves in well to do urban neighborhoods. They're cocooned in by their own bubbles of comfort. So they insulate themselves from the fallout of their heroes' policies that, obviously, regular working folks can't escape. Yet they're rooting now against Florida's governor in a time of crisis, that's just so lame and it's so sleazy. But a lot of these folks are used to lying with impunity. For weeks they've been pushing the false claim that Biden is staging some 11th hour comeback just in time for the midterms. But since August, \"The Angle\" has told you that this was untrue. But they're still trying to put lipstick on a donkey here. The New York Times Nate Cohn did his best makeup up today writing, \"The idea that Democrats can hold the House is not as ridiculous, implausible or farfetched as it seemed before the Dobbs ruling overturn Roe v. Wade. It is a real possibility, not some abstraction in the sense that anything can happen.\" Well, other pretend reporters that POLITICO are trying a new line, floating the idea that rural voters are demoralized and won't show up to vote. Now, they hang this wishful thinking at POLITICO on the slightly lower rural turnout in a few recent special elections. Then they attribute this to the Dobbs decision. And then they extrapolate to indicate that this could presage voting patterns in November. I mean, this is just ludicrous. Even political neophytes know that midterm elections are historically referenda on the White House, and the White House's performance. So it might be a good time to ask, how is the White House doing right now? Well, Biden approval is at 38 percent and the GOP is winning numerous generic ballots in a row now. Monmouth polling has the President getting trounced on issues that matter most to the voters. Only three in 10 Americans approve of the job Biden has done on the nation's top concern, inflation, 30 percent. As well as the other concerns that Republicans are focused on, i.e. crime, he gets a 32 percent approval; and immigration, a pathetic 31 percent approval. So these are among the unnatural disasters that Biden and the Democrats have dropped on the American people, causing immeasurable tragedy and damage along the way. And you bet the voters are noticing. So given the cyclone of bad news, the regime media is trying desperately to find a rainbow, which means blame shifting away from Biden and toward the Fed."

That is-- Gas prices are climbing again, we know that. OPEC is shrinking its output by a million barrels a day. And because Biden has kneecapped our own oil and gas industry, we're at OPEC's mercy.

A, you never saw them actually being honest about how bad their responses were. But you've also never heard anybody say, Oh, these people want federal funds, while they're criticizing Trump. They want the money even though it's Trump's wallet. No, this is just a term they use as part of their propaganda efforts to try to Katrina, Ron DeSantis. And in the same way that that was unfair during the Bush Administration, when they blamed President Bush for local and state policy failures. They're trying to do this here.

We know from the medical literature that doctors in the United States are performing double mastectomies removing the breasts of young women. They're also performing penectomies and vaginoplasty, which are removing the penis and creating an artificial vagina for minors. These are children under the age of 18. And simply by pointing this out, there's been this furious reaction. And what they're trying to do is mobilize the FBI, mobilize the Department of Justice mobilize the entire federal law enforcement apparatus to censor journalists, deplatform journalists, and they say very specifically, investigate and prosecute journalists. This is a reckless move designed to criminalize dissent, and protect these really awful and horrific radical gender surgeries and experiments that they're performing on minors."

But the idea that they should be able to proceed without any criticism, without any examination of their tactics and their conclusions, it's just ludicrous on every level. And it's up to every journalist, I don't care what your perspective is, to stand up for inquiry, and, frankly, aggressive inquiry when it comes to children's permanent surgery that will change their lives forever.

He talked about sandwiches, salads, French fries on salads, more salads. He said that Oz wanted to ban abortion with no exceptions and that he reduced crime while Mayor of the borough Braddock.

While Fetterman is talking about the topics you just mentioned, and a lots of other issues that have nothing to do with the crisis happening here in Pennsylvania. I'm talking about crime, the highest homicide rate ever in the city's history in Philadelphia. I'm talking about drugs, fentanyl in particular, and the open border that's causing it to kill folks in Pennsylvania more than ever before. We're top five in the country with fentanyl deaths. I'm talking about a 40 year high of inflation and tax rates that are through the roof advocated by not just Fetterman as a candidate for the Senate, but also as a lieutenant governor he was pushing for almost a 50 percent tax increase, while not paying his own 67 times. But I'll tell you what is others is happening, Republicans are coming home. They're realizing that all the garbage are being fed by legacy media was untrue. And viewers of your show are good examples. They're supporting me at doctoroz.com more aggressively more than ever before.

One if you legalize drugs, which is what my opponent Fetterman has advocated for, you will drive up homicide rates and drug overdose death rates, and that fact that's what happened with the Oregon 2020 law. They decriminalized drugs and not only drug overdose deaths, but homicide rates went up because you have lawlessness. They also pointed out something that stunned me. That I didn't realize this. But they say you can go around the corner from our church and buy fentanyl, it's easy to get an affordable. You can't find baby formula anywhere. We have abandoned our cities. These people have real needs. We can address them. We have solutions. Republicans are the party of ideas. Let's use those ideas to address these folks.

Because now a trio of Seattle institutions Starbucks, the Seahawks, and the Seattle Times are coming after Tiffany. Let's start with the Seahawks. In Smiley's game day ad, her husband, who was blinded by a suicide bombing while serving our country in Iraq, makes a two-second-long cameo wearing a Seahawks jersey. Apparently, that's a crime. The Seahawks were so upset they told the Smiley campaign it must immediately cease its unauthorized use of the logo. I kid you not. The campaign compiled and put up the exact same ad but took out -- complied with that and took out the logo. Joining me now is Tiffany Smiley.

I spent last week at a homeless encampment in Seattle, I cleaned up dirty needles. I talked with the residents. Do you know what they told me? They said everything changed. These are people addicted to drugs every day that we just allow to live on the street. They said everything changed when fentanyl came on our streets. And they asked me, what can you do about it, Tiffany? And I was clear. There is something we can do about it.

I didn't realize they had that kind of control over gay people viewing a gay movie. That's like saying atheists kept Christians away from the latest \"God Is Not Dead\" movie.

I don't know what \"The Times\" is talking about, Laura. Sandra Bullock just released a big rom-com in the summer, \"The Lost City.\" It made $30 million its opening weekend.

Now, the FOX affiliate in New Orleans, WVUE, did an investigation. They found mayor occupying this city-owned apartment for nearly 26 days, Laura.

One was redo elections of annexed regions under U.N. supervision, and Russia leaves if that is the will of the people. Crimea remains part of Russian, water supply to Crimea is assured, and Ukraine remains neutral. President Zelenskyy responded by calling him a Russian apologist. And Ukraine diplomat Andriy Melnyk responded to Musk by tweeting \"F-off is my very diplomatic reply to you.\" It is here where we must remind you that Musk has been a huge supporter of Ukraine, sending thousands of Starlink satellite service as a way for Ukraine to increase its Internet connectivity. And what he has learned is what so many others have learned along the way. Ukraine feels entitled to endless support from the west, mostly the United States, of course. We're the ones who pay the bills. And anytime you challenge their demand, even if it is in the interests of staving off nuclear war, you are labeled a Putin sewage.

We would destroy all Russian forces inside Ukraine. We'd sink the Black fleet. What would be the expectation what he would do? Then we have Joe Biden and President Zelenskyy saying we're going to humiliate him. He's got to leave office. OK, I don't like him. None of us like him, maybe. But he says he's not going to do that, and he has got nuclear weapons. He'd got maybe 6,500, 7,000 of them. So nobody is talking about how to step back. They're lowering the bar. Meanwhile, Iran is talking about maybe it has got a bomb, and we saw 5 million Japanese going into the shelters as this global nuclear bar goes lower and lower. And there's all these agendas, the European agenda, the NATO agenda, the American agenda, the Ukrainian agenda, the Russian agenda, and they're all mutually exclusive if your position is there's nothing going to happen except we're getting every single Russian out of the borderlands, we're going to humiliate Putin, and he won't dare retaliate. That would be good, but I don't think going to happen. I think Europeans are going to be pre-civilizational in February. They're going to be cold. They're not going to have energy. Joe Biden jawboned the east pipeline. He doesn't produce energy enough for liquefied natural gas to export. I don't know what they're going to do. He's tapping our strategic petroleum reserve. We don't even talk, Laura. He's tapping our strategic weapons reserve after the Afghanistan debacle and the $75 billion to Ukraine. And things are heating up in Taiwan and South Korea.
