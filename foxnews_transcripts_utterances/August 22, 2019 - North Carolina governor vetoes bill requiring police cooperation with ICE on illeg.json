The question is being asked, why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early for a change, not late. Let America win big, rather than just win.\" The president has lamented that, during the Obama administration, the Federal Reserve kept the Fed Funds Rate historically low, making money cheaper to borrow.

It actually drove down property taxes. Eight years after I took office, property taxes were actually lower than they were before they started, not just the growth, but the actual amount on the typical home was lower than before we started. And that really encourages people to make those investments, not only as consumers.

So, for some reason, union voters were just not showing up for Hillary Clinton and for that version of the Democratic Party in the same way they showed up for, say, Barack Obama four years before that. And I think that there really does need to be stronger messaging. And the issue, to me, and the most interesting thing is seeing these groups that are historically heavily Democratic-leaning now putting these Democratic candidates on notice, saying, you cannot take our vote for granted. You're going to have to work for that. You're seeing it come from unions. You are seeing it come from African- Americans. You're seeing it come from Latino Americans.

The issue with the payroll tax is that it funds the Social Security trust funds that are expected to or projected to go dry by 2035. The president then turned his focus to the Federal Reserve this morning, tweeting -- quote -- \"The economy is doing really well. The Federal Reserve can easily make it record-setting. The question is being asked, why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early for a change, not late. Let America win big, rather than just win.\" The president has lamented that, during the Obama administration, the Federal Reserve kept the Fed Funds Rate historically low, making money cheaper to borrow. That, of course, was after a major financial crisis. Also at the White House this afternoon, the president honors NBA legend Bob Cousy with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor that the nation awards.

They did it again in '86. And we saw the economic benefits to that go beyond just his administration, into the Bush administration and ultimately continued even in the '90s under Bill Clinton's administration. I think the tax cuts that this president and the Republican Congress passed a few years ago, the president signed continue to be good, but you can do more. In Wisconsin, we cut taxes by more than $8 billion, reducing the burden on the hardworking people in the state and small business owners and farmers and others. And we saw last year more people working in the state than ever before. It's simple. Put more money into people's hands, they're going to put it back in the economy."

All too often, sometimes, one of the fears people have, even when a tax comes around, is it going to be made permanent? Is this something that sticks around, or is the government going to pull that money back in? And so letting the taxpayers be the ones that not only see the benefits of the tax relief, but putting in place real reforms. For example, we did it in Wisconsin. We poured more money in the schools, made historic investments in schools. At the same time, we put tax limits on a levy, so that not only schools and local governments benefited from the state's investment. It actually drove down property taxes. Eight years after I took office, property taxes were actually lower than they were before they started, not just the growth, but the actual amount on the typical home was lower than before we started. And that really encourages people to make those investments, not only as consumers. For a lot of small business owners and family farmers, it encourages them to make investments in employees and raise wages, which is good for the economy."

We got to report from the CBO yesterday of the mounting federal debt. State governments don't have the leisure of that. So is it really possible for people, skeptics out there to say, hey, we're going to lower taxes, also lower spending, and also have a positive outcome?"

We all know about the Laffer Curve back in the '80s. Today, I call it the Kohl's curve. You go to a department store like Kohl's, you buy something on sale, you had another coupon top of that, in the end, you pull out some Kohl's cash, and it sometimes feels like they're actually paying you to buy the merchandise. They're not, but why do they do that? Because they make money off of volume and not off of higher prices. Governments that charge high rates and have high tax brackets typically see less economic opportunity. Those that drop them, as happened during the president's term when Ronald Reagan was in office and as we're seeing under the Trump tax cuts as well..."

Because Israel's had a law on the books for the last few years that says, if you're out to take on Israel, if you're for the boycott, the BDS movement that's trying to boycott Israel and its companies and its employers, they don't want you there. They knew this was going to happen. This is just a cheap political stunt to draw attention from -- away from just how extreme their positions are, not only when it comes to Israel, but, my goodness, you have got one of the two who said earlier this year that some people did something in regards to the terrorists that attacked on America 9/11."

But it's also -- another sad thing is, when you tout yourself as a former chief law enforcement officer of the state, but you're missing the point on public safety. And I think that's the sad thing is, people will suffer. The most important thing we can do in law enforcement is to identify and remove persons from our community that are committing criminal offenses. But when you return those persons back to the community, there's always that chance of a person being revictimized."

Some, we don't know of. But the thing about it is, when those persons are coming in, either through human trafficking or through our drug trafficking, that brings people into our communities that go to locations that might feel like they're safe, like sanctuary communities, and then commit offenses against our citizens and persons within our own community. And so I want to go back to the point is, is every sheriff in North Carolina, I can't see why any sheriff and the governor wouldn't support identifying persons that are criminal -- that are in our jails that are criminal offenders, if they're illegal in our country, once, at the perfect time, interface those persons with ICE and assist ICE in the removal process. It just makes for a safer community. And they're all -- let me tell you, they're a good number, many sheriff's across North Carolina that do honor federal detainers right now. So I want to be very clear. There's a few that don't, but there's a great majority that do. And I -- and I appreciate what they do to help keep their community safe. But this is the most important thing we could do as sheriffs that run jails, knowing who's coming in and knowing who's going out of jails, for the safety of our community. It's all about public safety. And public safety shouldn't be second. You shouldn't take politics and put it over public safety. That's a dangerous proposition."

He's passed a couple -- or issued a couple of executive orders that have limited unions' ability to collectively bargain, that's made it tougher for them to engage in political activities outside of work. So he really hasn't lived up to what he promised. He did a good job of seizing on the messaging that's important to unions. He talked about infrastructure. He talked about jobs and trade, but he hasn't really backed it up. So, yes, the Democrats need to make sure we don't abandon unions, and that we still recognize how important they are, especially in terms of providing manpower, as we ramp up to Election Day. But what's Trump offering?"

As you said, President Trump has done a good job at messaging, making his message applicable to union workers. And in many cases, we saw, in 2016, he maybe did that in a way that was better than Hillary Clinton. And so it's certainly Democrats cannot depend on winning the union vote anymore. It's something that they will have to fight for a little bit more than they maybe had to in the past. And I think we're seeing that already with Bernie Sanders rolling out his new proposal to help unions grow. And we're seeing more action from these Democratic candidates showing that they know this is something that they know that they must address, and they can't take for granted anymore."

And you got to wonder about the Democratic presidential candidates, because I haven't seen any of them really specifically going for the union vote. I have seen them talking about climate change and all these other things that seem like social issues. I'm not sure that the typical union worker is focused on those."

As a matter of fact, it was the lowest that it's been since 1984. So, for some reason, union voters were just not showing up for Hillary Clinton and for that version of the Democratic Party in the same way they showed up for, say, Barack Obama four years before that. And I think that there really does need to be stronger messaging. And the issue, to me, and the most interesting thing is seeing these groups that are historically heavily Democratic-leaning now putting these Democratic candidates on notice, saying, you cannot take our vote for granted. You're going to have to work for that. You're seeing it come from unions. You are seeing it come from African- Americans. You're seeing it come from Latino Americans.

They're going to come forward and there is going to be that testimony. There's so much testimony that can come in, so many alleged victims that can come forward.

But, frankly, he'd already -- if you believe the reports that he had already been attacked on July 23, and it wasn't a suicide attempt, he knew he was a targeted man. Just a few weeks later, then -- then it could happen. So that could be just coincidental, that he chose to do it at that time, and he's dead a few days later."

Now, remember, he narrowly lost it in 2016. So, can he turn it around this time? Joining me now is The Federalist's Emily Jashinsky. Emily, he came so close to Minnesota. It was amazing, because President Trump hustled. He spent a lot of time there. And during that period, the experts were saying, why? But he came within a razor's-thin margin of winning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. And if you look at really -- if you -- if you dig into the numbers, you did county by county, and you look at why that happened, he actually defeated Mitt Romney's margins of victory in some key counties by a pretty significant amount. So President Trump did really well in certain rural Minnesota counties. That's the same also in Governor Walker's state, by the way, where Trump ran up huge margins in northern -- rural parts of the northern parts of the state. And so that's actually really key for president -- for President Trump and for Republicans running in Minnesota. What's interesting is that they kind of have to balance those interests of rural voters with those of the suburban voters to win statewide. So you need to be able to appeal both to the -- sort of the rural working- class people and also to maybe the more middle-class, upper-middle-class people in the suburbs of Minnesota, people that might be able to -- might be willing to vote Republican, but you really have to balance those appeal and those -- the appeal with both of those groups. And that's kind of a difficult juggling act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, speaking of a juggling act within the Democratic Party, now, Ilhan Omar, Representative Omar, has really created some serious division. And I'm not sure how much it's resonating in her state. Obviously, she's very popular in her district, which used to be Keith Ellison's district, but, statewide, you got to wonder if the same tremors that she's creating in her own party nationwide are occurring in Minnesota as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "This is the big thing. And the best ally that Republicans will have trying to flip some of these states or to do well in some of these states, where there's potential for purpleness, is Democrats. They're going to be the biggest ally of Republicans. They're their own worst enemy. When you have radical members of Congress like the Squad, it makes it really easy for someone like a candidate running statewide in Minnesota to tie their Democratic opponent to them. And that is going to be an albatross for Democrats around the country, especially in states like this. And so Republicans' best friend in statewide races like the one in Minnesota is actually going to be the hard left, because they make that choice a lot easier, especially for suburban voters, who can hold their nose and vote for someone they may be disinclined to otherwise, because the candidate on the left is really that bad for them."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Which candidate do you think would fare best, Democratic candidate, would fare best against President Trump in these Midwest states? Because they're saying -- apparently, what they're saying is that Joe Biden, specifically -- and his wife almost articulated this the other day - - is that he should be the candidate because he's the only one perhaps of those running that can beat President Trump in the heartland."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Which says a lot, if they only have one candidate that can appeal in the heartland. And maybe it's Joe Biden. But even Joe Biden -- I mean, this is a primary, so they're all kind of racing to the left for the voters. But even he -- he's a little bit to the left, I would say, of your average working-class Democrat, at least a little bit to the left. And so even Joe Biden, I mean, he can count on that general election reset. But he's still -- if he's the nominee, President Trump is still going to be able to go back and pull some of his policy positions and say, Joe Biden is a radical Democrat. And so the fact that Democrats don't have anyone who's really the clear -- clear-cut example of someone who can pull that off easily is problematic for them going forward. I think Kamala Harris is better on this than a lot of people give her credit for."

If Democrats can kind of start running in that lane when the general election comes about, they might have a better chance, but I don't see anybody right now. I mean, I'm a Midwesterner. I don't see anyone right now that can really appeal against President Trump to those types of voters."

A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the nationwide shortage of teachers has quadrupled in five years from 20,000 in 2013 to 64,000 to 2016 to over 110,000 last year. Kentucky's shortage is worse than the national average."

      "speaker": "JONATHAN BUTCHER, HERITAGE FOUNDATION",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCKELWAY",
      "utterance": "But there is other evidence the shortage is real. Kentucky, for example, is budgeting a million dollars to forgive teacher candidate loans. It's also hiring non-certified teachers. A Virginia district is live-streaming classes to students because of the teacher shortage, while another in Alabama is offering $10,000 bonuses, while, in Illinois, they're raising the -- the minimum salary to $40,000 for a teacher over four years. There are many reasons for the shortage, good jobs elsewhere in the strong economy, too much standardized testing, and administrative bloat. Teacher burnout is also on the rise, as they face disciplinary problems, from fights, to inattentive students, to trying to compete with students' iPhones. It is not your daddy's classroom, Charles."

The other countries in the world are not curbing any of their CO2 emissions. We, in fact, have up done that with the fracking miracle. So why should any person watching this show have their taxes go up, have their own family's prosperity derailed? Because it wouldn't work.

This is an issue about new job opportunities for Americans. Right now, these manufacturing jobs, they are going away. There's so many places that are taking their business elsewhere. So feeling the Bern would mean getting those jobs back, being trained for work, that we don't have these jobs right now. Let's forget about the global climate warming, and think about the jobs in our country. And, at the same time, we save the environment. So it's a win-win. That's the way he should be messaging it.
