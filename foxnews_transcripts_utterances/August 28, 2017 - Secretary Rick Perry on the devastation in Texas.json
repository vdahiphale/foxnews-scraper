      "sentences": "Welcome to ''Hannity.'' This is a Fox News Alert. We are following three major breaking news stories. According to the National Weather Service, Texas-- they're now bracing for up to 20 inches of additional rainfall after this historic and catastrophic flooding. Now, this as President Trump is now promising 100 percent support and the rapid deployment of federal aid to help those devastated areas in Texas and also now in Louisiana. Our reporters are on the ground tonight in the Lone Star State. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then radical leftists, Antifa, protesters savagely beating nonviolent protesters over the weekend. This time, Berkeley, California. So when are the Democrats in this country going to condemn this out of control left- wing hate and violence? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, the president defends his decision to pardon former sheriff Joe Arpaio as Democrats and the liberal media feign moral outrage. Tonight right here, we will expose the left wing's massive double standard when it comes to presidential pardons. That is tonight's important ''Opening Monologue.'' if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I want to start tonight by sending our many thoughts and prayers to our fellow Americans down in Texans. They are dealing with unprecedented flooding, and of course, widespread devastation. Now according to estimates, nine trillion gallons of water have already been dumped on the area, and some parts could see a total of 50 inches of rain by this time the storm is over later in the week. So the people in Texas and Louisiana need to take all the necessary precautions because things are going to get worse. Not if, they will. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, while the region braces for even more flooding, we have to recognize the efforts of the Trump administration, the governor of Texas, the lieutenant governor, charities, and frankly, everyday citizens who have been unbelievably inspiring and amazing, the people that have done their best to prevent what could have been a widespread tragedy. Now, to overcome any type of natural disaster, you really need three components. Think about this. It really starts on the ground -- doesn't it? -- neighbors helping neighbors. We saw that all weekend long. Then you need local, state governments to respond effectively. The governor, and well, with the one exception of the Houston mayor, they all did -- they did their job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally, you also need-- this is where the federal government needs to step in and assist these communities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, before Harvey hit, the Trump administration was prepared. They have 8, 500 federal employees on the ground now there assisting. And earlier today, President Trump pledged his full support to all of the many, many victims. Think how hard it is to buy your first home. Think of the blood, toil, sweat and tears and effort, and to see it all washed away. Take a look at the president today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And this is just one of many, many examples of left-wing Antifa violence. So when are the Democrats in Washington, politicians-- when is the media going to offer the same criticism and condemnation of this group? We'll have more later tonight. And finally, the Democrats, members of the mainstream media-- they continue to feign moral outrage and yet expose what is a huge, massive double standard.

Now, Rich eventually fled to Switzerland, where the government refused to extradite him back to the USA. He was on the FBI's most wanted list. But that did not stop Bill Clinton from giving him a pass. Now, this, of course, came after Rich's ex-wife, oh, donated 450 grand to the Clinton library and over $1 million to Democratic campaigns. Clinton's money quid pro quo? Oh, I'm shocked. Bill Clinton also offered clemency-- now, this is really important-- to members of the terrorist group, the FALN, which claimed responsibility for over 100 bombings in major American cities that killed five people. You don't believe it? Look at this video! We haven't shown this to you in a couple years. It's the FALN terrorists in the 1980s making bombs.

Now, in case Democrats, the media forgot on fake news CNN and NBC -- well, Lopez Rivera-- he was sentenced to 55 years in prison. Why? Seditious conspiracy to overthrow the United States government. And as part of the group the FALN, and you know, we just can't forget what they did here. And President Obama -- he set a record for commutations, including by shortening the sentences of drug dealers. Yeah, people that want to sell drugs to your kids. We'll have more on that later tonight. But first, back to our top and our lead story and the horrendous flooding in Texas. On the ground in Rosenberg, Texas, Steve Harrigan.

      "utterance": "Welcome to ''Hannity.'' This is a Fox News Alert. We are following three major breaking news stories. According to the National Weather Service, Texas-- they're now bracing for up to 20 inches of additional rainfall after this historic and catastrophic flooding. Now, this as President Trump is now promising 100 percent support and the rapid deployment of federal aid to help those devastated areas in Texas and also now in Louisiana. Our reporters are on the ground tonight in the Lone Star State. Then radical leftists, Antifa, protesters savagely beating nonviolent protesters over the weekend. This time, Berkeley, California. So when are the Democrats in this country going to condemn this out of control left- wing hate and violence? Also, the president defends his decision to pardon former sheriff Joe Arpaio as Democrats and the liberal media feign moral outrage. Tonight right here, we will expose the left wing's massive double standard when it comes to presidential pardons. That is tonight's important ''Opening Monologue.'' I want to start tonight by sending our many thoughts and prayers to our fellow Americans down in Texans. They are dealing with unprecedented flooding, and of course, widespread devastation. Now according to estimates, nine trillion gallons of water have already been dumped on the area, and some parts could see a total of 50 inches of rain by this time the storm is over later in the week. So the people in Texas and Louisiana need to take all the necessary precautions because things are going to get worse. Not if, they will. Now, while the region braces for even more flooding, we have to recognize the efforts of the Trump administration, the governor of Texas, the lieutenant governor, charities, and frankly, everyday citizens who have been unbelievably inspiring and amazing, the people that have done their best to prevent what could have been a widespread tragedy. Now, to overcome any type of natural disaster, you really need three components. Think about this. It really starts on the ground -- doesn't it? -- neighbors helping neighbors. We saw that all weekend long. Then you need local, state governments to respond effectively. The governor, and well, with the one exception of the Houston mayor, they all did -- they did their job. And finally, you also need-- this is where the federal government needs to step in and assist these communities. Now, before Harvey hit, the Trump administration was prepared. They have 8, 500 federal employees on the ground now there assisting. And earlier today, President Trump pledged his full support to all of the many, many victims. Think how hard it is to buy your first home. Think of the blood, toil, sweat and tears and effort, and to see it all washed away. Take a look at the president today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "To the people of Texas and Louisiana, we are 100 percent with you. We're praying for you. Working closely with your leaders and officials, and I will be visiting the impact zone tomorrow to ensure that you're receiving full support and cooperation from the federal government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, the president rightly will be traveling to Texas tomorrow to offer his support. Now, we're going to take you live on the ground in Houston in just a minute. Also tonight, radical leftist Antifa thugs attack peaceful protesters at the rally yesterday in Berkeley, California. Now, take a look at this headline from The Washington Post, ''Black-clad Antifa members attack peaceful right-wing demonstrators in Berkeley.'' Now, according to the AP, at least five people were attacked, 13 people arrested. And this is just one of many, many examples of left-wing Antifa violence. So when are the Democrats in Washington, politicians-- when is the media going to offer the same criticism and condemnation of this group? We'll have more later tonight. And finally, the Democrats, members of the mainstream media-- they continue to feign moral outrage and yet expose what is a huge, massive double standard. The president is standing by his decision -- I think it was the right one-- to pardon former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. After the president announced this on Friday night, he was padoning Joe Arpaio, well, who was found guilty of criminal contempt for defying a judge's order in immigration enforcement, well, the media in this country that will never give the president a fair shot went ballistic and apoplectic and politicized immediately the president's decision when we were just two hours away from a hurricane. Watch this."

And Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election, an election that he would have won. So -- and he was elected many times. So I stand by my partner, Sheriff Joe. And I think the people of Arizona who really know him best would agree with me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, the president also highlighted the left's huge hypocrisy and massive double standard when it comes to presidents granting pardons and clemency. Now, if the media is so upset about Sheriff Arpaio, then they should be really outraged about what Presidents Clinton and Obama did. Let's go back to 2001. During his last day in office, Bill Clinton -- remember? He pardoned Marc Rich, one of the biggest tax cheats in American history, who back in the early 1980s was convicted, oh, let's see, on 51 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion, racketeering, trading with the enemy, which in this case happened to be Iran. Now, Rich eventually fled to Switzerland, where the government refused to extradite him back to the USA. He was on the FBI's most wanted list. But that did not stop Bill Clinton from giving him a pass. Now, this, of course, came after Rich's ex-wife, oh, donated 450 grand to the Clinton library and over $1 million to Democratic campaigns. Clinton's money quid pro quo? Oh, I'm shocked. Bill Clinton also offered clemency-- now, this is really important-- to members of the terrorist group, the FALN, which claimed responsibility for over 100 bombings in major American cities that killed five people. You don't believe it? Look at this video! We haven't shown this to you in a couple years. It's the FALN terrorists in the 1980s making bombs. And back in 1999, Bill Clinton offered clemency to 16 members of that group, the FALN, you know, the people making bombs. Then you have President Obama. He commuted the sentence of the notorious FALN member Oscar Lopez Rivera, who actually turned down Clinton's clemency deal. Now, in case Democrats, the media forgot on fake news CNN and NBC -- well, Lopez Rivera-- he was sentenced to 55 years in prison. Why? Seditious conspiracy to overthrow the United States government. And as part of the group the FALN, and you know, we just can't forget what they did here. And President Obama -- he set a record for commutations, including by shortening the sentences of drug dealers. Yeah, people that want to sell drugs to your kids. We'll have more on that later tonight. But first, back to our top and our lead story and the horrendous flooding in Texas. On the ground in Rosenberg, Texas, Steve Harrigan. Steve, you were amazing on Friday night. Thank you for being with us. I know you've been working around the clock. And I know the audience appreciates it. What's the latest there?"

    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Thanks, Sean. We're just outside of Houston. You can see emergency vehicles behind me. They're there because a giant sinkhole has opened up in part because of the tremendous amount of water that's pouring down. They're trying to block cars from trying to get on this road. Nine inches of rain has fallen in just the past 24 hours alone. The conditions are getting worse and worse each hour. There were seven different neighborhoods outside of Houston that had voluntary evacuations. Now those evacuations are mandatory. People are being told they have to leave as this water continues to rise. And there's real questions about the structural soundness of many small bridges. So there's concerns about how to get around when the very roads are falling apart. Right now, people are leaving. They're having to evacuate and they're heading out of here as quickly as possible. Sean, back to you."

What's the latest on that controversy?"

When you see people around here, they are wet, cold, tired and uncertain about where they're going to eat, where they're going to go. The shelters here, they need everything. They need doctors, they need baby formula, they need dry clothes. People are wet and confused. And to ask them to leave their homes now in the darkness, a very tough situation, Sean."

We watched as this neighborhood filled up with rising water, entire families rescued by boats, with young children shivering in the rain. These families had no idea where to go. They were shell-shocked as the water just engulfed their houses. One by one, they were rescued by boats. You would ask them, Where are you going to go? They say, We don't know. We might go to the local high school. We might go to some type of shelter. And there was a young woman just a block right up on here on higher ground who opened up her garage to the families and elderly people. One of those elderly couples still sitting here tonight, waiting for a ride. I want to quickly introduce you to Angela. Angela, you opened up your home to these people.

Looks like a metro bus passed those red doors, just dropped off dozens of people. We have seen metro buses, school buses, dump trucks, you name it, people walking in on foot. Just last hour, we showed you the interstate on the back side of the convention center. They're now using that as a helicopter landing pad to bring the people in. As they walk in the doors, you can see what they are getting, this pile of clothes here. Volunteers-- absolutely amazing. They've been bringing diapers and formulas and cups and plates and clothes and underwear, everything that families have had to leave behind in their homes, those homes that they may never see again. It is a bit of a different scene than this morning. When we first got here, they were at half capacity. People were smiling and happy and everybody was getting a hot meal. But now things are getting a little bit tense. You can hear they're trying to keep them calm. We've seen a little bit of fighting here, not much. But it's the Red Cross who greets them. They're there at this table. They're registering. They're taking anyone in, anyone who needs a spot here, no matter the capacity. You mentioned a guest, Sean. It's David Brady.

And we work closely with the judge and the mayor on where those are going to be, what they need. And they at least give us a little bit of time to get set up because we don't want our-- our guests, these Houstonians who have been so devastated by this flood, to show up and not have someone welcome them, put a Red Cross blanket around them and comfort them and help them get through this."

It's en route to Samaritan's Purse, Red Cross. You guys are all hands on deck now. I want to follow up on Caroline's question because this is important. Will there be room for every person that's going to need shelter from the area, A? And we watched what happened with Katrina. I reported on Katrina. Are food and water and medicine and supplies and security and cots and blankets-- will they be-- are there enough now available vis-a-vis your organization, other organizations, the federal government, state and local governments? Will you have everything you need so we don't repeat some of the mistakes in the past?"

And everyone, including the mayor and the Harris County judge are all working on that challenge right now. Right now, everything is going as we hoped it would in this very almost impossible task to take on. Everything is going as we hoped it would.

I happened to be in Corpus Christi on Wednesday night. And when I was there-- the people didn't-- people weren't all that, you know, exercised about the storm. They thought it was going to be bad storm. They hoped it would, you know, not be as bad. But people were calmly going about the process of preparing. And there wasn't a lot of-- you know, wasn't a lot of politics involved. It was just, We have a job to do and we're going to do it. And from Greg Abbott, the governor, to Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor, to the coordination with Homeland Security-- FEMA is under Homeland Security-- local officials, all the volunteers from churches, synagogues, mosques from all over the country who are pouring in-- that really does remind you of the best of this country. We're self-sufficient, except sometimes we need help. We're independent, but sometimes we need a helping hand from a neighbor and the government where appropriate. And this is a time when we need a coordinated government, and Sean, we need all the high-placed officials not only nominated but confirmed at Homeland Security, at all our major departments. We have crises all over, you know, our executive departments of staffing right now. And this reminds us all over again why we need more than acting directors or deputy directors.

I mean, Donald Trump sneezes the wrong way, and the media are all over it. There was actually a Chyron today on another cable channel that said something like, Trump decides to go to Texas despite-- despite possible disruption. A few days ago, they were claiming-- somehow claiming, even though he was all over the issue and the emgergency. that he wasn't engaged enough. Now he's going, and they're criticizing him for that. So the man cannot win no matter what he does. This is being handled as well as a cataclysmic event such as this can be handled. I really don't know what else could be done at this point, given the enormity of the problem. But the idea that they're complaining about the Arpaio pardon taking place when the president clearly said he was going to pardon him-- I mean, would it have been better for the media if he pardoned him next week?

I know this is one of the times, Joe, and I interviewed you all last week, you wish you were wrong. You had this with pinpoint accuracy. And we're not done yet.

Fortunately there is a lot of dry air over the top of where the center is that will inhibit any kind of rapid development. I'm still worried it's out over the warm gulf. Bu what is happening is the feeder bands from the storm are coming northwestward. And when they run into the Texas gulf coast, they just explode. It's a frictional effect. They've got air piling in, goes straight up, and you are getting this repeating what we call training going on in and around the Houston area. And Harvey is going to continue eastward underneath Galveston late tonight and tomorrow then turn northeast. But in the meantime, the bands keep pivoting in overtop of Houston and just piling on. There's a chance that the storm starts to intensify and pulls the bands back in towards it and try to stop the rain --"

And that pivoting process is going on. The wind, I'm watching the wind over Galveston Bay is turning into the north and northeast. And I've been talking about this. And my worry is because of all this water that's coming to Galveston Bay, the bay is enhanced because of the storm surge, that that water comes to Galveston from the north because they're in for northeast winds now 25 to 45 miles and hours the next 24 hours. And we also have a problem on the mid-Atlantic coast tomorrow. The Virginia capes, 40 to 60 miles an hour winds. It may not be Maine, but that will go out very, very quickly. But it's Texas.

The president has put a cabinet together that is really focused on this. The president has been leaning into this disaster from before it ever started, clearly giving the authority to the state of Texas to move and move quickly. So I feel confident that both the state and the federal government, but more importantly, Sean, I'll suggest to you the faith community in the state of Texas will play an incredibly important role. We saw Franklin Graham and his group, what he's doing, Baptists men, the Boy Scouts, and just private citizens. I know story after story that has been told about private citizens that have been called up and said, hey, we need your boat. We need you driving it or we'll take it and do it, the law enforcement.

Nobody ever calls out these groups the way they should be. Occupy, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, \"What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them?

I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly. I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe, and I think the people of Arizona who really know him best would agree with me."

Before I get to Joe, I want to go back to this issue. We've had Black Lives Matter literally saying \"What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now.\" And Larry, they got an invitation to the White House. We just played the Antifa beating up these protesters this weekend. You don't see it on the media."

So Black Lives Matter fits very nicely into that narrative. The man is out to get them. Cops are not out there trying to do a good job, trying to protect and serve. They're out there trying to racially profile young black men. That's their narrative. That's what they go with. That's how they get that 95 percent plus monolithic black vote. That's why they do it."
