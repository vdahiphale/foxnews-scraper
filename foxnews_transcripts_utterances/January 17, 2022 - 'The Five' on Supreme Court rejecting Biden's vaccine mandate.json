The pandemic problems are piling up for President Biden. The Supreme Court dealing a huge blow and striking down a key component of the president's sweeping vaccine mandates by blocking the vaccinated -- or the vaccinate -- or test rule for large private companies with a 100 or more employees. The high court is allowing the vaccine mandate for most health care workers to stand. Now that comes as the administration can't seem to find its way out of its COVID testing fiasco. Biden announcing that he is ordering 500 million more COVID tests while Americans are still waiting for the first batch he had promised to arrive.",

As for the rule -- as for the ruling, it kind of sits where I think Americans are what the Supreme Court did. And that we're pro-vax, but we're not pro-vax mandate. That seems like what we are. I mean, it just feels like it and I think that we understand the difference, I don't think Joe does. I think that Biden, you know, if he is not calling you a racist for not supporting, for not supporting his voting rights theatrics then he calls you kind of like a stupid dangerous unpatriotic.

A period of calm. That's not true. We were lied to. There is no bright side, it's all become very dark, and very dank. It's like -- it's like Joe turned America into his basement. And that's why -- that is why we have this fake voting rights theater. Its incendiary rhetoric used to divert from these dual problems of crime and COVID. The president is in a mess.

I was at a lawyer's dinner a few weeks ago including an attorney, a prominent attorney who had argued before the high court. And I said, you know, this is a slam dunk on the Jacobson versus Massachusetts, the seminal 1905 case, the government has the absolute right to mandate vaccines. And the Supreme Court today said yes. When the Medicaid, Medicare, health care workers, a state legislature can do it and the Jacobson, the state can do it. The federal government can do it, a city can do it. What -- the people that can't do it are agencies of the federal government. It can't be a regulation. What Ron Klain, the Rasputin of the Biden administration did here was to try and use OSHA to get a vaccine mandate in private industry without going to Congress to get a law passed requiring vaccines in private industry. Supreme Court saw through it by six-three and said no, you can't work around the Supreme Court, the law of the land. What you must do is pass a law if you want to mandate. They didn't pass a law, the Supreme Court rejected them. But there is no doubt that the government of the United States has the absolute ability to mandate to the military, to mandate to health care workers. They can, the various municipalities can pass laws that require agencies to mandate vaccines. The only thing you cannot do is pass a regulation. A regulation is different than a law. It doesn't have debate, it doesn't have two sides to the story, you don't have a conclusion, so I believe what the Supreme Court did was absolutely appropriate and in line with this old precedent from 1905, Dana.",

And he was really targeting Mitch McConnell when he said that. And I started thinking about that. And I wonder about Trump. Now is Biden's loss Trump's gain? You know, what about Trump? And it's interesting you point out that Biden is at 33 percent approval. Thirty-three percent of the people want Trump to run for president. Fifty- nine of the people do not want Trump to run for president. So, 33 percent don't want him to run. His disapproval is the same as Biden's disapproval. I think what you're going to see is interestingly enough, no one can project or forecast but I think that maybe it will be Hillary Clinton versus Mike Pence.

As for the rule -- as for the ruling, it kind of sits where I think Americans are what the Supreme Court did. And that we're pro-vax, but we're not pro-vax mandate. That seems like what we are. I mean, it just feels like it and I think that we understand the difference, I don't think Joe does. I think that Biden, you know, if he is not calling you a racist for not supporting, for not supporting his voting rights theatrics then he calls you kind of like a stupid dangerous unpatriotic. And unpatriotic group if you don't force, you know, if you don't agree enforcing medicine into people. Even if you believe. I mean, I believe that medicine is good."

And I said, you know, this is a slam dunk on the Jacobson versus Massachusetts, the seminal 1905 case, the government has the absolute right to mandate vaccines. And the Supreme Court today said yes. When the Medicaid, Medicare, health care workers, a state legislature can do it and the Jacobson, the state can do it. The federal government can do it, a city can do it. What -- the people that can't do it are agencies of the federal government. It can't be a regulation. What Ron Klain, the Rasputin of the Biden administration did here was to try and use OSHA to get a vaccine mandate in private industry without going to Congress to get a law passed requiring vaccines in private industry. Supreme Court saw through it by six-three and said no, you can't work around the Supreme Court, the law of the land. What you must do is pass a law if you want to mandate. They didn't pass a law, the Supreme Court rejected them. But there is no doubt that the government of the United States has the absolute ability to mandate to the military, to mandate to health care workers. They can, the various municipalities can pass laws that require agencies to mandate vaccines. The only thing you cannot do is pass a regulation. A regulation is different than a law. It doesn't have debate, it doesn't have two sides to the story, you don't have a conclusion, so I believe what the Supreme Court did was absolutely appropriate and in line with this old precedent from 1905, Dana."

And he was really targeting Mitch McConnell when he said that. And I started thinking about that. And I wonder about Trump. Now is Biden's loss Trump's gain? You know, what about Trump? And it's interesting you point out that Biden is at 33 percent approval. Thirty-three percent of the people want Trump to run for president. Fifty- nine of the people do not want Trump to run for president. So, 33 percent don't want him to run. His disapproval is the same as Biden's disapproval. I think what you're going to see is interestingly enough, no one can project or forecast but I think that maybe it will be Hillary Clinton versus Mike Pence.

And what they don't realize is the more they say it the more people are thinking about Donald Trump and saying, gee, you know, the economy was better and, you know, my 401K to the extent you had one, and at least he was fighting for Americans, at least he was getting hostages out of other countries. And so, it's just a dumb thing. But I want to say something about Kamala Harris. You know, every time she is ask a question, she says I don't want to get into the high-class gossip. And she says I'm -- I want to -- I'm focused on affordable child care. So, she turns herself into this wonderful person who cares about child care. This, from the same administration where the head of the Department of Education contacted the Department of Justice and the FBI, and the White House so that they can turn parents into domestic terrorists and then go after parents. But then they stand up in front of the -- in front of the American public and say, we are out there trying to protect children and affordable child care.

And under Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore has become Balti-less. It is a terrible situation there. One more thing about New York, last night, they were two carjackings, one right by my apartment another one way downtown. And in the one by my apartment, the guy who did the carjacking, the suspect, then use the car to go after another car, like rammed another car and then kind of tried to go after a police officer, but nobody was hurt. So, under -- as I read the Bragg memo, that would be a misdemeanor, right?"

Criminals are smart enough to realize that if you destroy society with enough progress recipe reforms, there is no society left for the criminal to prey upon. Every parasite needs to keep the host alive. So, here you have a criminal that's going like whoa, slow down, Democrats. I still need to steal. I still need to loot.

Jesse pointed out that the thing is wearing with some kind of workout outfit. So, I really am I'm sorry I said it. But now from that to pedophilia. A major media outlet is facing enormous backlash after deleting a series of horrifying tweets which seemed to normalize pedophilia. Yes, pedophilia. USA Today -- straight as you can get -- promoting an article originally titled What the public keeps getting wrong about Pedophilia, arguing that the attraction to minors is \"misunderstood.\" Here's one of the tweets. \"When most of the public thinks of pedophilia, they assume it's synonymous with child sex abuse. A pedophile is an adult who is sexually attracted to children, but not all pedophiles act out, abuse kids. And some people who sexually abused kids are not pedophiles.\" After all kinds of outrage and widespread disgust, USA Today, today decided to pull the entire tweet thread saying that the tweet lacked context because the full article was unavailable because it was hiding behind a paywall. So, Greg, I hear you, pedophile was the thing in ancient Greece. Should we be kinder to misunderstood pedophiles?"

You know, I understand trying to get the youth demo, but this is a little disgusting. By the way, Judge Jeanine made a great point on my show last night about this. This is all based on a lie that pedophiles seek understanding and treatment. They don't. They're perfectly happy exploiting your desire to help and there are no rush to reverse their deviant instincts. It's the opposite. They actually go to great lengths to plan and deceive their perversions. They put a lot of work into it. Just read about that CNN producer. I mean, he like flew people in. I mean, what -- I mean, you had to do some serious planning to like, you know, sexually traffic teenage girls."

Honestly, like, so -- and then there's Twitter, which is stupid, and they probably should not have their social media team doing Twitter about that.

I have convicted people who are the heads of corporations and teachers and priests and garbage collectors as well as -- all kinds of -- doctors, lawyers, it doesn't matter. You can, till the cows come home, tell me that pedophiles don't act out. You're wrong. They act out every time we catch them.
