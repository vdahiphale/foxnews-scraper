Our button works, yours doesn't, and it's bigger. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, despite what the media predicted, there is real progress on the Korean peninsula, because the president's peace through strength strategy is working. It always works. Appeasement doesn't work. Bribing dictators doesn't work. Now, there hasn't been a single rocket fired in months, American hostages, thank God, they have come home. One nuclear site in fact has been dismantled and shuttered, and the process continues to this day. And this is something else that the mainstream media will never tell you. President Trump has been incredibly tough on Russia. This is something they won't report under his administration, the U.S. issued sanctions against roughly 200 individuals and entities related to Russia. Other stinging economic sanctions against Russia have also increased, and U.S. forces on the ground in Syria inflicted heavy casualties on even Russian soldiers during a skirmish earlier this year, an enormous embarrassment for Vladimir Putin. And the United States has been busy arming Ukraine with lethal weapon systems, but the media, they are not going to focus on any of this. Instead, it's Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion. If they are not talking about Stormy, it's all the time. It's 24/7. Now, with this is a backdrop, the president moves forward with his very important diplomacy and as a leader of the free world, President Trump, he must meet with the leaders of Russia, China, North Korea, and others, as long as he is not spending $150 billion of your cash and other currencies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, our friends and foes, they know where we stand. They need to hear from the commander in chief. There is, as you say, a new sheriff in town. Let the president negotiate deals that Obama was not capable of. And specifically, Russia must stop coordinating with the Iranian regime. They must stop supporting President Assad in Syria. And yes, they need to stop, yes, meddling in anybody's elections and be held accountable for their actions. Now, the years of weak and feckless leadership under Obama are now over. No more cargo planes full of cash, and as President Trump frequently says, a good relationship with Putin and Russia, when you're not trying to bribe them, it is very positive thing for the country. However, under President Trump, any hostile or aggressive action by Putin's regime will be and should be met with strength, not appeasement, not bribery, not cash, not kissing the rings of dictators. And while the mainstream media and left, as they peddle their conspiracy theories, well, the administration is now putting forth some truth and some precedent and some facts. And by the way, Reagan proved it to all of us. Peace through strength works. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Diplomacy is important. Trust but verify. And the American people, our safety and security, frankly, is dependent on all of this -- our kids, our grandkids. This matters. Now, following his talks with Vladimir Putin, I had the opportunity to sit down with the president right after his press conference. Here is a part of that interview. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

John Brennan who is accusing the president being a traitor voted for the communist party at the height of the Cold War in 1976 when the Soviet union actually wanted to destroy America. That's treasonous. Vladimir Putin is a bad guy, he is a bad actor. But the Russian federation is not the Soviet Union. And as far as I know Donald Trump never voted for the communist party at the height of the Cold War, so let's just put that on the record. With regard to the reaction to today's summit, it's a little bit like the Strzok testimony. You saw the unveiling of the deep state last week with Strzok's testimony, today you really saw the depth of the mainstream media. Nobody in that room behave like a journalist. They were like members of Move on.org or the resistance. The idea that we have a chance to talk about big issues, saving hundreds of thousands of lives in Syria, the question of Ukraine's national sovereignty. And instead they want to perpetuate this bogus collusion narrative. They came out of the closet there is no journalism on the mainstream media left and it was absolutely shambolic.",

Now, remember, ahead of the 2016 presidential election cycle. In 2014, the House Intel Committee chairman, Devin Nunes, he issued a very stern warning about Putin's belligerent actions and attempts to denigrate the United States and, by the way, yes, impact our 2016 election. And we also know, you can go way back to 2008, we know that Russia hacked into both the McCain campaign and even the presidential campaign of Barack Obama himself. And despite this, in 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls -- oh, just before the election, it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with.

Now that Trump is president, after nearly a decade of playing down Russian interference and its impact on our elections, the left is in total freak out mode, trying desperately to connect Russian hacking to the Trump presidency. This is a total left-wing conspiracy, a fantasy. This is the witch hunt. Every single report, every investigation into our election shows absolutely no votes were changed, none were altered in the 2016 election. Not a single vote. And by the way, it's important to point out every major country in the world engages in election interference. As Senator Rand Paul put it, we all do it, and this includes the Clinton campaign. In fact, if you're looking for Russian interference, look no further than Hillary Clinton and the DNC in 2016. They actually paid, oh, yes, through a law firm that they funnel money, Fusion GPS. Yes, then they got a foreign entity, foreign spy by the name of Christopher Steele, he put together phony opposition research, and now the infamous dossier, which has been debunked, filled with lies, Russian lies, Russian propaganda, and all paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party to manipulate you, the American people in the lead up to the 2016 election. Nobody in the media seems to care about Obama's attempt at interference in the last Israeli election against our number one ally in the Middle East, Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And by all accounts, today's meeting, always productive and very important. As we all know, there are a lot of serious issues between the U.S. and Russia, but predictably, even before this meeting took place, yes, the destroy Trump, hate Trump media, they were already, hoping and predicting failure. You see, success for Donald Trump is bad for their agenda, especially in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections. Take a look."

And while the left always acts like the sky is literally falling because Donald Trump actually wants to discuss safety and security with nuclear weapons, nuclear proliferation, Syria, Iran, a lot of other important issues, including interference. By the way, meeting with Putin is that bad, we all know the truth. U.S. diplomacy is in good hands, despite what they have told you. The president has never been afraid to walk away from a bad deal, never been afraid to call out foreign leaders, and hold all of them accountable. As we saw, he was critical of the British government's execution of Brexit. And, by the way, he rightfully called out many of our allies in NATO. Why? They are not paying their fair share for their own national defense, even criticizing the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and her country's lucrative energy deals Vladimir Putin's Russia, which creates a dangerous dependency on Russia and energy, which is the lifeblood of their economy. After all, if the West is so worried about Russia, well, why would they be willing to give him billions and billions of dollars to make Russia rich again? Instead, the president is now rightly pushing Germany to kill its oil and gas deals with Russia and get their energy from us in that the United States, which would also mean millions of high-paying career jobs for Americans. Now, this move would not only benefit the United States, it would also absolutely wreck Russia's economy. Now, Putin should be very concerned about that possibility, as it would literally destroy Russia's economy and probably destroy him politically. We'll have more on that in a moment. And now, the president has been even more forceful with our enemies. Look at North Korea, little rocket man, fire and fury. Our button works, yours doesn't, and it's bigger. Now, despite what the media predicted, there is real progress on the Korean peninsula, because the president's peace through strength strategy is working. It always works. Appeasement doesn't work. Bribing dictators doesn't work. Now, there hasn't been a single rocket fired in months, American hostages, thank God, they have come home. One nuclear site in fact has been dismantled and shuttered, and the process continues to this day. And this is something else that the mainstream media will never tell you. President Trump has been incredibly tough on Russia. This is something they won't report under his administration, the U.S. issued sanctions against roughly 200 individuals and entities related to Russia. Other stinging economic sanctions against Russia have also increased, and U.S. forces on the ground in Syria inflicted heavy casualties on even Russian soldiers during a skirmish earlier this year, an enormous embarrassment for Vladimir Putin. And the United States has been busy arming Ukraine with lethal weapon systems, but the media, they are not going to focus on any of this. Instead, it's Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion. If they are not talking about Stormy, it's all the time. It's 24/7. Now, with this is a backdrop, the president moves forward with his very important diplomacy and as a leader of the free world, President Trump, he must meet with the leaders of Russia, China, North Korea, and others, as long as he is not spending $150 billion of your cash and other currencies. Now, our friends and foes, they know where we stand. They need to hear from the commander in chief. There is, as you say, a new sheriff in town. Let the president negotiate deals that Obama was not capable of. And specifically, Russia must stop coordinating with the Iranian regime. They must stop supporting President Assad in Syria. And yes, they need to stop, yes, meddling in anybody's elections and be held accountable for their actions. Now, the years of weak and feckless leadership under Obama are now over. No more cargo planes full of cash, and as President Trump frequently says, a good relationship with Putin and Russia, when you're not trying to bribe them, it is very positive thing for the country. However, under President Trump, any hostile or aggressive action by Putin's regime will be and should be met with strength, not appeasement, not bribery, not cash, not kissing the rings of dictators. And while the mainstream media and left, as they peddle their conspiracy theories, well, the administration is now putting forth some truth and some precedent and some facts. And by the way, Reagan proved it to all of us. Peace through strength works. Diplomacy is important. Trust but verify. And the American people, our safety and security, frankly, is dependent on all of this -- our kids, our grandkids. This matters. Now, following his talks with Vladimir Putin, I had the opportunity to sit down with the president right after his press conference. Here is a part of that interview. Take a look."

He's one of the people that get it. But I'll tell you that I thought it was a really amazing time -- not about that. I think it's a shame, we are talking about nuclear proliferation. We're talking about Syria and humanitarian aid, we're talking about all these different things, and we get questions on the witch hunt. And I don't think the people out in the country buy it.

And at the end of this meeting, I think we really came to a lot of good conclusions, a really good conclusion for Israel. Something very strong. He is a believer in Israel. He's a fan of Bibi.

      "speaker": "TRUMP",

I think it's becoming a humanitarian situation, and a lot of people are going to move back to Syria from Turkey and from Jordan and from different places, they're going to move back, less so from Europe. But they will be moving back from lots of different places. So I really think we are not far apart on Syria. I do think that on Iran, he probably would have liked to keep the deal in place because that's good for Russia. You know, they do business with -- it's good for a lot of the countries that do business with Iran, but it's not good for this country and it's ultimately not good for the world. And if you look at what is happening, is falling apart, they have rights in all their cities. The inflation is rampant and going through the roof, and not that you want to hurt anybody, but that regime, we will let the people know that we are behind them 100 percent. But they are having big protests all over the country, probably as big as they have ever had before. And that all happens since I terminated that deal. So, we'll see."

We discussed ISIS and, as you know, we've pretty much eradicated ISIS in the Middle East. And we've done a very strong job, he acknowledged that.

To me, the most important issue is the nuclear issue, because I know President Obama said that global warming is our biggest problem, and I would say that nuclear warming is our biggest problem by the factor of about 5 million. The nuclear problem, we have to make sure, we have to be very careful. And, you know, if you look at Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. And we have to do something and working on other countries. And he also said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea. We are doing well with North Korea. We have time. There is no rush. You know, it's been going on for many years, but we are doing very well. As you know, we got our hostages back. There's been no testing. There's been no nuclear explosion, which we would have known about immediately. There's been no rockets going over Japan. No missiles going over Japan. And that's now been nine months, and the relationship is very good. You saw the nice letter he wrote.

The United States could be paying for 91 percent, OK? Could be. So, the minimum is 70 percent, but it's probably 91. So, we are paying for 91 percent of the cost of keeping Europe safe. On top of that, the European Union takes total advantage of us with tariffs and with trade barriers. But they kill us on trade. We lost $151 billion last year.

And I had to reiterate the things I said several times including during our personal contacts that the Russian state has never interfered and it's not going to interfere into internal American affairs including the election process. Any specific material if such things are right, we are ready to analyze together."

Sara, I want to start with you, because the media and the left in this country is in the middle of what it can only be described as a collective meltdown. Starting with John Brennan calling this summit treasonous, Nancy Pelosi and Jeff Flake. And here's the reality. If Vladimir Putin had what they said it would have been out by now. There's no way but it doesn't stop the conspiracy theories. And the idea that somehow that President Trump whose dropping $150 billion in cash and other currency--"

But let me go back to Brennan, Sean. It's extraordinary to me that the ex- CIA director calls the president of the United States actions treasonous when his actions border on sedition."

The dossier how that was handled what people say under oath, I get all that. And I heard your monologue very closely. And I think you're right that Peter Strzok has things to answer for. I think where is the DNC servers the president said. All of that can be true."

I give you all that. Nonetheless, Sean, the president missed a golden opportunity today. I've got to be direct in saying in having Vladimir Putin there and just to his face saying knock it off.

I did like the idea and I thought this was interesting that the president is saying, Putin had a good idea, let Mueller's people go interview them. All for it.

Putin is denying it, you know, the idea that he has something. But here's I think the most important part that we got to get into and that is, at some point, we need to have the specific evidence and the double standard is glaring in this particular case as it relates to the servers, as it relates to the e-mails that are missing. And at some point we got to say where are -- where is this evidence as well because we want to know who knew what when and where."

      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Look, Sean, let me -- let me address the question of how everybody is reacting to the press who were on the left. But first, a reminder with regards to what you mentioned earlier. John Brennan who is accusing the president being a traitor voted for the communist party at the height of the Cold War in 1976 when the Soviet union actually wanted to destroy America. That's treasonous. Vladimir Putin is a bad guy, he is a bad actor. But the Russian federation is not the Soviet Union. And as far as I know Donald Trump never voted for the communist party at the height of the Cold War, so let's just put that on the record. With regard to the reaction to today's summit, it's a little bit like the Strzok testimony. You saw the unveiling of the deep state last week with Strzok's testimony, today you really saw the depth of the mainstream media. Nobody in that room behave like a journalist. They were like members of Move on.org or the resistance. The idea that we have a chance to talk about big issues, saving hundreds of thousands of lives in Syria, the question of Ukraine's national sovereignty. And instead they want to perpetuate this bogus collusion narrative. They came out of the closet there is no journalism on the mainstream media left and it was absolutely shambolic."

      "utterance": "As we continue from Helsinki, Finland, we continue with Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Ed Henry, Sara Carter, and Daniel Hoffman. Let me go back to what the president was very strong in my interview with him. Where is the server? Where are the e-mails? Why did they get away with that? Why the double standard? And rightly tough on Peter Strzok, who frankly, every FBI I know feels that he has hurt the institution that they love and have served either in the past or presently. And look at where we are. Look at where this has taken us, 18 months, where's the evidence?"

      "utterance": "Look at how far we've come. Because had President Trump not won the election, we would have no none of this, Sean. But it's a very important point. Why did the FBI refused to look at that server? Right? Why was this sent over to a private company? Where is the information that was contained on that server? The Awan brothers were directly connected to Pakistan. There is a lot of information that they were connected to Pakistani intelligence."

I mean, think about it. Even in his private discussions with then FBI director Jim Comey, he said I want you to look into this. Look into this. He hasn't hidden anything. And when it came to reductions--"

In 2014 Devin Nunes said you have devoted your life to the CIA. And this ought to be something that we get a handle on. Here's my point. Julian Assange was 17 years old and hacked into NASA and the DOD. It's 30 years later. Where is our cybersecurity that prevents anybody from being able to do something like that? Where is it? At some point, we've got to say what are we doing that they can still do this?"
