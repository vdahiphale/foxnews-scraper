      "utterance": "Well, on the China thing, it's interesting. I think what -- we could hear the Biden people saying today is that this was maybe more of a clarification, right? And I sort of get it in a way. If you listen to what he was saying last week, I think what he was trying to do was compare himself or juxtapose himself to the president. President who comes out with American carnage and his inaugural address has painted a very stark vision of the future in many ways. Biden has this entire campaign been trying to portray himself and come across as the aspirational figure. I think what he was trying to say in that first statement or, at least, what they are saying he was trying to say was China can't beat us. That China -- that if we put our minds to it, and we as the American people do the right things and do the things we're supposed to do, we can beat China."

We know that they want to be globally dominant in the world. That perhaps we have been naive about just how deeply they are working against us economically, militarily, and geo-politically."

    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",

Yes, they can't -- they are trying to compete with us economically and militarily. If we do the right things though we can beat them because we are the United States of America. This president is not doing the right things. And that's where he wants to be."

And if Joe Biden can make the argument that I'm going to be the president who gets this done for you. Or he can say, this is a president whose putting a very difficult position, you need to vote for somebody else, he could be making that argument. Instead, President Trump is able to say, look, I'm still fighting for you, we're still working for a deal with China. And you have Joe Biden completely changing his narrative. And not just saying that China's competition but saying that they're beating us, he said today that China is investing in technology that we're not investing in. We're not investing in technology, they're stealing our technology. They're using it against us. And the reason why he's soft on China is because his son inked a billion-dollar deal with the Bank of China, which is part of the Communist -- the Communist Party in China. That's why he was so soft in that. Yes."

And I think that unfortunately for Vice President Biden, he is falling into the same conventional trap that the other conventional politicians fell into with the president. And so, he mowed down 18 people. 17 on the Republican side, and the Clinton Empire.

You're supposed to go through a legislative body to get a tax increase like that. The president is using on our cane law from the 1960s based on national security and he as one person is making the decision on a tax increase of a very large magnitude that's hurting people. Hurting my cousin. My cousin Auggie is in the auto-class business, pay $10,000 in tariffs last month. A couple more months like that, you're going to knock him out of business. And so, the president is got to be very, very careful with that. Now, they don't like me saying it, but he should have more guys around him saying that. But that's not the issue tonight. Tonight is who looks better on T.V.? Who looks more muscular? Who looks more powerful? And it's President Trump. And he's -- and Joe Biden, if you've -- with all due respect, he's falling into the same conventional trap where he's letting the president guide the narrative as opposed to ignoring some of what the president's doing and counteracting them in a different way."

Because we're getting ahead of the Democratic primary here, you know, Joe Biden versus President Trump could happen based on the polling we know today. Voters in Democratic Party say they want someone to beat Trump, that's their number one issue. But Joe Biden has to get through a primary which is exactly why you saw him flip on the Hyde Amendment this week because the left is pushing him that way. They're not pushing him on China. That's a Trump issue. But he does have to get past Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, and the 19 other candidates that were in Iowa over the weekend making their case to those voters."

There are those who believe impeachment should start immediately, those who believe proceeding should start, those who believe investigations need to continue to get to the truth, the underlying facts which is what I believe in, and those who even want to pump the brakes further than that.

He's going after Bill Barr, as we know Don McGahn, as we mentioned. It's interesting you know, when you look at the campaign trail and we talked a lot about Joe Biden. Joe Biden back in 1995 said this on the Senate Judiciary Committee about this same Attorney General. He said as you know -- as I know you know but others should know too, I truly enjoyed working with you when you were Attorney General. You were one of the best I have ever worked with and there's been a lot of Attorney General since I've been here. And I mean that sincerely. I think you know this raises a question. This was a person who got through the process quite easily. Is there really momentum and you know energy behind this procedure now that has gone to lawsuits against these individuals?"

I'm saying, given all that -- given all that, and given the two years, I think a lot of Americans, in fact the CBS poll says that 53 percent of Americans say with regard to this continuing investigation drop it and move on to other issues. I think they would like to see the focus -- you know, I mean, those 53 percent clearly according to that poll would like to see the focus move to other things. They feel like it's been done already, not a redo."

So to date, 260 pieces of legislation have been passed by the House, the vast majority of them bipartisan, and only 13 of those bills have passed the Senate, less than five -- exactly five percent.

Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is reporting tonight that Robert Mueller despite the fact that he said very clearly that he thought that would be the only time that he spoke to the public, Nadler says he will testify before the end of the summer.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "House Republicans have a lot of questions for Robert Mueller. And if he comes before our committee, you can expect that will probe into how he assembled his team, why he included people as prosecutors who had previously represented the Clinton Foundation against Freedom of Information Act requests. I think we'll also ask why he didn't probe deeper into the bias of Peter Strzok. When Robert Mueller fired Peter Strzok from his team, he never asked him you know, what it meant to talk about an insurance policy or OK we'll stop him regarding the president the United States. And so I think that there will be many members of the committee from the right and the left who have questions for Mr. Mueller and I would only hope that if he's going to give testimony, let's do it in public. Let's not do the behind closed doors and then both sides come out and you know, it's very frustrating to the American people where it looks like both sides have seen different things."

I'm a little surprised because when he came out and gave that statement, he said you know basically this is my last public statement. I'm going off into private life. What do you think might have changed that?"

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",

As a matter of fact, media sources were cited over 130 times in the Mueller report. And it seems as though the last statement from Mr. Mueller came when he didn't believe that the public was maybe reacting to his report in the way that he would have liked. I don't think that there's any additional work or factual development beyond the four corners of the Mueller report, and I don't think that there's going to be a change in the legal analysis that you know, the president was using Article Two powers which are very robust in our constitutional system that he acted in public and that there was no underlying Russian collusion criminal offense."

It is obvious that John Dean had nothing to offer regarding illuminating facts in the Mueller report. He was there merely to raise the specter of impeachment and the specter of Richard Nixon. And I just think that when you've got a sitting President of the United States calling the ghost of Christmas past up to talk about how that the Nixon days' work, they don't really derail what I think is the greatest political movement in American history for the president."

He was pretty emphatic about the fact that this was his last public testimony. We've seen a lot of people refuse subpoenas from Congress. Whether or not he will be able to do that remains to be seen. So we stay on that story as it moves forward. All right. Also tonight, President Trump and Joe Biden as we mentioned are both in Iowa, both getting ready to speak moments away. But there is another 2020 contender who has sort of silently been climbing up the ladder in a number of these polls. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren now trails Biden by only single digits with 15 percent in the latest CNN poll. That's her strongest showing yet. And tonight a story that shows what Warren's plan to remake the U.S. economy really looks like. Correspondent David Spunt has the details from Washington tonight. Hi, David."

Now she is getting a lot of traction in the field of two dozen Democrats. Warren was one of the first to announce her intention for the White House. She did so back at the end of December of last year. Senator Warren, no stranger to standing up to large corporations. She proposed the idea of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 12 years ago. Now a New York Times profile looks at Warren's economic proposals and argues that Warren's positions are forcing her rivals to push the same or similar policies on the trail. One example, a 7 percent corporate tax for every dollar of profit above $100 million. And a 2 percent annual wealth tax on family fortunes above $50 million. Now, the Times credits Warren with releasing the largest number of detailed plans out of all the major candidates in the 2020 race. Now here is just a sample of her rallies from the last few months. Listen."

Look, she is going to reduce the incentives for work, for investment and for growth and then she is going to discourage innovation and risk-taking. If you liked the slow growth no growth economy of Obama and you don't like the economic surge we are experiencing under Trump, you should support Elizabeth Warren. I mean, her policies would take everything that's been achieved in the last two years and reverse it. So, we'll be back to as bad a place as we were in coming into the Trump presidency or worse."

    {
      "speaker": "PUZDER",
      "utterance": "Well, let's a take a look just for one minute at a number. Elizabeth Warren loves to think she understands the numbers. But I think they confuse her. We -- if you look at fiscal year 2017 tax receipts through the first seven months, so that's through April and compare. That's the last year before the tax cut, so you had higher taxes. Taxes for this fiscal year through April are 6 percent higher. We significantly reduced taxes. Businesses went out and invested. We have more people working than we've ever worked in the history of the country. We keep hitting historic highs on job openings on top of the people that are hired. People are making more money. Three percent wage growth for 10 months and they are taking home more of what they earn because of the tax cuts. So, you've got incredible economic growth. The benefits are going to low wage workers. What she wants to do would take those benefits away from low wage workers. It would bring everybody down, not just the rich. It would bring everybody down and send us back to a stagnant economy where people are wondering where the next job was going to come from or how they were going to do better than their parents."

The National Sex Abuse Review Board which was set up by the bishops to look for answers has made it clear that bishops can no longer police bishops and that lay experts must be brought in to hold the clergy accountable.

And if a bishop is involved, the report would be filed with the Vatican. A national survey released today by the Pew Research Center says almost a quarter of Catholics have scaled back church attendance and donations and only 36 percent think the church has done a good job responding to the crisis. The bishop's conference is happening while prosecutors in numerous states are going through clergy sex abuse files. And the goal isn't just going after priests. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel says if the evidence warrants, prosecutors will use state racketeering laws normally reserved for organized crime to go after dozens of diocese including bishops and other church leaders. Monsignor G. Michael Bugarin who handles sex abuse allegations for the Detroit archdiocese says whatever the charges they will cooperate. Watch."
