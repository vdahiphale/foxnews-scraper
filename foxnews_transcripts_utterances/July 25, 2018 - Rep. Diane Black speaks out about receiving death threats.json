The House and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani maintained Mr. Trump said, quote, \"Don't pay with cash.\" Michael Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, who gave the tape to CNN indicates that Trump wanted to pay with cash. Davis even went on to say that only drug dealers and mobsters pay with cash. But the Washington Post, ABC, and NBC, not exactly Trump loving media outlets, all agree the exact wording on the tape is unintelligible. Today, the president tweeted, quote, \"What kind of lawyer would tape a client? So sad. Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated, cut, while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped. Can this be so? Too bad.\" Politico, then ran a story saying the president was suggesting the audio had been edited or doctored. Except the president suggested no such thing. He simply asked why the tape was abruptly terminated, and there is a big difference between doctoring a tape and not playing the whole thing. And as to the president's question about why a lawyer would tape his client? Lanny Davis was asked about that on Good Morning America. Watch."

All right, to talk about this and all of it really that happened this afternoon in a head- spinning day, Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, joins me with a look at all of it. Ben, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for being with us. I want to get to the trade issue which I think was fascinating, it was a very hard pivot from the White House. And a hastily convened news conference as we just said, and very big news. So I want to get to that in just a moment. But let's start with the tape from last night, Alan Dershowitz, as Trace just pointed out, said that setting up a corporation for payment is fine, it happens all the time, and he pointed out that the payment was never actually made. But Judge Napolitano, said this morning on our air that what they are discussing is a civil fraud and could be problematic for the president. How do you see it?"

      "speaker": "BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY WIRE",
      "utterance": "Well, the possibility of a campaign finance violation is really the serious question here. Did President Trump hand catch to Michael Cohen to pay off the publishers of the National Enquirer in order to help his campaign? That's really the basic question and there are a lot of dots there that still have to be connected. We haven't seen any money pass hands, we don't know exactly if the money did pass hands, how it passed hands? We don't know even if Trump paid off the National Enquirer, whether it has to do with the election or not because that's really a matter of opinion. And so, is any of this really going to damage President Trump? I think not. I think this is all baked into the cake for President Trump. More than that, I think, it's very difficult to actually criminally prosecute these types of cases. John Edwards, of course, the Democratic presidential contender in 2008, he had a very similar issue. He was actually tried, and there was a hung jury, the charges ended up falling apart. It's difficult to think that this is going to be the thing that Democrats hope it is which is of, course, the killer shot with regards to the presidency."

I think, at this point, he sort of signaling to prosecutors that he has a lot, simply, because he would like to get off the hook. And the only way they cut a deal with him is if he has a lot here. But I'm not actually sure that he has very much. Again, the fact that the president has probably paid off a number of these types of cases before actually helps the president when it comes to the legal case."

      "utterance": "All right. In terms of what we saw this afternoon, because as I said, it was sort of a rush this afternoon, a call for all of the reporters to come to the Rose Garden, they set up the two podiums, they were not expecting a bi-lat with the head of the E.U. Jean-Claude Juncker, who looked -- you know, mildly happy I guess to be there. But the president has said that -- you know, that they're giving us such a raw deal. Do you think that it sounds like the president got a good deal here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Well, it sounds like trade were averted. The fact is that the best thing that the economy can hope for is no trade war. It sounds right now like the Europeans are making some relatively moderate to minor concessions and that the United States is going to back off its weapons with regard to tariffs, although, it's not clear. Maybe the president wants to keep in place these steel tariffs and aluminum tariffs. It's un -- frankly, I just don't know at this point until we actually see the formal wording of the details, and until we see that we're going to not know whether the president made a good deal here or a bad deal here. It is pretty clear though that the direction that everybody wants to move is in the direction of free trade, and not toward more tariffs, and that in of itself is a good signal, I think, that's why the market jumped."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "One of the things that I find interesting is that -- you know, we have the globalists at the White House who were fretting so deeply over the potential for a trade war. Which I -- you know, I guess may indeed still happen, and as you say we sort of need to see how all of this works out. But when you hear that -- you know, the E.U. is now going to be buying more soybeans -- you know, that obviously is a hope to keep the farmers happy here in the United States that there aren't going to be any escalations in auto tariffs, at least not right now. I mean it seems that this is the way the President does everything. He lays down this huge marker, sort of scares everybody that he's going to -- you know, be so dramatic with these tariffs that it's going to cause a colossal trade war. And now, as he says, you've got the E.U. like, OK we can go to the White House tomorrow, actually. And they're going to buy an enormous amount of liquefied natural gas which is terrible news for Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, the fact is that -- you know, the most plausible possible read of the president's behavior is that this is all planned out. It's also possible that he just has a lot of stuff about tariffs and the other side gets scared, and then, they make a deal. However, it works out. Whoever you want to give credit to the bottom line is if the deal is good, the president gets credit for the deal once we find out what's in the deal. He's going to get neither full credit nor full blame for whatever ends up happening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, in terms of Russia, the meeting now moved to next year at the earliest. And as I said, you know, this -- the moves on the missile front on liquefied natural gas, all of this is not good news for Russia. So, all of these things almost feel in some ways like the president is really bending over backwards now to prove that he will not do anything that would look as if he is kowtowing to Russia in any way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "The fact is there is always been a disconnect between presidents Trump's specific personal rhetoric with regard to Russia, and his administration's policy with regard to Russia. And that sort of reared attend again this week when the president was very complimentary of Vladimir Putin over the last week and a half. And his administration continue to strengthen various sanctions against the Russians. They continue to provide deadly weaponry to the Ukrainians. The administration said they are not going to recognize the Russian seizure of Crimea as legitimate. So, all of this suggests either that the president is sort of playing both sides and he's carrying a big city, he's speaking loudly, and then -- and then, he is -- you know essentially doing the opposite in order to promulgate a particular policy. Or that the president says stuff and then, the administration cleans it up for him, either way, the outcome is basically the same."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "So, shadow banning is can be done a couple of different ways on Twitter, at least, the allegations go. One on the allegations is that if you tweet something that it just doesn't show up in people's feed. That even if they're following you, it doesn't show up in their feed because Twitter has essentially downgraded the content that you're tweeting about. The other way that it shows up is you go to search for somebody's account online, and it doesn't automatically fill in the rest of the accounts in the top of the Twitter search bar that's actually been well-substantiated device news which is not a right-wing outlet. Says that this is happening on a routine basis to a lot of folks on the right side of the aisle, but almost never to people on the left side of the aisle. People have a right to be suspicious about the Twitter trends, and how Twitter operates its business. They are not transparent when it comes to their logarithms. And because of that, because they're not transparent with regards to the algorithms, it means that any sort of perceived bias is going to be exacerbated tenfold. And even Jack, Jack Dorsey, had his Twitter, he's acknowledged as much. He says like, \"I understand why you guys don't trust me, we're going to have to do better.\" Well, the only way they're going to do better is if they come fully clean with the American people, and how exactly they operate."

He's praised all three of those leaders even though we have fundamental disagreements so he wants the personal relationship right so maybe we can make some improvements on the fundamental disagreements.

Well, people, I think misinterpreted that we would concede the annexation of Crimea to Russia so now we've got a formal declaration that we're not going to do that. And Pompeo did say we agreed to disagree with them on the Ukraine but there have been some positive things that came out admittedly they're not major, major agreements. You know, business exchanges, we're going to work on counte0rterrorism together, they're going to work on a humanitarian issue inside Syria and try to reduce the violence. Those are not real concrete policies they're going to have far-reaching impact but nonetheless there is some agreement and they didn't get any place on the New START treaty which expires in 21 and also the fact that Russia is violating the intermediate nuclear force treaty or the INF treaty and we intend to violate it ourselves because they've developed a capability that's not permitted.

But we've had some and the reason why it has come kind of quiet, we have finally penetrated into the virtual Caliphate particularly that ISIS has. We took that physical caliphate not totally away but mostly away but we've had -- we've made some real progress and a lot of our media folks, social media folks have taken down tens of thousands of sites that they have and they've been cooperating with us and we've also learned a lot you know through the years dealing with ISIS because they were so sophisticated and how they use the internet.

So that's one part of it, the non-compliance the duly issued subpoenas, the second part is this FISA application. It has Rod Rosenstein's name on it.

You had Ron Wyden, the senator out of Oregon saying that because President Trump wants to take away security clearances of former employees, that we should impeach them. They way overplayed their hand. So Republicans I think have been the adults in the room. The economy is doing well. And look at the announcement tonight where the president played a tough hand.

I imagine you are resting somewhat easier knowing that this person is behind bars, but what exactly did he do and say to you? REP. DIANE BLACK, R—TENN.: I can't talk about the details, Martha, except to say that they were threats and they were serious enough threats that the grand jury did take action. And I will tell you this is not the first time and it probably won't be the last time that when people get angry and they do and say things that are threatening. But I believe in what the president wants to do in protecting our border. I believe in building the wall and I believe in holding people accountable that come to our country illegally and I'm never going to back down on that.

And you know, they have been looking at the total video, which is, you know, a sad thing, I watched it today, but to me it's all about the band and about forcefully telling people what they can and cannot use with their own money and their own time."
